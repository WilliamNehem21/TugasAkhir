There has been recent increasing interest in categorical axiomatisations of differen- tial structure. For example, for forward differentiation, see [2]; for reverse differen- tiation see [4]; and for tangent structures, see [3]. A natural question is whether the axioms are well chosen. The authors generally show they hold in natural structures. For example, in the case of cartesian differential categories they hold for the cate- gory of finite powers of the reals and smooth functions. So the axioms are, in that sense, correct. But one can additionally ask, if, or in what sense, they are complete, that is whether there are missing axioms.

To establish completeness we employ an interpolation theorem, a well-known theorem of Severi [12] on the solvability of Hermite interpolation problems. Hermite interpolation generalises Lagrange interpolation. In Lagrange interpolation, one seeks a real polynomial taking prescribed values at prescribed points, and this has an evident generalization to multivariate Lagrange interpolation. In multivariate Hermite interpolation, one additionally prescribes values of (possibly higher-order) partial derivatives.

Our semantics of the theory of partial differentiation employs a concrete notion of function, viz. smooth functions over the reals. For the general theory of second- order logic, a more abstract, and thereby more general, notion of function is needed. This can be formulated variously in terms of abstract clones [5], Lawvere theories, or, more conceptually, in terms of monoids in a presheaf category of contexts, see [8,6,7].
