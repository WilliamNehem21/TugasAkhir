Applications of the methods have included multi-stage-inventory prob- lems (Ben-Tal et al., 2009), planning and scheduling problems (Ning and You, 2017) and treatment-length optimization problems in radiation therapy (Eikelder et al., 2019). In particular, robust optimization tech- niques that employ inexactly revealed data are of great interest in

tainty sets involving the intersection of two ellipsoids and a non- convex and nonhomogeneous quadratic function. It is known that generalizations of S-lemma for non-convex quadratic systems involv- ing more than two quadratic functions are often not possible un- less the system enjoys some hidden convexity (see Example 2.1). For a survey of S-lemma and its generalizations, see Polik (2007), Jeyakumar et al. (2009a) and Derinkuyu and Pinar (2006).

established in Jeyakumar et al. (2009b), do not yield corresponding S-lemma type results for diagonal matrices due to homogenization of the given non-homogeneous system. Simplified S-lemma results are known for homogeneous systems involving diagonal matrices in Ben- Tal et al. (2009); Polik (2007)
