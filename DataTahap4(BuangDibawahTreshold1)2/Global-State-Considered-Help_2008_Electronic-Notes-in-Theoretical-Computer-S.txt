Structure of Paper First we look at a calculus without store, its categorical semantics and then game semantics. Then we do the same with store. Along the way, we shall need in Sect. 3.1 to develop the theory of expansions in order to formulate an injective renaming lemma.

Definition 3.2 Let A be a cartesian category A with a strict initial object. We say A has nonsingular quotients when every expansion from a non-initial object has a quotient that is unique up to unique morphism (and hence, in the usual manner, unique up to isomorphism).
