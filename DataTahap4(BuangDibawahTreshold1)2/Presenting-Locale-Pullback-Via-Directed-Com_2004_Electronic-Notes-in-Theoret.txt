By clearly separating out the infinitary directed join structure of frames from the finitary (distributive lattice) structure it is hoped that further light is shed on the parallel that exists between proper and open (e.g. [6]) since the basis of that parallel appears to be that the finitary structure is dualised whilst the infinitary structure remains fixed. Thus a single pullback stability result is available (that of locale maps with triquotient assignments) which specializes (dually) to the known pullback stability results for proper and open maps.

The importance of the Townsend/Vickers result appears to be that it offers an external description of that part of the theory of locales which is fixed under this duality. This has possible application to an axiomatization of the notion of continuity. By further extending to geometric morphisms this work may therefore offer insight into the parallel between proper and open in topos theory.
