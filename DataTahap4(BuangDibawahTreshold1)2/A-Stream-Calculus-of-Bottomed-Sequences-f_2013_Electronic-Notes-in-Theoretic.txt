Note that t(x) is continuous on x = 1/2 and therefore the tail of the expansion does not depend on the choice of the first digit. Actually, the two expansions of 1/2 are 01000... and 11000  which coincide from the second character. It means that

In Section 2.1, we defined notions that a function on BD (exactly) realizes a function on I. We say that a closed XPCF term (exactly) realizes a real function if it denotes a function which (exactly) realizes the function. The program
