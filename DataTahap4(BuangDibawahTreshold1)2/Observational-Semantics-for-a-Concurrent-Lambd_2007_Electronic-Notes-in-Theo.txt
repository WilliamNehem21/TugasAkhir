The claim holds for all pairs (l, 0), since if M has no holes there is nothing to show. Now, let (l, n) > (0, 0). For the induction step, we assume the claim holds for all pairs (l', n') that are strictly smaller than (l, n).

The first diagram has the same special cases as the diagram for fut.deref(f). The second diagram shows the only case where the target of a dereferencing operation is inside the body of an abstraction, but this is no longer the case after applying a standard reduction. An example for this case is:
