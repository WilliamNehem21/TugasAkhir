Further progress in understanding of search behaviour calls for a model of a fea- sible biological mechanism that allow animals and humans i.) reproducing a variety of statistically different movement patterns, without demanding and tedious com- putations, and ii.) spontaneous switching between them in different environments. In our paper, we propose such a model and solve it analytically (Sec. 4).

The VE provides a simplified way to see and experience the real world, sup- porting the sense of spatial presence via virtual locomotion, rendering a clear sense of navigation, and allowing for interactions with objects through a user interface [26]. Not surprisingly, VE gained widespread use in recent years as a tool for studying human behavior, maintaining the capacity to create unique experimental scenarios under tightly controlled stimulus conditions. A major problem for users of VE is maintaining knowledge of their location and orientation while they move through space, essentially when the whole path cannot be viewed at once but oc- cluded by objects in the environment [27]. Most of human spatial abilities (such as navigating a large-scale space and identifying a place) have evolved in natu- ral environments over a very long time, using properties present in nature as cues for spatial orientation and wayfinding [28]. However, many of natural body-based self-motion cues are absent in VE, causing systematic spatial orientation problems in subjects, and therefore calling for the instant invention of new adaptive strate- gies to move through VE, under reduced multisensory conditions. The analysis of adaptive strategies instantaneously evolving in VE accentuates the key biological mechanisms of searching behaviour more vividly than the analysis of empirical data recorded in situ. Furthermore, in VE we can study the mobility patterns of humans with extremely high resolution, up to the scales of millimetres and milliseconds, by

Gender is often reported as a decisive factor in spatial cognition research [39,40]. A review of gender differences in spatial ability in real world situations can be found in [41]. In the present paper, we do not discuss the gender mobility differences observed in our experiments, leaving a detailed report on that for a forthcoming publication. Based on the results of the statistical data analysis, we discuss on the role of scanning and reorientations in a compensation of information deficiency while moving through VE (Sec. 3.1), and on the experimentally observed super-diffusive spread of searching activity on large spatiotemporal scales (Sec. 3.2).

In Sec. 4, we have formulated a mathematical model of decision making when no precise information on a possibility of rewards is available. The model can be solved analytically for some important cases (see Sec. 4.3) and helps to generate biologically relevant hypothesis about the fundamental process of decision making. We conclude in the last section.

- B. Although participants (mostly university students, with the mean age of 24.2 years and a standard deviation of 3.7 years) were recruited personally and through advertisements at the University of Bielefeld. None of them have ever been familiar with the actual building prototyping the virtual models A and B. Prior to test- ing, all adult participants and parents of children younger than 16 years old gave their informed written consent for participation in the study. Participation in the study was voluntary, and a participant could revoke her participation consent and quit at any time and for any reason. The standard provisions for data protection were adhered: all test results were kept confidential. All individual data were man- aged and processed anonymously that eliminated any possibility of identification of participants.

Self-motion through the VE suffers from a lack of many natural body-based cues. Natural methods of visual exploration are also restricted in VE to that experienced through the display representing only a limited field of view, suffering from the degradation of sensory cues due to device latencies and blocking out all surrounding visual input. It was concluded from various experiments that the optic flow without proprioception, at least for the limited field of view of the virtual display system, appears to be not effective for the updating of heading direction [33], and even when physical motion cues from free walking are included, this is not necessarily sufficient to enable good spatial orientation in VE [34].

Several studies conducted on small animals [14,15], [35,36] suggested that the switch between scanning and reorientation behaviour in movement patterns of an- imals that search emerges from complex mechanic-sensorial responses of animals to the local environment and could infer the effects of limited perception and/or a patchy environmental structure. When exploring patchy resources, animals could adjust turning angle distributions, selecting a preferred turning angle value that would allow organisms to stay within the patch for a proper amount of time, maxi- mizing the energetic gain. For example, the zigzag motion of Daphnia appears to be an optimal strategy for patch exploitation [36]. Therefore, the distinction between quick scanning turns and a longer reorientation behaviour is crucial to understand the statistical patterns of search [1].

There is growing evidence that the neuromodulatory system involved in assess- ing reward and uncertainty in humans is central to the exploration-exploitation trade-off decision [45]. The problem can be cast in terms of a distinction between expected uncertainty, coming from known unreliability of predictive cues and coded in the brain by a neuromodularity system with acetylcholine signals, and unexpected uncertainty, triggered by strongly unexpected observations promoting exploration and coded in the brain with norepinephrine signals [46]. It was suggested in [46] that an individual decides on whether to stay or to go according to the current levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine, encoding the different types of uncertainty.
