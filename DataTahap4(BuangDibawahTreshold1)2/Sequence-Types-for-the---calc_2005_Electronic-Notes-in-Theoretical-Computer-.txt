Example 3.4 (Ad-hoc polymorphism) In this example we show that a value received on a polymorphic channel y can then be used in two different ways, depending on its type. In order to do so, we must provide two different implementations (in this case of the output on z) and guard each of them with an input (respectively on one and two) used to recognise the specific type of the polymorphic value (here represented by w). The process
