Work on portraiture has been undertaken by many researchers. Rosin et al. [27] recently provided a set of benchmark photographs to be used for testing NPR portraiture algorithms. The state-of- the-art algorithms that they showcase are all able to create good abstracted representations of the photographs. However, they do not come close to the level of abstraction demonstrated in this

The widest spread between the upper and lower quartiles in the sample of character heights is that of Lola in I Will Be Especially Very Careful. However, the illus- trators use collage and all of the original images of Lola are the same size. The differences in this book, as mentioned earlier, are in the photographic reproduction. This example demonstrates one of the challenges of this analysis: knowing that the drawings are not scaled differently on different pages. We use the quality of the fine-level detail (texture, brush stroke size, line width) as evidence that, where the artist has used pens or brushes, the images in a given book have been all produced at the same scale and all photographically reduced by the same proportion.
