Petri nets were originally devised as a graphical formalism for describing concur- rency and synchronisation in distributed systems. In their simplest form they are also known as Place-Transition nets [4]. Generalised Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs) [2] extend Place-Transition nets by incorporating timing information.

Coloured Generalised Stochastic Petri Nets (CGSPNs) [11] extend GSPNs by as- signing colours to tokens. The marking of a place is therefore a multi-set containing varying numbers of tokens of each colour. Transitions have different firing modes which are enabled depending on the colours of the tokens on their input places and alter the multi-sets of tokens on their input and output places upon firing.

When checking if transitions are enabled and where tokens will be removed and placed when transitions fire, tagged tokens may only be carried along tagged arcs. Normal tokens may be transported by both tagged and normal arcs. Tagged tokens count as normal tokens towards determining whether or not a transition is enabled in a particular marking.

A Performance Tree query is represented as a tree structure consisting of nodes and interconnecting arcs. Nodes can have two kinds of roles: operation nodes are performance-related functions, such as the calculation of a passage time density, while value nodes are the inputs to these functions such as a set of states, an action, or simply numerical or boolean constants. A full list of currently supported performance analysis operation nodes can be found in [15].
