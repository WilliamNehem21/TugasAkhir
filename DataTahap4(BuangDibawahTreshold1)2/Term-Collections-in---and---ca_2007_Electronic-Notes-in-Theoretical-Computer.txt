The generality given by those recent works is broken when the matching con- straints involved in the calculus may have more than one solution, that is when the solving of the matching problem gives several solutions (substitutions). In fact, to the knowledge of the author there is no satisfactory (total) order to compare substitutions. Thus we must represent collections of terms by sets (or at least by an associative and commutative structure).

The following definition and the following lemma will be crucial in the proof of the Church-Rosser property of the Sect. 5. They formalize the idea that if a multiplicative relation on simple terms satisfies the multi-diamond property (form- ally if its singleton extension satisfies the diamond property) then its multiplicative extension also verifies this property.

A. Miquel suggests to the author the reading of [14]. This was the starting point of the work. H. Cirstea gave deep feedbacks on previous versions of the paper. This was very useful. We also thank L. Vaux and C. Kirchner for useful interactions and comments on this work.
