(O1) We can make a fold along a line that passes through given points P and Q. (O2) We can make a fold along the line that superposes given points P and Q. (O3) We can make a fold along a line that superposes two given lines m and n. (O4) We can make a fold along a line that is perpendicular to a given line m, and

OnLine(Q, l) holds, then R(P, Q, l) holds. In particular if for any combinations of values of P , Q and l for which formula (A1) holds, then R(P, Q, l) holds. This can be written as a 3-CTRS (type 3 Conditional Term Rewrite System)[10].

We have seen the model of computation for computational origami. The model comes with a formal language to reason about the model. However, the formal language is not sufficient for end-users, i.e. origamists, to explore the possibilities of computational origami. The computational origami environment Eos developed by us assists the user to perform origami construction and reason about geomet- ric properties. The programming and computational capabilities described in this paper are an abstraction of what have been implemented so far. We need more programming supports for computational origami.
