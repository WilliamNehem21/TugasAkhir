Otherwise, G contains a C6: a, x1, b, x2, c, x3, a. Given that {a, b, c} is an in- dependent set and G has no induced C6, G[{x1, x2, x3}] induces an edge. Let (x1, x2) be an edge of G[{x1, x2, x3}]. As H(S) is not a dominating set, x1

We now consider strongly regular graphs, a subclass of diameter two graphs. We start by analyzing the strongly regular graphs G(n, k, b, c), when c = 0. In this case, each such graph is a union of disjoint complete graphs.

A strongly regular graph with c > 0 is a connected nontrivial k-regular graph, which is not a complete graph. The result of Theorem 2.10 is valid for biconnected C6-free diameter two graphs. We can give an upper bound for strongly regular graphs, with c > 0, in general.

Theorem 2.13 presents a tight bound for strongly regular graphs, but it does not consider the parameter c. There are graphs whose relation between the param- eters k and b do not provide a tight bound, for example, the graph GQ(3, 9) whose parameters are (112, 30, 2, 10). With respect to the bound given in Theorem 2.13

When the cardinality of H(Sj) is greater than k, by Proposition 2.5, we can conclude that H(Sj) is a dominating set. So we want to determine the maximum number of iterations when this occurs. A bound on this number is established in the following results.

maximum size [logc+1(k.c + 1) + 1 for strongly regular graphs. Finally, it was established that the P3-hull number for biconnected C6-free diameter two graphs is at most 4, which enables the computation of the P3-hull number for this subclass in time O(n4).
