We have shown that probabilistic names induce a representation for Borel measures which, in the case of countably based F0-spaces, is admissible w.r.t. the familiar weak topology. This question had remained unsolved in the pre- ceding paper [9]. Therefore the representation via probabilistic names is very natural, justifying the concept of probabilistic names as generators of Borel measures. An open problem is to characterise the class of non countably based qcb0-spaces for which the representation via probabilistic names is admissible
