Similarly to [13], our aim here is to use the duality of algebras and coal- gebras to prove a dual of this theorem for coalgebras. As it turns out, the concept dual to implication is that of a modal rule. Theorem 4.1 establishes that a class of coalgebras is rule-definable iff it is closed under images of mor- phisms and disjoint unions. Theorem 5.2 applies this result to Kripke frames: A class of Kripke frames is definable by rules of infinitary modal logic iff it is closed under images of p-morphisms and disjoint unions.

The concept of a strong-mono-coreflection is a generalisation of the concept of cofreeness and dualises the concept of a strong epireflection (see Borceux [4], I.3.6). Strong monos do appear here because they are the categorical way of describing subcoalgebras (see the appendix). Coreflective classes are used

Let us mention that the duality of algebras and coalgebras has been used here as a heuristics. The proof of theorem 4.1 is not the formal (categorical) dual of a corresponding proof for algebras since it depends on the category of sets (and coalgebras over Set are dual to algebras over Setop).
