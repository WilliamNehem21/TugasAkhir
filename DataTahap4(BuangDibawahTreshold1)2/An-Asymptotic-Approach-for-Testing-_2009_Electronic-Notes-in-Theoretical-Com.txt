A direct approach to the P -matrix or P0-matrix problem is to evaluate all the principal minors of A using standard numerical linear algebra techniques with O(2nn3) computational time complexity. In [3], the computational time complex- ity of the P -matrix problem has been reduced from O(2nn3) to O(2n) by applying recursively a criterion for P -matrices based on Schur complementation. But this algorithm can be not directly applied to test the P0-matrices because the Schur complementation can be not computed when some zero diagonal elements appear. In this paper, we propose an asymptotic approach for testing the P0-matrices by replacing the possible zero diagonal elements using an enough small positive number
