credentials there is a beautiful example where this is made possible. In the 80s Chaum ([8] and [9]) showed an anonymous e-cash system where double spent coins (double spending is a crime that should lead to revocation) expose some secrets about the user. This can be used for anonymity revocation. There were many followers of this genre. Unfortunately, we do not know of any other example in

We now show a general attack based on a collusion between a corrupt revocation authority and verifiers. The attack assumes a general approach to revocation ob- served in several existing systems. In the appendix (section 4), we illustrate how the systems in [7], [5], and [4] fit this description.

A general revocation system:There exists a public revocation list L (or its complement). L may be coded with some secret keys. We use C(L) to denote the coded list. Everybody can read C(L), but only RA can write (add and delete) in

Remark 2.3 There are hopes in the folklore that technology may be invented to eliminate the need to trust RA not to link transactions. So far all the general purpose personal anonymous credentials systems that we reviewed succumb to this attack 3 . It seems that the ordinary trust (not to make permanent false revocations) is insufficient, and additional trust is needed not to engage in the above attack (using temporary revocations).

[2] there is still ambiguity about which attributes were certified. We do not know how to exploit it in order to fool the verifier in a showing protocol. However, we think that both technically and legally, the issuer should have certainty about the attributes she signs at the end of the issuing protocol.
