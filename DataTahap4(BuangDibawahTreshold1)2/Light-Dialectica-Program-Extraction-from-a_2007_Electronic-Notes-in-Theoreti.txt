There has been quite some work in the last years in the field of program ex- traction from classical proofs. Although strong mathematical results have re- cently been obtained in the Proof Mining of classical analytical proofs (see, e.g., [17,15,18,20,22]), the computer-implemented program extraction meta-algorithms were able to produce only limited results, for rather small test-cases and even then, the extracted program is not the optimal one.

MinLog is an interactive proof- and program-extraction system developed by H. Schwichtenberg and members of the logic group at the University of Munich. It is based on first order Natural Deduction calculus and uses as primitive minimal rather than classical or intuitionistic logic. See [11,25] for full details.
