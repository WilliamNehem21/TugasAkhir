Domain theory was introduced by Scott in the late 60s for the denotational seman- tics of programming languages. It provides the mathematical foundation for the design, definition, and implementation of programming languages, and for systems for the specification and verification of programs. From both the computer science side and the purely mathematical side, one of important aspects of domain theory is to carry as much as possible of the theory of continuous domains to as gen- eral an ordered structure as possible. Due to their strong connections to computer science, general topology and topological algebra, continuous domains have been
