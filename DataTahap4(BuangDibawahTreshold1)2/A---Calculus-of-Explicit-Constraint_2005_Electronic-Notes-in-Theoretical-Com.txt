This reduction can be obviously decomposed into two steps, one comput- ing the substitution and the other one describing the application of the corres- ponding substitution. This decomposition does not mean that the matching computations leading from constraints to substitutions and the application of the substitution are explicit but just that they are clearly separated. Depend- ing on the matching theory, these computations can be really significant and we want to go further on and to make them explicit.

The application of a rewrite system is actually never as simple as presented above. Here, we encode only one (meta) rewriting step but in general the encoding is more complicated because one needs to encode the evaluation strategy. The problem is solved by using (typed) fixpoints to apply the rewrite system recursively (see [9] for a full presentation).
