In the final section we use these logical block structures to give a diagrammatic description of two familiar quantum protocols, namely superdense coding and tele- portation. The ultimate goal is to develop an appropriate logic for such protocols and to formalise the representation in a computer algebra tool, for simulation and verification. Thus, the paper follows earlier work on semantics of quantum pro- gramming languages, like, for instance [1,19,20,21] and [7].

Example 3.5 In the context of Hilbert spaces, several of the ingredients encoun- tered above are present, but we do not find a logical block structure, for the standard logic of effects. We briefly describe the situation, building on Example 2.5.
