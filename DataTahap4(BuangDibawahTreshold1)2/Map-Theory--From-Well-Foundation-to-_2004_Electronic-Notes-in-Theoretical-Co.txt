In Section 2, we will give an informal presentation of MTF and MTA, and of their common-core which will be denoted by MT . In Section 3,4 and 5, we will present successively three groups of axioms and rules which permit, respectively, the embeddings of Propositional Calculus in MT , of Predicate Calculus in MT , and of ZFC in MTF and MTA. Sections 6 and 7 will be devoted to the validation of FA in MTF and of AF A in MTA. Finally, in Section 8, we will discuss an open problem concerning an alternative axiomatization of MTA.

There is still to check that M satisfies the QND. In fact, it is clear from Remark 2.10 and Definition 2.11.3 that M satisfies a stronger property, called Strong Quartum Non-Datur (SQND ) in [2], and which is expressed as follows.

of arity 0, for the axioms which assert the existence of a particular set, as the Emptyset axiom or the Infinity axiom). Each usual operation on sets cor- responds to a term of Map Theory, called a set constructor. A list of the set constructors relevant to the axiomatization we chose is given in [19, p. 55]. In this paper, we give only three basic useful examples corresponding to

Remark 5.2 MTF -Prim implies the validity of the axiom of Infinity in MTF . The natural way to treat infinity in MTA would be to replace MTF - Prim by a dual axiom MTA-CoPrim. In fact, as it will be discussed in Section 8, we were forced to fall back on MTA-Infinity.

In this section, we discuss briefly the axiom MTA-CoPrim which we wanted originally to integrate in MTA. Unfortunately, we were not able to prove its consistency (in connection with the other axioms of MTA). Let us state this axiom and explain its interest compared to that of MTF -Prim.
