In example (1), only communication happens. In the next two examples, both mobility and communication take place. A careful observation reveals that (2) and (4) use different sorts of mobility, which we call one-dimensional mobility and two-dimensional mobility respectively. In (2), all locations are always located on the same level, no location nesting being permitted, while in (4), ambient n becomes a subambient of m after its movement.

In (16) and (17), the environments of Q are both changed by P . There is not any symptom for Q to know when and how its environment will be changed. This kind of phenomenon is hard to be simulated in communication-based models, since in these models a process cannot have any influence to a sib- ling process if no communication happens between them. So one may think of treating a pair of sibling processes, say in m.P and Q in (16) as a whole entity in the translation (if it exists), and either process can perform some actions to influence the entity, which also means to influence itself and its sibling process. There are two reasons against this strategy. (1) A good trans- lation should be homomorphic with respect to parallel composition, namely
