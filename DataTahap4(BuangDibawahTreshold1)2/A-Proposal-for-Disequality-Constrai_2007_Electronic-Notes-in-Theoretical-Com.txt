For these reasons, having experimental versions of this kind of features is a good starting point, possibly at the cost of inconsistencies with other features already present in the draft. Although not completely polished, the proposal described in this paper is already available in our Sloth system including the examples presented below(https://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/research/Sloth) 5 .

Further, operators returning Bool can be used to find positive as well as negative answers (i.e. answers making the goal True and False respectively) while operators returning Success find positive answers only, pruning the others (this is because Success is a one-point domain). The operator to choose depends on what the programmer wants to obtain from the program.
