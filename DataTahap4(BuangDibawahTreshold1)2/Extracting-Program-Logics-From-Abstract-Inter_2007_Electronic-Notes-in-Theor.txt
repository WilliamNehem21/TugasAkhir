Galois connections were first proposed by Patrick and Radhia Cousot as a formal- ization of program data-flow and static analysis [7]; the Cousots also defined the notion of best approximation of a transfer function [8]. The notion of a functionally complete approximate transfer function was proposed by Giacobazzi, et al. [14,15]. The lifting of Galois connections from base type to higher types was studied by Nielson [25] and the Cousots [10]. The characterization of a Galois connection by
