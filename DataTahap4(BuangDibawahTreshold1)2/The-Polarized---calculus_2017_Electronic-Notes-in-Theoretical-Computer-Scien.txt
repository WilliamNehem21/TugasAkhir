In the first four rules, a negative redex has the form [hd(t)]Sj, the last three rules reduce positive redexes, which are positive case-expressions. So, if an expression contains a redex, it is not normal. On the other hand, if a typed expression is not normal, then either it contains a positive case-expression (which has to have the form of a positive redex, as the three possible forms of a value are covered by the last three reduction rules), or it contains a negative redex (because the four possible forms of hd(t) are covered by the first four reduction rules, and typing forces hd(t) to occur as shown). So, a typed expression is normal iff it is irreducible. Moreover, each reduction rule eliminates a maximal formula (the type of t in hd(t) or the type
