Definition 3.1 We denote by BBIND (resp. BBID, BBIT, BBIG, CBIND, CBID, CBIT, CBIG) the set of formulae of BBI (resp. CBI) which are valid in every structure belonging to the class NDm (resp. Dm, Tm, G, NDg, Dg, Tg, G).

One can view eBBI as a fragment of BBI/CBI through Proposition 4.2 and in this sense, it seems to be a bit simpler than minimal BBI as defined in [5]. Validity in eBBI is the restriction of validity in BBI/CBI. Hence (see Theorem 3.2), this notion may depend on the class of models chosen among NDm, Dm, Tm, NDg, Dg, Tg and
