The category Alg(ffi, ) is a full subcategory of Alg S, and it is easy to verify that it is closed under limits and filtered colimits in Alg S. It follows that it is a reflective subcategory, see Theorem 2.48 in [6]. Since the forgetful functor of Alg(ffi, ) is a restriction of that of Alg S, the proposition follows.
