Given a colored graph F , we say that a multicolored cluster graph H contains F if H contains a copy of F for which the color of each edge of F is contained in the list of the corresponding edge in H. More generally, if F is a graph with color pattern P , we say that H contains (F, P ) if it contains some colored copy of F with pattern isomorphic to P . In connection with this definition, we may obtain the following embedding result. The proof of this result follows from arguments such as in the proof of the Key Lemma [18].
