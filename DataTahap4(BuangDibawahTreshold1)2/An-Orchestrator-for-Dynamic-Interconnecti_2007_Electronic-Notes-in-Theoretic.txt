Notation. The paper resorts to standard mathematical notation typically used in model-oriented specification methods, like Vdm [14], Z [27] or B [1]. We adopt, however, a pointfree specification style (as in, e.g., [9]) which leads to more con- cise descriptions and increased calculation power. The underlying mathematical universe is the category of sets and set-theoretic functions whose composition and

Central to our approach is the presence of a particular coordination connector, called the orchestrator, whose role is to manage the interactions among all other elements in the architectural network. In a sense, the orchestrator corresponds to an intermediary layer between components and ordinary connectors, i.e., it acts as a bridge among components and connectors.

Base2 communicates with Base1 though its input port b2.3 and output port b2.4. Base2 also has an input port b2.1 and an output port b2.2. In this case both ports are available and disconnected from the connectors network. The behaviour of Base2 is given by,
