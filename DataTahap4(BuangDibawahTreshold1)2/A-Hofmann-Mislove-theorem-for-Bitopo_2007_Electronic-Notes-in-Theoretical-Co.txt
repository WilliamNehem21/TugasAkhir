From this perspective it is natural to consider an order between propositions which increases the positive extent and shrinks the negative one. As it turns out, this additional relation is always present in a d-frame, and in fact it follows from the distributive lattice structure and the two complemented elements alone. The earliest reference to this appears to be [5], but the proof is entirely straightforward and can be left as an exercise.
