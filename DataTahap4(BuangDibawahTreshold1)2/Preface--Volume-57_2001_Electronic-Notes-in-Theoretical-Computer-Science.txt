The motivation to organize this forum stems from the fact that reduction strategies in rewriting and programming have attracted an increasing attention within the last years. New types of re- duction strategies have been invented and investigated, and new results on rewriting/computation under particular strategies have been obtained. Research in this field ranges from primarily theoret- ical questions about reduction strategies to very practical application and implementation issues. The need for a deeper understanding of reduction strategies in rewriting and programming, both in theory and practice, is obvious, since they bridge the gap between unrestricted general rewrit- ing (computation) and (more deterministic) rewriting with particular strategies (programming). Moreover, reduction strategies provide a natural way to go from operational principles (e.g., graph and term rewriting, narrowing, lambda-calculus)and semantics (e.g., normalization, computation of values, infinitary normalization, head-normalization) to implementations of programming lan- guages.
