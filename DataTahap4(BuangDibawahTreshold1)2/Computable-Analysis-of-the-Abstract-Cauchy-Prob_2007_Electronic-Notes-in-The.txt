tion can be written as u(t) = W (t)x. In such cases, if one can compute the semigroup W (t) from A, then one can compute the solution of (2). What in- formation on A are needed to compute W (t) and vice versa is a main concern of the present paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review some ba- sic definitions and facts related to C0 semigroups of bounded linear operators in Banach spaces. In Section 3, we introduce the model for computation and related definitions. In Section 4, we show how to compute a uniformly contin- uous semigroup from its bounded linear infinitesimal generator and vice versa.

In this section, we summarize some definitions and facts regarding semigroups. The reader is referred to [6] for more details. Let X be a Banach space. A one parameter family W (t), 0  t <  , of bounded linear operators from X to X is called a semigroup of bounded linear operators on X if
