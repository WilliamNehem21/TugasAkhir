The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we continue to study some versions of the classical Hausdorff difference hierarchy (DH). Second, we discuss in some detail a class of effective topological spaces introduced in [12,24] which is relevant to our study of the DH and to computability in topology.

Here we briefly discuss some notions related to countably based T0-spaces and com- putability over them. Ideas and many of results here are not new. They are slight modifications and/or extensions of those in [12] (see also Exercise 3.2.17 in [24]).
