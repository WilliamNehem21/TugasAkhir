In this section we will give the precise definitions of the main notions discussed in this paper. At firs the most general notion of (f, e, d)-effective computability is defined. Then we explain, how this notion can be reduced to a simpler notion of f -effective computability in two steps. Therefore, it suffices to investigate only the f -effective computability later on.

Another natural restriction to the modulus and distance function is that they should be nondecreasing. Thus, we consider only the unbounded nonde- creasing modulus function e and distance function d in this paper. Even un- der this restriction, an (e, d)-divergence degree v can still be a non-monotonic function. However, because we are interested only in the bounding function f which bounds the function v, we assume also that the function f is also nonde- creasing when we discuss the (f, e, d)-effective computability of real numbers.
