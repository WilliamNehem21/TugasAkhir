Different convexities on graphs are studied extensively [2,4,5] due to their wide number of applications, including distributed systems [14], social networks, and mar- keting strategies [9]. Moreover, the Helly property on graphs has been studied quite intensively in the past [3]. The problem we address considers the Helly property on the P3-convexity of a graph. This paper is the first systematic study of the computa-

incidents to u1 or u2 in M . Otherwise, these edges include all edges incident to u1 (resp. u2) in the edge P3-convex hull, which includes all edges incident to endpoints of edges in M that have endpoints in V (G)-vertices and E(G)-vertices (denoted by middle edges) and we have an edge restriction 2 contradiction. Moreover, there is no edge incident to u1 or u2, or two middle edges incident to a same V (G)-vertex (resp. E(G)-vertex) in M . Otherwise, it includes another edge of u1 (resp. u2) in the edge P3-convex hull, and it includes all edges of H in the next iterations. Therefore, it also implies an edge restriction 2 contradiction in a middle edge of

related to this truth assignment as centers of stars. Each star covers the variable counterpart of the literal and, since it is a truth assignment, all clause vertices are reached by a center of star. These p centers of stars are non-adjacent. Thus, M is

vertices in S. Such S can be pick as the vertices of the large clique and u. Consider a maximum edge P3-Helly-independent set Mj of H. If we pick more than one edge of the clique to Mj, the edge P3-convex hull is E(H) and we have an edge restriction
