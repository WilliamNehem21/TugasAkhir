In the following we have to deal with closed and compact subsets of normed and metric spaces. Given a metric space X we denote the set of all closed subsets of X by A(X) and the set of all compact subsets of X by K(X). To represent these spaces we use the representations for closed and compact subsets of metric spaces that are defined and studied by Brattka and Presser in [4].

The norm of a normed space X is strictly convex if and only if every nonempty (closed) convex subset of X is a set of uniqueness [8, Theorem 5.1.18]. If every nonempty closed convex subset of a normed space X is a set of existence, then X is reflexive. Additionally, a normed space X is reflexive and has got a strictly convex norm if and only if every nonempty closed convex subset is a Chebyshev set [8]. It follows that every nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space X is a Chebyshev set, that is the metric projection onto it is a total and single-valued function.
