proper brain-computer interface (BCI) [1]. To develop a secure BCI system, emotion recognition plays a vital role. We can present a security system where emotion cannot be controlled forcefully suppose that an ATM machine will not dispense money when the user has scary emotion in the situation of robbery. Moreover, emo- tion recognition process has effective control over device such as computer and assistive applications [2]. Besides, emotion recogni- tion has some other applications like music therapy [3,4], safe driv- ing [5,6], artificial intelligence [7], etc.

PCA is a multivariate analytical method based on the linear transformation that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, to extract significant information from big data, to ana- lyze the variable structures, etc. [28,31]. The PCA method has been used for dimensionality reduction of the EEG signals in this paper. Since the spatial resolution of the EEG signal is poor, considering all channels for feature extraction is just increasing the burden. In this situation, we can use PCA because it can find the maximum varia- tion from the input higher dimensions. Therefore, for reducing the number of channels of interest a group of the EEG signal can be transformed into a single signal using PCA.

and F8. We applied PCA on these nine channels and took the 1st PCA. The similar procedure was applied to prefrontal, frontal, cen- tral, parietal, and occipital lobe groups and transformed all the sig- nals to five signals of interest of every set of the input EEG signal. This procedure yielded 5 set of data instead of input 62 sets of data
