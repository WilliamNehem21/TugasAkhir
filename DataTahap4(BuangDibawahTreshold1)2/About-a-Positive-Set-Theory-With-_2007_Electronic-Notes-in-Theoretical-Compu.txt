In [6] and [7], the theory is erroneously attributed to E. Weydert; rather, the first who proposed the theory seems to be R. Hinnion, even though Weydert contributed a lot in the area with his thesis [10]. In fact, some theories inspired by the same ideas as Strong-Frege-3 can be found in the works of Hinnion himself, see [3] and [4], besides those of other researchers such as Brady [1], Gilmore [2] and Skolem [8]. Instead, it seems, [6] and [7] are the only papers dedicated to Strong-Frege-3 itself.

The previous remarks show that Strong-Frege-3 is able to provide a variety of set theoretic constructions. However, as we said, the consistency problem for Strong- Frege-3 is open. What can be done is giving models of fragments of Strong-Frege-3. In the following subsections we will consider some interesting fragments and models for them.

Friedberg in 1958 showed that the class of all r.e. sets has an injective enu- meration. Here we want to prove the same result for the subclass V01 of all r.e. sets which encode partial recursive functions valued in {0, 1} (with respect to the standard encoding of pairs of integers with integers).
