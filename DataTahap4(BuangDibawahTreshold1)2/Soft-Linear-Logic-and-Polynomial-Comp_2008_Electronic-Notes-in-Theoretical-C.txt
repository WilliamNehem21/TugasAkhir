the properties of subject reduction and strong normalization, when the definition of strong normalization is revised taking into account that a term can have more than one normal form. If a term can be typed in STA+, then each one of its normal forms can be reached in a number of reduction steps which is polynomial in the size of the term, if the reduction is performed carefully. Moreover we show that every non deterministic polynomial time decision problem can be simulated by a term typable in STA+. Then STA+ is correct and complete for NPTIME.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the Soft Linear Logic is recalled. In Section 3 the type assignments STA is presented, and the technical problems to be solved in order to derive it from SLL are briefly discussed. Section 4 contains the

In this section we present STA, a type assignment system in natural deduction, based on SLL, which enjoys the subject reduction property, and which inherits from SLL the good computational properties. In order to obtain subject reduction, terms are built in a linear way, and possible duplications of subterms are obtained through the rules dealing with the modality, namely soft promotion and multiplexor. This is possible thanks to a restriction of the SLL formulae, given in the next definition.

The characterization of FPSPACE could be reached by enriching the calculus with strings of booleans and the type assignment system by a new type and rule for dealing with them. Moreover the machine could be extended to deal with closed terms typed by the type of the boolean strings. The extension does not present any particular problem, but it would be technically very boring.
