the generation of reduction orderings. Our development admits the specifica- tion of monotonicity conditions which must be satisfied by the orderings. This provides a more flexible framework enabling more applications. For instance, we could want to impose such restrictions to prove termination of variants of term rewriting like context-sensitive rewriting, infinitary rewriting, innermost rewriting, outermost rewriting, etc. (see [18] for further motivation).

Our second contribution is the definition of a rule-based transformation system for solving (parametric) elementary constraints (Sections 5, 6 and 7). This is an essential part of the work which does not depend on our main application focus (termination of programs), thus being useful for dealing with elementary constraints arising from other problems. Section 8 concludes.

The meaning of the rules should be clear: they mostly rely on well-known arithmetic properties of addition, product and exponential (over the reals). Rule Add basis corresponds to Proposition 5.1; rule Add exp corresponds to Proposition 5.3 and rule Negative Exp is obvious (and necessary to deal with negative exponents).

Our second example illustrates the generation of coefficients. Consider the TRS R in Example 1.1. According to the previous considerations, we would give the following parametric interpretations to the function symbols (for sim- plicity, only fact is given a linear elementary interpretation):
