We study orthomodular structures formed by some sets of states of finite transition systems. These sets, called regions, can be interpreted as local states of a distributed, concurrent system, that can be modelled by a Petri net. The main result shows that such orthomodular structures have enough elements to represent meets of certain subsets of elements.

We study a class of orthomodular structures arising from finite automata. The elements of such structures are defined as certain subsets of the set of states of an automaton. These subsets can be interpreted as local states, in contrast to the given global states of an automaton, in a sense which will be explained in the following. This line of research comes from our interest in the theory of Petri nets, a formal model of concurrent and distributed systems, introduced by Carl Adam Petri with the aim of building a theory of systems embodying principles derived from modern physics, specifically from the special theory of relativity and from

Given a net N = (B, E, F ), define K = IP(B), where IP(X) denotes the powerset of X. The elements of K are called cases of N . A case is a potential global state of the system that N models. Occurrences of transitions, which are subject to the firing rule, defined below, change the current case.

itself, and this property holds for all events [3]. A region can be interpreted as a local state of a system whose behaviour is described by the transition system. Such local states correspond to conditions, which are either true or false in a global state. A region r is the set of global states in which the corresponding condition is true.

We now have two maps: H associates a coherent, prime orthomodular poset to a transition system; J goes the other way round. In [1], it was shown that J (P ) belongs to the class of transition systems generated by nets of condition and events (namely, CE transition systems). In the same paper, it was shown that A is embedded in JH(A) for all CE transition system A, and that P is embedded in HJ (P ). In both cases, the embedding is given by a natural notion of morphism.

We have shown that a natural order relation defined on the local states of a CE net system gives rise to an orthomodular poset, when the net system is saturated with respect to local states. A different way of generating orthomodular posets from Petri nets builds on occurrence nets. These are acyclic nets of conditions and events, originally introduced as a model for concurrent processes; they can naturally be used to define a semantics of general CE net systems, expressed within net theory. Petri has defined an occurrence net with a regular structure as a kind of discrete representation of a relativistic spacetime. It is then possible to define a closure sys- tem on subsets of elements of the net, and a corresponding orthocomplement. The closed subsets form an orthomodular lattice; this result resembles results by several authors (see, for example, [2]) on the usual Minkowski spacetime, and suggests a
