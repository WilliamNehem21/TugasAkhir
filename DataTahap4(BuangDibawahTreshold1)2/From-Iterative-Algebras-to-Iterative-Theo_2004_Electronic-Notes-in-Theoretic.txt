all inner parts commute: see (3.4) for the left-hand part, (3.1) for part (i), whereas the lower part commutes trivially (analyze the two components sep- arately) and so does the middle triangle. It remains to verify the upper part: here we use (3.1) and (3.5) to conclude that the following diagram
