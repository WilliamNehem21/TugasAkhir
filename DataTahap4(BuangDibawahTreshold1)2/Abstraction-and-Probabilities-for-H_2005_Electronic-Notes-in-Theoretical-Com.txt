Hybrid logics (see e.g. http://www.hylo.net enhance basic modal and tem- poral logics with the ability to bind names to unique states in models. This extension is an important ability in applications that have to track states or other objects across space or time. If we think of a hybrid logic as a tem- poral logic enriched with syntactic clauses for the look-up and binding of names, it is natural to ask whether established model-checking methodology can be adapted to, or retained, in this hybrid setting. Apart from the work by Franceschet & Rijke [10], surprisingly little attention has been given to the extension of model checking to hybrid temporal logics. We are also not aware

We presented propositional hybrid logics as established enhancements of propo- sitional temporal logics with the ability to name and re-bind specific states. We then provided a sound relational abstraction technique for hybrid Kripke structures and a hybrid version of computation tree logic. We further moti- vated and discussed a definition of hybrid labelled Markov chains and a syntax and semantics of probabilistic computation tree logic in this hybrid setting. Our abstraction techniques for hybrid Kripke structures should be transfer-

Our exposition of hybrid logics was heavily inspired by the introductory article at http://www.hylo.net/ and comments made by Chris Hankin, Sebastian Nanz, and Herbert Wiklicky. We thank the anonymous referees, Joost-Pieter Katoen, and Prakash Panangaden for constructive comments that helped shape the final version of this paper.
