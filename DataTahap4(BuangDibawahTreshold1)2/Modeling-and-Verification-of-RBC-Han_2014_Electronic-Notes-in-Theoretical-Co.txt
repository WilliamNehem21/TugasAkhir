Radio Block Center (RBC) is a core part of the Chinese Train Control System level 3 (CTCS-3) which is a protocol for safety critical systems. The correctness of the RBC handover protocol is one of the most important factors affecting the safety of systems. Hence, it is of great importance to ensure the correctness of the protocol. To this end, some formal methods have been used to model and verify the protocol. In this paper, we use Modeling, Simulation and Verification Language (MSVL) as the formal language to model and verify the protocol. The result shows that the behavior of RBC handover is consistent with the specification.

The remainder of this paper is constructed as follows. In section 2, the MSV toolkit for MSVL is briefly introduced. The RBC handover protocol is described in section 3. Section 4 and 5 dedicate to modeling, simulation and verification of the protocol. Finally, we give conclusion in section 6.

hands over with two normal radio stations; 2. RBC hands over with only one normal radio station. The handing over procedures in both cases are different. We focus on the second case here. We use RBC1 to represent the handover RBC and RBC2 the takeover RBC.
