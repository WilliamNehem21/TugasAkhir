We say that a function is locally constant at a point if it is constant at some neighbourhood of the point. Given property p and a point y, we say that p(y') holds for some y' as close to y as one wishes if for every neighbourhood V of y there is y' such that p(y') holds. Recall that a space is locally connected if every point has a neighbourhood base of connected sets.
