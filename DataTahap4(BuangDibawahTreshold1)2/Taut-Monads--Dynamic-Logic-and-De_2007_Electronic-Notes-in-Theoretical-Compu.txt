In this paper, a monad T in the category Set of sets and (total) functions induces three constructs of interest. The first is the Kleisli category SetT which may be thought of as the category in which expressions are evaluated when the monad class T has been activated. The second is the category SetT of algebras over the monad, which is used to determine if the monad is of collection type. The third is a class of topological spaces determined by certain endomorphisms of the Kleisli category whose box and diamond operators are the interior and closure operators.

Rel is the standard model of multi-valued semantics. One can choose submonads to enforce further properties, e.g. non-empty subsets or finite subsets; these are submonads because a singleton is non-empty and finite and because a non-empty union of non-empty sets is non-empty and a finite union of finite sets is finite.
