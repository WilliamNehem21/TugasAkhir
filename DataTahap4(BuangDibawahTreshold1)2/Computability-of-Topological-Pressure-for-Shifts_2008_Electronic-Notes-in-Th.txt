In this paper, computability aspects of the topological pressure are investigated. Since the topological pressure is a generalization of the topological entropy, as al- ready mentioned, the following elaboration is a continuation of [13] where com- putability aspects of the topological entropy were considered. While in [13], it was possible to show the computability of the topological entropy for types of shift dynamical systems far beyond the shifts of finite type, the computability of the topological pressure is shown here only for shifts of finite type. However, even for shifts of finite type, the concept is applicable to a wide class of so called one dimen- sional spin systems, mainly investigated in theoretical statistical physics. Hence the computability aspects of the topological pressure can be transferred directly to computability aspects of these models in statistical physics. Naturally, computabil- ity theoretic aspects are of interest in that area, since there is a broad community of physicists studying these systems by Monte Carlo simulations [7].

If no restriction on the type of shift is made, the above theorem does not hold in the following sense: There is no Type-2 machine computing a name of the value of the topological pressure of some continuous function over some shift space, where the input is a name of that shift space and a name of the function. In [13] it was shown that a corresponding machine does not exist computing the topological entropy. Since the topological entropy is the topological pressure for the null function, there is no such machine computing the topological pressure.
