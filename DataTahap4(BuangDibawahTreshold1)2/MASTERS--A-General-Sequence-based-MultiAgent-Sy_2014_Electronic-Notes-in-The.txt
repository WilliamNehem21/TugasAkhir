The Director Agent has total knowledge about the protein actual spatial confor- mation and its function is to coordinate searching agents, aiming at a more efficient spatial exploration. The Director agent has no representation in the Cartesian space. It is an agent that acts on the 3-D space from outside. Director Agents perform global moves on the searching agents. It is mandatory to have at least one Director Agent in the simulation.

MASTERS is effective in capturing information about the simple off- lattice models investigated. The chosen models demonstrated a considerable capacity to simulate folding by basic energy contributions without being knowledge-based. In spite of the achievement of slightly higher values of energy in most of the cases compared to the literature, the A residues fold into hydrophobic cores for all targets. Even
