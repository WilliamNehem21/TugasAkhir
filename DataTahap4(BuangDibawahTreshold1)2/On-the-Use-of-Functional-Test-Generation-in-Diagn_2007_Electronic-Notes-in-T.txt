binational test generation for f . Combinational test generation considers only the combinational logic of the circuit. It assigns values to the primary inputs and present state variables, and observes fault effects on the primary outputs and next state variables. A combinational test t for a fault f defines a single state transition

For the purpose of diagnostic test generation we will define a set of state tran- sition faults STT ARG. An element STi of STT ARG will be a single or multiple state transition fault. Diagnostic test generation will consist of generating tests for the faults defined by STT ARG. It is possible to use a functional test generation pro- cedure such as the one described in [10] or [11]. Alternatively, test generation for state transition faults can be done at the gate level as follows.
