A similar idea of system determinization was also applied in [4], in a non- coalgebraic setting, for the case of testing semantics where must testing coincides with failure semantics in the absence of divergence. A coalgebraic characterization of the spectrum was also attempted in [7], in a somewhat ad hoc fashion. Connec- tions with these works are still to be explored.

There are two possible directions for future works. On the one hand, we would like to investigate to what extent the coalgebraic treatment of decorated trace se- mantics can be applied in the context of probabilistic systems. On the other hand, we would like to understand how our approach can be combined with [3] to obtain a coinductive approach to denotational (linear-time) semantics of different kinds of processes calculi.
