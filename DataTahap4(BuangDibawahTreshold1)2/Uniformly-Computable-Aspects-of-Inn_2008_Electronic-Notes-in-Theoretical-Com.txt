Many thanks to Valentin Andreev for several helpful conversations. Many thanks also to Klaus Weihrauch and Vasco Brattka who gently pointed out some minor errors in a previous version of this paper. Posthumous thanks to my departed colleague and friend Alec Matheson who introduced me to the beautiful topic of bounded analytic functions. I also thank the referee for his helpful comments. Last, but certainly not least, many thanks to my wife Susan for her support.
