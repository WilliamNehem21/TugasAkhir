Number theory has many increasingly important applications in computer science and cryptography [1]. One of the central topics of number theory is the prime numbers. The prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1, which have no positive divisors other than 1 and itself but the natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers.

The reset of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the proposed method for generating the prime numbers is given along with its algorithm. In Section 3, a unified framework is proposed to obtain the sieves of Eratosthenes and Sundaram using our pro- posed method. Conclusion is summarized in Section 4.
