with both isomorphic to the set of C-ideals. There are two directions in which this can be used. One is that if a frame is presented by generators and relations (in other words, it is the Lindenbaum algebra for a propositional geometric theory), then the presentation can be manipulated into site form and then the result shows how to define sup-lattice homomorphisms from the frame. This was particularly useful in the context of [2], which involved quantales and modules over them, which are sup-lattices but not frames in general. The other direction was that it shows how to generalize the coverage theorem to get presentations for structures other than frames, specifically quantales and their modules.

Each arrow here represents a forgetful functor that has a left adjoint, a free algebra functor. Note that some of the arrows are between finitary theories, and there are already non-trivial coverage theorems for those. However, our main Theorem, 4.4, is about dcpos and the coverage theorems for the central square.
