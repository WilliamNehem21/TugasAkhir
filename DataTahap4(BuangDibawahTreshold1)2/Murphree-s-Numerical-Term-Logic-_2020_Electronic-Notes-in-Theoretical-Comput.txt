Besides these two general forms, we must consider two cases. For the base case let us consider each basic form. For form 1, take n = m = 0, and for form 2 take n = 0 and m = 1. Hence, NTL collapses with TFL, in which case we just obtain

closed complete trees in TFL. For the inductive case, take n = k and m = j. Such a replacement yields a valid inference in NTL, since all the conditions of a valid inference in NTL are preserved. Now, suppose that each form is also valid in NTL for n = k + 1 and m = j + 1 for k, j > 0, then the trees would look as follows:
