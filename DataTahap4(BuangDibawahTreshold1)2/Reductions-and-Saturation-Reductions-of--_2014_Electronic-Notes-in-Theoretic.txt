Rough set theory [8,13,14] is an important tool for dealing with fuzzyness and un- certainty of knowledge, and has become an active branch of information sciences. Meanwhile it has been successfully applied in medical science, material science, management science and so on. Basic opinion in rough set theory is that knowl- edge (human intelligence) is the ability to classify elements [5,7,13]. Also, one can say that knowledge is a family of classification patterns in some interesting fields,

Proof. Since the set of all the least elements of maximal chains in P forms an anti-chain which by the assumption is finite. The anti-chain has a finite reduction and the intersection of the anti-chain is exactly indP. Clearly, the finite reduction is also a reduction of P.	2
