endophytes have been explored for diverse applications owing to their production of extracellular enzymes [9]. The enzymes function so as to obtain nutrition from their host, hydrolyze food substances and are involved in eliciting defense mecha- nisms against pathogens [10]. There is an imperative need to discover and utilize diverse novel enzymes with high stabil- ity for industrial processes. The present work aims to examine the diversity of endophytic fungal assemblages and their ability to produce extracellular enzymes in selected plants.

The plant tissues, namely the leaf, petiole, stem and roots of the medicinal plants, were used. The members of Hedychium (Zingiberaceae) are listed as critically endangered species of India in the Red data book [20]. However, not much work has been done on endophytic fungal isolations from the plants belong- ing to Hedychium sp. to the best of our knowledge. Also, the studies on endophytic fungi from these plants have revealed

This study reports Lasiodiplodia sp. (Pn-7) as producing maximum amylolytic activity out of all the isolates. From our laboratory, thirty isolates from Alpinia calcarata Roscoe were screened, of which the isolate Cylindrocephalum sp. gave maximum amylase activity [26]. Among 112 isolates, thirty one isolates have shown cellulolytic activity (27.67%) and the highest cellulolytic activity was demonstrated in Aspergillus sp from
