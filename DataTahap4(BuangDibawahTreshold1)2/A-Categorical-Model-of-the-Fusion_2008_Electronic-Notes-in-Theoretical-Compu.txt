The characterization of BF -bisimulations provided by Proposition 4.6 allows us to compare BF -bisimulations with the original notions of fusion bisimulation and hyperbisimulation of Definition 2.2. The clauses in Definition 2.2 about communi- cation actions are covered by clauses (i), (ii) in Proposition 4.6; the condition about bound actions in Definition 2.2 is represented in clause (ii) by the fact that, after a bound transition, the resulting processes are bisimilar via a different relation, on a set of names where the fresh name has been allocated.
