Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a progressive disease that may result in Chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytokeratin(CK)18 is an intermediary filament protein, expressed in hepatocytes, which is proteolytically cleaved during liver damage. M30 epitope of cytokeratin18(CK18-M30) is involved at different levels in apoptotic path- ways. The aim of this study to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of cytokeratin 18-apoptosin M30 fragments (CK18-M30) as non-invasive method of liver fibrosis assess- ment and their correlation to METAVIR score. Serum concentrations of CK18-M30 were measured by ELISA in One hundred and sixty eight chronic hepatitis C patients (112 males and 56 females). Results showed that serum concentrations of CK18 were significantly increased in a stepwise fashion from A0 to A3 and from F0 to F4.There was highly signif- icant positive correlation between CK18 and fibrosis stages (r = 0.881 & p < 0.001) and

levels of transaminases (r = 0.355 & p < 0.05). CK18 was correlated positively with viral level (r = 0.3 & p < 0.05). It was concluded that Elevated serum CK18-M30, as an indicator of enhanced  apoptosis  of  hepatocytes,  was  increased  and  correlated  significantly  with

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a progressive disease that may result in chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular car- cinoma. It is estimated nationally that over 200 million people are infected and about 80% progress into chronic form [20]. Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the world, estimated nationally at 14.7% [15].

Serum human Apoptosense M30 was assessed by ELISA sup- plied by Glory Sience co., Ltd (USA). A solid phase microwell coated by purified human Apoptosense M30 Antibody and horse reddish peroxidase (HRP) labelled with anti Apopto- sense M30 was added forming Ab-(Ag eab enzyme complex), washing the microwells and adding substrate tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) which is proportional to M30 concentration in the sample giving a blue colour which turned yellow after stopping reaction with sulphuric acid solution and the plate was read by spectrophotometry at a wave length 450 nm and results are interpolated from Apoptosense M30 standard curve [5].

The study showed a significantly higher level of CK18 in the serum of patients with marked fibrosis compared to patients with lower levels of fibrosis. These results are in agreement with those of Akl et al., who reported that CK18 expression was found to be increased in chronic HCV cases with higher stages of fibrosis that were progressing into cirrhosis, espe- cially at METAVIR stage F4 [2,3].

This result may be important for patients with normal aminotransferase levels. Therefore, apoptotic CK18 in the serum of patients with chronic hepatitis C are associated with higher ALT level and histological liver damage. This agree with many studies that found elevated serum apoptotic CK18 levels in patients with chronic hepatitis with high ALT levels [18,22].
