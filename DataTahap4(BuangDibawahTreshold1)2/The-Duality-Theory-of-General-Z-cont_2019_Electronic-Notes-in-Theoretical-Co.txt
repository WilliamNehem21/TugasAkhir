Suppose that P and Q are Z-precontinuous posets where Z is the subset selection B, C or D respectively. Then it is easy to check that the sum corresponding to the first three is still Z-precontinuous. Pick P is the chain 3 and Q is a 4-element lattice. It is clear that A, F and P-precontinuity may be destroyed under all these
