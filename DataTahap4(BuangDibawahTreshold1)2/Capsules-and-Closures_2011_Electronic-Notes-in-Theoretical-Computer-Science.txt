The idea behind those propositions is that for every capsule, there are several bisim- ilar states corresponding to different computations, and each keeping track of a dif- ferent set of superfluous information. Similarly, for every irreducible capsules, there are several bisimilar results keeping track of superfluous information. Capsules thus offer a much cleaner representation of the state of computation.
