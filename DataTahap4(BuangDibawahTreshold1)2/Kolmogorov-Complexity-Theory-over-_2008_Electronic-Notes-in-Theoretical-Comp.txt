As an application, [28, Corollary 4] presents an alternative proof to a known lower bound in the algebraic complexity theory of polynomials, thus exemplifying the real incompressibility method as a natural counterpart to Fact 1.1d). We will give another application in Observation 4.1.

Remark 2.2 More precisely, any finite information (like, e.g. the number J of real constants following or the length of the input x to simulate M on) can be incorpo- rated in this way without increasing the size of the encoding. This simplifies several putative pitfalls from classical Kolmogorov Complexity like [20, Example 2.1.4]

Now although the latter answer may in general be wrong, the finitely many queries u1,..., uN  H admit a common M beyond which all are reported correctly; and so are the negative ones vj H anyway. Hence for m M, N , g(x, m)= f (x).

Take some hypothetical non-trivial factorization p = q1 q2 in E[X1,..., Xn, Y1,..., Ym]. A fortiori, p(x, Y )= q1(x, Y ) q2(x, Y ) constitutes a factorization in E(x)[Y ]; a non-trivial one: because if for instance q1(x, Y ) were the constant polynomial, say q1(x, Y )= c  E, then q1(X, y)  c = 0 for some y1,..., ym

Conversely suppose p(x, Y ) = q1(x, Y ) q2(x, Y ) in E(x)[Y ] and consider the polynomial r := p  q1 q2  E[X, Y ]. Although vanishing on (x, Y ), it cannot be identically zero because that would mean a non-trivial factorization of irreducible p. On the other hand r(X, y1,..., ym) = 0 for some y1,..., ym

Discrete Kolmogorov Complexity Theory is a useful tool for establishing (lower and average) bounds on running times of specific algorithms as well as generally on the complexity of certain problems [20, Section 6]. The same can be said about its BSS counterpart [28, Corollary 4]. For instance we conclude from Example 2.7a) an entirely new proof of the following

The first author is grateful to his colleagues Dennis Amelunxen, Peter Scheiblech- ner, and Thorsten Wedhorn for discussions about algebraic varieties and the rationality questions arisen in Section 2.2. Moreover, Peter Scheiblechner has been a great help in finding a proof for Lemma 3.11c). Finally we owe to Klaus
