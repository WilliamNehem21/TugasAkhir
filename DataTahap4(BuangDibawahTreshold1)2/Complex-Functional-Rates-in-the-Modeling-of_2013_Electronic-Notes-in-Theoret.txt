The Kappa-calculus is a formal language idealizing molecular interactions as a particular kind of graph-rewriting. Molecules are nodes with fixed numbers of sites and molecular bonds are arcs connecting sites. Complexes are connected graphs built over such nodes and bonds. Reactions are modeled by rewriting rules that can modify the internal state of nodes, create bonds to represent complexations, and destroy bonds to represent decomplexations.

used to notify to molecules the occurrence of a reaction involving other molecules in the same complex. In this way, after a reaction taking place, all the molecules of the involved complexes could possibly update their internal state accordingly. In [9,10] we also discussed how to perform simulations of the behavior of systems modeled with nano-Kappa.

numbers; the integers 1, 2, .. ., sf (A) and 1, 2, .. ., ss(A) are respectively the fields and the sites of A (in particular, sf (A) = 0 means there is no field, ss(A) = 0 means there is no site).

The simulator for the Kappa language KaSim [1] already includes the possibility to associate to a reaction a pair of rates, the first one to be used when the reactants are freely floating and the second one for the case in which they are part of the same complex. This latter mechanism is useful to resolve the ambiguity of Kappa rules among two reactants A and B that could be applied in a context where A and B are sometimes already connected and sometimes disconnected. Indeed, this would lead to an inconsistency in the definition of the kinetic rate which should have a volume dependency in the former case and no volume dependency in the latter. Nevertheless, the introduction of physical or chemical properties influencing reaction rates as functions of the whole involved complexes makes unfeasible any attempt of modeling in Kappa.
