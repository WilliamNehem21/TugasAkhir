Definition 2.3 Suppose B is a set of functions (called basic functions), and O is a set of operations. Then FA[B; O] is called a function algebra, and it denotes the smallest set of functions containing B and closed under the operations in O. For ease of readability, we often list the elements of B or O simply as a list separated by commas.
