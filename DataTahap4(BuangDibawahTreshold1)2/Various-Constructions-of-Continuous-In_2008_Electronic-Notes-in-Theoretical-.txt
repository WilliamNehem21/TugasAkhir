Here we only give the general power constructions. It is not practical to re- quire a power of a continuous information system remain a continuous information system, for powers of domains are not always domains. What kinds of continuous information systems whose powers are again continuous information systems will be explored elsewhere.

Remark 4.2 Generally speaking, the induced weak information system is not a continuous information system (see Example 4.3 below). However, if some induced weak information system happens to be a continuous information system, then it must be an algebraic one (see Proposition 4.4 below).

Pass to (algebraic) retracts. We note that retracts should be defined in terms of retractions which have to be approximating mappings. However, approximating mappings are defined only between continuous information systems. To define prop- erly retractions between (algebraic) continuous information systems, the following Proposition 4.8 and 4.13 are needed.

braic kernel construction is a relatively strong construction, for it generates always algebraic information systems. This construction might have uses in representing algebraic domains. The (algebraic) retracts are somewhat complicated and closely related to approximable mappings. However, these constructions indeed give new (algebraic) continuous information systems.
