In an earlier work [16] we presented an approach to stochastic minimising games based on our logic for probabilistic programs [17,11]. The contribution here is to extend our logical approach to maximising games. That maximising and minimising are not (simply) duals is due to the use of least fixed-points in both cases, as is normal for iterating programs. (For duality, we would have to use greatest fixed-points in the maximising case.)
