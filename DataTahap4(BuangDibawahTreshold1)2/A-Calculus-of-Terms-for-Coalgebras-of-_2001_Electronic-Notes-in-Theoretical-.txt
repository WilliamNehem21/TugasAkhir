Example. To illustrate the use of rigid terms and case-formation in coalge- braic specification, here is an example adapted from [9, Section 4]. Let A be a set of (possibly infinite) binary trees. Each tree x either is a single node with no children, or has exactly two children obtained by deleting the top node of

St is a type symbol that will denote the state set of a given coalgebra. A type is rigid if it does not have St as a subtype. The set of rigid types is thus the smallest set that includes O and satisfies (1) and (2).

The tools needed to give a structural characterisation of logically definable classes of coalgebras are now all in place. The following result is the analogue for polynomial functors of Theorem 9.2 of [4] for monomial functors, and the underlying reasoning is the same.
