As already mentioned, the TCCS model has been inspired by the notion of time available in the Esterel model [4] and its relatives such as SL [5]. These models rely on signals as the basic communication mechanism. Unlike a channel, a signal persists within the instant and disappears at the end of it. It turns out that a signal can be defined recursively in TCCS as:

We have presented a natural notion of contextual and convergence sensitive bisim- ulation and we have shown that it can be characterised by a variant of the usual notion of labelled bisimulation relying on the concept of contextual convergence. As a direct corollary of this characterisation, we have shown that (untimed) CCS processes are embedded fully abstractly into timed ones. Finally, we have refined the notion of bisimulation to make it divergence-sensitive.
