In the first section, we provide a quick review of the various categorical notions used, with a short list of important notation. In the second section we give a quick overview on combining the choice theories. The third section contains our main result on completing arbitrary nondeterministic models with appropriately distributive probabilistic operators. We introduce the theory necessary to construct the convex completions functor and give a full account of its adjunction structure. The final section presents how our functors can be lifted to find posetal models.

As we have seen, the classical way of constructing mixed choice models on a cat- egory C was done by calculating LP models in C then extending them by adding appropriately distributive nondeterministic operators. This allowed us not only to construct the free mixed choice models from objects in C but also to construct mixed choice models from LP models over C. By focusing on the dual approach, we are able to calculate TMC models from TND models in C. Thus given any non-standard model of nondeterministic choice in C, we can extend it to mixed choice.

I would like to acknowledge, first and foremost, my supervisor Philip J. Scott. His advice, understanding and patience throughout the development of my PhD thesis, on which this paper is based, have been a real asset to me. Also, I would like to thank Michael Mislove and James Worrell for the many interesting discussions
