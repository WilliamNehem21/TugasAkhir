Circular-arc graphs form a superclass of interval graphs. An important difference between these two classes is that interval graphs have a linear number of maximal cliques (in the number of vertices), while circular-arc graphs may have an exponential number of maximal cliques. This may suggest why some problems are more difficult for circular-arc graphs than for interval graphs. For instance, vertex-coloring is polynomial for interval graphs, but NP-hard for circular-arc graphs [4].

Observe the necessity of including (ii) in Definition 2.2, otherwise the pullbacks f1,..., ft could define non-compatible edge-colorings (that is, color conflicts could be created when assembling all edge-colorings in order to construct the edge-coloring of G). Also in the definition, observe that disjointness is assumed only among the sets of the partition {E1,..., Et}, but not among the domains of the functions in F , which are sets of vertices, not edges. This means that a single vertex u can be

proves (ii)). If only one set I from {YAB, YAC, YBC} has vertices of maximum de- gree in G, then surely I /=YBC, because of the assumption on the cardinality of XA. If I = YAB, then the semi-core of G is an indifference graph, because the order YB, YBC, YAB, YAC, YA is an indifference order 7. The case I = YAC follows
