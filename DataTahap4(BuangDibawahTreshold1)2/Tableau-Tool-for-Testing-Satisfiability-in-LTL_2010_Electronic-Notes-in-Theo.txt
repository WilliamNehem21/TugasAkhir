It is known, e.g., from research on description logics, that sometimes algorithms for theoretically computationally hard problems can solve most of the practically significant problems efficiently, especially when augmented with optimization tech- niques. Apparently, we face a similar phenomenon in the case of LTL as well, confirming that theoretical worst-case complexity results should be taken with a grain of salt when determining the practical utility of algorithms.

guage. 4 . Memory usage by both tools was carefully monitored during all tests to ensure that it does not run out. That would cause the computer to start using virtual memory and greatly increase the running times. Virtual memory was not used in any of the tests reported below.

Another way to test the correctness of the implementation was to generate and test large sets of formulae that we knew to be satisfiable, and formulae we knew to be not satisfiable. In particular, we have used sets of such formulae generated by M. Montali [10], and one of them detected a bug in an earlier version of the program.
