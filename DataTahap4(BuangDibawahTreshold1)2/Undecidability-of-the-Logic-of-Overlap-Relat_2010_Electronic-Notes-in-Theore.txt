ability is typically the case for fragments of HS involving only one modality, which makes that set of fragments particularly interesting. The decidability of B, B, E, E can be easily shown by a reduction to point-based logics. The decidability of A, A, and thus that of L, L (respectively definable in terms of A, A) has been established in [6,7] by different model-theoretic arguments each implying small (non-standard) model property for these logics; likewise for the decidability of D over dense linear orderings (the proof can also be adapted to the case of D). The decidability of D over general, finite, or discrete linear orderings, however, is still open.

In this work, we show that O (and hence O, which is symmetric) is the only so far proven exception from that decidability trend, despite its simplicity and limited expressive power. The main result of the present paper is that the logic O (resp., O), interpreted over discrete linear orderings, is undecidable. This result strengthens those obtained in [4] for a number of extensions of O when the semantics is restricted to discrete linear orderings.The proof is based on a reduction from the undecidable octant tiling problem (see, e.g., [2]), which is the problem of establishing whether a given finite set of tile types can tile the second octant of the integer plane, respecting the color constraints between pairs of tiles that are vertically or horizontally adjacent.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce syntax and seman- tics of the fragment O, interpreted over discrete linear orderings. In Section 3, we briefly illustrate the structure of the undecidability proof. In Section 4, we give a detailed account of it. Conclusions provide an assessment of the work and outline future research directions.

In this section, we give an intuitive account of the structure of the undecidability proof. We have already exploited a reduction from the tiling problem for the second octant of the integer plane to prove the undecidability of various HS fragments [3,4]. However, the nature of the overlap modality featured by the logic O substantially influences the technicalities of the reduction.

Inductive step. Let us assume that, by the inductive hypothesis, M, [ci, ci+1] H k1 (resp., M, [ci, ci+1] H k2), where len([ci, ci+1]) = 2 and i is odd (resp., i is even). The argument we applied to the base case can be applied to prove that M, [bi, bi+1] H u1 (resp., M, [bi, bi+1] H u2), where ci < bi < ci+1 < bi+1 and len([bi, bi+1]) = 2.

Similarly, if we assume that, by the inductive hypothesis, M, [bi, bi+1] H u1 (resp., M, [bi, bi+1] H u2), where len([bi, bi+1]) = 2 and i is odd (resp., i is even), then the argument we applied to the base case allows us to conclude that M, [ci+1, ci+2] H k2 (resp., M, [ci+1, ci+2] H k1), where bi < ci+1 < bi+1 < ci+2 and len([ci+1, ci+2]) = 2.

on. Notice that, in forward (resp., backward) rows, the last (resp., first) tile-interval has no tile-intervals above-connected with it, in order to constrain each row to have exactly one tile-interval more than the previous one (these tile-intervals are labeled with last).

Let [c, d] be a up rel-interval. By (24), we have that there exist d', d'', with c < d' < d < d'', such that [d', d''] is a tile-interval and by (21), (28), and Lemma 4.1, there exist c', c'', with c' < c < c'' < d, such that [c', c''] is a tile-interval. Now, suppose that [c, d] satisfies up relb (the other case is symmetric) and that [c', c''] satisfies f. Then, (29) is contradicted. Similarly, if [d', d''] satisfies b, then

It is not difficult to show that the given undecidability proof cannot be directly applied to the logic of Overlap relation, interpreted over other classes of linear orderings, e.g., the class of dense linear orderings. We are interested in solving the decision problem for the considered logic when interpreted over other linear orderings. As a matter of fact, we are not aware of any interval temporal logic which is decidable (resp., undecidable) with respect to some classes of linear orderings and undecidable (resp. decidable) with respect to other ones.
