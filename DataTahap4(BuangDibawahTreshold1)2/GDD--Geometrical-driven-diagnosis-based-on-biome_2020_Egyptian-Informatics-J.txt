Modern medical diagnosis heavily rely on bio-medical and clinical data. Machine learning algorithms have proven effectiveness in mining this data to provide an aid to the physicians in supporting their deci- sions. In response, machine learning based approaches were developed to address this problem. These approaches vary in terms of effectiveness and computational cost. Attention has been paid towards non-communicable diseases as they are very common and have life threatening risk factors. The diagno- sis of diabetes or breast cancer can be considered a binary classification problem. This paper proposes a new machine learning based algorithm, Geometrical Driven Diagnosis (GDD), to diagnose diabetes and breast cancer with accuracy up to 99.96% and 95.8% respectively.

Type 2 diabetes [4] is the most common type of diabetes. The total number of type 2 patients can be estimated by 415 million humans worldwide. The estimated number of undiagnosed dia- betes patients is 193 millions. Early diagnosis of diabetes along with the proper treatment, can effectively limit the catastrophic effects of diabetes on health.

the experiments and the results and proves the excellence of the proposed approach over other recent algorithms in the field. Sec- tion 5 provides the conclusion for the proposed approach and the experiments carried. Section 6 discusses the limitations of this work and future work possibilities.

and the other the negative class. Then the positive class data is duplicated one or more times to balance the positive and negative classes. After that, each subset is split into training and testing sets 70% and 30% respectively. The training datasets are clustered using
