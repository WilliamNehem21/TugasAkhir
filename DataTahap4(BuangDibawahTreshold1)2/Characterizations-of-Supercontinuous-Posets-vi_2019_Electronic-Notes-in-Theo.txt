In this paper, the concepts of Scott S-sets, weakly local S-compactness and S-bases of posets are introduced. With these new concepts, some characterizations of supercontinuous (resp., superalgebraic) posets are given. In order to provide a topological interpretation of S-bases, the new concept of the S-essential topology on posets is also introduced. Properties and characterizations of S-bases via the S-essential topology are obtained. Main results are: (1) A poset L is supercontinuous iff every two different points can be separated

introduced and extensively studied (see [1]-[3]). Lawson in [3] gave a remarkable characterization that a dcpo is continuous iff its Scott topology is completely dis- tributive. Since some naturally arisen posets are important but fail to be directed complete, there are more and more occasions to study posets which miss suprema of directed sets (see [4]-[8], [12]-[15]). By the technique of embedded bases and sobrification via the Scott topology, Xu in [12] successfully embedded continuous posets into continuous domains and proved that a poset is continuous iff its Scott topology is completely distributive.

directed if every finite subset of D has an upper bound in D. A poset L is a directed complete partially ordered set (dcpo, for short) if every directed subset of L has a supremum. A complete lattice is a poset in which every subset has a supremum.

tributive lattices, need not be continuous in general. In this paper, we introduced the concept of Scott S-sets of posets. By Remark 3.3, Scott S-sets of a poset are all Scott open sets of the poset and the Scott S-sets of a complete lattice need not be a topology. However, by our Theorems 3.7, 3.10 and 3.19, we see that Scott S-sets play roles in characterizing supercontinuous posets similar to that of Scott open sets in characterizing continuous posets.
