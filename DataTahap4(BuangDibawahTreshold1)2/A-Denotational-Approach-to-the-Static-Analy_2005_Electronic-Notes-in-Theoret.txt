We present in this paper, a non-uniform static analysis for detecting the term-substitution property in processes specified in the spi calculus. The property is essential in defining security breaches, like secrecy and authenticity. The analysis is fully denotational, preserving compositionality and facilitating implementations in functional programming.

operations. We view the cryptographic operations as the value-processing behaviour of processes. One aspect of the term-passing and term-processing behaviours that has significance when detecting security breaches in processes is term substitution. Term substitutions occur whenever communications, successful decryption, signature verification and tuple splitting take place. Security implications arise in scenarios where a process classified at a low secrecy level obtains high-level data, or a process classified at a high trust level obtains low-level data. We call the former information leakage and the latter authenticity breach.
