It could be argued that one ofits faults is that it only applies to continuous mappings, since there are now more general fixed point theorems available [5]. However, within the context of continuous mappings, the only criticism that seems plausible is that its canonical fixed points are not as canonical as they could be. There is, after all, one thing more satisfying than a least fixed point: A unique fixed point.

It would be nice to see a metric based approach to semantics replaced with one based on results like Theorem 5.3. Especially on a model ofCSP. Trying to obtain estimates in the spirit ofProp. 5.6 for nonexpansive maps also seems like a fun question. It would be neat to find out if the informatic derivative [6] (derivative of a map on a domain with respect to a measurement) can be useful in this regard.
