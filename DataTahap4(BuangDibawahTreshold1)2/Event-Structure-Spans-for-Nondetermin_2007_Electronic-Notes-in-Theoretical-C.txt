example is essentially that presented in [11]. Let A1 be the nondeterministic process that either outputs a token and stops, or outputs a token, waits for a token on input and then outputs another token. Let A2 be the process that either outputs a token and stops, or waits for a token on input and then outputs two tokens. The input- output relations between strings of tokens of both A1 and A2 are the same:

The paper [4,5] studies a trace construction on rooted profunctors for nondeter- ministic dataflow. In loc. cit. the tensor operation is also given by simple parallel composition. We now sketch why the trace construction there coincides with that on event structures, that
