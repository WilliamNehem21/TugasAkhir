The growing importance of model checking in hardware verification and the difficulty of pro- ducing correct software are driving a growing interest in the application of model checking to software. This leads to many challenges of scientific and practical interest, both in core model checking technology and in supporting techniques, such as program analyses and transformations that help automate abstraction of the data state and reduction of the control state. The two main aims of the workshop were to introduce people to the field of software model checking, and to serve as a forum for the presentation and discussion of new research ideas in the field.

The call for papers resulted in 25 submissions. Eight were selected by the Program Committee for presentation at the workshop, and seven appear here. The submissions were reviewed by the Program Committee and the following additional reviewers: Dennis Dams, Alex Groce, Frederic Lang, Radu Mateescu, SeungJoon Park, and Sriram Rajamani.
