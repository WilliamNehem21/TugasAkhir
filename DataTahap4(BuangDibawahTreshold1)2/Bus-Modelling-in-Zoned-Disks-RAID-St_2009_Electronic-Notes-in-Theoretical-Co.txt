Other work in the area relate to single RAID levels and their performance in a specific working mode (normal or degraded) [1,8,10]. Some of these studies focused on the delivered throughput [9], which can be limited by the shared bus bandwidth. In this paper, we focus on the bus connecting devices in single RAID organisa- tions as well as Multi-RAID systems. The very specific context characteristics which motivate this study are discussed in Section 2, the proposed model is described in Section 3 and its parameters are determined in Section 4, mainly as moments, us- ing the detailed description of the principles of operation of the system.
