While building a new system by reusing existing components, behavioural interfaces do not always fit one another, and these interoperability issues have to be faced and worked out. Mismatches may be caused by different message names, a message without counterpart (or with several ones) in the partner, etc. The presence of mismatch results in a deadlocking execution of several components [3,10].

In this paper, the adaptation contract AC between components is specified us- ing vectors [9]. Each action appearing in one vector is executed by one component and the overall result corresponds to a synchronisation between all the involved components. A vector may involve any number of components and does not re- quire interactions to occur on the same names of actions. Moreover, a vector may synchronise actions performed by sub-processes in a hierarchical fashion.

C R finds the behaviour that can be performed by the client in both adaptors. This is done by hiding the actions performed by the servers (LA and LB ) and building the synchronised product. If there are no traces that can be performed by the client in both adaptors, there is a dead- lock in C R and it is not possible to build a fault-tolerant system. Otherwise, using C R , we constrain each adaptor to this client behaviour which yields, by construction, trace
