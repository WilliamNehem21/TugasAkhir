set of G, such that every vertex in G has at least one neighbor in S, and no two vertices in G have the same set of neighbors in S. When a device may be prevented from detecting an intruder at its own location, it is necessary to install another de- vice in its neighborhood. A natural way to analyze such situations is to make use of open neighborhood sets which may have useful additional properties, such as being open-independent, dominating, open-dominating or open-locating-dominating.

tary prisms, such as independence, distance and domination. For further study on domination parameters in complementary prisms, see [1,3,4,7,8,9,11]. Cappelle et al. [2] described a polynomial time recognition algorithm for complementary prisms and Duarte et al. [5] studied algorithmic/complexity properties of complementary prisms with respect to cliques, independent sets, domination, and convexity. Here we study open-independent, open-locating-dominating sets in the complementary prisms of graphs. Various properties of and bounds on OLDOIND-sets in comple- mentary prisms were presented and the cases of cliques, paths and cycles have been completely solved. Our main result is that if the girth of G is at least five, then the

A logarithmic lower bound on the size of an OLDOIND-set in any graph has been provided. Various properties of and bounds on OLDOIND-sets in complementary prisms were presented and the cases of cliques, paths and cycles have been com- pletely solved. It has been shown that for any graph with girth at least five, it can be decided in polynomial time whether or not its complementary prism has an OLD-OIND-set (and also the set can be found in polynomial time if it ex- ists). Furthermore, we conjecture that the problem of deciding if a graph has an OLDOIND-set remains NP-complete even for complementary prisms and pose the following open questions:
