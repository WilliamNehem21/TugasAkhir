Some colors were used only in edges. Such colors were used in matchings of distance between rows that were determined by the matchings of Kp. Since the matchings are pairwise disjoint, the pairs of rows determined by the matchings of Kp are distinct and, therefore, there are no colors being applied to adjacent edges. By construction it is clear that incident and adjacent elements were not assigned to the same color. The colors used only in edges were used in perfect matchings of the graph, totalizing rp times. The colors used in vertices and edges were used in 2
