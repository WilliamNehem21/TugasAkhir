Let Y + denote the full subcategory of Y consisting of positive Conway games. Since Y + is a full subcategory of Y , we have just established that if Y has binary products, then Y + has binary products as well. We conclude our proof of Proposition 2.1 by showing that Y + does not have binary products. Consider the negative game B interpreting the booleans, with four positions

In this section, we recall the definitions of asynchronous games and innocent strategy given in [12]. The original definition of asynchronous game is adapted in three ways. First, we consider asynchronous games with a well-founded event structure, in order to relate them to Conway games. This is only a detail of presentation, since all our definitions work perfectly well in non well- founded asynchronous games. We also add an incompatibility relation #

Besides, the category Z incorporates two well-known variants of the inno- cent arena game model: the well-bracketed and the non well-bracketed ones. More precisely, there are structure preserving functors F (resp. G) from the category of arena games and well-bracketed (resp. non well-bracketed) inno- cent strategies, to the category Z. The two functors F and G differ mainly

Acknowledgements. The main part of Section 3 was developed in collab- oration with Peter Selinger, during the winter 2000-2001. We have learned recently that a similar line of research was developed by Robin Cockett and Robert Seely, on polarized categories and modules. There remains to under- stand how their work relates to the work presented here.
