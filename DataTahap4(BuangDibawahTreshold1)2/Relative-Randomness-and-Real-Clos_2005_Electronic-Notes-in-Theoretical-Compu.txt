With the same technique we show that the class of differences of computably enumerable reals (d.c.e. reals) and the class of computably approximable reals (c.a. reals) form real closed fields. The d.c.e. result was also proved nearly simultaneously and independently by Ng [6].

Of course, this result is vacuous unless w.c.l.L. functions actually exist. They certainly do. To see this, let us dig up a helpful fact from real analysis: if f is differentiable on E (with E open), then f is locally Lipschitz on E.
