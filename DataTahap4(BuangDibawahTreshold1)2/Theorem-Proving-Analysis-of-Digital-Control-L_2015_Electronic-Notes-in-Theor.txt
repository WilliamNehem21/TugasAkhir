In the remainder of this paper we present the physical modeling considerations that motivate this work (Sec. 2); a simple hybrid thermostat model used to illustrate our approach (Sec. 3); an analysis of that model using informal mathematics to convey the key ideas (Sec. 4); a corresponding formal analysis in the Coq theorem prover (Sec. 5); and a conclusion (Sec. 6).

and applying a heat pulse if T is below a threshold. While this is a relatively sim- ple thermostat behavior, we view it as an instance of digital control logic coupled to physical dynamics, which could be generalized to more complex scenarios. In particular, even this simple thermostat embodies the challenges noted previously: modeling the cyber-physical system in a well-posed causal form, and accounting for indecision in analog-to-digital conversion.

Here, the part of the integral for tj > ti vanishes due to the causality-enforcing step function in G; and the function q is the thermal forcing term, which in our case is a sum over heat pulses. In accordance with our convention, any discrete forcing event at exactly time tj is to be included in the integral because it is not already reflected in T (tj). Thus far we have exploited the linearity of the thermal dynamics with respect to q considered as an external forcing.

The proof is structured as a four-way case analysis as described in Sec. 4, with each case discharged by applying a subsidiary lemma (e.g., Tn heat keeps above). The statements of the four lemmas (shown below, with proof bodies elided) match the conditions described in the informal proof.
