During the last couple of decades, many new and different data models have been introduced. First, so called semantic data models have been developed [17,33,47], which were originally just meant to be used as design aids, as ap- plication semantics was assumed to be easier captured by these models. Later on some of these models, especially the nested relational model [35], object- oriented and object-relational models [6,24,43,44] have become interesting as data models in their own right and some dependency and normalisation the- ory has been carried over to these advanced data models [25,26,27,39,41,46,52]. Most recently, the major research interest is on the model of semi-structured data and XML [48]. Work on integrity constraints in the context of XML can be found in [2,15,23,22,51]. One key problem is to develop dependency theo- ries (or preferably a unified theory) for these advanced data models. Biskup

Product(Item,CustName) denotes an item together with the name of the cus- tomer who bought it. Total denotes the total price of sales, NOrd the total number of orders, NProd the total number of products and NShip the total number of shippings. A few reasonable constraints that a database designer may specify for this application are the following.
