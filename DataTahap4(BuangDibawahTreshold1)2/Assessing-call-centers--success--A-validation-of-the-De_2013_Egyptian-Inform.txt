Abstract Business process outsourcing (BPO) is becoming one of the most growing industries in 21st Century and a significant workforce in the global economy. Revolution in telecommunications, free trade agreements, and cultural behavior in a number of developing countries paved the way for the growth of BPO industry. Technology based BPO services are those services provided by Call centers, services that vary from receiving simple phone calls, to marketing services, sales services, and up to remote diagnosis and technical support services.

One way to analyze the measured data for different dimensions and call centers is to try to model the two main outcomes (dimensions) for the call centers, User Satisfaction, and Net Benefits as function of the input dimensions. Use of multiple regression is used in order to model the User satisfaction Dimension as function of the input dimensions System Qual- ity, Information Quality, Service Quality, and Usage. The Net Benefits dimension is modeled as function of the four in- put dimensions as well as the user satisfaction dimension.

higher priority was given to the system quality and the service quality dimension. Call centers decision makers can use the tool to tune the different weights in order to reach the objec- tives set by the organization. Multiple linear regression analy- sis was used in order to provide a linear formula for the User Satisfaction dimension and the Net Benefits dimension in or- der to be able to forecast the values for these two dimensions as function of the other dimensions.
