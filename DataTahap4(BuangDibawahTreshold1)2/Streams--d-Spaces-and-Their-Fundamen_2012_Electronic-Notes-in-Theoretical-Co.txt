The notion of fundamental category arises from an adaptation of the usual notion of fundamental groupoid [3,15,23]. Actually we can define the fundamental category of a (locally) partially ordered space [8,20], d-space [10] or stream [18]. In each case the construction follows the same pattern and leads to a Van Kampen like theorem [10,8]. We briefly recall their construction following a general setting inspired from [14]. From this framework we give a common proof for the Van Kampen theorem

Proof. The underlying Hausdorff space of Y as well as the continuous map q are given by the Lemma 3.9 and the relation on Y is the least closed reflexive relation on Y that turns q into a morphism of W.

We conclude the section showing the notion pospace is rather rigid in regard of the fundamental category invariant. Indeed there is a unique (up to isomorphism) pospace whose fundamental category is the standard poset 11 [0, 1]. In opposition, there is at least two non isomorphic d-spaces whose fundamental category is the standard poset [0, 1], the topology and the collection of directed paths of a d-space being too loosely bound.

provides a counter-example. It is worth to notice this situation is not pathological since it is actually the kind of model obtained when a linear process (i.e. containing neither loop nor fork) spawns a new process which is reduced to a loop. In this case we should also have a directed segment whose end is glue to the vortex. The vortex thus corresponds to the state where the new process is created.

The pathology described at the end of the preceding section directly derives from the presence of the vortex. Intuitively, it seems impossible to have a vertex in the directed geometric realisation of some cubical set K without using a degeneracy. Thus we conjecture the Proposition 6.9 actually holds for any precubical set. Yet, by the Propositions 6.2 and 6.3 we have
