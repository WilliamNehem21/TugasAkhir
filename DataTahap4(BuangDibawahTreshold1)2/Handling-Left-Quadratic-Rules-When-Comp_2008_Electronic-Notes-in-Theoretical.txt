Layout of the paper The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces notations and the basic completion approach. Next, Section 3 presents the main theoretical contributions of the paper, while Section 4 describes a family of examples and gives related security issues. Finally, Section 5 concludes.

Let us first remark that the criterion defined in [17] does not allow managing the XOR non-left linear rule. Second, in [6] we have restricted XOR operations to typed terms to deal with the XOR non-left linear rule. However, some protocols are known to be flawed by type confusing attacks [14,10,11]. Notice that our approach in [7] can be applied to any kinds of TRSs. Moreover, it can cope with exponentiation algebraic properties and this way analyse Diffie-Hellman based protocols.

Regular approximation techniques have been successfully used in the context of security protocol analysis. In order to apply them to other applications, this pa- per proposed an extension of the completion procedure for handling left-quadratic rules. Our contributions allow analysing some reachability problems using poly- nomial steps computing A , rather than automata determinisation steps that are exponential, even in practical cases. Notice that the approach presented only for quadratic rules can be extended to more complex TRSs. We intend to optimise this technique: polynomial is better than exponential but may also lead to huge automata in few steps. We have been implementing the techniques in an efficient rewriting tool in order to investigate complex systems backward analyses.
