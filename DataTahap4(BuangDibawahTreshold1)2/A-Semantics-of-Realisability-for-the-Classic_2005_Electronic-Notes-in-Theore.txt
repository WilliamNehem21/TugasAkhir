Until very recently (see the introduction of [3] for a brief history), no proof of the strong normalization of the cut-elimination procedure was known for full logic. In [3], P. De Groote gives a such proof for classical propositional natural deduction by using the CPS-transformation. R. David and the first author give in [2] a direct and syntactical proof of this result. R. Matthes recently found another semantical proof of this result (see [6]).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is an introduction to the typed system and the relative cut-elimination procedure. In section 3, we define the semantics of realisability and we prove the correctness theorem. In section 4, we give some applications of this result.
