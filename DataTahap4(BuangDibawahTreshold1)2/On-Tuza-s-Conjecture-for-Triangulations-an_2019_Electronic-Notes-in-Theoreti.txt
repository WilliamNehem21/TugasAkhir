Proof The proof consists of the analysis of a series of cases. In each of these cases, we find a reducing triple for G, which contradicts the irreducibility of G. In this extended abstract, we present only the proof of (i).

We were also able to obtain the following slightly stronger version of Lemma 4.4 for a (finite) class of planar 3-trees. This result will be used in the next section. Given a copy H of K4 in a planar 3-tree G, we denote by g(H) the pair (i, j) where i (resp. j) is the maximum (resp. minimum) number of vertices of G inside a face of H. We say that a planar 3-tree G is restricted if G contains a copy H of K4 such that g(H)= (2, 0). In this case, we always consider the face of H with no vertices of G inside as the external face of G, that is, the vertices of G not in H are drawn in the internal faces of H. If, additionally, H has two faces with precisely one vertex of G inside, then we say that G is super restricted.
