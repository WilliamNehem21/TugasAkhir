Even before the SPIN model for rwlock was completed, it was obvious that there were problems with the implementation. Just the act of performing a verification review can be instructive! In the case of rdlock, a reader must wait (writer prefer- ence) if a writer is queued. At this point, the readers-queued count is incremented. However, it is never decremented!! This bug was acknowledged by Red Hat and fixed in the next release.
