The Tietze-Urysohn Theorem states that every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subspace of a normal space can be extended to a continuous function on the whole space. We prove an effective version of this theorem in the Type Two Model of Effectivity (TTE). Moreover, for qcb-spaces we introduce a slightly weaker notion of normality than the classical one and show that this property still admits an Extension Theorem for continuous functions.

In this paper we introduce a weaker notion of normality called quasi-normality. This notion may be considered as a substitute for normality in the class of qcb- spaces (cf. Section 3). We show that quasi-normal qcb-spaces admits extendability of continuous functions defined on functionally closed subspaces (cf. Section 4). The category of quasi-normal qcb-spaces forms a cartesian closed subcategory of QCB and contains all separable metrisable spaces.

It is well-known that the subspace operator on topological spaces has the following transitivity property: Any functionally open subset of a functionally open subspace is functionally open in the original space, whereas the analogous statement for functionally closed sets is false in general (cf. [2, 2.1.B]).

It follows from [2, 2.1.J] that the reverse implication is true as well. So we will prove at first that quasi-normal qcb-spaces have the property that any zero-set of any functionally closed subspace is also a zero-set of the original space.

This effectivisation of Proposition 4.6 can be proved by showing effective ver- sions of the lemmas in Section 4 on which Proposition 4.6 is based. Their proofs can be obtained by effectivising the proofs of their topological counterparts using Lemma 5.1.
