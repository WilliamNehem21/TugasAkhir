A similar treatment for general iteration seems to be non-existent. One motivation may be the lack of a clear inductive definition of the domain of general iterates, whereas primitive iterates (and even functions definable by primitive recursion) can be easily defined by induction on the carrier of a Peano algebra. However, general iteration has received an algebraic treatment using closure theory [5,8], iteration theories [1] and coalgebras [12].
