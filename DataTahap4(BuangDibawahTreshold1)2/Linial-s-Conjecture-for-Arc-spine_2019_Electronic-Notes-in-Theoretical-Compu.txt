We say that a digraph D is an arc-spine digraph if there exists a partition {X, Y } in V (D) where D[X] is traceable and D[Y ] contains at most one arc. One such partition {X, Y } of an arc-spine digraph is maximal if X is maximal. We use D[X, Y ] to denote that D has one such partition {X, Y } and that it is maximal. We denote by a the unique arc of D[Y ] that may exist and by u and v the tail and head of a, respectively. Let P = (x1, x2,..., xl) be a Hamilton path of D[X].

In Lemma 2.4 we show that there is an analogue of [9, Lemma 1] for k-loose arc- spine digraphs. Note, however, that the concept of k-loose for arc-spine digraphs presented here is different from the concept of k-loose for spine digraphs presented in [9]. The different definition of k-loose was needed as a means to guarantee that there would be perfect analogues of Lemmas 1 and 3 from [9] for arc-spine digraphs. The analogue of [9, Lemma 3] is Lemma 2.8.

The most ingenious part of the proof presented by Sambinelli, Nunes da Silva and Lee is the proof of [9, Lemma 3] . Next, we show the proof of its analogue for arc-spine digraphs, Lemma 2.8. Again, note that the concept of k-tight for spine digraphs is different from the presented definition of k-tight arc-spine digraphs. Fur- thermore, we point out that the proof of the base case of Lemma 2.8 is considerably more intricate than the base case of [9, Lemma 3].
