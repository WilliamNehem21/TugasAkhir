The remainder of the paper is divided into the following sub- sections. Section 2 describes the weakness of brightpass method. Section 3 presents the proposed methods. Sections 4 offer a thor- ough security analysis and a comparison of the proposed meth- ods with the brightpass method. Section 5 and 6 provides the ex- perimental evaluation and discussions. The paper is concluded in Section 7.

The secret key is obtained using this method via a graphical password-based interface. The graphical user interface is composed of a 7X5 matrix containing a mixture of directions and numbers. The first ten cells contain random directions, while the following twenty-five cells contain random numbers ranging from 0 to 9.

are used. The user selects the number from the start position in accor- dance with the directions specified in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, as our original PIN is 1234. This is the tricky part; when the screen bright- ness is low, the user chooses any direction in order to make an error, and when the screen brightness is high, the user follows the directions mentioned.

Because the directions derived from the matrix and original PIN are used in conjunction with the screen brightness, the method described above is resistant to multiple recordings. When the screen brightness is low, the user can move in any of the four directions, which oc- curs three times during a session due to the low brightness. As a re- sult, the chances of recovering the original PIN are extremely slim to non-existent.
