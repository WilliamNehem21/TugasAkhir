The uncertainty of the real world is concerned with fundamental concepts of quantum computing by making use of properties of quantum mechanics as the su- perposition, suggesting an improvement in the efficiency regarding complex tasks. In addition, simulations using classical computers allow the development and valida- tion of basic quantum algorithms (QAs), anticipating the knowledge related to their behaviours when executed in a quantum computer. Quantum interpretations come from measurement operations performed on the corresponding quantum states.

Section 2 presents the fundamental concepts and properties of connectives of FL and IFL. Moreover, IFSs can be obtained by intuitionistic fuzzy operators as presented in subsection 2.2. Section 3 brings the main concepts of QC which will be considered in the development of this work. In Section 4, a discussion about IFSs which can be obtained from quantum computing following the same methodology from previous work in order to model fuzzy operations from quantum registers. In Section 5, the approach for describing IFSs using the QC is depicted. An interpre- tation of classical intuitionistic fuzzy sets from quantum states is also considered, presenting the operations on IFSs modelled from quantum transformations, relat- ing the intuitionistic fuzzy approach to the difference and implication operators,
