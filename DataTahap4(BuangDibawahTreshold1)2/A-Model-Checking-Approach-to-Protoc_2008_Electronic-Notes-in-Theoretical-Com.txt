A System-on-a-chip (SoC) integrates components of a computer system into a single chip with various hardware and software components connected using a central bus such as AMBA [8]. SoC verification is an active area of interest and verification strategies are based on data-flow and/or control-flow analysis of the system. The focus of this paper is protocol conversion for mismatched protocols [13]. Although physical connectivity (interconnection using physical channels) between components can generally be achieved, logical connectivity, where processes communicate in the desired fashion, cannot always be guaranteed [13]. A mismatch occurs when pro- cesses fail to be logically connected. The aim of protocol conversion is to synthesize

The presented approach is similar to the synthesis of discrete controllers with temporal logic and Control-D system [1]. However, the approach in[1] generates controllers that can only perform disabling, i.e, transitions in the underlying system can be disabled that lead to the eventual failure of given CTL formulas. Additionally, the approach does not handle liveness properties. On the other hand, converters generated using our approach not only perform disabling, but they can also buffer events for later use in the communication of the protocols. Additionally, the syn-

consumer example where the producer can produce multiple 8-bit data after each handshake whereas the slave can only read one 8-bit data after each handshake. The generated converter controls the communication between the two components such that paths where data is lost are never reached. The final three results are well-known NuSMV examples modified to create a mismatch. Note that size entry in the second column for the final two results refers to the combined size of the system (size of P1||P2) for these examples.
