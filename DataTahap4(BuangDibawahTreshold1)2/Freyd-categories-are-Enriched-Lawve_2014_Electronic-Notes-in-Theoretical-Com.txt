Definition 2.1 [1]A doctrine is a set D of small categories. A D-limit is a limiting cone whose diagram is indexed by a category in D. Dually a D-colimit is a colimiting cone whose diagram is indexed by a category in D. We write Dop for the doctrine

The relationship between monoidal actions and enrichment is widely understood (e.g. [13]) and has proved useful in studying algebraic theories and notions of com- putation (e.g. [9], [10, Ch. 6], [18], [23]). Proposition 2.7 is the main step towards our two main theorems.

C(x, y)= V(I, C(x, y)). An enrichment of an ordinary category C in V is defined to be a V-enriched category C whose underlying ordinary category is C. For example, if V is a symmetric monoidal closed category, then the closed structure provides an enrichment of V in itself.
