Numeric invariants in programs are important for optimization and verification. In this context, one of the most interesting abstract domains to infer these invariants is that of convex polyhedra (polyhedra for short) which is able to infer linear re- lationships between variables [5]. Linear relationships make it possible to express symbolic bounds that are sufficient to prove, for example, the absence of buffer over- flows in C programs, even when the terminating zero character is not fixed [14,13]. Furthermore, it is possible to express input/output relationships of a function [7]. However, the domain of convex polyhedra suffers from the poor scalability of its join operation. The most precise join is the convex hull of the two polyhedra whose result can be exponential in the size of the input. While an exponential output is rather uncommon, the bottleneck is the exponential intermediate representation
