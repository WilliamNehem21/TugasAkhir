program construction facilities. The CLP scheme for Constraint Logic Program- ming, started by a seminal paper by Jaffar and Lassez, provides a combination of CP and LP which has proved very practical for CP applications [7]. Adding a FP dimension to CLP has led to various proposals of CFLP schemes for Con- straint Functional Logic Programming, developed since 1991 and aiming at a very expressive combination of CP , higher-order lazy FP and LP .

These and other related works encourage us to continue our investigation, aiming at finding and implementing more elaborated means of communica- tion among solvers, as well as trying their performance experimentally. Fu- ture planned work also includes modelling the declarative semantics of cooper- ation. The implementation described in this paper will be soon available (see http://toy.sourceforge.net).
