Controlled complementary measurements are key to quantum key distribution protocols, among many other things. We axiomatize controlled complementary measurements within symmetric monoidal categories, which provides them with a corresponding graphical calculus. We study the BB84 and Ekert91 protocols within this calculus, including the case where there is an intercept-resend attack.

Quantum cryptographic protocols such as BB84 and Ekert 91 [2,12] involve controlled complementary observables. While we do have graphical understanding of complementarity of two observables, as well as of controlled observables, in the latter the control space is an abstract one. Hence blending these two concepts into one is not straightforward. This is the main contribution of this paper: an axiomatization of controlled complementary measurements in the language of symmetric monoidal categories, and hence in terms of graphical calculus. This is done in Section 3. This enables us to give a concise presentation for the BB84 and Ekert 91 protocols. We prove the correctness of these, and analyze the case where there is an intercept- resend attack. This is done in Sections 4 and 5. First, in Section 2, we survey previous work on bases, complementarity, measurement, control and the classical- quantum distinction within graphical calculus.

We can now use the results of the previous section to translate these protocols into graphical language. Note that (ii) can be realized by means of a a-controlled unitary which applies the identity for ai = 0 and the Hadamard gate for ai = 1. By Proposition 2.6 it then follows that both protocols are highly related. We obtain for the procedures till (vii):
