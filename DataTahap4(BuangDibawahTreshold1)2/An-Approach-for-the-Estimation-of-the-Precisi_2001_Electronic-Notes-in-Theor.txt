In the following, we tackle the problem: having obtained a discretization of an object of R2, we try to recover the set of real objects generated by rigid trans- formations of the original one such that the discretization viewed as a set of Zn remains fixed. This problem comes from medical imaging. In the context of cancer therapy, the problem is to irradiate a tumor. Dosimetry techniques aim at computing the beam energy level which is necessary to damage the tumor at most. The beams must be concentrated on the tumor itself through the use of multi-leaves collimators which deform the beam into a shape similar to the

We can use the previous algorithm in order to solve this problem. In this case, the transformations applied to the borders would be the same ones : the transformation T . So, for each border [Si, S(i+1)%n] of the starting polygon, we compute the feasible region Ri and its parameters after the transformation T . Such transformed borders correspond to points (ai, bi) in the A-B parameters space. So, the transformation T is valid if and only if each point (ai, bi) is in Ri.

A direct extension could be to extend these results to general curves. One way to do this is to approach the curve interiorly and exteriorly by two polyg- onal lines. Finally, we could try to study the case of 3D real object and in particular of polyhedral ones.
