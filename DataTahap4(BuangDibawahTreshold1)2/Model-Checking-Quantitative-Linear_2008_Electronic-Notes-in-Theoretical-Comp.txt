However, the analysis within these frameworks is still Boolean: either a timed automaton satisfies a property or not; two hybrid automata are either bisimilar or they are not. A Boolean approach to quantitative system analysis suffers from the drawback of being fragile: small perturbations in the values within the system description may lead to opposite truth values for the satisfaction of a property. This is problematic, since the system values are usually only known approximately, because they are often obtained by measurement, learning or educated guesses.

Organization of the paper. In Section 2, we briefly recall some theory on au- tomata over infinite words. Section 3 introduces QTS and QMC models, Section 4 presents the logic QLtl, while Section 5 treats our model checking algorithms. Then, we present in Section 6 several extensions to the theory and in Section 7 some conclusions.

Theorem 2.1 was first stated in [22], where a doubly exponential construction was provided. This construction was improved in [24], where a singly exponential, with an almost linear exponent, construction was provided: if A has n states, then A' has 2O(n log n) states and O(n) pairs in its acceptance condition.

A Quantitative Markov Decision Process (QMDP) is a Markov decision process (MDP) with quantitative values in the states. Thus, a QMDP can be viewed as a QMC combined with nondeterminism, i.e. each QMDP state enables one or more transitions whose target state is determined probabilistically. Formally, a QMDP
