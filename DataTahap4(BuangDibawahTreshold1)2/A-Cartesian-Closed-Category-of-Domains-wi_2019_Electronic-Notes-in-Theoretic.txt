In 2006, G. Hamrin and V. Stoltenberg-Hansen [6] investigated a class of special continuous domains, within which each domain has an almost algebraic basis. An inspiration for the notion of an almost algebraic basis is due to [17]. In that paper a

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some notions and def- initions we need. Section 3 discusses the properties of almost algebraic domains. Section 4 investigates the properties of continuous L-domains endowed with count- able, almost algebraic and M-closed bases and the function spaces among them. Section 5 gives a cartesian closed category of continuous L-domains with almost algebraic bases.

Since the class of continuous (resp. algebraic) L-domains is also closed under finite cartesian products, the above lemma, whose complete proof appears in [8, 9], shows that the category of continuous (resp. algebraic) L-domains with continuous functions is cartesian closed. Moreover, it is one of the maximal cartesian closed subcategory of continuous domains.
