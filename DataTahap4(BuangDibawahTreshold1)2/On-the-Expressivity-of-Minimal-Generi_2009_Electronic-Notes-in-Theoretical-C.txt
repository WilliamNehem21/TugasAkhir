Without any structural rule on the generic context, this often seems too restric- tive. The design of the induction rule also turns out to be problematic. In the end, the interplay of minimal generic quantification and fixed points in LINC lacks in expressivity. Theorems which should intuitively hold are underivable, e.g.,

It currently provides little automation, incarnated by the tactic prove which performs a focused proof-search. It treats fixed points as described in [3] but is still not able to infer invariants, and is thus limited to unfoldings. Ongoing work in that direction promises much more automation in these simple developments. In particular, instances of all properties proved in this paper would actually be established automatically by simple heuristics: in our proofs, when we build a derivation using the induction rule, the invariant can be infered from the conclusion. Bureaucratic lemmas such as strengthening of generic quantification, but also more subtle things, detailed in the next example, would not be a burden for the user anymore: the cost of having a minimal generic quantification would vanish.

This formulation implies new branches compared to the usual proof. However they are trivially treated, and overall the proof is not more complex than with more traditional notions of contexts. Moreover, the resulting theorem is also slightly stronger than the usual one, as it allows richer contexts.
