Therefore, we will work with the smallest category making the diagrams of S commute. This is obtained by quotienting the morphisms Cat(S)1 of the free category Cat(S) generated by the sketch graph G (described in [10]) under the diagrams of S, which is possible thanks to prop 2.2.

An analogous reflection can be proved also for finite decidable lex-sketches internal to an arithmetic universe by building more complicated trees. Cer- tainly, we can investigate the existence of the reflection for a wider class of finite product sketches within an arithmetic universe or variations of it. We think that within a locally closed arithmetic universe the reflection should hold for generic internal finite product sketches, since in this paper the property of decidable finiteness of the sketch was essentially used just to quantify over a subset of sketch arrows.
