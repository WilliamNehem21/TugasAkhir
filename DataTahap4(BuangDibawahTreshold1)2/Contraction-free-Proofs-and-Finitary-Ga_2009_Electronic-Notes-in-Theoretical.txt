This view leads to a consistent, but incomplete game model for LL with exponentials, which is finitary, in the sense that each play is finite. The game is based on a set of inference rules which does not enjoy cut elimination. Nevertheless, the cut rule is valid in the model.

where an edge between two notions of validity indicates that the target is a model of the source, and a negated edge in the other direction indicates that the model is not complete. We conjecture that the vertical negated edges may be rectified by passing to local strategies in the sense of [13]. However, the horizontal negated arrow cannot be rectified.

(This does not use contraction or cut.) For other cases, one just shows that a list of new hypotheses starting with ? do not hinder the derivation too much. This only adds weakenings and Exchange rules, but no cuts nor contractions.	 

On the left, the broken edge or formula is shown. It determines two subtrees, which are pictured as triangles, and named to emphasise the analogy with inference rules. In the initial position of the tensor move (third line), there are several triangles connected to the left-hand vertex v: they denote subtrees which have v as only vertex in common.

Call a position U strongly normalizable (sn for short) if, even if we add the above exotic move, all plays from U are finite. Why do we need a new move? We want to be sure that if a position is sn, so are all its subpositions, in the sense of subgraphs. And the problem with this is that, although most moves on a subposition come from a move on the full position, this is not the case for a 1-move. Indeed, consider the bare 1-move

So we have a game for NLL. Let us now show that it defines a model of NLL (and hence of LL). The definition of (winning) strategies is exactly as in Section 3, thanks to Theorem 5.1. As in Section 3, we put:
