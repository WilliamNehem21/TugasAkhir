Proof. The abstraction theorem is proved by induction on derivations. In each cases, proving the statement (a) is straightforward. Since the treatment of other rules is now standard, we only deal here with the rules concerning identity types. Even though we do not detailed it here, the treatment of conversion uses previous lemma.

As explained in [2] (Section 5.4), the parametricity translation extends well to inductive families. The idea is to translate an inductive type I by a new inductive IR whose constructors are the translation of constructors of I. Likewise, the elimination scheme for IR is the translation of the one of I.
