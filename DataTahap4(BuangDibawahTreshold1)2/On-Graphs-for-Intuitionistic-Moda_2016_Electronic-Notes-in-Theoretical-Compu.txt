We present a graph approach to intuitionistic modal logics, which provides uniform formalisms for express- ing, analysing and comparing Kripke-like semantics. This approach uses the flexibility of graph calculi to express directly and intuitively possible-world semantics for intuitionistic modal logics. We illustrate the benefits of these ideas by applying them to some familiar cases of intuitionistic multi-modal semantics.

We provide graph calculi, having diagrams as terms and whose rules transform diagrams, capturing graphically the semantics of the modal operators and accessi- bility relations. These calculi provide uniform and flexible formalisms where one can explore Kripe-like semantics for intuitionistic modal logics: satisfaction conditions, valid formulas, etc. We illustrate these ideas by 2 case studies: logics as in [13,5].
