We start with a characterization of syntactical nets, used to represent the syntax of a language of terms with binders. Syntactical nets are essentially syntax trees with backpointers that associate bound variables with their corresponding binding constructors. In the following, this class of nets will be defined as the image of a translation function from terms to interaction nets.

We end the section with a note on the encoding of recursion. There is scope in the definition of token-passing nets for recursive constructs. These may be handled either by computation rules that re-introduce an occurrence of the syntactic symbol in the right-hand side, or by canonical rules. The former approach can be used for recursion patterns such as iterators or recursors, which perform pattern-matching on their argument [1]. The latter approach is explored in the next section to encode a general binding recursion operator.
