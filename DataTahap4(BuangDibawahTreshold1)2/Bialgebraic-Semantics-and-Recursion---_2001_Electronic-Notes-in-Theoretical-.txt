One can model bisimulation by spans of coalgebra maps (first done in [3]). With this, under mild conditions, one has that the semantics given by the final coalgebra is fully abstract and that there is a greatest bisimulation which is a congruence. These conditions are that kernel pairs exist and that weak kernel pairs are preserved by B.

One can instead develop a general theory for locally ordered categories (better: CPPO-enriched ones). One can define simulations (or ordered bisim- ulations) as spans of laxand and oplaxcoalgebra maps; it is shown in [4] that these include partial bisimulations [1] (also known as prebisimulations). There is then a new version of the general theory but now with the conditions that insertors exist and that weak insertors are preserved. Unfortunately, the weak preservation condition fails.

As regards possible further developments, one evident possibility for future work is to combine recursion and value-passing (e.g. as in the work of [6]). More immediately it would be good to treat other examples than GSOS. In particular probabilistic computation presents a challenge with its need for continuous domain theory.
