The original motivation behind the introduction of the interaction combinators was indeed the definition of a simple universal interaction net system, i.e., a system capable of simulating all other interaction net systems. The universality of the combinators, which automatically entails their Turing-completeness, together with their extreme simplicity and elegance, are in our opinion enough to justify the interest of studying this system as an autonomous computational model, ignoring its relationship to general interaction nets.

Wires can have one or both of their extremities not connected to any cell, in which case the net has a free port, principal or auxiliary (or neither) depending on the nature of the port of the cell connected to the other extremity of the wire. The net above has for example 7 free ports, of which 1 is principal and 4 are auxiliary. The free ports of a net are referred to as its interface.

The reader acquainted to the Geometry of Interaction (GoI) may see that well- foundedness is indeed a stronger version of nilpotency [4,7]. In the GoI semantics, fewer straight paths are taken into consideration, namely those that have a non-null weight in the dynamic algebra, or regular paths in Danos-Regnier terminology. It is possible to show that well-foundedness formulated in terms of maximal regular paths, i.e., finiteness of regular paths, becomes also a necessary condition for a net to be total, and thus nilpotency characterizes total nets.
