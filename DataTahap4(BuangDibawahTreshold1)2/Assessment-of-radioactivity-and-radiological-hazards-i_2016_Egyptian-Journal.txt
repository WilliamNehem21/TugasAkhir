Ceramic tiles are generally preferred for indoor finishing due to their ornamental properties along with their relatively cheap cost. Ceramic tiles may be glazed or unglazed. Zircon is a common opacifying constituent of glazes applied to ceramic tiles and is also used as an opacifier in porcelain tiles by in- corporating it directly into the mixture used for forming the body of the tile. All zircon sand contains radionuclides of natural origin, primarily those in the uranium and thorium decay series. Although the concentrations of these radionuclides are low, they are significantly higher than those in normal rocks and soil. Due to the presence of zircon in the glaze, ceramic tiles can show elevated concentration of natural radioactivity [1,3,4]. The fact that ceramic tiles are fundamentally building mate- rials, an assessment of their radiological impact on members of the public is necessary with emphasis on gamma radia- tion and inhalation of radon released from the product as the main exposure pathways [1].

strong to very strong correlation range. 40K has a very high cor- relation with all other variables except 232Th where it has a weak correlation. The high positive correlation coefficient ob- served between 232Th and 238U is due to the fact that radium and thorium decay series occur together in nature [27].
