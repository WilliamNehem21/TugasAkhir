sues. The histopathological analysis confirmed these results. All the previous alterations in the liver and kidney could be ameliorated when BPA-treated rats were co-administrated either with GBE, mela- tonin or their combination. These natural substances could exhibit protective effects against BPA- induced hepato- and nephrotoxicity owing to their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potentials.

Bisphenol A (2,2-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) propane, (BPA) is an environmental chemical contaminant that is widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins [1]. Also, BPA is used in the production of thermal stabilizers, plasticides, paints and dental materials [2]. Human extensive exposure to BPA through the food chain is widespread because BPA is released by food and beverage containers [3]. High doses of BPA altered liver weights and decreased the viability of rat hepatocytes [4]. BPA is a nephrotoxic agent due to the accumulation of its toxic metabolites and inability of the kidney to eliminate those metabo- lites [5]. Also, BPA induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause tissue injury in the liver, kidney and other organs [6]. Furthermore, the low doses of BPA generate ROS by means of decreasing the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and increasing lipid peroxidation thereby causing oxidative stress [7]. Nowadays, natural supplements are used in the treatment of

Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE) is one of the most widely used herbal supplements in the traditional Chinese medicine for cen- turies [9]. Several investigators reported that G. biloba polysaccha- rides (GBP) have different biological actions, such as anti- oxidation, anti-inflammation, immunomodulation and anti-tumor [10]. It could protect the liver from an induced injury by means of reducing lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion concomitant with enhancing gene expression of the antioxidant enzymes [11]

Melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine) is natural hormone secreted mainly from the pineal gland [3]. Also, other organs such as eyes, brain, gut, skin and immune cells can synthesize melatonin [14]. Melatonin is also synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract [15]. Melatonin participates in the regulation of many physiologi- cal processes. Melatonin can reduce oxidative stress via stimulat- ing the activities of the anti-oxidative enzymes; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) [16]. Addi-

Livers and kidneys were excised and washed using saline solu- tion (0.9%). Parts from the livers and kidneys of each group were fixed in 10% formalin for histological examination. Other parts were minced and homogenized in ice-cold sodium phosphate buf- fer (0.01 M, pH 7.4) containing 1.15% KCl (10% w/v) using a poly-

Total plasma protein was determined using biuret reaction [23]. Urea and creatinine plasma levels were also measured [24] and [25], respectively. Plasma and hepatic Aspartate aminotransferase (AST; EC 2.6.1.1) activity was assayed [26]. While, plasma and hep- atic alanine aminotransferase (ALT; EC 2.6.1.2) activity was

This study was intended to examine the antioxidative effect of GBE and/or Mel against BPA-induced oxidative damage in the liver and kidney tissues of adult male rats. The present data showed that BPA caused significant increases in the plasma AST and ALT activ- ities indicating liver damage. These two enzymes are the most indicative markers of hepatocellular damage [37]. The enhanced activities of the plasma liver markers point out the cellular leakage and the loss of the functional integrity of membrane architecture [38]. The BPA-induced hepatotoxicity was ameliorated after the administration of Mel and/or GBE as indicated from the significant decreases in the hepatic activities of both AST and ALT as shown in. It was reported that GBE ameliorated the toxic effect of CCL4 [39]. Pre-treatment with Mel prior to thioacetamide induction in rats

TBARS, GSH, GST, CAT, SOD and GPx are important biomarkers of oxidative damage [41]. Our results indicated the increase in the level of TBARS and the decrease in the GSH level in the BPA- treated rats. The significant increase in the levels of hepatic TBARS was concomitant with significant decrease in the GSH level at a dose of 50 mg/kg BPA [42].

cantly attenuated the decreased level of GSH by BPA [43]. GSH is an essential intracellular hydrophilic antioxidant that participates in the catalytic cycles of many antioxidant enzymes such as glu- tathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S- transferase [44,45]. The decreases in the specific activities of GPx and SOD in the liver of BPA-treated rats were recorded [42]. Glu- tathione peroxidase catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide

from the attack of superoxide [47]. However, the treatments of the BPA-intoxicated rats with GBE and/or melatonin ameliorated the oxidative stress. Thus, the hepatic activities of SOD and GPx were significantly increased after GBE or Mel co-treatment with BPA. Previous findings indicated significant increases in the hepatic SOD and GPx activities after administration of either GBE or mela- tonin [48,45]. Our results showed significant increases in the activ-

enzymes in BPA + Mel-treated rats. Mel attenuated the hepatic increase in CAT induced by gamma-irradiation in adult male rats [53]. Regarding the BPA induction of renal toxicity, our study showed significant increase in the urea and creatinine levels in BPA-treated group. The accumulation of BPA-toxic metabolites and the inability of the kidney to eliminate them resulted in nephrotoxicity [54]. However, our study revealed that the treat- ment with BPA + GBE, BPA + Mel and BPA + GBE + Mel caused sig- nificant decrease in the urea and creatinine levels as compared with the BPA-treated group. These results are supported by previ- ous studies that showed the ameliorative role of GBE against nephrotoxicity [56]. Also, Mel prohibited acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity in adult male rats [55]. Our study revealed that

In conclusion, the wide use of BPA in the different plasticizers and other industries has a hazard effects on human today. Thus, we should limit the consumption of its products. GBE and Mel were observed as potent natural antioxidants. Owing to their antioxidant capacities; GBE, Mel and their combination exhibited protective effect on liver and kidney tissues against BPA-induced injury in rats. They could restore the liver and kidney functions, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants to control values. They also attenuated the lipid peroxidation and the proinflammatory status in livers and kidneys which was evidently appeared in the histopathological investigations. Thus, consumption of GBE and Mel could introduce health benefits to human against the hazards of BPA.

H2O and O2 [49]. However, the renal activities of GST, SOD and CAT were significantly increased in BPA + GBE-treated group com- pared to BPA-treated one. There was an increase in the renal SOD activity when adult male rats were administered with GBE plus gentamycin compared with gentamycin-administration [56]. Also, the current study showed that there were significant increases in the activities of the renal GST, SOD and CAT in the BPA + Mel- treated group compared with BPA-treated one. Furthermore, it has been indicated that these renal antioxidant enzymes were sig- nificantly increased in CCl4 plus melatonin treated-rats [57].
