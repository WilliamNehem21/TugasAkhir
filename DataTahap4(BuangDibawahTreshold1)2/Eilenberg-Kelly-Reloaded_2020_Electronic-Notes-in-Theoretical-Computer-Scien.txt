Example 3.4 Given a left-skew closed category (C, I, () and a comonad D on C that is closed, i.e., lax closed with e, c natural isomorphisms (just e being invertible suffices for our purposes). Let B D( C = DB ( C as in Example 2.7. Then the left-skew closed category (C, I, D() is right-normal if (C, I, () is right-normal with

Example 3.5 Given a left-skew closed category (C, I, () and a monad T on C that is lax closed. This is the same as T being left-strong and right-strong with the the left-strength cst and the right-strength cstR making a bi-strength and commuting. Let B (T C = B ( T C as in Example 2.8. Because T is left-strong, we have that (Kl(T ), I, (T ) is left-skew closed. Now, if (C, I, () happens to be left-normal,

Example 4.7 In Example 3.5, we assumed a closed category (C, I, () with a lax closed monad (T, c) and tried to establish that the left-skew closed category (Kl(T ), I, (T ) where B (T C = B ( T C was normal. This did not work out.

Example 4.14 Given a skew bi-closed category (C, I, (L, (R) and a monad T on it. Then T is left-strong wrt. (L if and only if it is right-strong wrt. (R: there is a bijection between the left-strengths cst and the right-strengths cstR:
