DPPH free radical activity. All different concentra- tions of the tested chemical compounds under study have been dissolved in methanol to obtain final concentration ranging from 6.25 to 200 mg/ml to show IC50 (concentration makes 50% inhibition of DPPH colour). Fifty microlitres of different sample concentrations was added to 5 ml of 0.004% methanolic solu- tion of DPPH. We let the solution dry for 60 min in the dark then the absorbance was recorded vs a blank at 517 nm.

We performed cluster calculations by DMOL3 program [20] in Ma- terials Studio program [21], which was designed for large scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT semi-core pseudo pods determinations (dspp) have been shown with the double numerical basis sets plus polarization (DNP) func- tional. The DNP basis sets are of comparable quality to 6-31G Gaussian basis sets [22]. Kessi and Delley assumed that the DNP basis sets are highly more accurate than Gaussian basis sets of the same size [23]. The RPBE functional [24] is so far the best exchange-correlation functional [25], based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), employed to take account of the exchange and correlation effects of electrons. The geometric op- timization was shown without any symmetry restriction.

The lower values of HOMO energy show that mol- ecules donating electron ability are weaker. On the contrary, a higher energy of HOMO implies that it is a good electron donor. LUMO energy showed that the mol- ecule can receive electron.

coordination. But, in the 1H NMR spectrum of Hg(II) complex of H2TAET, the signal attributed to (NH)b proton disappeared with the presence of signal at 10.49 due to SH group. Also, the shift of the signal owing to thiazole proton supports the co-
