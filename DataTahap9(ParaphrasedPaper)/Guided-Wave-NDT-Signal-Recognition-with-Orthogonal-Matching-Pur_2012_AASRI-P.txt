The goal of this research is to break down and create guided wave non-destructive testing (NDT) signals using orthogonal matching pursuit with a modified evolutionary programming algorithm based on the t distribution (MTEP). This algorithm is designed to decrease computational complexity. The study involves inspecting a pipe sample with holes using guided waves, and then processing the test signal with OMP using MTEP. The resulting output is compared with OMP using an evolutionary programming algorithm based on the t distribution (TEP). The findings indicate that this enhanced method can reconstruct the signal with superior quality, reduced computation time, and improved recognition of echo signals. As a result, the proposed approach is beneficial for recognizing guided wave NDT signals.

Ultrasonic guided waves are capable of traveling long distances and detecting defects across an entire wall under non-contact conditions, making them valuable for NDT in pipes. Due to the dispersed and multi-modal nature of guided waves, it is crucial to develop efficient methods for recognizing these NDT signals. Matching pursuit (MP) has been utilized in signal processing for ultrasonic, radar, and guided wave applications, as well as for fuzzy clustering and classification of signals. However, implementing MP numerically is challenging due to the large number of iterations required for inner product calculations between the signal and matching atoms. Evolutionary programming (EP), developed by L. Fogel and D. B. Fogel, is a global optimization algorithm that explores multiple paths simultaneously to optimize objective functions. In this study, a modified EP algorithm employing mutations based on the t probability distribution and chirplet function as matching atoms is utilized for orthogonal matching pursuit. This allows for the recognition of echo signals in guided wave test signals from a pipe sample with holes, while representing the features of guided waves through the matching parameters.

OMP operates similarly to MP in its choice of matching atoms but requires an orthogonal operation on these chosen atoms based on the Gram-Schmidt rules. Subsequently, a projection to the space spanned by the selected atoms and the weight of the signal and its residual can be obtained. This process is repeated for the residual until a specified halt criterion is met.

The study proposes a modified evolutionary programming algorithm using mutations based on the t distribution and applies it to orthogonal matching pursuit. After processing guided wave signals from a pipe sample with holes using OMP with MTEP, the resulting output is compared to OMP with TEP, demonstrating that the improved method can produce a signal with enhanced quality, reduced computation time, and improved recognition of defect echoes. Consequently, the proposed approach proves valuable for recognizing guided wave NDT signals.
