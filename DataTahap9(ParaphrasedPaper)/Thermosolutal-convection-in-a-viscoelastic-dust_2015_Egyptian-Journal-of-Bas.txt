The study examines the behavior of an incompressible fluid layer of Oldroydian viscoelastic fluid heated and soluted from the bottom in the presence of suspended particles and a uniform vertical magnetic field, with a focus on incorporating the influence of Hall currents in a porous medium. Utilizing linearized stability theory and normal mode analysis, the dispersion relation is derived. It is found that, under stationary convection, the Oldroydian viscoelastic fluid exhibits similar behavior to an ordinary Newtonian fluid. Additionally, the study reveals that dust particles and Hall currents both contribute to the destabilization of thermosolutal convection, whereas the presence of a magnetic field stabilizes the thermosolutal convection. Furthermore, the medium's permeability shows both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on thermosolutal convection under specific conditions. Graphs are presented to illustrate the stability characteristics based on numerical parameter values, and the case of overstability is also investigated.

Previous research has demonstrated that a dilute solution of methyl methacrylate in n-butyl acetate aligns with the theoretical model of the Oldroyd fluid, and the thermal instability in a viscoelastic fluid layer in hydromagnetics has been studied. Additionally, the effect of a magnetic field on thermosolutal instability of an Oldroydian viscoelastic fluid in a porous medium has been considered, with findings indicating the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field and the dual effect of medium permeability.

The Boussinesq approximation is commonly employed in thermal and thermosolutal convection problems involving incompressible fluids, and the stabilizing effect of a magnetic field on instability is well recognized. Furthermore, a numerical study of hydromagnetic thermal convection in a viscoelastic dusty fluid in a porous medium is discussed, and it is noted that the Hall effect is likely to be significant in various geophysical scenarios and laboratory plasma flow.

The growing importance of non-Newtonian fluids in chemical technology, industry, and geophysical fluid dynamics is underscored, along with the relevance and significance of Hall currents in geophysics, MHD generators, and industry. Previous studies have also examined the instability of Oldroydian viscous fluids in porous media, with external influences such as magnetic fields and/or rotation taken into account. However, the impact of Hall currents has been largely overlooked in previous investigations involving Oldroydian viscoelastic dusty fluids in porous media. Consequently, this study aims to address this gap by examining the effect of thermosolutal convection in an Oldroydian viscoelastic dusty fluid in the presence of Hall currents in a porous medium.
