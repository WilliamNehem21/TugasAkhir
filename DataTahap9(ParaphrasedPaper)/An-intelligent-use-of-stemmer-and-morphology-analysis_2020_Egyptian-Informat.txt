The increased use of Arabic text in web and social media networks has led to a growing interest in Arabic information retrieval. This paper presents a novel approach for Arabic stemming, referred to as Arabic Morphology Information Retrieval (AMIR). This approach involves applying a set of rules relating to the relationship among Arabic letters to identify the root or stem of words used as indexing terms in Arabic retrieval systems. The paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed algorithm by highlighting its benefits for various Arabic information retrieval systems. Additionally, the AMIR system's performance is evaluated by comparing it with the Lucene, Farasa, and nostemmer systems in terms of mean average precisions. The results show that AMIR achieved a mean average precision of 0.34%, outperforming Lucene (0.27%), Farasa (0.28%), and nostemmer (0.21%).

Arabic words are constructed based on abstract forms known as roots, which serve as the basis for generating other derivatives through the addition of suffixes or affixes to the root. The Arabic language is highly inflectional, with trilateral roots used to derive the majority of its words. Unlike other languages such as English and French, Arabic stems differ, and Arabic nouns can take various forms based on factors such as plurality, gender, and grammatical tense. Stemming is a technique used to reduce words to their respective stems or roots, but existing Arabic stemmers are prone to high error rates.

While significant work has been done on Arabic information retrieval, weaknesses persist due to a lack of emphasis on lemmatization and over-reliance on morphological and stemming analysis. This paper discusses recent advancements in stemming and morphological analysis and their impact on Arabic document retrieval.

The paper addresses the limitations of existing stemmers and proposes a method aimed at producing superior results by incorporating the use of infixes in addition to suffixes and prefixes. Many Arabic words contain infixes, but existing methods are unable to extract the root of words with infixes. Additionally, the proposed method focuses on the derivational structures of Arabic and removes inflectional elements.

In summary, this paper aims to enhance Arabic root extraction and improve the effectiveness of Arabic information retrieval systems. The proposed method has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing stemmers, as evidenced by the experimental comparison with Lucene, Farasa, and nostem methods.
