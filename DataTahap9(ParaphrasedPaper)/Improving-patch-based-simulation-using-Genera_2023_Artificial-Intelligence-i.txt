The method of multiple-point simulation (MPS) is a commonly used geostatistical technique for modeling complex geological patterns and subsurface heterogeneity. Within MPS, there are various implementation methods, with patch-based simulation being a more recently developed class. However, despite recent progress in patch-based algorithms, they still face two main challenges: conditioning to point data and the occurrence of verbatim copy. These challenges are partly due to the finite size of the training image, from which a limited pattern database is constructed. In response to these challenges, we propose a new approach called generative-patched-simulation (GPSIM), which is based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). This approach aims to address the issues of conditioning to point data and to reduce the occurrence of verbatim copy, ultimately improving patch-based simulation methods.

The first challenge, conditioning to point data, involves the difficulty of ensuring that candidate patches from the training image (TI) match hard data exactly. This problem arises when there are dense hard data within the data event. The second challenge, the occurrence of verbatim copy, refers to the exact reproduction of portions of the training image onto the simulation grid, resulting in reduced variability between realizations and hindering the modeling of spatial uncertainty.

To address these challenges, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating new patches. GAN consists of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through an adversarial process. By using GAN, we aim to generate a larger number of new patches to enrich the pattern database and improve the variability between realizations.

Our approach builds on the work of Rezaee et al. (2015), who also aimed to enrich the pattern database by generating independent realizations from the original training image. However, our focus is on improving the performance of existing patch-based methods using GAN, rather than describing all implementation methods. We emphasize the quantitative comparison of realizations created from the enriched patch database with those produced from the original patches, based on two criteria: variability between generated realizations (representing spatial uncertainty) and variability within the realizations (depicting the reproduction of statistics from the training image).

The comparison of the realizations is conducted using a distance function, which provides a measure of similarity between images. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach shows potential in addressing the challenges of conditioning to point data and reducing the occurrence of verbatim copy, thereby improving patch-based simulation methods.
