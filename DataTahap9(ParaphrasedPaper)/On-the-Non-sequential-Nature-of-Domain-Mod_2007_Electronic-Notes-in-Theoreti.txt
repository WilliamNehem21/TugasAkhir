We define a function to be locally constant at a point if it remains constant within a certain neighborhood of that point. For a given property p and a point y, we say that p(y') holds for a point y' as close to y as desired if, for every neighborhood v of y, there exists a point y' such that p(y') holds. It is important to remember that a space is locally connected if every point has a neighborhood base consisting of connected sets.
