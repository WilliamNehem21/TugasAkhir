This paper introduces an improved operation for a custom power park featuring a newly proposed control algorithm for a series active filter. The custom power park serves multiple customers in an industrial area and provides a high-quality, reliable power supply at different levels, outperforming utility-supplied power. The enhanced operation is achieved through the use of GTO-based static transfer switches, shunt and series active filters. The shunt active filter offers harmonic and reactive power support, while the series active filter mitigates voltage sag/swell and voltage harmonic issues using the newly proposed control algorithm. The entire model of the custom power park is developed and its operation is validated using a MATLAB/Simulink model.

In many scenarios, it is often impractical to provide power at different levels and tariffs. In such cases, a custom power park (CPP) can be established and operated to supply different grades of power to various customers. The different power grades are made possible by integrating different devices in the park, as elaborated in subsequent sections.

The series active filter (SEAF) plays a crucial role in providing voltage support and eliminating voltage harmonics for the AAA loads. When the voltage of both feeders falls below 90% of the nominal voltage, the SEAF provides essential voltage support. Additionally, it can absorb excess voltage if the voltage levels increase, up to 10% of overvoltages. Furthermore, the SEAF is capable of providing 100% voltage support when both feeder voltages drop below 60%, as well as during the startup delay of the distributed generation (DG), ensuring the SEAF can support the entire AAA loads for 3 to 5 seconds.

In the event of failure of both the primary and alternate power sources, the DG/RES is required to provide power for AA and AAA loads. Typically, the DG/RES takes some time to start up and complete synchronization, which can be addressed by using renewable power supplied to the loads through voltage/current source inverters, achieving minimal or no delay. Additionally, the DG turn-on and readiness checking capabilities, and the speed of operation (isolation and switching) are influenced by the voltage detection scheme employed. The ABC-to-DQ0 transformation method is used to detect voltage, involving the conversion of measured voltage to the DQ0 axis with the transformation technique, followed by filtering to attenuate voltage transients and then transmitted to the CPP main controller for conditional checking.

In a specific scenario described, the voltage dropped to 70%, resulting in low voltage for A and AA loads, but the AAA loads were maintained at nominal voltage due to support from the series active filter. At 0.125 seconds, the voltage increased to 120%, with the AAA loads unaffected and receiving nominal voltage. At 0.2 seconds, harmonics were injected into the system voltage, yet the operation of the AAA loads remained unaffected, demonstrating the voltage harmonic compensation capability of the series active filter, making the AAA loads resilient to feeder voltage issues.
