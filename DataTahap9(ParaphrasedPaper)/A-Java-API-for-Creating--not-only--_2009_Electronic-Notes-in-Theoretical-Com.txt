This paper introduces a Java API for creating animation content with AnimalScript as the primary output. The API is designed to be easily extended to support other notations or languages, making it useful for a wide range of AV content generators, including those that do not use the Animal AV system. This paper offers more detailed information about the API compared to a previous report in German, including an informal evaluation and usage. 

Section 3 presents the design for the Java API, along with an example animation generated using the API. Sections 5 and 6 provide a brief informal evaluation and discuss extending the API to other notations, respectively. The paper concludes in section 7 with a summary of the work and potential areas for future research.

The API supports various graphical objects and relevant data structures commonly used in computer science. Furthermore, it enables the easy creation of objects with a single method invocation. Visual settings can be defined once and reused multiple times, similar to cascading style sheets, streamlining the creation of visual attributes for objects.

Animating objects created using the API is straightforward, and extending the API to support other output languages involves creating a new Java package and implementing a base factory for the new language. In the case of the AnimalScript language, the implementation consists of 30 Java classes, totaling 6,336 lines, with the largest class being the base factory class containing approximately 900 lines, of which less than 300 lines consist of actual code.
