Recent advancements in shallow methods have shown promising results in addressing variations in face images. Pinto et al. introduced V1-like features comprising a population of Gabor filters, which are robust to changes in view, lighting, and other image variations. Cao et al. proposed feature sets that encode local face micro-structures into uniformly distributed discrete codes, striking a balance between discriminative power and invariance. Additionally, patterns of oriented edge magnitudes (POEM), a feature set proposed in previous research, and monogenic binary coding (MBC) have also demonstrated effectiveness in handling variations in face images.

Combining texture-based descriptors with other techniques has also been explored to address variations in pose and illumination. Accurate 3D shape modeling has been used to map images with varying poses to a full frontal view, resulting in discriminative models capable of handling aging, facial expressions, low light, and over-exposure. Fusion of learned and handcrafted features has shown improved performance on the FERET and LFW datasets.

Various techniques such as local binary patterns (LBP), magnitude accumulation, self-similarity calculation, and multi-scale log-Gabor filtering have been employed to extract discriminative features from face images. The Dense LBP (DLBP) and Multiscale Binary Coding Approach (MBCA) are among the techniques used in experiments, alongside parameter tuning specific to each application.

In addition, the Heterogeneous Autoencoders for Supervised Classification (HASC) method has been applied to capture both linear relations and nonlinear associations through covariance and entropy combined with mutual information. Further, rotation-invariant local binary patterns (RICLBP) have been utilized to preserve the structural information among binary patterns.

To address dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis (PCA) has been employed to map feature vectors into a smaller number of uncorrelated directions while preserving the global Euclidean structure.

Finally, the proposed system has been evaluated on the FERET and LFW benchmark databases, acknowledging the computational costs associated with preprocessing steps, descriptor extraction, and matching. The performance of the system has been assessed based on recognition rate in the FERET datasets and accuracy in the LFW dataset. The computational time of the feature transform, performed by PCA, has been noted to be negligible.
