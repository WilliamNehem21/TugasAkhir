Focusing attention on comonads that arise from comodels of Lawvere theories allows us to leverage the existing knowledge base of the latter. Specifically, we can discuss the sum and tensor product of theories, with the sum yielding the product of the induced comonads and the tensor product possessing the universal property. Moving forward, it would be valuable to characterize the comonads that stem from categories of comodels, particularly in the realm of sets. However, this seems to be a challenging task, and realistic objectives may involve seeking conditions on presentations, some of which are implied in Section 2. Additionally, we aim to further investigate examples and the significance of constructions that can be made on comonads by confining them to those generated by comodels.

Let "nat" signify the full subcategory of sets consisting of natural numbers, with one object for each natural number and maps representing all functions between such natural numbers. The category "nat" has finite coproducts given by the sum of natural numbers.

The primary category of comodels for us is exemplified by the concept of arrays, as examined in Section 4. Therefore, we will not extensively develop examples here, but to provide insight into the types of comonads covered, we present two examples.

Finally, in this section, we briefly outline the theoretical value derived from restricting from arbitrary comonads on sets to those comonads generated by comodels. We consider arrays as a prime example and find the relationship between global state and arrays inherently compelling. Furthermore, there is more that can be expounded on at an abstract, technical level.

It is worth noting that this process involves taking models of L in the category comod(L', C) rather than in C, and this lifting is not generally facilitated by a distributive law of comonads. Therefore, this appears to be a genuinely new construction in relation to comodels compared to the existing work on coalgebra. The significance of this has not yet been fully explored.
