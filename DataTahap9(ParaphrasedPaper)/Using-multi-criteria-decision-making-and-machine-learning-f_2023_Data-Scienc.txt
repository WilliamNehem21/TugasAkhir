The aim of this study is to investigate decision-making processes and machine learning techniques used in the evaluation and selection of football players, taking into account their physical, technical, tactical, and behavioral attributes, and how these processes impact managerial-financial and sporting performance. Player selection poses a significant challenge for clubs, as it involves the simultaneous evaluation of multiple criteria. Thus, the recruitment and team selection processes must consider a variety of sporting and financial factors. The study seeks to assess the key criteria used by decision-makers in team selection and to predict the influence of these choices on sports and financial performance. To achieve this goal, decision-making methods are examined for assisting in player recruitment and selection, and machine learning algorithms are considered for predicting the sporting and financial outcomes following player selection. The study also reviews relevant literature from academic journals, conference proceedings, and books related to sports management and decision-making.

These academic works aim to explore the main criteria and sub-criteria used in the selection of football players. The selection process involves various performance attributes, such as technical, physical, mental, and behavioral attributes, which have become more complex due to the availability of big data technologies. Specialized companies and official leagues provide extensive datasets for football analytics, leading to the emergence of multiple criteria for player selection. The study also presents various decision-making methods, such as the technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and data envelopment analysis (DEA), used to help decision-makers in selecting the best players for the team. Furthermore, a two-phase approach for player selection, combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and integer linear programming, is proposed and applied to a Turkish football club to demonstrate its effectiveness. Additionally, a data-driven framework called Playerank, based on a machine learning approach, is developed to assist professional football scouts in evaluating, ranking, and recommending football players.

The study underscores the complexity of selecting a team lineup for a competition, emphasizing the subjective nature of the process and the potential for decision-making approaches to provide more objective insights. The paper also provides recommendations for future research, including the incorporation of biometric and psychological data to further refine player performance predictions, the exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for increased transparency in selection decisions, and the extension of the proposed methodology to other sports contexts to broaden its applicability.
