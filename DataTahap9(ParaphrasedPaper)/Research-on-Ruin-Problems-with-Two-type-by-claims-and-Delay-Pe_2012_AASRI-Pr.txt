The paper discusses the surplus just before ruin and the deficit at ruin under different initial surplus scenarios. It also presents a recursive formula for the joint distribution when the initial surplus is zero, as well as the ruin probability of the risk model under this condition. Additionally, the paper offers a method to calculate the ruin probability when the initial surplus is nonzero.

Furthermore, the study introduces a new risk model that is relevant in practical settings, as it considers the possibility of two types of by-claims occurring in a car accident, such as bodily injury and property damage, with the potential for delays to the next time period.
