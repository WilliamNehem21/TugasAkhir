This academic paper introduces a method for automatically constructing inheritance hierarchies using a set-theoretical approach based on formal concept analysis. The resulting hierarchies are concept lattices, and the paper also discusses extending the approach to induce nonmonotonic inheritance networks. The main idea of formal concept analysis is utilized in this approach.

The paper presents a novel method for automatically acquiring lexical knowledge from unstructured data using formal concept analysis to extract the monotonic inheritance relationships inherent in the data. The approach has been successfully tested on English and German lemmas in the lexical database CELEX, yielding a hierarchy of derivational information. Despite potential increases in the number of nodes, the approach has been implemented to handle large quantities of information by representing it in an aoc-poset.

The automatic induction of nonmonotonic structures poses challenges as nonmonotonic relations are not as readily apparent in the data as monotonic ones. The set of possible representations using nonmonotonicity is much larger, and it requires decisions on information overwrite. Most approaches involve encoding regular or default cases in the upper area of a network, while subregular and exceptional information is placed below these nodes, with nodes inheriting regular properties unless overwritten by subregular or exceptional properties.

To model subregularities and exceptions, further default attribute sets can be attached to subnodes of the top node. Care must be taken to ensure the correct inheritance of attributes. Additionally, instead of focusing on valid implications, it is possible to consider partial implications, which are valid except for a specific set of exceptional objects.
