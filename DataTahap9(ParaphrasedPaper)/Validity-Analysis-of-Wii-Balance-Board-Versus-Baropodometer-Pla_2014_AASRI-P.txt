The freemed fm040(bp) incorporates passive plates made of resistive conductive rubber with gold-coated sensors. This platform is capable of operating at a sampling rate of up to 500 Hz, and its active area measures 40 cm x 40 cm. The proprietary software, freestep, controls the bp and enables various types of analysis and measurement, including static and dynamic analysis, postural and stabilometric analysis, and biomechanical analysis (such as gait analysis).

We selected this measure because it is recognized as a dependable and accurate indicator of standing balance control. Furthermore, given the predetermined trial period, the total center of pressure (COP) path length yielded results similar to the average COP velocity (path length divided by period).

In our study, we examined the validity of using the Wii Balance Board to assess balance levels typically evaluated using a baropodometer platform. To achieve our objectives, we compared the results from two balance tests: standing balance with open and closed eyes. The variable selected for comparison was the total COP path length, which serves as a reliable and valid measure of standing balance.
