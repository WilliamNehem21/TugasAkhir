This research introduces a novel method for detecting and categorizing obstacles in dynamic backgrounds. The obstacle detection relies on inverse perspective mapping and homography, while obstacle classification is based on a fuzzy neural network. Vanishing point estimation is achieved through feature extraction, and the method leverages the geometric relationships within the scene to facilitate obstacle detection. Additionally, a new fuzzy decision fusion method, incorporating fuzzy attribution, is described for obstacle detection and classification applications. The method is further enhanced by a fuzzy decision function that adjusts parameters using an autoadapted algorithm to improve classification accuracy. The study demonstrates that this approach yields improved classification results.

Additionally, the paper discusses forward collision warning systems, which utilize radar and laser sensors to detect impending collisions. Depending on the system, these warnings can range from notifying the driver to automatically applying partial or full braking to minimize impact. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States began evaluating the potential mandate of frontal collision warning systems and lane departure warning systems in 2009, and the European Commission considered the implementation of "collision mitigation by braking" systems in 2011. The mandatory installation of advanced emergency braking systems in commercial vehicles was scheduled for implementation in the European Union by November 2013 for new vehicle types and by November 2015 for all new vehicles.

Furthermore, the paper addresses the potential use of systems that utilize sensors to monitor a vehicle's proximity to the vehicle in front and take automatic emergency braking action when an imminent collision is detected. There is potential for such systems to expand their capabilities to address other types of accidents in the future, including pedestrian accidents and head-on collisions. Preliminary studies indicate that these systems could potentially prevent around 5,000 fatalities and 50,000 serious injuries annually in the EU. While technical challenges may delay widespread implementation, cost-benefit analyses are already feasible for these systems.

The paper also discusses the practicality and affordability of sensor-based solutions for obstacle detection, highlighting the role of video processing approaches in addressing this challenge. Specifically, the paper presents a comprehensive system for obstacle detection and classification in non-stationary settings using computer vision. The proposed obstacle detection method leverages motion parallax analysis and the computation of the homography of the road plane between successive images to detect obstacles within the scene.
