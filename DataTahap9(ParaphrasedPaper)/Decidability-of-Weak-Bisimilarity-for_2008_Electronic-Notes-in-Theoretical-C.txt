We have not discovered a way to expand upon the findings outlined in this paper that would eliminate our constraint to normed processes. If we can establish the unique decomposability theorem, we anticipate that the entire spectrum of bpa processes will be decidable. Nonetheless, we have not succeeded in proving this theorem to date.
