We demonstrate the application of information theory in quantitatively defining interference among variables in imperative programming languages. Specifically, we concentrate on analyzing the leakage of information from private variables to public ones in while language programs. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a quantitative analysis method for this language, which utilizes a use-definition graph to estimate the extent of information leakage into each variable.
