This paper presents the semi-formal semantics and a technique for run-time monitoring for tlcharts, a visual specification language that combines the intuitive appeal of non-deterministic Harel statecharts with formal specifications in linear-time metric temporal logic (LTL and MTL). The paper outlines an automata-theoretic semantics for non-deterministic statecharts with negation and state overlapping, as well as an extension for temporally annotated transitions to provide a simple automata-theoretic semantics for tlcharts. Additionally, it describes a run-time monitoring technique for tlcharts. The paper also discusses the use of metric temporal logic (MTL) for the verification of real-time systems, including its support for relative-time and real-time constraints and the extension of MTL with temporal logic with time series constraints (TLS) for specifying time-series properties.

Furthermore, the paper touches on the use of timed automata to extend non-deterministic automata with timed transitions, similar to the timeout event mechanism of Harel statecharts, and the importance of using MTL conditions in tlcharts. It also mentions the use of lnint-e, a logic that enables statecharts to temporal logic transforms, and highlights the similarities and differences between this logic and tlcharts.

In addition, the paper provides a detailed example of a session specification, including conditions for keypress sensing, alarm triggering, and the end condition. It also discusses the role of default states in tlcharts, defines the concept of a pc store, and explains how tlcharts are used and applied as a temporal logic specification rather than a token-by-token reaction of a system to environmental stimuli.

Finally, the paper mentions the potential extension of tlcharts notation to support regular expressions and a tool under development by Time Rover, Inc., that will support both temporal logic and regular expression conditions within tlchart diagrams.
