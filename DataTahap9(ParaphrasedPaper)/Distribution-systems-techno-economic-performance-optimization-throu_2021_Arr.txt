The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) draws inspiration from the foraging behavior of humpback whales, known for their strategic hunting of small fish near the sea surface using a technique called bubble net feeding. In WOA, the whale's movement is simulated through a selection of either the shrinking encircling system or the spiral system, which determines the optimization problem vectors, such as location, size, and operating power factor. The best potential solution in WOA represents the target prey, and other search agents adjust their positioning accordingly. The simulation involves three stages: encircling prey, spiral bubble-net feeding, and scanning for food sources.

Seyedali M. et al. introduced the Multiverse Optimization (MVO) model, based on the concept of the big bang and the existence of multiple universes. The MVO numerical model incorporates the use of wormholes as a means of exchanging objects between universes or different parts of the same universe. This process involves constructing white/black tunnels at normal inflation levels using the roulette wheels method, with inflation rates determined by traveling distance rate (d) and wormhole existence probability (WP).

In the study of distribution systems, stability is a critical factor, particularly in light of changes in power generation which can impact voltage stability. The IEEE 118-bus power system, consisting of 118-bus, 54 generators, and 186 branches with a predominant active and reactive load, is chosen for the study to showcase the applicability of proposed techniques to larger systems.

The study evaluates the performance of three optimization algorithms (WOA, MVO, and SCA) in determining the mix of DG types and optimal operating power factors for various case studies. Results demonstrate that MVO yields optimal outcomes in terms of objective function (O.F) value across the three networks examined, with similarities observed between the results obtained from different algorithms in specific case scenarios.
