The pagoda system is a modular architecture designed for creating and testing autonomous systems. Each pagoda node, or agent, interacts with its environment by sensing and acting in accordance with its goals and policies. A pagoda system consists of multiple nodes working together towards a common objective.

The ultimate goal of the pagoda project is to develop techniques for specifying and analyzing autonomous systems that leverage the modularity and declarative nature of policy- and goal-based systems. This approach is based on the reflective Russian dolls (RRD) model, which in turn is built on the rewriting logic formal modeling framework. The current paper presents a significant case study demonstrating the advantages of policy-based coordination for designing and reasoning with modularity.

Policies within the pagoda system constrain the actions and interactions of nodes. They can limit choices for setting parameters, manage trade-offs between different factors, or control the aggregation and abstraction of information used by nodes or communicated to other agents.

The architecture allows for easy integration of different component instances, enabling nodes to interact with each other based on component type rather than instance identity. This facilitates the use of various reasoning, knowledge, and learning components by simply modifying the coordinator policy to select the appropriate component instances for different situations or goals.

Furthermore, the pagoda architecture can accommodate additional component types, such as those responsible for knowledge abstraction or aggregation. These components can be invoked by the coordinator to infer higher-level information from sensor data or information received from peers.

The paper also introduces message handling mechanisms within the pagoda system, including rules for message delivery and policies for different types of messages such as goal messages, set messages, and sense messages. The use of "wait4" patterns is described, which allows messages to be processed only when they are expected, based on predefined patterns.

In the context of ad hoc wireless radio networks, the pagoda system is being used to develop methods for specifying distributed coordinators. Here, policies determine the controlled dissemination of information and the distributed management of resources such as bandwidth, energy, and data storage. The mobile unity language is utilized to provide coordination primitives and logic for reasoning about mobile unity specifications.

In conclusion, the pagoda system provides a flexible and modular framework for specifying and prototyping autonomous systems, with a focus on policy- and goal-based coordination and reasoning.
