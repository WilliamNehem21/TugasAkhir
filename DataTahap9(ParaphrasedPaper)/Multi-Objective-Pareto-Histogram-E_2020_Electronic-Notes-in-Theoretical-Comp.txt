These algorithms with a posteriori preference are favored because they handle the objective functions independently, maximizing or minimizing each one to obtain a set of compromise solutions known as the Pareto set. In this context, decision-makers select one or several solutions based on a compromise criterion between the objective functions. Among these algorithms, MOPSO-CLAHE is a notable method.

The speed-constrained multi-objective PSO (SMPSO) is a metaheuristic that enables the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to address multiobjective optimization problems. Coello et al. define a multi-objective optimization problem as the search for a decision vector that satisfies specific constraints and optimizes a vector of objective functions.

To assess the results of the Pareto set, the hypervolume measurement was utilized. This metric calculates the volume of the dominated region within the objective space with respect to a reference. The hypervolume metric is suited for evaluating the dominance of one Pareto front over another.

This paper provides a summary of the current image enhancement algorithms pertaining to histogram transformation, noting the limited use of multiobjective Pareto optimization. Furthermore, it introduces a multi-objective Pareto algorithm called MOPHE and presents its mathematical formulation. MOPHE was developed to enhance image contrast while avoiding excessive distortion, yielding a set of resulting solutions with compromise values for contrast, entropy, and similarity.
