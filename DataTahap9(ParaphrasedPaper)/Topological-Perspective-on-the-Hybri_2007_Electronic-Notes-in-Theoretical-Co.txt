The paper discusses the non-orthodox proof rules of hybrid logic in the context of topological semantics, which is more general than Kripke semantics. It investigates the soundness of the hybrid proof rule bg and demonstrates that it is not topologically sound. The authors also show that the bg rule characterizes topological spaces that can be represented as Kripke frames (i.e., Alexandroff spaces). Additionally, they provide a general topological completeness result for hybrid logics when the bg rule is dropped and only the name rule is kept, and they highlight some limitations of the topological expressive power of pure formulas. These results extend to neighborhood frames.

The paper acknowledges the importance of nonorthodox rules, or Gabbay-style rules, in obtaining completeness results for hybrid logics axiomatized by pure formulas. The authors express gratitude to individuals who provided comments and shared unpublished papers, as well as to those who presented the paper on their behalf at a workshop. They also note that the bg rule fails to preserve validity on many topological spaces, including the real line, and discuss variations of the rule inspired by their findings.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the admissibility of the name and bg rules in certain logics, and provides a result related to the axiomatizability of certain classes of spaces by hybrid logics. It also explores the generalization of the results to normal neighborhood semantics or Scott-Montague semantics, and discusses the possibility of adapting the completeness result to hybrid languages that lack the global modality.

Overall, the paper critically examines the topological semantics of hybrid logic and its implications for completeness results, as well as its connections to Kripke semantics.
