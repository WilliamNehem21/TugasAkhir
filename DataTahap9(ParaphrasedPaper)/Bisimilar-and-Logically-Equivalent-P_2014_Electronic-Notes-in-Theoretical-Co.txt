In this section, we introduce a concise process calculus for the pdl programs discussed in the preceding Section 2. We establish that two processes are bisimilar if and only if they share the same set of finite feasible runs with context, drawing inspiration from this approach.

In order to demonstrate soundness, it is imperative to establish the validity of each axiom within this framework of frames and to confirm that the inference rules also uphold this validity. The validity of axioms 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, as well as the inference rules, is well-established in the existing pdl literature [5, 16, 4]. Hereafter, we provide the proof for axiom 4.

An additional avenue for future research could involve ascertaining the precise complexity of the satisfiability problem for pdl+. While we are aware of the existing exptime-hardness resulting from pdl, we suspect that it may also be exptime-complete, akin to pdl. Consequently, we aim to provide an exptime algorithm for the satisfiability problem.
