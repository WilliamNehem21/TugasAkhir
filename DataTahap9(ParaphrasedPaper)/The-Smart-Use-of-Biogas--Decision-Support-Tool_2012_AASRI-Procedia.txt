The current utilization of fossil fuels is rapidly exhausting natural reserves, which form at a very slow pace over long periods of time. As a result, there is considerable research focus on developing renewable fuels to replace fossil fuels. Renewable fuels are environmentally sustainable and contribute significantly less to the greenhouse effect.

Biogas is a renewable fuel and energy source that can be utilized in a variety of applications. It is formed by the anaerobic fermentation of biomass by bacteria over a period of several days, a process that naturally occurs in oxygen-deprived environments such as swamps.

The primary sources of biogas from human activities include domestic garbage landfills, manure fermentation, and sewage treatment. Anaerobic fermentation of these waste products results in a greater reduction in waste volume compared to aerobic processes, making anaerobic fermentation the preferred method in the industry.

In an integrated scenario, the first step involves assessing the quality of the raw gas in terms of its methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide content. Subsequently, the role of SBDS (Sustainable Developmental Solutions) is to perform calculations at four different levels to determine the potential benefits and avoided carbon dioxide emissions: biogas treatment, treated biogas utilization, energy generation, and energy distribution. Energy recovered from biogas utilization typically includes heat and power. Additionally, consideration can be given to a fourth level involving the delivery of energy into the natural gas network, known as bio-methane. The final step is to present the output data along with graphical representations.
