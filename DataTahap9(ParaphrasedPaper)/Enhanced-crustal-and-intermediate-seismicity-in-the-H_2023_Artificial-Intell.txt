The Hindu Kush-Pamir region (HKPR) is known for its complex ongoing deformation, unique slab geometry, and intermediate seismic activity. Recent decades have seen a wealth of seismological data, leading to the application of deep learning algorithms to extract valuable insights. This study presents a fully automated approach to enhancing earthquake cataloging within the HKPR. Our method utilizes an attention mechanism-based deep learning architecture to detect events, perform phase picking, and identify faults in the western Pamir, as well as the Vakhsh thrust system and the Darvaz-Karakul fault. These findings highlight potential sources of future seismic hazards. Additionally, our expanded earthquake catalog contributes to a deeper understanding of the interaction between crustal and intermediate seismic activity in the HKPR, shedding light on deformation and active faulting resulting from Eurasian-Indian plate interactions.

In the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in recorded waveform data with numerous continuous seismic station networks distributed throughout the region. However, many low-magnitude and low signal-to-noise ratio earthquakes remain undetected. Detecting and locating these undetected earthquakes can significantly improve our understanding of regional tectonics and the unique geometry of the HKPR.

It is important to note that the process of earthquake detection differs from that of phase picking. The primary objective of detection is to minimize false negatives and false positives, while phase picking focuses on the temporal accuracy of the arrival time. Our network first learns to distinguish the earthquake signal within the time series, and subsequently uses local attention to focus on smaller sections within the earthquake waveform to make the P and S phase picking.

To train our networks, we utilized the Stanford Earthquake Dataset (STEAD) - a global dataset of earthquakes and non-earthquake signals that has been labeled on a large scale. The earthquake data consists of approximately 1,050,000 three-component seismograms, each lasting 1 minute. These seismograms are associated with around 450,000 earthquakes that occurred between January 1984 and August 2018. Each earthquake event is linked with information such as the origin time, arrival times of the P and S phases, magnitude, epicentral location, depth, focal mechanism, error estimates, and signal-to-noise ratio.

We also identified oriented active faults, including northwest-trending strike-slip faults and dextral shear faults. These faults are associated with deformation patterns that indicate north-south shortening and east-west extension in the region. Additionally, our findings suggest that the geometry of the region best fits the scenario of a north-dipping Indian lithospheric slab beneath the Hindu Kush, which may be responsible for the focused seismicity and unambiguous dip direction.

Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the seismic activity and tectonic processes occurring in the Hindu Kush-Pamir region, with implications for understanding future seismic hazards and the dynamics of plate interactions.
