A group of input and output devices along with a large local memory constitute the essential components for new generation interconnection networks, which utilize hardware routers to facilitate the entering, leaving, and passing of messages. Each node is connected to a router, and the network topology is defined by the pattern in which routers are interconnected. Torus networks are commonly employed in high performance parallel computers due to various advantages such as constant node degree, constant length channel wires, higher channel bandwidth, lower contention latency, and the ability to be partitioned into meshes. These networks are enhanced with wraparound channels to link each edge node to the corresponding node on the opposite edge, resulting in a more balanced utilization of communication channels under random traffic conditions.

Multicast communication, where one source node transmits the same message to multiple destination nodes, is crucial in a wide range of parallel applications. Effective multicast routing aims to minimize communication latency, which encompasses startup latency, network latency, and blocking latency. Different multicast routing algorithms, such as unicast-based, path-based, and tree-based, have been developed to address this challenge. Unicast-based algorithms involve sending separate copies of a message from a source to every destination, leading to increased network traffic. Path-based algorithms are inefficient as they require multiple traversals of the network, resulting in redundant copying and forwarding of message components. Additionally, deadlock prevention is a critical concern when implementing multicast techniques in interconnection networks, and considerable efforts have been devoted to developing deadlock-free routing methodologies.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related research, Section 3 presents the proposed multicast algorithm, Section 4 compares the performance of the proposed algorithm with existing multicast algorithms, and finally, Section 5 offers a conclusion.

The proposed multicast algorithm for 2D torus networks seeks to adhere to the base routing algorithm and cover as many destinations as possible, enabling multicast operations to be completed in at most two communication steps. Various path-based multicast algorithms have been developed for torus networks, each with its own unique approach to optimizing multicast communication. For example, the T2W algorithm defines a horizontal main path that targets the last node, leveraging wraparound channels and parallel submulticasts to efficiently deliver messages to destination nodes. Similarly, the Multipath-HCM routing algorithm divides the torus network into high-channel and low-channel subnetworks to facilitate efficient multicast delivery, and the TASNeM algorithm utilizes the symmetric topology of the torus network to distribute traffic load over multiple meshes.

Overall, these multicast routing algorithms aim to minimize communication latency and maximize the efficient utilization of network resources in torus networks, offering valuable solutions for parallel computing applications. Further research and performance evaluations are required to fully assess the effectiveness of these algorithms in practical scenarios.
