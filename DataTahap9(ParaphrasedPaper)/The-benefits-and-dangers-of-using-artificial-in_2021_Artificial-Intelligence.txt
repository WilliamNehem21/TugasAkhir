Numerous articles and papers, including those by Minsky (1961), Newell (1963), Winston (1976), and Davis et al. (2002), have been published on the topic of AI. In recent years, the petrophysics community has increasingly focused on applying data-driven techniques, including AI, to address the technical challenges associated with petrophysical evaluation, particularly in relation to the thinbedded nature of sediments and the presence of both mobile and immobile viscous residual oil. These efforts have encompassed the use of machine learning techniques, with applications ranging from carbonate characterization (Bigoni, 2019) to log depth matching (Le, 2019), enhanced formation evaluation (Posenato-Garcia, 2020), and resistivity inversion (Li, 2019).

During a development drilling campaign, a formation evaluation program was implemented to appraise a reservoir with thinly bedded oil. High-resolution electrical logs (including MSFL) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tools were employed in conjunction with core data to identify and avoid perforating zones with higher oil saturations. The objective of running an NMR tool was to identify intervals of high residual oil saturation, which were then confirmed at the wellsite using the MDT-LFA (Modular Formation Dynamics Tester-Live Fluid Analyser) to confirm fluid composition and check for mobility. Borehole gas chromatography data was also utilized to validate these interpretations.

The NMR results were calibrated to high-quality Dean and Stark measurements of oil, gas, and water saturations, with AI techniques applied to the NMR curves enabling the prediction of fluid types in uncored sections and oil mobility throughout the reservoir section. Additionally, shear velocities were analyzed using AI in a North Sea field to expand the dataset and improve reservoir modeling for future well drilling.

Permeability prediction remains a significant challenge, as it is primarily related to the aperture of pore throats rather than pore size, and is difficult to measure with logging tools due to their limited resolution. Several studies have utilized AI to obtain more accurate estimates of permeability compared to conventional techniques.

Furthermore, AI has been used in petrophysical interpretation to process standard porosity logs and create interpretations for wells. AI predictions have proven valuable in generating accurate permeability distributions, with results showing good preservation of the dynamic range of core permeability data in comparison to least squares linear regression.

In summary, AI has demonstrated its potential to address various challenges in petrophysical evaluation, from predicting fluid types and permeability to improving the accuracy of porosity logs and interpreting well data. These advancements are an important development in the petrophysical field and hold promise for future applications.
