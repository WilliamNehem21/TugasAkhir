To put it differently, as the yk distribution approaches a multivariate Gaussian distribution, our research provides analytical expressions for the mean and variance-covariance matrix, which are solely dependent on variables s and p. Additionally, we fully characterize the degenerate cases of the limiting distribution based on the stoichiometry matrix. We also note that a suitable v can be computed using the Cholesky decomposition or spectral decomposition. The concept behind this definition is to identify an appropriate affine map to transform yk into a normalized random variable. We support the soundness of this approach with a specific proposition.

In this study, we investigate the asymptotic distribution of molecular quantities in a reaction network under a strong steady-state assumption, utilizing the SSA. We supply analytic expressions for the mean and variance-covariance matrix based on s and p. Our work highlights theoretical and practical implications, including the ability to derive confidence ellipsoids, address model validation issues, and examine the convergence of accumulation speed ratios. We illustrate our findings with toy examples.

A noteworthy aspect of our work is that the constraints-based approach serves as a probabilistic counterpart to FBA. While FBA focuses on balanced fluxes ascribing to constant internal metabolite concentrations, our approach extends this balance to internal chemical species and also encompasses the second moments of outputs at the cell level, allowing for integration of inherent production variability. However, the additional constraints are non-linear and not necessarily positive quadratic, requiring efficient constraint resolution or optimization techniques beyond conventional linear methods such as the Dantzig simplex algorithm. Thus, the constraints-based approach offers potential applications for advanced constraint resolution and optimization techniques.
