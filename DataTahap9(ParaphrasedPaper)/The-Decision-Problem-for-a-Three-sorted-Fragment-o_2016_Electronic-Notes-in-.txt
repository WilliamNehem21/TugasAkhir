Recently, a new formal logic system called three-level quantified syllogistic (3LQSR) has been proven to have a solvable satisfiability problem, which involves variables of three different kinds. The algorithm used to resolve the satisfiability problem for 3LQSR was based on a method presented in a prior study to prove the decidability of a different logic system called three-level quantified small model syllogistic with predicates and union (3LSSPU). The concept of relativized interpretation introduced in a previous work can be viewed as a variation of the concept of assignment of the small model defined in another study. The language 3LQSR, along with its extension 3LQSTR, which is introduced in the current paper, does not have the capability to express the concept of general union. However, general union is a foundational operator in 3LSSPU. Subsequently, the satisfiability problem for four-level quantified syllogistic (4LQSR), a formal logic system enabling variables of four different types, has been demonstrated to be solvable. This result has been utilized to prove that the description logic with atoms allowed in the fragment two-level syllogistic (2LS) is decidable. It has been shown that the expression of 2LS using finite enumerations can be achieved with formulae in 3LQSTR, where x={x1,..., xk} is a quantifier-free atomic formula at level 0. Moreover, it has been established that the variables x1,..., xn in the formula are not linked to z, and in the general case, 3LQSR-formulae with an exponential length in n are required, indicating that the fragment 3LQSTR is a distinctively restricted system.
