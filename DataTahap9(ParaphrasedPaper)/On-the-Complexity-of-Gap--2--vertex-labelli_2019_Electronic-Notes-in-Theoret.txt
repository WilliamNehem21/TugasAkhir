The concept of gap-[k]-vertex-labellings was first introduced by A. Dehghan et al. in 2013. In their publication, the authors explored the computational complexity of decision problems related to gap-[k]-vertex-labelling for certain groups of graphs, as well as the minimum value of k for which some graphs can be assigned such a labelling. They demonstrated that determining whether a given graph can be assigned a gap-[k]-vertex-labelling is an NP-complete problem. Let t=(t1, t2,..., tp) represent an arbitrary but fixed ordering of all p triangles in g. Additionally, we extend the notation to indicate that ti={ex, ey, ez} is the triangle of g induced by edges ex, ey, and ez of e(g).
