The ability to create a fold along a line passing through specified points p and q is demonstrated in multiple statements, such as one regarding making a fold along a line that aligns with given points p and q, and another pertaining to making a fold along a line that corresponds with two given lines, m and n. Additionally, it is stated that a fold can be made along a line perpendicular to a given line m, and if the condition online(q, l) is met, then r(p, q, l) is also met. This is further elaborated by highlighting that if formula(a1) holds for any combination of values of p, q, and l, then r(p, q, l) holds, which can be expressed as a 3-ctrs (type 3 conditional term rewrite system). 

Furthermore, the paper introduces a model of computation for computational origami, which includes a formal language for reasoning about the model. However, it is noted that this formal language is not sufficient for end-users, specifically origamists, to fully explore the possibilities of computational origami. To address this limitation, the authors have developed an environment called eos for computational origami, which assists users in performing origami construction and reasoning about geometric properties. While the programming and computational capabilities described in the paper are an abstraction of what has been implemented so far, the need for additional programming support for computational origami is highlighted.
