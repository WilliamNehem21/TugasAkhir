Cellular processes are regulated by intricate molecular networks, and understanding the resulting dynamics often involves using a boolean abstraction. By employing boolean regulatory networks, qualitative models with discrete dynamics are created, in which properties of interest are related to attractors and their reachability. When examining multicellular systems, it is necessary to consider cell-cell communication by appropriately connecting cellular network models. This is achieved through logical composition rules that define cell-cell communication and result in a composite model of the regulatory control of the entire system.

As formalized in Definition 2.1, a logical regulatory graph (LRG) is a graph in which the nodes represent genes or regulatory components, and the directed, signed edges represent regulatory interactions between these components. Additionally, variables are associated with components to indicate their states (on/off or true/false), and logical functions specify the evolution of these variables.

Although the focus is on boolean LRGs, it's important to note that multi-valued LRGs, which allow variables to take a broader range of discrete values, can also be considered. This is not a limitation, as any multi-valued LRG can be formally translated into a boolean LRG. In fact, this translation was utilized in our initial case study in Section 4.

In practice, composing LRGs requires specifying how they influence each other. This is accomplished through the composition rule M, where the definition of the sets ZK relies on the system's topology. For instance, in the context of cells arranged in a hexagonal pattern on a 2D grid, a simple neighboring relation can be defined based on distance, with cells having up to 6 direct neighbors at a distance of 1, and possibly more neighbors at greater distances. The number of neighbors depends on the distance and also on the position of the cell in the grid, with cells at the grid borders having fewer neighbors than those at the center.
