The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows. Section 2 provides a review of relevant notation, concepts, and established facts. Section 3 presents the proof of the computability of the canonical form and set h. In Section 4, the difference scheme for equation (1) and certain associated properties are outlined. Section 5 is dedicated to demonstrating the computability of the solution operator for equation (1). Finally, in Section 6, potential future research directions are briefly discussed.

There are multiple options for selecting the difference scheme. The scheme utilized in this study is more complex than the one employed in the earlier work, but it exhibits some beneficial attributes as outlined in the introduction. Its description is presented in several stages.
