The definition of components in this study is comprehensive, but the concept of state remains rather abstract. Rasche and Polze also adopt a heuristic approach to state transferal, utilizing an object-graph-traversal algorithm and a mapping to achieve a semi-automatic, direct method. They depend on an accounting system for consistent state update, despite the occasional failure of this component, which can lead to state corruption. It is assumed, however, that the component is deterministic and that any errors are promptly communicated back to the caller, for example, by throwing an exception in an actual implementation.
