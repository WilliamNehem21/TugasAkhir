Floating-point arithmetic is often considered intricate due to a lack of understanding among many individuals. Even those who have been trained in mathematics may struggle with concepts such as the non-associativity of addition or the existence of non-zero numbers that are treated as zero due to limited precision. Consequently, mathematical formulas are often implemented in code exactly as they appear in textbooks, despite the potential drawbacks of this approach. The main challenge with floating-point arithmetic lies in the limited precision, which requires rounding the exact mathematical result to a representable value.

In the context of floating-point arithmetic with an unbounded exponent range, it is important to note that the predecessor of a given floating-point number has the same exponent and unit in the last place (ulp). This fact forms a significant part of the proof and hinges on the nature of the floating-point format.

There is a question of whether the aforementioned property holds when using the rounding to nearest, ties away from zero mode. The answer is affirmative, as this mode does not exhibit mid-point behavior. However, expressing this property across all rounding modes requires consideration of the five rounding modes mentioned in the last theorem, which can be cumbersome. Additionally, using directed roundings may invalidate the results.
