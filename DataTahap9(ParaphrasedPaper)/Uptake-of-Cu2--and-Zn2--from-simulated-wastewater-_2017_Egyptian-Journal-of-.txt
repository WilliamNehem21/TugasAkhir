The increasing industrialization has led to a rise in the release of industrial waste containing heavy metals into water bodies. Processes such as electroplating and metal surface treatment generate significant amounts of wastewater containing heavy metals, including copper(II) and zinc(II). Even at low concentrations, the presence of copper(II) and zinc(II) in aquatic environments can pose potential risks to human health. Copper(II) levels exceeding the maximum concentration limit of 0.25 mg/l can cause liver damage, Wilson's disease, insomnia, and depression. Similarly, exposure to zinc(II) levels surpassing the limit of 0.80 mg/l can result in neurological disorders, lethargy, and thirst. Given the toxicity and harmful effects of these metals, it is imperative to treat metal-laden wastewater before releasing it into aquatic systems.

In recent years, biochar derived from various agricultural wastes has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient adsorbent for removing heavy metals and organic contaminants from water and soil. This is owing to its highly porous structure, extensive surface area, abundant functional groups, and mineral components. Biochar is typically used to improve soil fertility and crop productivity, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, manage waste, and produce energy. It is commonly produced by the pyrolysis of carbon-rich agricultural waste materials. Various agricultural residues, such as corn straw, rice straw, peanut and soybean husks, sugar beet tailings, oak wood and bark, rice husks, olive pomace, orange waste, and compost, have been utilized as precursors for biochar production and employed in the removal of heavy metals from water.

The efficacy of muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) peel biochar for the removal of copper and zinc from water has been investigated. From the experimental data, the adsorption process's isotherm, kinetics, and thermodynamics have been evaluated. The surface properties of the adsorbent were analyzed using FTIR and SEM techniques to assess the surface functionality and morphology of the biosorbent.
