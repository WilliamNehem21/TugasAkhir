The animation includes adaptive documentation to avoid the need for users to switch between views. When the documentation appears, it is positioned at the top of the animation window. At present, the documentation is available for all supported tree types except for b-trees. It covers both insertion and removal operations at one of four levels of detail.

In this prototype, we have introduced some fresh concepts. This system is among the first of its kind to utilize actual values in its integrated documentation and to offer varying levels of detail in documentation. Additionally, the ability to add code to the visualization without re-parsing from the beginning is a novel feature and a noteworthy advancement for the animal system.
