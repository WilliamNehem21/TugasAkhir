The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the two proposed methods for road edge detection. Section 3 discusses initial positioning based on road edge detection. Section 4 presents the experiments conducted, and finally, Section 5 summarizes the work and outlines potential future research directions.

The color-based method utilizes both color and edge features to address the limitations of individual feature-based detection caused by shadows. The approach leverages the distinct color differences between the two sides of the road edge and the high image gradient of the road edge to identify road edge candidates based on color analysis around points with significant gradients.

This method is demonstrated in an environment where the non-road area is designated as a green belt, and the right edge of the road serves as the detection target. The process involves performing Canny edge extraction on the grayscale version of the original image, denoted as "c," and transforming the original image into the HSV color space and designated as "m."

A binary image of "m" is generated using a specified formula for each point, with white points representing green areas and black points representing non-green areas. The method then assesses the total number of candidate edge points ("t") and the number of points in "c" ("p") using certain criteria to determine if there may be shadows on the road and if the road edge is not clearly defined. If these criteria are met, the approach switches to a threshold segmentation-based method; otherwise, it proceeds to fit the road edge line using the candidate points.

The process further involves converting the image into a grayscale format and examining each pixel to determine the optimal threshold using the maximum between-class variance criterion. The image is then transformed into a binary format using the optimal threshold, followed by Canny edge extraction. A scan is performed from left to right (specific to right edge detection) to identify the first white pixels, and the road edge is obtained by conducting Hough transform on these pixels.
