The red swamp crayfish, P. clarkii, is a native species from the northeast of Mexico and south central USA that has been introduced worldwide and has become the dominant freshwater crayfish in many areas due to its high production rate in farming, despite facing challenges such as poor water quality, temperature fluctuations, low oxygen concentrations, and desiccation. It constitutes at least 80% of all wild and cultured crayfish harvested globally, with annual production exceeding 60,000 tons in the USA and China. Moreover, the crayfish has been found to be sensitive to petroleum pollution and pesticides such as fenthion and fenitrothion, which can lead to histopathological changes in its tissues, especially in habitats with chronic exposure to such contaminants.

In an experimental study, it was observed that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of the fungus T. harzianum resulted in a remarkable reduction in the survival rate of P. clarkii, with higher concentrations leading to greater decreases in survival rate during exposure periods. Similar effects of fungal treatments on other organisms have also been reported, including a 100% reduction in the population of Biomphalaria alexandrina due to herbicides, and changes in the abundance and species diversity of oribatid mites due to fungicides. Furthermore, T. harzianum has been found to be effective against other pests, such as root-knot nematodes, and has been associated with the mortality of other nematode species. The ability of T. harzianum to produce toxins and enzymes, such as chitinase, has been highlighted as an important factor contributing to its biopesticidal properties. Additionally, it has been suggested that the toxicity of T. harzianum may be related to blockage of fungal spores in the gills of P. clarkii, similar to effects observed in cockroaches.

In summary, the red swamp crayfish, P. clarkii, faces numerous environmental challenges and is susceptible to various contaminants, as evidenced by its responses to pesticides and fungi. While the species has shown remarkable adaptability and is a prominent component of global crayfish production, it remains vulnerable to ecological disturbances and may serve as an important indicator of environmental health.
