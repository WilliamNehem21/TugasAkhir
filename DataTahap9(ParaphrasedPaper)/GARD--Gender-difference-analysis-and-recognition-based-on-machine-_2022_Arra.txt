In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on intelligent diagnosis and treatment in the medical field, driven by the analysis of large-scale medical examination data. This study introduces a method to examine the variations in medical attributes between males and females, and identifies differences in medical attributes across different age groups. Utilizing cluster analysis, the study identifies common important attributes (CIAs) that can be used for gender recognition within specific age brackets. Subsequently, two gender recognition models (GRMs) are proposed based on the CIAs, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GRMs, with a 92.8% accuracy achieved within a specific age range (17-51 years) using only six medical attributes.

Farnaz et al. developed a time series medical generative adjunctive network (GANs) for a wound prognosis model, which can extract continuous and categorical features from electronic medical records (EMR) through the use of neighbors, iterative imputer, and multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) to handle missing data in the field of oncology.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset and analyzes the variations in medical examination attributes between males and females. In Section 3, cluster analysis is used to determine the medical examination items that are crucial for gender recognition within each age group. Section 4 introduces two gender recognition models, one with known age (GRM A) and one with unknown age (GRM B). The role of data analysis in gender recognition is evaluated in Section 5, and the paper concludes in Section 6.

A thorough evaluation of the GRMs is presented in one section, discussing the significance of CIAs and the division of age range. Furthermore, the impact of age range division on gender recognition accuracy is explored, with the analysis suggesting that knowing the age of samples dramatically improves accuracy. The paper also provides insights into the performance of GRM B, cluster analysis, and CIAs through comparative experiments.

In summary, the study presents a method for assessing the differences in medical attributes between males and females at specific ages through the distribution of medical attributes. It identifies key attributes for gender recognition and proposes GRMs based on these findings, demonstrating high accuracy within certain age ranges. The effectiveness of the proposed models, cluster analysis, and CIAs is verified through experimental validation.
