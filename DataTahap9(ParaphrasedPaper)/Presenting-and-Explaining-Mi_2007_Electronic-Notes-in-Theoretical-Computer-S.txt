The Mizar proof language is designed to have presentation features that are user-friendly, similar to textbook presentations, while also enabling rigorous proof checking at a semantic level. Both the presentation features and the semantics are important for users, and an ideal Mizar presentation should be both human-friendly and facilitate fast access to detailed semantics and proof explanations. However, this poses several challenges when presenting original Mizar texts, results of semantic queries over the Mizar library, and texts produced directly at the semantical level by automated theorem provers. This paper explores solutions to these challenges and outlines an initial system for presenting detailed explanations of atomic Mizar inferences through the cooperation of Mizar XML presentation tools, the MML query system, and automated theorem provers working on the MPTP semantic translation of Mizar.

The primary purpose of formal proof languages such as Mizar is mechanized proof checking, which requires transforming presentation features to a proof-checkable level with clear semantics. This transformation is accomplished through several compiler-like passes in Mizar, gradually converting syntactic features to their semantic counterparts and finally checking the correctness of proofs at the semantic level.

The semantic level of Mizar serves various purposes, including proof checking and storage of the Mizar internal database. It is also used in the MML query searching and presentation system, as well as being the basis for formats used in the MOMM system, the Mizar proof advisor, MPTP systems, and for semantic browsing in the MizarMode. However, it should be noted that the semantic level of Mizar expresses the Mizar logic, not the standard untyped first-order predicate logic used in current automated theorem provers (ATPs) such as E, Vampire, SPASS, Otter, or Prover9. Additional processing is needed to transform this logic to standard predicate logic, and there are multiple choices in this transformation, with many possible ways of encoding pure predicate logic in the Mizar logic.

The Mizar semantic level has recently been fully XML-ized, and XSLT tools are being developed to create linked HTML presentation of Mizar 7 from it. This XML-ized semantic format is designed to make it relatively easy to link symbols and other Mizar resources in HTML, and recent modifications have been made based on feedback to address HTML presentation bottlenecks. It allows faithful recreation of the original Mizar presentation while revealing additional information computed by the Mizar system, which is typically not accessible to Mizar authors. The use of pure XSLT for creating the HTML presentation is advantageous because all major browsers today support the XSLT language, enabling Mizar authors to load the XML file directly into their browser to access additional information during authoring.

At the Mizar site, there are differences in linking and rendering of MML queries and ATP proof objects, and examples are provided. Additionally, it is important to note that the constant "c1" has been renamed to "c11001" in the HTML rendering, as a result of the MPTP system naming conventions requiring unique names for every MPTP object.
