Wistar rats were utilized in this study to investigate the effects of a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) injection on various biomarkers related to type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the potential therapeutic effects of the flavonoid 2-hydroxychalcone. The levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPAR-γ) in subabdominal adipose tissue, serum adiponectin, serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and serum insulin were assessed following oral administration of 2-hydroxychalcone. The study suggests that lifestyle modification and glycemic control are fundamental in the treatment of T2DM, and highlights the need for new therapeutic approaches due to the adverse side effects associated with existing antidiabetic agents.

Adiponectin, an adipocytokine exclusively secreted by adipose tissue, plays a role in insulin resistance, T2DM, and metabolic syndrome. Plasma adiponectin levels were found to be decreased in obesity, which may contribute to the development of insulin resistance.

Chalcones, which are naturally occurring compounds, are considered precursors of flavonoids and have been reported to exhibit various biological activities. 2-hydroxychalcone, a specific type of chalcone, has been shown to mimic the effects of insulin by enhancing glucose uptake and insulin receptor phosphorylation in adipocytes. Furthermore, synthetic chalcone derivatives have demonstrated inhibitory activity against diabetic complications.

The study utilized a rat model of T2DM induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin injection, and observed a significant reduction in body weight in the diabetic rats. Treatment with 2-hydroxychalcone improved body weight and also showed potential in improving dyslipidemia and reducing oxidative stress in the diabetic rats.

The findings from this study also suggest a potential positive correlation between adiponectin and antioxidant markers such as glutathione, while indicating a negative correlation between malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and adiponectin. These results further support the potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherogenic properties of adiponectin.

In summary, the study investigates the effects of 2-hydroxychalcone on various biomarkers related to T2DM in a rat model, and provides evidence of its potential therapeutic benefits in improving body weight, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress associated with T2DM.
