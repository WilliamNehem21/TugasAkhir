An action-selection mechanism using a binary search tree is employed to choose an action based on a random number within a specific range. Each node in the tree maintains the cumulative sum of action rates in its left subtree, enabling efficient selection of actions through left-right switches. This tree structure ensures that the performance of a one-step simulation is logarithmic in the number of actions (O(log n)), thereby offering efficient execution across compartments.

The developmental polarity of the Drosophila egg is established by localized mRNA molecules known as maternal effects. During the initial nine nuclear divisions, nuclei migrate from the egg's interior to its periphery, forming a monolayer called syncytial blastoderm. Subsequent nuclear divisions lead to the encapsulation of each nucleus by plasma membranes, transforming the syncytial blastoderm into a cellular blastoderm comprising approximately 6000 distinct cells.

Protein synthesis is treated as an atomic event, with transcription and translation being represented by a single reaction. Gene activation is modeled as a reaction that changes the gene's state from 0 to 1 upon availability of the activating protein, while gene inhibition occurs in the opposite manner. The dynamics of the Hunchback (hb) protein are expressed through a series of reactions with corresponding rates.

To demonstrate the versatility of the framework, we investigated pattern formation during Drosophila embryo development, specifically modeling the interactions between maternal factors and gap genes that drive early regionalization of the embryo. The framework enables modeling of intracellular reactions regulating gene expression and diffusion of molecules mediating cell-to-cell communication, facilitating the exploration of the interplay between these two levels and its contribution to spatial self-organization. Results demonstrate the emergence of precise spatial patterns, which align well with observations from actual embryo gene expressions.
