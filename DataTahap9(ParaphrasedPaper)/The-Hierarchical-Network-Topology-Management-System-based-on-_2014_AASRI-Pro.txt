As network scale continues to expand and grow in complexity, effective management and maintenance have become increasingly crucial. Network management systems (NMS) now play a significant role in network construction and upkeep. Specifically, network topology management (NTM) serves as a fundamental component of NMS, with most of its functions being carried out through the use of a topological graph.

In our approach, we employ a hierarchical display strategy using an IP network as an illustrative example. The first layer of the display showcases the primary topology, representing the relationships between routers and subnets. The second layer delves into the interconnections within the subnets, while the third layer can further detail the topology structure at the port level if the subnet also includes routers or switches.

Typically, a standard loading model is used due to the relatively small amount of data involved. However, in the context of hierarchical networks, a multilevel loading model becomes a prerequisite. During system initialization, the multilevel loading model only presents the uppermost data. This model not only conserves space but also enhances the speed of the loading system.
