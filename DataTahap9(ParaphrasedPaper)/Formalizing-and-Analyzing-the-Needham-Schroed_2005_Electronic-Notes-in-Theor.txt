The strategy was employed to analyze the Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol (NSPK) as a standard case study for protocol verification, focusing on authentication and secrecy properties. Our experiments with both the insecure and corrected versions of NSPK demonstrated the strategy's capability to identify attacks in the insecure version and verify the properties of the corrected version.

The protocol must ensure the secrecy and freshness of the key K_AB, such that at the end of a session, only A, B, and S should know K_AB, and A (respectively, B) should believe that B (respectively, A) possesses the same key K_AB created by S in the current session. If B accepts the message at step 5, then K_AB has been sent by A in step 3, ensuring authentication.

When defining the rewrite system RP, we attempted to establish general guidelines for formalizing the protocol steps. These guidelines can be summarized as follows: the left-hand side of the first rule should take the form goal(agt(a), agt(b), r(j)), and the left-hand side of a rule with the root mesg should be satisfied. Furthermore, by tracing the critical pairs, we can identify which terms were previously recognized by the intruder in the completion process, providing feedback on the error location. This strategy is akin to a rewriting strategy described in [20, 21] to address the issue of completion process divergence, where the bottom-up strategy allows for computing the normal form of a term with respect to the infinite canonical rewrite system.

The instantiation (inst) is a parameter of the strategy, constructed based on the function symbols in the given signature, the names of principals (the server and agents with their labels), the numbers denoting intruders and protocol runs. We focus on the behavior of agents A and B, server S, and an intruder (represented by agt(0)) during two protocol sessions, typically designated as r(0) and r(s(0)).

We assume that the properties to be proven or disproven in a protocol are described by well-formed terms, and during the expansion phase of the strategy, only well-formed terms will be considered, while the non-well-formed ones will be omitted from the search space. However, this might not suffice to ensure the termination of the expansion process, as seen in the expansion process with the trs for the NSPK. The predicate of well-formedness is a parameter for the strategy, and when considering other protocols or different properties, the definition of well-formedness of terms may need to be adjusted accordingly. For the insecure NSPK, we provide the following definition.
