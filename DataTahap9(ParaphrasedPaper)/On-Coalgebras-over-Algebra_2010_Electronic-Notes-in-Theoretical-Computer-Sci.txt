The previous section described a scenario where two endofunctors, t and h, are given and the goal is to find an appropriate monad such that (t, h) form a commuting pair. The relationship between algebras of t and coalgebras of h suggests that it is uncertain if a solution exists for the general case of any two set-endofunctors. However, an alternative approach is proposed: starting with just one endofunctor and a finitary monad, a distributive law can be found to induce a Kleisli lift. After achieving this, a second endofunctor on set can be constructed, if possible, to form a commuting pair using the functor obtained on alg(m).

The subsequent part of the paper introduces the concept of a commuting pair of endofunctors in relation to a monad. While this is a new concept, a more in-depth analysis and additional examples are necessary to fully comprehend this structure, such as the connection between bisimulations and traces that is exhibited elsewhere. We intend to explore this aspect further in a subsequent paper.
