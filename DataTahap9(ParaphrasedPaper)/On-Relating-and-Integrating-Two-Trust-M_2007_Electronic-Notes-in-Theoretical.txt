This paper presents an ongoing research effort to develop a comprehensive framework for specifying and analyzing security and trust in emergent dynamic coalitions, such as mobile ad hoc networks, peer to peer systems, and web services. The focus is on integrating two established languages, the role-based trust-management framework (rt) and the transitive trust model, to provide a basis for modeling and analyzing security and trust aspects using formal techniques based on inference systems.

The study explores the potential for integrating these two frameworks into a unified inference system for describing both trust and recommendation relationships in distributed systems. It highlights the peculiarity of dynamic coalitions, emphasizing the need for trust, reputation, and recommendation mechanisms to enforce cooperation among electronic devices belonging to different security domains.

The role-based trust-management framework (rt) is central to the study, defining roles as combinations of principals and role terms. The formalization of the trust model is based on a series of inference rules that enable standard mechanisms for managing trust relationships. The comparison between the transitive trust model and the rt family of languages is facilitated by this formalization.

The paper also discusses the explicit rules and mechanisms for combining trust measures in the transitive trust model, addressing issues such as transitivity of trust, multiple paths, and recommendation chains. It presents an example of aggregating trust measures and introduces a simplified trust model enriched with trust measures and rules for combining them.

The study acknowledges the limitations of the simplified trust model, particularly the loss of information related to recommenders, and suggests avenues for further refinement, such as the study of an extension to rt dealing with recommenders and the exploration of aspects like intersection of roles.
