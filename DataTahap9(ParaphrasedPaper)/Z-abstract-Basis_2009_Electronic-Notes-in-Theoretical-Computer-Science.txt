The paper introduces the concept of a z-abstract basis and explores its properties. It demonstrates that for a union-complete subset system, the basis of a z-continuous poset, with the restricted z-relation, constitutes a z-abstract basis. Furthermore, it shows that the rounded z-ideal completion of the z-abstract basis is isomorphic to the z-continuous poset. Conversely, it establishes that the rounded z-ideal completion of a z-abstract basis results in a z-continuous poset.

P. Venugopalan conducted research on z-continuous posets, which are a generalization of directed set systems. The concept of a z-subset system has led to the formulation of many theorems in domain theory. In domain theory, mathematicians recognize the significance of the abstract basis due to its association with continuous posets. The study investigates whether the corresponding concept of abstract basis in relation to z-subset systems can be defined, and delves into its characteristics.
