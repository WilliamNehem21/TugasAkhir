The use of labeled deduction has been employed effectively in various non-classical logics, including modal and temporal logics, as it provides a method for dealing with modalities and results in deduction systems with strong proof-theoretical properties. This framework involves encoding additional information, either semantic or proof-theoretical in nature, using labels to make explicit what is implicit in the logic being studied. For instance, instead of just having a formula a, one can consider the labeled formula b: a, where b intuitively denotes the time instant at which a holds within the underlying Kripke semantics. Labels can also be used to specify temporal relations, such as the relational formula bRc, which states that the time instant c is accessible from b.

This approach forms the basis for formalizing deduction systems for temporal logics with the until operator, and a labeled natural deduction system for a linear-time logic with the new history operator is presented. It is shown that, through a proper translation, this system is sound and complete with respect to the linear temporal logic LTL with until. The paper also outlines directions for current and future work, and provides some sketch proofs with full proofs available elsewhere due to space constraints.
