The CWML workflow model involves tasks with specific input and output conditions, with their semantics defined by underlying Petri nets. The state of a task in the model is determined by the marking of its underlying Petri net. The visibility of an action is contingent upon the variable it assigns, with certain criteria for determining its impact on the truth value of the property to be verified.

The complexity of the slicing algorithm ranges from O(n) to O(n^2log n), depending on the visibility of the tasks. The Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association National Model (CHPCA 2002) is based on understanding health, illness, and bereavement experiences, highlighting the role of hospice palliative care in addressing suffering and enhancing quality of life. An HPC workflow was developed in collaboration with the Guysborough Antigonish Strait Health Authority (GASHA) based on the CHPCA 2002 model.

The developed model contains general guidelines known as norms of care, with the workflow modeled using the Nova workflow. Additionally, LTL formulae were generated to ensure compliance with the norms. The authors anticipate that translating CWML to other model checkers will be straightforward, and they plan to address time sensitivity in safety-critical systems such as healthcare in future work. They also aim to enhance their approach with unstructured workflow models featuring an infinite number of states.
