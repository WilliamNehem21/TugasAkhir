A more general variation of the issue has been explored using a polyhedral approach. In one instance, the authors examined fresh lower limits on the optimal cover size, derived from the fractional solution of the linear programming relaxation of the proposed formulation. In another, two integer programming models for the rectangular cover of a convex polygon were discussed.

While the algorithms are sub-cubic, their practicality diminishes when the dimensions align with those of real-sized images. Additionally, in a column generation setting, solving the problem optimally is unnecessary, as a column with a negative reduced cost is sufficient to proceed with the process. Therefore, quick heuristics, particularly linear programming-based ones (such as rounding heuristics), may be valuable for this issue. Hence, we are intrigued by an integer programming approach for the maximum subarray problem for d = 2.

The linked polytope can be viewed as a two-dimensional version of the full interval vectors polytope, which denotes the convex hull of vectors in {0, 1}n with consecutive ones. The associated polytope has been studied in previous works, some of which have influenced the present study.
