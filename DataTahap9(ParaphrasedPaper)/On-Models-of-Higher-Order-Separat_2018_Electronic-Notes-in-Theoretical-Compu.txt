This paper demonstrates how principles from categorical logic can be applied to present a comprehensive framework for models of higher-order separation logic involving a sublogic of persistent predicates. The focus is on basic rules and connectives of separation logic, without consideration of specification logic, such as hoare triples, or concepts like invariants specific to particular separation logics. The study aims to provide a general modeling approach for the fundamental aspects of the logic, so that future efforts can be directed towards modeling parts specific to a particular logic.

The paper utilizes the standard notion of a complete Heyting algebra to model standard higher-order logic and a complete bi-algebra to model higher-order separation logic. It demonstrates the construction of such algebras based on a model of resources, formalized by a partial commutative monoid, and various ways of singling out the idempotent monoid elements. The framework is shown to encompass models that include a modality for reasoning about guarded recursive predicates. By changing the ambient category, the paper demonstrates how the model of iris, a higher-order separation logic with guarded recursive predicates, can be recovered using the topos of trees.

The study explores conditions for obtaining a logic of persistent predicates and presents two different constructions based on idempotent resources and interior operators on resources. It is shown that sublogics closed under all standard logical connectives of the ambient logic can be obtained through the second construction. Additionally, the paper establishes that sublogics considering duplicable predicates and closed under all standard connectives must adhere to specific conditions.

The paper discusses the support for guarded recursive predicates, showing that the iris logic can be modeled using a subcategory of the topos of trees. It demonstrates that the model of iris predicates can be reconstructed using the constructions from earlier sections in the topos of trees. The study also addresses the behavior of the modality arising from the adjunction and explores the issue of preserving unions in practical cases.

In conclusion, the paper advances a systematic approach for modeling higher-order separation logic with persistent predicates, showcasing how the choice of ambient category can facilitate the modeling of logics supporting guarded recursive predicates. The authors express interest in utilizing this method to investigate variations of models combining linear and separation logic with guarded recursive predicates in future research.
