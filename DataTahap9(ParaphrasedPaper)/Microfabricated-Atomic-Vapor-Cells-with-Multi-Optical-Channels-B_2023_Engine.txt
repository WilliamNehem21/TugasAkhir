This research paper presents the development of a side-molding process for creating glass cavities with high-quality inner sidewalls, which enables mass production of MEMS multi-optical-channel alkali metal atomic vapor cells. The study demonstrates that the processed inner sidewalls meet the criteria for an optical channel, and that an integrated processing platform allows for multilayer non-isothermal anode bonding, inert gas filling, and noble gas recovery and recycling. Measurement of the absorption spectra and free-induction decay signals of xenon-129 (129Xe) and xenon-131 (131Xe) under different pump-probe schemes confirms the suitability of the vapor cell for use in atomic devices such as atomic gyroscopes, dual-beam atomic magnetometers, and other optical/atomic devices. The proposed micromolding technology is expected to have wide-ranging applications in the field of optical-device processing.

In the new side-molding process, a smooth mold is inserted into the glass cavity and the inner sidewalls are compressed at a specific viscoelastic temperature, transforming the rough sidewalls into an optical plane. This results in the fabrication of an atomic vapor cell with multiple optical channels, which is confirmed through a series of optical tests. The advantages of this process include the removal of inner surface morphology, minimal glass deformation, and reduced molding pressure, which contributes to mold recycling and cost reduction.

The paper also discusses the operational issues related to helium permeation through the glass substrate, as well as strategies to mitigate this problem, such as using alternative glass materials or applying coatings and sealing materials to prolong the lifetime of the atomic vapor cells. Additionally, the study delves into the nuclear spin properties of 129Xe and 131Xe, observing differences in their relaxation times and NMR linewidths, and proposes further research on prolonging the relaxation time of 131Xe using hydrogen or deuterium films.
