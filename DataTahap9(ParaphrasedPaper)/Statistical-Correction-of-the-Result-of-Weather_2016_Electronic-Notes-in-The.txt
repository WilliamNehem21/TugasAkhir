This paper presents a technique called model output calibration (MOC) for calibrating simulation models, and evaluates its effectiveness by applying it to correct weather forecast data generated by the ETA 15km model at CPTEC/INPE, which is a regional model for numerical weather prediction. The study demonstrates positive results in the statistical correction of ETA forecast, particularly in improving temperature and relative humidity variables. The authors assert that the MOC approach could potentially enhance the results of simulation models related to crops and diseases that utilize variables generated by weather forecast models.

The paper discusses the features and operation of MOC in section 4, outlining its application in correcting forecasts generated by the ETA model and presenting the resulting improvements. Section 5 contains the conclusions of the research as well as considerations for future work based on the obtained results.

Despite advancements in forecast methods leading to more accurate results, many variables provided by models are susceptible to changes influenced by natural phenomena. The authors highlight errors in temperature forecast models due to coarse topographic representation and deficient physical modeling.

The discrepancies are attributed to the grid point model's assumption that climatic variables behave homogeneously within each grid, which may not accurately represent real-world conditions. To mitigate these errors, the paper discusses the development of statistical methods for correcting these issues, emphasizing the importance of calibration in identifying and rectifying forecast model problems.

The calibration process involves adjusting the calculations in the forecast model based on identified issues, and it is differentiated from the validation process by the parameters used. The discussion highlights the technical nature of selecting parameters for data calibration and the unique approach of each statistical method. One such method, the Model Output Calibration (MOC), was developed by Mao et al. in 1998 and uses multivariate linear regression for statistical correction based on a shorter training period compared to other methods.

The paper then presents the results of applying MOC to correct temperature and relative humidity forecasts generated by the ETA 15km model from December 2015. The analysis covers 36 Brazilian locations, including meteorological stations at airports in capitals and cities in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo state and the south region of Brazil. The goal of the project is to improve the quality of energy load forecasting for the Brazilian electric system national operator (ONS) through these corrections.

The study reveals that while the ETA model generally underestimated observed temperatures, it tended to overestimate relative humidity during the night and underestimate it during the day. The discrepancies were more pronounced in stations with larger distance between the model grid box and the observation point. The paper concludes by acknowledging the errors inherent in numerical weather prediction models and the necessity of ongoing improvement efforts.
