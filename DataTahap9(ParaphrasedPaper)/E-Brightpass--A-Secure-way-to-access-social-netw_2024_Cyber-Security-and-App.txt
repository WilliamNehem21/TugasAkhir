The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2, the shortcomings of the brightpass method are discussed. Section 3 introduces the proposed methods. Sections 4 include a comprehensive security analysis and a comparison between the proposed methods and the brightpass method. Sections 5 and 6 cover the experimental evaluation and discussions. The paper concludes in section 7.

The method involves obtaining a secret key using a graphical password-based interface. This interface consists of a 7x5 matrix comprising a combination of directions and numbers, with the first ten cells containing random directions and the subsequent twenty-five cells containing random numbers ranging from 0 to 9.

During the process, the user selects a number from the starting position based on the directions specified in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, corresponding to the original pin 1234. The tricky part comes into play - when the screen brightness is low, the user intentionally selects any direction to introduce an error, whereas when the screen brightness is high, the user follows the specified directions.

Because the directions obtained from the matrix and the original pin are used in conjunction with the screen brightness, the method described above is resilient to multiple recordings. When the screen brightness is low, the user is able to move in any of the four directions, which occurs three times during a session due to the low brightness. Consequently, the chances of recovering the original pin are extremely slim, if not nonexistent.
