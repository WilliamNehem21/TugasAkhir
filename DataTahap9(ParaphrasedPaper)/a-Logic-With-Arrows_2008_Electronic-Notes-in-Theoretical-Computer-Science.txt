The primary author played a key role in the development of nominal techniques, such as nominal logic [22, 14], which share similarities with a-logic and incorporate a freshness predicate. However, these techniques are not compatible with the axiom of choice; for instance, nominal logic is not consistent with a unary term-former f such that (f s) # s always holds. It appears that we can formally represent such an f in a-logic as follows:

In the semantic framework, predicates are construed as sets of (tuples of) elements from the domain, where "at" represents a unary predicate. Atoms are essentially a subset of the underlying domain, denoted as [[at]] in the domain's interpretation. Elements of [[at]] are distinct in that they cannot be in the image of the interpretation of any term-formers.
