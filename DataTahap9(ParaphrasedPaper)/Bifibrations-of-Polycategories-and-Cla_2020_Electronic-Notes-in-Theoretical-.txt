One could argue that definition 2.8 represents a natural extension of the concept of strong universal multimap in a multicategory, while definition 2.10 is a natural extension of representability from multicategories to polycategories (in accordance with definition 2.5). It will be shown in section 3 that these concepts can be viewed as special cases of more general fibrational concepts. Similar to strong universal multimaps in a multicategory, both in-universal and out-universal polymaps are closed under composition in a suitable sense.

It is important to highlight that the findings in this section, particularly the polycategorical Grothendieck correspondences, depend on the existence of a weak 2-polycategories theory. As far as we are aware, such a theory has not yet been rigorously developed. We leave it as a future endeavor to formulate this theory. In the meantime, we will describe the assumptions we make about the properties of weak 2-polycategories after reviewing the standard notion of categorical Grothendieck correspondences.
