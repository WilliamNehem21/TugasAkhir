This paper presents an integration of the semantic models of compensating csp (ccsp) process algebra into the general-purpose theorem prover PVS. The ccsp process algebra is a language designed for modeling long-running business transactions, with specific features for orchestrating compensations. The paper outlines the definition of ccsp process algebra terms in PVS using mutually recursive datatype and the embedding of trace and operational semantics within PVS. It also explains how these semantic embeddings are utilized to establish and verify a relationship between the semantic models through the powerful induction mechanism of PVS.

The language of compensating csp (ccsp) is intended for modeling long-running business transactions within the context of standard csp process algebra. Business transactions often entail coordination and interaction among multiple partners, and compensations are actions taken to rectify errors in such transactions, particularly long-running ones. The ccsp language facilitates the modeling of business transactions by offering constructs for orchestrating compensations. Formal semantics provide a comprehensive and rigorous definition of the language.

Mistakes or omissions can easily occur in manual proofs, and mechanizing the semantic models with an interactive and automatic theorem prover like PVS can address these issues. PVS is well-suited for this purpose due to its support for high-order logic, abstract datatypes, and induction mechanism. Previous research has successfully mechanized process algebras, and given the similar nature of ccsp semantic models to standard csp, PVS is chosen for this experiment. The paper emphasizes the novelty of mechanizing both operational and trace semantics of ccsp in PVS, as previous works were more application-centric.

The paper provides a systematic approach for establishing a relationship between the semantic models of ccsp. It describes the extraction of traces from transition rules, establishment of correspondence between extracted and original traces, and the embedding of ccsp in PVS. The definitions of process algebra terms, traces, and operational semantics, along with the mechanization of supporting lemmas, are discussed. The use of induction and the level of granularity in proof steps are highlighted as key components of the mechanization.

Additionally, the paper outlines the use of abstract datatype in PVS to model process algebra terms, the systematic definition of trace semantics, and the embedding of semantic models within PVS. The automation of proofs and mechanization in PVS has provided a deeper understanding of ccsp semantic models and helped identify previously unexplored lemmas.

The paper acknowledges the need for further research to include other operators and extend the experiments to encompass a broader subset of the ccsp language. Furthermore, the potential application of ccsp for modeling business transactions is mentioned as a future avenue of exploration.
