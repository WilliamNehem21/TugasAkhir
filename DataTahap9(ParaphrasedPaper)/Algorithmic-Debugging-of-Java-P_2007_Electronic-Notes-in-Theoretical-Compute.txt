The paper discusses the concept of software components, emphasizing encapsulation, which allows programmers to focus on the semantics of each component without having to consider its implementation details. It then introduces the idea of declarative debugging, which involves building a computation tree to identify erroneous methods in a program based on the validity of their results. The debugger abstracts away method implementation details, reducing the user's task to verifying the results of method calls.

The authors compare their approach with a previous proposal for a declarative debugger for the imperative language Pascal, highlighting the efficiency of their debugger based on the Java Platform Debugging Architecture (JPDA). They also discuss a related work that stores relevant events during program execution in a deductive database, contrasting it with their approach that focuses specifically on method calls and uses a computation tree to deduce the wrong method.

The paper outlines the application of declarative debugging to Java programs and introduces the use of a test-case generator to minimize user interaction. It acknowledges some limitations of their prototype, such as the inability to pinpoint the specific buggy statement in a method, and suggests the possibility of switching to trace debugging mode for more precise error identification.

Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to declarative debugging in the context of object-oriented languages, with a focus on Java, and discusses its limitations and future directions.
