We anticipate two immediate potential applications for these concepts. The first application relates to web services. In previous work [17, 6], a foundational theory of contracts for web services has been proposed, which is based on a modified version of CCS. Our incorporation of cost environments could be readily utilized in this context, and we intend to explore this further in forthcoming publications. The second application pertains to the advancement of a more realistic theory of networked processes. As communication across a network is not instantaneous, we propose the inclusion of representations of routers in the process description language, which would enable the association of communication cost with the number of routers through which a message has to travel. This avenue of inquiry is currently being pursued.
