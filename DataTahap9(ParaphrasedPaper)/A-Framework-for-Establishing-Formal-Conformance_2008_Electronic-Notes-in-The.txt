The paper discusses a framework for defining conformance relationships between object models and object-oriented programs. It proposes a formal method for establishing conformance relationships, allowing for reasoning with flexible rules of conformance between model and program constructs. The framework introduces a syntactic mapping that provides a definition for semantic conformance between models and programs, independent of object modeling or programming language. By leveraging intermediate representations of interpretations and heaps, the framework enables the independence of model and program semantics.

The proposed framework aims to support various software engineering tasks, such as code generation from models, reverse engineering, and semantic correspondence checking. It is designed to accommodate different types of couplings for model elements and program constructs, and it is demonstrated using a banking application as an example.

The framework is formalized in the PVS system, which provides mechanized support for formal specification and verification. It utilizes a specification language based on simply typed higher-order logic and a prover to ensure the correctness of conformance relationships. The paper also presents a formal definition of models and programs using uninterpreted types in the PVS framework.

The framework's practical applications include conformance checking, code generation, roundtrip engineering, and model-driven development, particularly in the context of refactoring. It offers a formal and precise definition of conformance relationships, which is crucial for ensuring the soundness of transformations that affect model elements and their corresponding implementations.
