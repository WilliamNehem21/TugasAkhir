Understanding which lane contains heavier vehicles due to limited visibility is important. If a driver in lane four decides to make a lane change and faces the choice of staying in the congested lane or returning to the previous lane, they are likely to revert back to the previous lane. Alternatively, the driver may opt to switch to the less congested lane three, where there is more space. In this situation, it may be beneficial to remain in lane three or the driver may choose to switch to the less crowded lane two. Thus, having anticipated data about traffic conditions in different lanes is crucial to making informed decisions about route selection in order to achieve mobility benefits.

In the context of analyzing sudden driving behaviors, such as sudden braking and lane changes, the number of occurrences of these actions for each vehicle is essential. For instance, if a driver frequently performs sudden braking or lane changes at high speeds, it can disrupt traffic patterns. Additionally, vehicles with higher speeds but a tendency for sudden braking or lane changes can pose a risk of potential accidents. On the other hand, vehicles with higher speeds and a more predictable driving behavior are preferred. Therefore, a system that can analyze the behavior of drivers and provide guidance for optimal lane selection to reduce travel time is valuable. Simulation results demonstrate that such a system can significantly improve performance, particularly in heavy-traffic scenarios.

An experiment comparing the system's performance when deployed versus when it is inactive revealed a substantial improvement in traffic flow when the system is operational. Furthermore, the presence of more operational data analyzers can enhance the decision-making process for drivers. To ensure the system's resilience, future research should focus on investigating its security aspects.
