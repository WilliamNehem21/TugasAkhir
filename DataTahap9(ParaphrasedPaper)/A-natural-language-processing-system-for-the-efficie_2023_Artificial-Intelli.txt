Biomedical knowledge graphs play a crucial role in structuring biological findings. However, keeping these graphs updated with the latest knowledge is challenging. Natural language processing offers new possibilities for automating this process, but the lack of annotated biomedical data remains a significant obstacle. This study aims to explore methodologies for automatically extracting causal relationships from biomedical literature to update disease-specific pathophysiology mechanisms.

The proposed approach involves searching and retrieving PubMed abstracts using specific keywords, followed by automatic information extraction using natural language processing. The extracted information, representing cause-and-effect relationships, is then encoded using the biological expression language (BEL). Domain experts assess the completeness, relevance, accuracy, and novelty of the extracted information.

One of the challenges in biomedical research is transforming scientific text into structured knowledge representations, such as ontologies and knowledge graphs. Biomedical knowledge graphs, which represent biomedical concepts and relations using nodes and edges, have various applications, including identifying protein functions and aiding in drug discovery. Efforts are being made to construct ontologies and causal knowledge graphs, either manually or through automatic/semi-automatic methods.

The study utilized PubMed abstracts related to tau phosphorylation and its post-translational modification to extend the initial mechanism knowledge graph. Potential targets against neurodegenerative diseases were identified, and various sources and databases were used to validate and enrich this information.

In addition to identifying potential targets, the study utilized a graph-based algorithm and other computational methods to explore pathways and interactions within the knowledge graph. There is a growing need for machine learning-based approaches to improve hypothesis generation and speed in biomedical research. The study aims to present a method to address these challenges and overcome the hurdles of hypothesis generation.

The study also involved validating and enriching the understanding of found interactor candidates by searching various gene, protein, and disease databases for additional information. Additionally, it discussed the role of apolipoprotein E in neurodegeneration and potential therapeutic approaches. Finally, the study highlights the protective effects of coenzyme Q10 against sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in young mice.

Overall, this study aims to contribute to the development of effective methods for automatically updating biomedical knowledge graphs with the latest findings from literature.
