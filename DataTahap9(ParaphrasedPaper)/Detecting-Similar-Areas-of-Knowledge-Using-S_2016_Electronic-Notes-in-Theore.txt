The process of searching for scientific publications online is crucial for researchers working within a specific field. However, the vast quantity of available publications makes this task challenging, and identifying potential collaborators or reviewing literature further complicates the process. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that combines multiple bibliographic sources to identify common research areas and potential collaborative networks. We aim to achieve this through the use of ontologies, vocabularies, and linked data technologies to enrich the base data model. Additionally, we have developed a prototype to create a centralized repository of bibliographic sources and employ data mining techniques to identify similar knowledge areas within the community of researchers in Ecuador.

The ever-increasing number of publications available through search engines and digital libraries presents challenges for researchers in terms of delving into a topic, reviewing literature, and tracking research history due to the overwhelming amount of information. Furthermore, academic literature is often disorganized and noisy, and information about researchers and their bibliographic resources is scattered across various digital repositories, text files, or bibliographic databases.

When proposing projects involving multiple researchers from different higher education institutions, questions arise regarding finding peers working in similar research areas and creating networks of researchers with common knowledge areas. Detecting similar areas based on keywords could aid governments and higher education institutions in identifying researchers with shared interests, creating opportunities for new research projects and resource allocation. Expanding this knowledge base will provide a centralized digital repository containing information on Ecuadorian researchers and their bibliographic resources. This work aims to encourage collaboration between institutions and establish a semantic repository to identify researchers working in similar areas, providing accessible and reusable updated information. Enhancing the generation of research networks among academic peers in the region could lead to greater opportunities for collaboration between participating institutions.

Although there are numerous tools and services available online offering various functionalities to support the exploration of academic data, these tools operate in different ways, complicating literature review and data utilization. Our approach utilizes these characteristics to retrieve and enrich bibliographic data from multiple sources to identify similar areas.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work, while Section 3 outlines the architecture for detecting similar areas among Ecuadorian researchers and identifying potential collaboration networks using semantic technologies to enrich data extracted from various bibliographic sources. Conclusions and future work are presented in Section 4.

Each bibliographic source contains data that may be duplicated or inconsistent, necessitating the correction of ambiguous data before storage. We employ methods of author disambiguation, including one that uses author names and initials, and an advanced method that uses author affiliations. We also analyze the similarity between sets of publications from different authors to establish the correct author for a specific publication. Our work aligns with existing efforts to identify potential collaborative networks through the semantic enrichment of scientific articles, but it includes authors from multiple sources and not limited to Ecuadorian affiliations only. We aim to dynamically add new data sources to enhance author information.

In the field of geoscience studies, it has been demonstrated that ontologies can improve data retrieval, reuse, and repository integration. Our proposal differs from the Geolink project in that it integrates all sources into a single repository and does not use federated queries due to response time concerns. While the Geolink project's data model is specific to geodata, our approach covers multiple domains according to the bibliographic source.

Citation data is commonly used to measure the relatedness of publications, but other approaches, such as digital records and collaborative filtering, can also be used to find related papers. Our work aims to use keywords to express relatedness in literature, which has not been extensively explored in the literature.

The different data sources represent repositories containing information about authors and scientific publications from various areas. The sources of author information are distributed across different DSpace repositories in various higher education institutions, with records belonging only to Ecuadorian authors. Additionally, scientific publications are extracted from sources such as Microsoft Academics, Google Scholar, DBLP, and Scopus, each of which provides their data via APIs. The content and access to data vary among these sources, necessitating the unification of data models into a common model describing literature from different domains stored in a central repository.

The data extraction module is responsible for extracting and describing bibliographic data from several sources using semantic technologies and linked data practices. The extracted data is analyzed for structure, and if the documentation is unavailable, web scraping techniques are used to analyze the data model of the source. The established data model is then used to extract and store the data in a triple store, such as Apache Marmotta. The data extraction module uses the LDClient library to consume XML data from web services or web pages, and processes the data in memory using a temporary triple store called Sesame. String metric algorithms, such as cosine similarity and Levenshtein, are employed to determine the correct value of a publication field when some sources do not provide complete records. The correct value is determined based on the most common value among all values extracted for that field.

Data enrichment involves unifying all publication and author data in a central repository using the BIBO ontology. This process addresses inconsistencies and ambiguities present in the data and utilizes a data disambiguation component to resolve these issues. The central repository stores the unified information of publications and authors using a graph-based storage model.

To detect patterns from the collected data, we use a module with three components: finding groups, knowledge discovery, and label groups. The results are stored in the central repository for further queries.

We use the vectors generated to execute the k-means algorithm in Mahout, using cosine distance as the similarity measure and a random seed generator to seed the initial centroids. The number of clusters is adjusted based on the amount of extracted data from different bibliographic sources. We also employ WordNet to find synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, and the concept of a word for all keywords in each cluster, aiding in the identification of common meanings and concepts.

Overall, our framework seeks to address the challenges of organizing and leveraging the vast amount of academic literature available online, particularly for the community of researchers in Ecuador. By combining multiple bibliographic sources and employing semantic technologies and data mining techniques, we aim to facilitate the identification of common research areas and potential collaboration networks, ultimately fostering greater collaboration and knowledge sharing among academic peers in the region.
