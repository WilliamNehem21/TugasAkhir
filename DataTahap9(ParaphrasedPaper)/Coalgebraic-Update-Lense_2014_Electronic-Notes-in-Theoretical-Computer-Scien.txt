In this paper, we present update lenses as an enhancement of standard (asymmetric) lenses by distinguishing between views and updates. Besides the set of views, we introduce a monoid of updates and an operation of the monoid on the set of views. By separating updates from views, we enable alternative methods of modifying the source beyond simply merging a view into the source. We also delve into a more refined dependently typed version of update lenses.

We provide several descriptions of update lenses in relation to bialgebras, algebras, and coalgebras, which we derive from established facts about distributive laws between comonads/functors, compatible composition of comonads, liftings of comonads/functors to categories of coalgebras, distributive laws of monads/functors over comonads/functors, cofree comonads, adjoint monads, and comonads, among others. We investigate the conversion of views and updates, a tensor of update lenses, and the composition of update lenses. Additionally, we discuss an adaptation, known as initializable update lenses, in the appendix.

Initially, we highlight the inconvenience with using the standard bookshop lens to modify the price of a specific book, as it necessitates listing all books, not just the ones whose prices need editing, due to the single set of views being used in both lookup and update operations. We demonstrate how separating updates from views allows for the reuse of the same set of views for different update strategies.

The category of acts also possesses a product monoidal structure, although due to its complex definition and space constraints, we abstain from discussing it in this paper. For a thorough understanding of the dependently typed version of acts discussed in section 7, we direct the reader to additional resources.

Update lenses, as an advancement of standard lenses, are both practically significant and theoretically elegant. Particularly noteworthy is that update lenses allow for decompositions that standard lenses do not support, as they can be viewed as pairs of matching coalgebras, bialgebras, and so on. These characterizations emerge naturally from various types of distributive laws.

Our future work will involve exploring symmetric variations of update lenses, drawing upon existing research on symmetric lenses and the latest categorical concepts from Johnson and Rosebrugh. We also aim to uncover the precise connections to delta and c-lenses.
