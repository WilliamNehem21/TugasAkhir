In this paper, we provide a summary of the benefits of utilizing hexagonal grids in raster graphics. We embark on an investigation of honeycomb graphics, which uses a 2D version based on a hexagonal grid and a 3D version with hexagonal prisms as voxels. We present an analytical honeycomb geometry of linear objects, drawing parallels to developments in classical raster graphics. Additionally, we demonstrate the advantages of honeycomb graphics, particularly its ability to provide a more accurate approximation of continuous objects without tunnel-like artifacts.

In the realm of image processing and computer graphics, square and cubic models in R2 and R3 are commonly employed. Raster computer graphics are based on a square grid, with pixels representing the square tiles, while cubic grids and voxels are utilized in graphical models in three dimensions. Comparatively, less attention has been focused on hexagonal grids and their associated graphical models. This paper aims to highlight the overlooked advantages of graphical models using hexagonal grids, referred to as "2-hexels," over traditional models. The benefits also extend to the 3D space, where hexagonal prisms, known as "3-hexels," can be employed as voxels. The graphical models based on hexagonal grids are termed honeycomb models, with a focus on motivating and providing theoretical foundations for their development.

A key issue with square grids is the topological challenges they present, particularly in the context of connectivity and the formation of tunnel structures within sets of pixels. This can lead to theoretical difficulties in constructing tunnel-free discretizations of complex objects. The paper proposes the use of honeycomb models as a solution to this problem in sections 3 and 4, leveraging the benefits of hexagonal grids to overcome these challenges. The paper also introduces basic concepts of analytical discrete geometry.

A novel approach in raster graphics involves leveraging analytical discrete geometry to define basic Euclidean primitives and create tools for efficient modeling of complex objects composed of these primitives. The paper outlines these basic definitions and concepts as part of this approach.

The paper further discusses the partitioning of the plane and the construction of an analog of Cartesian analytical geometry in the discrete coordinate plane, laying the groundwork for the application of the proposed honeycomb models.

In the context of 3D honeycomb models, the paper notes the structure of the neighborhood of 3-hexels in two different models and emphasizes that the proposed honeycomb models offer superior discretizations compared to classical models.

In conclusion, the paper proposes honeycomb models for raster graphics based on hexagonal grids and hexagonal prism tilings, showcasing the development of analytical discrete geometry within these models and highlighting their advantages over classical models.
