This paper explores the relationship between fault tolerance and a specific computer security analysis strategy, known as partial model checking. It introduces a process to model fault-tolerant systems, where occurrences of potential faults are incorporated into the system's model. The paper also discusses how the verification of fault tolerance can be approached as a logic formula validation problem. Additionally, it provides an example of a CCS model of a triple modular redundancy system and explains the use of partial model checking in model checking efficiency.
