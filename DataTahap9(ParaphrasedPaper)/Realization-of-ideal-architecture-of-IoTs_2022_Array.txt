Numerous academic papers have been published on the topic of Internet of Things (IoT) since 2000, covering diverse research directions and fields. In this study, the authors have gathered relevant smart city methods and compared them to create a general reference framework for designing urban IoT systems. The paper identifies uncertainty and related problems in meeting the needs of a large integrated network. To address this, the authors apply principal components analysis (PCA) for data compression and anomaly detection, as well as break down the concept of edge computing into detailed steps, including endpoint device computing and fog computing. The aim is to optimize the PCA model by calculating data from endpoint devices on the server and updating parameters of the PCA to the fog computing device in real time, thereby enabling IoT to address uncertainty and errors it encounters in diverse environments.

As time progresses, the characteristics of IoT systems need to be refined. The new network architecture is no longer solely based on traditional internet models for distributing computation or scaling up, but also considers the entire system in terms of total services and applications. The research introduces the concept of self-adaptive frameworks and the platform-as-a-service model, emphasizing the importance of application-independent decentralized services and various IoT applications from the same devices.

The paper emphasizes the necessity of developing machine intelligence due to the specific characteristics of cross-domain applications or services in IoT systems. The authors note that previous studies have been limited by the speed of data collection due to their high dependence on data amount, and propose a feedback mechanism comprising response and reflex modes to endow the overall IoT system with thinking capabilities.

The authors also propose viewing the IoT transmission system from the perspective of biological cells rather than information theory and introduce the concept of the "stem cellular network" (SCN) to reflect the differentiation of modules into various functional cells and the feature of self-renewal.

The paper details the interaction of the SCN with other quadrants, the creation of a wide-area and lightweight transmission network, and the role of the comprehension unit in expanding data to a high-level format. It also addresses issues related to real-time data generation, transmission, recognition of sensor usage or scenarios, early prevention and control of diseases, and the operation of the transmission system.

The study demonstrates the implementation of the core components of the SCN and customer service (CS) in a health-care center, thereby showcasing their functions and potential for performance or functional evolution. The lightweight modular architecture designed for this work is highlighted as being easy to maintain and modify, with potential for further performance or functional improvements.
