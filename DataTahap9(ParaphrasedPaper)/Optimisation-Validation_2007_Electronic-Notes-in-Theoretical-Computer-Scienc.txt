This academic paper introduces the concept of optimization validation, which aims to formally demonstrate that an optimizing transformation enhances a certain resource measure. This concept is distinct from translation validation, which focuses on ensuring that a specific transformation performed by an optimizing compiler preserves semantics. The paper's primary focus is on a program logic for a subset of Java bytecode, which is proven to be sound and complete for a resource-annotated operational semantics, using resource algebras to measure dynamic costs like time and space. The authors also illustrate examples of optimization validation formally verified using Isabelle/HOL, while introducing a type and effect system for measuring static costs such as code size, which is shown to be consistent with the operational semantics.

The paper extends the framework to cover a wider range of resource notions and introduces orderings on resources to establish when one program consumes fewer resources than another. It addresses both static and dynamic costs, leveraging a notion of static resource algebra to measure static costs using a type system with effects. The organization of the paper includes sections on dynamic semantics, resource algebras, program logic, example optimization validations, and a discussion of the static system, concluding with a summary and related work.

The authors discuss the possibility of collecting traces during computation, which can be constrained by additional policies encoded in the higher-order assertion language of their program logic. They also present various optimization examples and outline the validation proofs, demonstrating the effectiveness of their methodology.

The paper acknowledges previous work on verifying compiler correctness and optimizations, highlighting the novelty of their approach in formally and statically verifying optimization improvements in resource usage. The authors reference related work on performance estimation, monitoring, and static analysis, and identify avenues for future research, such as generalizing improvement theory to resource algebras and automating the application of their techniques.
