We present a method that can be utilized to demonstrate that a specified function qualifies as a measurement. We showcase its effectiveness by utilizing it to resolve three challenging cases: capacity in information theory, entropy in quantum mechanics, and global time in general relativity. Additionally, we illustrate how this method offers a new and unexpected characterization of measurement, and establish that, in principle, it can be universally applied.

Previously, it was unclear whether capacity constituted a measurement. It was demonstrated that c measured its kernel, yet the complexity of the argument hindered its extension to all channels. However, as demonstrated in Theorem 3.2, we can now prove that capacity measures the entire interval domain without requiring any additional effort.

Formerly, we regarded the bijection n i[0, 1] as a means of transferring domain theoretic structure from i[0, 1] to n. However, it can also be viewed as a technique to transfer topological structure from n to i[0, 1]. Specifically, we topologize i[0, 1] using the Euclidean topology inherited by n as a subset of the plane, representing i[0, 1] as the region of the unit square below and including the main diagonal.
