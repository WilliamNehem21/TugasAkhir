Following the standard levelling process, there remains some residual magnetic error. This error, which is a weak non-geological effect, appears as streaky noise along flight lines, posing a challenge for processing and interpreting airborne geophysical data. Microleveling, as a standard step in aerogeophysical data processing, aims to eliminate this residual noise. In this paper, we propose a two-step procedure for microleveling single aerogeophysical data. First, we utilize a deep convolutional network to approximate the original data and separate it into low-level geological structures and a residual component containing high-level geological details. Subsequently, we employ a mixture of Gaussian robust principal component analysis (mog-rpca) to isolate the weak energy fine structures from the residual component. The resulting microleveling is a combination of the low-level structures from the deep convolutional network and the fine structures from mog-rpca. The deep convolutional network acts as a prior to capture the low-level geological structures without requiring a training dataset. Our experiments on synthetic data and field data confirm that the combination of deep convolutional network and mog-rpca is an effective framework for microleveling single aerogeophysical data.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II provides a detailed introduction to the deep convolutional network and mog-rpca; Section III presents the model structure and parameter selection process used in this paper. In Section IV, we conduct experiments and discuss the results. Finally, in Section V, we draw our conclusions.

In the effort to achieve microleveling, various methods have been proposed in the literature. Fedi et al. (2003) proposed a discrete wavelet transform-based method for extracting space-localized anomaly details from magnetic fields. Gao et al. (2021) designed a leveling method based on curvelet transform, which effectively removes leveling error in data due to the multi-scale and multi-directional features of curvelet transform.

The utilization of deep convolutional networks as handcrafted priors has shown excellent applications in fields such as image denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting. For instance, Liu et al. (2021) applied a U-Net structure as a seismic data prior for seismic data missing trace reconstruction, while Qiu et al. (2021) proposed an unsupervised denoising method for seismic random noise attenuation using convnets. These approaches demonstrate the ability of deep convolutional networks to capture low-level image statistics priors and apply them effectively in various data processing tasks.

To separate the fine-scale structures from the residual obtained from the deep convolutional network, we use mog-rpca. Robust principal component analysis (rpca) is a powerful method for decomposing data into low-rank and sparse matrices. The mog-rpca method, which models data noise as a mixture of Gaussians, has been shown to effectively address random noise removal and background subtraction in various fields.

We find that most of the fine structures retained in the residual after processing with the deep convolutional network are sparse, which can be extracted using mog-rpca. By utilizing this method to extract the fine structures and adding them to the low-level geological structures obtained using the deep convolutional network, we can realize the microleveling of aerogeophysical data as per the two-step procedure proposed.

In summary, our proposed method employs a deep convolutional network to capture low-level geological structures in the aerogeophysical data and mog-rpca to further extract weak energy fine structures in the residual, resulting in effective microleveling of aerogeophysical data. The two-step microleveling procedure can be utilized to generate labels for supervised machine learning microleveling methods.
