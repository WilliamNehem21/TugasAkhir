The proof is derived from the examination of several instances. Each of these instances contains a reducing triple for g, which conflicts with the assertion that g is irreducible. The extended abstract includes only the proof of (i).

Furthermore, we have established a slightly more robust version of lemma 4.4 for a finite set of planar 3-trees. This finding will be utilized in the subsequent section. When a planar 3-tree g contains a copy h of k4, g(h) denotes the pair (i, j), where i (or j) is the maximum (or minimum) number of vertices of g inside a face of h. We define a planar 3-tree g as "restricted" if it contains a copy h of k4 such that g(h) = (2, 0). In this scenario, we consistently designate the face of h without any vertices of g inside as the outward face of g; that is, the vertices of g that are not in h are depicted in the internal faces of h. Moreover, if h additionally possesses two faces, each with exactly one vertex of g inside, we classify g as "super restricted."
