This paper can be compared to two categories of related research. Firstly, a significant amount of work in the deep learning community addresses tasks such as regression from images, image segmentation, and object detection. However, these tools have seldom been applied to support the wood processing industry. On the other hand, there are works specifically focused on wood imagery, utilizing traditional imaging techniques on planks or trunks, as well as x-ray tomography.

Instead of proposing a new architecture, the authors utilized existing convolutional neural network architectures with excellent performance on various image tasks. The chosen networks were specifically tailored for regression on images, with the ResNet-34 architecture being selected due to its balance of parameters and performance, as well as its proven success in image classification tasks. The authors also leveraged the ResNet-34 architecture's ability to handle images of varying sizes and performed transfer learning to achieve high performance with minimal training epochs.

To enhance the performance of the neural networks, the authors explored various data augmentation strategies and regularization techniques. The chosen data augmentations included transformations such as shift, scale, color augmentation, random flipping, and rotations. Furthermore, the authors trained the network using the convolutional part pretrained on ImageNet and experimented with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

The authors conducted their tasks using Python and PyTorch with NVIDIA CUDA, and utilized metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) for predictor quality, as well as dice coefficient, accuracy, and mean intersection over union (IoU) for segmentation tasks. The results demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the deep learning-based approach for tasks such as tree centerline regression, contour estimation, and knot detection in wood imagery, highlighting the generalization capacity of the models across different species and shapes, despite limited annotated data.
