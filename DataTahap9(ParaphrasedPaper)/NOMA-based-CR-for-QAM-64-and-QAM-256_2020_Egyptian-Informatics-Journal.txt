The efficient utilization of the spectrum without any loss is achieved by implementing super coding (SC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) with filters at the transceiver of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). This approach enables multiple users to access the spectrum simultaneously in the power domain on the same channel. It is found that this technique can utilize the spectrum both in the presence and absence of primary users (PUs), leading to increased system throughput. The study also integrates NOMA with a matched filter detection technique for smarter spectrum allocation, which has not been previously implemented in NOMA-based cognitive radio (CR) systems. The system's performance is evaluated based on parameters such as probability of detection (PD), probability of false alarm (PFA), bit error rate (BER) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and power spectral density (PSD).

The paper also presents the analysis of communication rates for nominal 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) systems to assess the performance of the proposed systems. It introduces a matched filter spectrum detection technique and evaluates its performance based on PD and PFA at various SNR values, demonstrating improved spectrum detection at 25 dB SNR.

Furthermore, a cooperative spectrum sensing model based on decision statistic (DS) function is presented, which enhances the sensing performance by analyzing the power, waveform, and spectrum of licensed users. A joint optimization technique based on Lagrange decomposition is introduced to alleviate spectrum shortage issues.

The study also implements cooperative cognitive radio for multiple users using cyclostationary techniques, demonstrating enhanced spectrum detection for multiple users at the cost of higher computational complexity. Moreover, an energy-efficient system is proposed to reduce the average power consumption of IoT devices while maintaining performance.

The paper also investigates the integration of matched filter spectrum sensing technique into NOMA for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-64 and QAM-256, aiming to enhance spectrum utilization, spectral performance, and quality of service. The proposed technique is shown to improve PD, BER, and reduce PFA, with the simulation results indicating shorter sensing time and detection achieved at a minimum SNR for a static threshold value.
