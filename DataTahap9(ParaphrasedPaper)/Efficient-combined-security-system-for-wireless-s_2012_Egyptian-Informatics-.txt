This paper proposes the integration of the kerberos and ecmqv protocols to create a combined system aimed at enhancing network security and reducing energy consumption. The integration is also designed to improve network speed by minimizing the number of communications and calculations. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work, including the lightweight kerberos protocol with short messages and ecmqv. Section 3 explains the implementation of the combined security system and its effectiveness for wireless sensor networks. Section 4 discusses the results of the combined system in comparison to the two aforementioned protocols. Finally, the paper concludes with Section 5.

In the context of sensor networks, key establishment involves the deployment of nodes that create a shared secret key through key transport or key agreement (or exchange). In key transport, an entity generates or obtains a secret key and securely transfers it to other entities, while in key agreement, all participating entities contribute a random input to derive a shared secret key. Key agreement offers the advantage of preventing entities from predetermining the resulting key as it depends on the inputs of all participants.

The paper outlines the setup of shared secret keys for entities and explains the process by which the shared secret key is determined by entity 'a'. Furthermore, it discusses the division of a wireless sensor network into clusters, each of which contains multiple sensor nodes and one elected as the coordinator (head). The head is responsible for the overall mission, including collecting data from other nodes and routing it to the sink. As a result, the head's energy consumption is higher than that of other nodes. Additionally, the paper emphasizes that the energy analysis of the kerberos protocol is based on the assumption that entity 'a' can directly send and receive messages to and from the third party 't', which is reasonable for small sensor networks but not for larger networks where the sensor nodes may be located far from the base station. It is noted that multi-hop communication between 'a' and 't' increases overall energy consumption, as each intermediary node has to forward the message to its neighbor.

The paper highlights the potential benefits of using the combined system, supported by experimental results. It acknowledges that there may be some additional load when switching between the two protocols in Layer 2, using kerberos for communication with Layer 1 and ecmqv for communication among nodes in Layer 2 and between Layers 2 and 3. However, the paper suggests that this additional load is outweighed by the savings in power and the improvements in security achieved through the combined system.

In summary, the paper presents a combined security system that integrates lightweight kerberos and ecmqv protocols, aiming to benefit from the strengths of both protocols. The system aims to enhance energy consumption by reducing the number of communications and computations, thereby improving network speed. Furthermore, it seeks to improve network security by leveraging the strengths of both lightweight kerberos and ecmqv protocols. The experimental results indicate that the overall energy cost of using the combined system is lower than that of using lightweight kerberos or ecmqv alone, based on the energy characteristics of the wireless sensor node.
