Each unit can be either a single site pi= s or a collection of several co-located sites pi=(s1|...|sti). For instance, a basic structure a b c enables chemical reactions to take place among three different molecules presenting sites a, b, and c respectively. On the other hand, the structure a(b|c) permits reactions between site a on one molecule and sites b and c on another. Similarly, a pattern (a|b|c) allows unimolecular reactions involving a, b, and c all situated on a single molecular complex.

In the previous section, we discussed how gene regulation can be represented at a molecular level by modeling all potential binding states of the regulatory region. However, such detailed modeling may not always be necessary to create a useful representation of regulatory interactions within a network. In this section, we will present a general-purpose, high-level model of gene transcription and translation in the bond calculus and demonstrate how affinity patterns and general kinetic laws can be utilized to capture the interconnecting regulatory patterns. We will also examine the specific instance of the plant circadian clock.

These species can interact at various sites following the central dogma of molecular biology. For instance, interaction at site cx leads to genex being transcribed into its RNA form (mRNAx), while interaction at site tx causes mRNAx to be translated into its protein form (proteinx). Additionally, we allow for the decay of mRNAx by interaction at site dmx and for the decay of proteinx by interaction at site dx. Lastly, proteinx has an extra site ix (influence) that does not alter its state but enables it to act as an activator or repressor for other reactions.
