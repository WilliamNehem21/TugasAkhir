This paper introduces the use of Euler diagrams to represent virtual directories, which are collections of files computed on demand and subject to various constraints. The authors also briefly discuss the integration of this new capability into the VennFS project, outlining a data structure called the EulerTree, which is based on the R-tree and designed to handle queries related to a given Euler diagram and its sets. The paper emphasizes the intuitive nature of hierarchical file systems in traditional office settings and discusses systems such as Presto, WinFS, and Ximian Evolution that utilize unique approaches to organizing and managing files. Furthermore, the paper highlights the user-friendly nature of Euler diagrams, which can be employed to create classifications based on user-defined attributes. Additionally, the paper presents a detailed description of the data structure representing planar subdivisions and explains the algorithm used to insert new rectangles while maintaining their disjointedness. Finally, the paper discusses the potential application of Euler diagrams in organizing information in contexts such as emails and bookmarks and refers to related research by Johns and Blake in the field of cognitive maps in virtual environments.
