This study focuses on balancing sensing, security, and performance considerations in cognitive radio networks (CRN). The proposed model involves encrypting and transmitting arriving signals from secondary users when an idle encryption node is found. Additionally, the model incorporates security measures to halt CRN operations upon intrusion detection. The impact of encryption and security measures is evaluated, and the optimal sensing time at which the tradeoff between these factors is maximized is determined. The model uses sensing time as a benchmark for assessing performance improvements resulting from scalability.
