This paper provides several examples of algorithm synthesis using the lazy thinking approach, demonstrating how the resulting algorithm is influenced by the chosen algorithm scheme. It also outlines the implementation details of the lazy thinking algorithm synthesis method within the theorema system, emphasizing that the synthesis of example algorithms can be accomplished automatically, without requiring user interaction.

All formal developments in this paper are presented using the theorema system, with all formulas expressed in the theorema syntax. Additionally, the method's implementation is illustrated through a specific example within the theorema system.

Based on our observation of data types included in the problem specification, it is evident that there are relatively few valuable algorithm schemes suitable for storage in a library. While there are numerous algorithms available, there are only a limited number of algorithm schemes. This implies that for a given data type, there exist only a few fundamental approaches for addressing specified problems, with a multitude of variations and instantiations of these approaches, as well as numerous combinations of these approaches with subalgorithm ideas (schemes).

Further, it is noteworthy that the second formula serves as a natural specification for the split functions. It indicates that when a tuple x is split using the functions l and r, combining the splits through concatenation yields a tuple containing exactly the elements of the original x.
