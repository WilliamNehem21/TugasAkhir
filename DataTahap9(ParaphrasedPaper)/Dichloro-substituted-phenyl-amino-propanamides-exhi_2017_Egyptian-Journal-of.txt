Epilepsy presents a significant disability for those affected, and its treatment involves the use of antiepileptic drugs that can inhibit the firing of neurons. The generation of normal and seizure-related neuronal activity is controlled by voltage-gated sodium channels, which play a crucial role in the electrical signaling of cells, regulating membrane potential and determining neuronal excitability. These channels are also targets for antiepileptic medications. By blocking voltage-dependent sodium channels, it is possible to reduce abnormal neuronal firing by decreasing the number of available channels. Previous studies have indicated an increase in the expression of nav1.6, an isoform of voltage-dependent sodium channel, in animal models of epilepsy.

This study was conducted at the University of KwaZulu, South Africa. Data for both proton and carbon-13 NMR were reported as chemical shift in parts per million (ppm). Mass spectra were obtained using an AP2000 (IS, 70eV) instrument at the University of Virginia, USA.

Mice of both sexes were divided into twelve groups, each consisting of six mice. Group 1 served as the control, while groups 2, 3, and 4 were administered fluphenamic acid (i.p.) at doses of 20, 10, and 5 mg/kg, respectively. One hour after the administration of fluphenamic acid, these mice...

The design of the test compounds (DCP23, DCP25, and DCP34) was based on a proposed pharmacophore model for compounds acting as blockers of voltage-gated sodium channels [15, 16]. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) confirmed the presence of expected functional groups in the compounds. Similarly, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for the three compounds were recorded, and spectral analysis revealed the structures of the products.
