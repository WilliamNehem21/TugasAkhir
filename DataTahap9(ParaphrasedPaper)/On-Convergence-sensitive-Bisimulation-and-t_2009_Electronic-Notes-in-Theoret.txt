As mentioned previously, the tccs model draws inspiration from the concept of time in the esterel model and its related models such as sl. These models utilize signals as the fundamental means of communication. In contrast to a channel, a signal persists within a particular moment and ceases to exist at the end of that moment. It is evident that a signal can be recursively defined in the tccs model.

This paper has introduced a natural concept of bisimulation that is sensitive to context and convergence, demonstrating that it can be characterized by a variation of the customary notion of labeled bisimulation based on the idea of contextual convergence. As a direct consequence of this characterization, it has been shown that (untimed) ccs processes are fully abstractly embedded in timed ones. Additionally, the notion of bisimulation has been refined to account for divergence sensitivity.
