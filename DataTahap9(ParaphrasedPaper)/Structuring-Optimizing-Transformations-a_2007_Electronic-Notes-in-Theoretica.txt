One interesting possibility enabled by this approach is a new method for validating optimizer implementations. By instrumenting an optimizer to produce a trace of its transformations using transformation primitives, the conformance of the trace with the optimizer can be verified through simulation. If the trace satisfies the soundness conditions of the underlying primitives, it preserves semantics.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the specification mechanism. Section 3 describes the verification technique and introduces TTL. Section 4 proposes a validation scheme. Section 5 explains how proof obligations can be automatically generated from the optimizations' specifications in PVS. Section 6 reviews related work, while Section 7 concludes the paper and suggests future directions.

The paper then specifies control flow analyses for identifying loops, defining properties such as domination, strongly connected components, and loops within a program. Additionally, it introduces the transformation primitive "re" and how it can be used for loop invariant code motion in a given program.

The paper also discusses the process of proving the soundness of the transformation primitive "re" in a specific optimization scenario.

Furthermore, the paper outlines a validation scheme that involves abstracting the input program and deriving its transformed version by simulating the trace on the abstraction. The scheme also checks whether the soundness conditions of the transformation primitives in the trace are met, ensuring that the optimizer preserves the semantics of the input program.

The paper also provides insights into the development of high-level proof strategies for discharging proof obligations and references the Verifix project, which addresses correct compiler construction.

Moreover, the paper suggests a novel validation scheme for optimizers, focusing on the generation and conformance checking of transformation traces, and discusses plans for developing TTL inference rules for various transformations and extending the framework to handle different types of optimizations.
