Detecting earthquakes is essential for seismologists in order to monitor tectonic activities in a specific area. Various automated methods have been developed for reliable earthquake monitoring, with template matching and short-time average/long-time average (STA/LTA) being the most advanced conventional algorithms for earthquake detection and seismic phase identification. However, template matching relies heavily on predefined events, which makes detection challenging for unseen data, while STA/LTA may not perform well for signals with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low magnitudes.

In this paper, we present a methodology focusing on seismic phase identification, which takes a 4-second window of three-channel seismogram data as input and outputs probabilities for P-wave window, S-wave window, and noise window. We experimented with various ResNet blocks, including 1D-ResNet18, 1D-ResNet34, and 1D-ResNet50, and found that 1D-ResNet34 outperformed the others with a 98.70% accuracy. Our proposed model achieved better performance for earthquake detection and seismic phase classification compared to existing models such as CapsNet and CapsPhase, which we attribute to the ability of ResNet's residual blocks to learn meaningful features from the input.

Our proposed method was compared with CapsPhase, and the testing accuracies of the two methods were found to be 94.39% and 95.68%, respectively, with 1D-ResNet demonstrating better performance, particularly in S-phase identification. Furthermore, we evaluated the model's performance with noisy data by introducing Gaussian noise to the dataset and found that the proposed model maintained high performance even in the presence of noise, making it suitable for identifying earthquake signals and phases, especially in the case of noisy low-magnitude earthquake waveforms.

In future work, we plan to develop a hierarchical classifier to complete the tasks of earthquake detection and seismic phase identification and to investigate the use of the pre-trained phase classifier for improving the phase arrival time picking on continuous seismic waveforms. It is important to note that this study is solely focused on seismic phase identification, and future work will explore its broader applications.
