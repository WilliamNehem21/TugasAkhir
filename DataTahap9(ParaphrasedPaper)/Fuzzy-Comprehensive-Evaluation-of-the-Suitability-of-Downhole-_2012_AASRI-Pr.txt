Wells can effectively decelerate the water and gas cones, expanding the area covered by gas or water drive, increasing individual well productivity, and improving oil recovery. The choke flow of ICD can regulate downhole production layer flow, adjust production profiles, and optimize oil and gas output. However, various factors can impact the productivity of horizontal wells with ICD, making it challenging to describe, analyze, and evaluate them due to their ambiguity and uncertainty. To address this issue, this study introduces a fuzzy mathematical method, which utilizes the theory of fuzzy set to integrate an evaluating matrix and the objective fuzzy matrix. This method can provide an objective assessment of various factors and accurately quantify evaluations. The key aspect of establishing an optimized evaluation model using fuzzy mathematics lies in determining the evaluating index factor, index weight, and subordinate function matrix that affect the suitability of ICD, and then constructing the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model.

When comprehensively evaluating the suitability of ICD completion across different scenarios, the relative fitness rij ranges from 0 to 1. A higher value of rij indicates greater suitability for ICD completion. The matrix containing all rij values represents the fuzzy comprehensive suitability matrix of ICD completion, denoted as r(x).
