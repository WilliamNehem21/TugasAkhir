The careful reader will recognize the significance of automated formal debugging algorithms for reasons beyond just making the logic debugging process more efficient and less frustrating. In addition to fixing implementation errors, these techniques are crucial for design revision in response to specification changes. Late discovery of a specification error during the design cycle often leads to patching the old implementation to align with the new specification, rather than starting the synthesis process anew. This process, known as eco, requires efficient methodologies for design revisions. Both eco and error debugging can be formulated as rectification problems in the logic domain.

Structural techniques involve the use of gate dominators, various cut-point generation algorithms, and other circuit structural information to identify and illustrate similarities between the specification and the implementation. These techniques also include cone intersection, which determines that a signal not in the intersection of the incorrect outputs' fan-in cones cannot be solely responsible for the error and, therefore, cannot be the error site. Additionally, back-propagation techniques aim to pinpoint the root cause of an erroneous output by tracing signal paths regulated by gates with inputs set to the controlling values.

Analytical techniques make use of satisfiability (SAT) solvers and recent advances in the field. An ideal debugging algorithm architecture should involve a strategy to identify which gates in the circuit need to be modified to correct the observed incorrect values at the circuit outputs for a user-defined set of counterexamples. The rationale behind this approach is that gates capable of correcting the circuit output for a large number of counterexamples are likely to be the actual root cause of the design error.
