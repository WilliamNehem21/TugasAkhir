In this paper, one can express nondeterminism using the "if... fi" construct, infinite nondeterminism using "x:=?" to denote that x is assigned an arbitrary natural number, and iteration using the "do... od" construct. Here, e and b refer to expressions and boolean expressions, respectively. For simplicity, it is assumed that the evaluation of an expression in a given state never results in an error. Errors can be introduced explicitly by the "abort" command or implicitly by a non-applicable "if" instance. The calculation of the maximal fixpoint is complex, and a comparison with a function mentioned in this paper is made, which is continuous although this fact has neither been proven nor utilized in this paper. When applied to the same example, the function yields stability of approximation after only two steps from the empty relation as the starting point, using a much simpler calculation. It is suggested that a study similar to the one in this paper could be conducted, using the union and intersection operators as parameters. It is emphasized that the discussed points hold true in all cases, in contrast to the usual Smyth ordering, where the set of valid total correctness formulae related to c1 is a subset of those related to c2, provided that c1 approximates c2 (i.e., the logical characterization is monotonic).
