We expand the concept of substitution with exceptions to encompass solution pairs containing a freshness context and a substitution with exceptions (defined as definition 3.5). Furthermore, we introduce a modified version of the consistency test algorithm (algorithm 1) to address solution pairs with exceptions. This serves as a broadened instantiation concept and presents various findings on the consistency of pairs with exceptions. In section 4, we demonstrate how to address nominal constraint problems by adapting the nominal unification algorithm. Additionally, in section 5, we discuss related work, and section 6 provides the paper's conclusion.

The following sections of this paper will focus on addressing these types of issues. Initially, we establish a precise definition of a solution for nominal constraint problems. It is important to note that our objective is to develop a nominal generalization of the existing concept of solution instantiation (definition 2.8), while ensuring that instantiation closure is maintained.
