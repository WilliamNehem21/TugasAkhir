Initially, we explore the interrelationships between various measures. By considering two dimensional functions, g and h, a comparison between hh and hg can be made by comparing the behaviors of the functions g and h near zero. The subsequent lemma establishes a connection between the behavior of the dimension functions g and h and the corresponding measures hh and hg.
