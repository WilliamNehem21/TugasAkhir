In Asia, specifically the northeast region of India, there is a rich diversity of flora and fauna, including economically valuable microbes that have yet to be fully explored. Fish and meat are important sources of food globally, and in the region of Assam, India, probiotic bacteria have traditionally been used in the production of yogurt and cheese. The microbial communities in fermented fish and meat, which are traditional foods of the ethnic groups in Assam, have been largely uninvestigated. This study aimed to identify indigenous probiotic candidates in fermented fish and meat products using a comprehensive approach that considers the safety and potential applications of the isolated strains, as well as their ability to survive the gastrointestinal tract to provide health benefits.

The chemicals and consumables used in the study were purchased from Merck India Pvt. Ltd., and all microbiological media were obtained from Himedia India Pvt. Ltd. Bacterial growth was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800, Japan), and centrifugation was carried out using a Sigma 3-30K centrifuge from Germany.
