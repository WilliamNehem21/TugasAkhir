Despite being in use for more than ten years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are now widely utilized in various modern applications such as medical monitoring, disaster management, and environmental monitoring. However, these networks face challenges related to limited energy and a short lifespan, as well as low channel bandwidth. One approach to addressing these challenges is clustering, which has been shown to be effective in conserving the energy of WSNs. The Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is a fundamental work in WSN clustering, but it has drawbacks, particularly in the setup phase where cluster heads (CHs) are selected randomly. This study seeks to enhance LEACH by identifying cluster heads based on their energy consumption, with the aim of improving the performance and prolonging the lifetime of WSNs.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks of distributed, small-scale systems that consist of numerous miniaturized, distributed, and limited-energy sensor nodes. These nodes collect environmental data and transmit it to a base station for processing and analysis. Due to the non-rechargeable power of the small batteries in sensor nodes, WSNs suffer from limited energy and a short lifespan. Clustering has been recognized as a beneficial technique for conserving the energy of WSNs, as it reduces communication costs and prolongs the network lifetime.

Energy consumption, particularly in communication, is a major concern in WSNs. While clustering can effectively reduce energy consumption, the random selection of cluster heads in LEACH introduces several issues, such as energy depletion and lack of constraints on the number of cluster heads. This study proposes an enhanced version of LEACH, called IE2-LEACH, which addresses these issues by selecting cluster heads based on their energy consumption and introducing a scheduling mechanism for efficient energy consumption.

The IE2-LEACH protocol aims to improve the cluster head selection process in WSNs by introducing a method to identify capable nodes as cluster heads, defining the roles of each cluster head, and balancing energy usage among the cluster head and its counterparts. The study presents simulation results and concludes by highlighting future research directions for improving WSNs. Several related works that address energy consumption and clustering in WSNs are also reviewed, with a particular focus on their approaches to cluster head selection and energy conservation.

In summary, this study introduces the IE2-LEACH protocol as an enhancement to the LEACH protocol, with the goal of improving energy consumption, prolonging the lifetime of WSNs, and enhancing their data transmission capabilities.
