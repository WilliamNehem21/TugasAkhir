Deduction graphs are designed to generalize both the natural deduction systems of Gentzen-Prawitz and the flag deduction systems of Fitch. These graphs are structured as acyclic directed graphs with boxes. This paper explores deduction graphs for minimal proposition logic and extends the study to include first-order universal quantification, demonstrating the versatility of the concept of deduction graphs.

The process of renaming is not straightforward, as it involves not only the nodes within the box but also the variable x in node 16. Renaming x in node 16 requires updating all nodes that reference node 16 and propagating these changes throughout the graph. This renaming process can potentially affect any node within the graph, including nodes 1 and 2, making it not only complex but also potentially unsolvable a priori.

In Section 2, we present the definition of deduction graphs with universal quantification, referred to as DGUs, building upon the definitions for terms and formulas of first-order predicate logic. Section 3 discusses the process of cut-elimination, followed by a discussion of strong normalization in Section 4. Section 5 concludes by comparing DGUs with developments in proof nets.

We introduce a criterion to easily determine whether a given closed box directed graph is a DGU (Lemma 2.6). Since the eigenvariable of a box is an important concept for DGUs, we establish a similar notion for general closed box directed graphs, defining a variable u as a box-variable of b if u is absent in the label of the box node of b, but is present in the label of the node to which the box node points. It is worth noting that for DGUs, the concepts of eigenvariable and box-variable coincide. Additionally, we revisit the notion of a box-topological ordering.

A depth-conflict exists in the DGU G if there is a cut with major premiss n and conclusion p at a greater depth, with an arrow from p to n being the only arrow to n. In such cases, the incorporation of G at n, p is achieved by moving the box of n, denoted as Bn, into the box at the lowest depth that includes p but excludes n.
