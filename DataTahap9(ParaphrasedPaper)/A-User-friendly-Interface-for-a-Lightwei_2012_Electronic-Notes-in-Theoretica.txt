User-friendly interfaces can have a significant impact on making the advantages of using machine-readable representations of formal arguments more accessible to a broader audience. These benefits are prevalent in both mathematical education and research endeavors involving mathematical rigor. They encompass the ability to reuse arguments, automatically evaluate examples, and utilize machine verification. Machine verification can range from identifying basic errors, such as the existence of unbound variables, to more complex validation techniques.

The task of the parser is to handle the concrete syntax of the portion of an argument being considered for verification. The concrete syntax parser is implemented in Haskell using the Parsec parser combinator library, which is powerful enough to construct infinite lookahead parsers for general context-sensitive grammars. This library is user-friendly and facilitates concise parser implementation. The Aartifact parser exhibits swift performance on all inputs tested, with the infinite lookahead capability being employed in only a few instances, such as enabling expert users to define their own infix operators. The overarching approach to processing syntactic idioms using a context-sensitive parser is akin to the design of the parser for the fortress programming language.

The Aartifact system has been employed in formulating and reasoning about a compositional formalism for a typed domain-specific language. The ability to implicitly invoke propositions related to the algebra of sets was crucial in making this process manageable and ensuring that resulting proofs are comprehensible. This endeavor also led to the identification of minor errors and the streamlining of a few definitions in the compositional formalism.

Work related to providing search capabilities for an expression library has been conducted in the context of Haskell. Search facilities have been developed to enable users to retrieve and explore expressions within a context based on their type, and an online search tool called Hoogle exists for navigating the Haskell libraries. Additionally, Hallgren and Ranta's work introduces a proof editor that utilizes a natural language parsing framework in conjunction with type checking to assist users in employing supported formal and natural language syntactic constructs while crafting a verifiable proof. The automation of the Matita proof assistant heavily relies on an integrated search engine. Previous research has also focused on retrieving library functions and automatically generating programming language code snippets using keyword collections. This work suggests that future efforts could concentrate on enhancing the integration of real-time lookup functionality with validation capabilities. For instance, real-time lookup hints could provide suggestions for valid expressions comprised of variables within the scope of an argument assertion. Moreover, it may be feasible to represent certain basic validation techniques, such as unbound variable detection, entirely as JavaScript applications.
