Determining minimum identifying, locating-dominating, open locating-dominating, or locating total-dominating codes in a graph G presents challenges and is recognized to be computationally difficult for general graphs, representing variations of the classic minimum dominating set problem in G. Consequently, a common approach is to ascertain the size of minimum such codes in specific classes of graphs. This study investigates how the minimum such codes change under three graph operations: the addition of a universal vertex, the formation of the generalized corona of a graph, and the formation of the square of a graph. By applying these operations to paths and cycles, we are able to determine the minimum codes in most resulting graph classes.

Regarding the locating total-dominating (LTD) problem, we note that it is equally challenging as the old problem, with the same arguments applying. Upper bounds for the LTD number of trees can be found in references [11,12]. Additionally, we explore the LTD number in special families of graphs, such as cubic graphs and grid graphs.
