The paper discusses how agents, with limited perception and interaction capabilities, represent and react to their external environment. It focuses on analyzing how the behavior of an agent may be influenced by its perceptions of the environment rather than how the agent acquires those perceptions. The paper introduces the concept of environment representation, which is a partial and evolving representation of the external environment based on the agent's perceptions.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the formal definition of probabilistic environment representation and explores how assumptions about the probabilities of environment perceptions can be used to analyze the behavior of the agent. The notion of possible beliefs is introduced to characterize the set of conclusions that a program can draw from initial interpretations while reacting to environment perceptions.

The paper also discusses the notion of likely beliefs, which provides a practical representation of a subset of the probabilistic beliefs. It introduces the concept of invariant of a program, which defines the properties that hold at each stage of the program computation.

The paper references previous works in computational logic in multi-agent systems, such as the impact system, and discusses the use of computational logic to represent incomplete information in multi-agent systems. It also touches on the topic of abductive logic programming and its potential application in expressing forms of interaction among agents.

Finally, the paper highlights the relevance of the presented formalization in supporting effective, resource-bounded quantitative analyses of the probabilistic behaviors of reactive agents through the notions of probabilistic beliefs and probabilistic invariants.
