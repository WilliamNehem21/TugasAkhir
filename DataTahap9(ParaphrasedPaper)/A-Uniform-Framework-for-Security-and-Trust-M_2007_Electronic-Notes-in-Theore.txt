Security concerns are closely intertwined with cooperation aspects within pervasive and autonomous computing systems, which are comprised of various entities that must collaborate and share resources to achieve specific objectives. Cooperation is often linked to trust, as entities are more likely to collaborate with parties they trust. This study focuses on integrating formal modeling and analysis of security and trust. Specifically, it introduces a framework for uniformly modeling security protocols and trust and reputation management procedures, such as automated trust negotiation (ATN). The framework demonstrates a strong connection between methodologies for establishing, managing, and negotiating trust and the security mechanisms used to ensure information confidentiality and integrity.

The framework typically models cryptography by representing encryptions as algebraic terms, such as using "mk" to represent the encryption of a message "m" with a key "k." Decryption, the inverse operation, can generally only be performed with the correct information, such as the decryption key. The goal is to unify trust features within an existing security framework, as it is important to consider how credentials are formatted, negotiated, and managed in dynamic, fully interconnected systems where resource access may depend on user-presented credentials.

The paper also discusses the potential use of trust values, where credentials carry a weight expressing the level of trust one entity has in another for performing a specific function. The calculation of trust values is dependent on specific inference rules. By modeling both security protocols and trust management policies within a single framework, the study aims to easily relate different concepts. For instance, it formally demonstrates the relationship between the notion of privacy in trust negotiation and the concept of non-interference in security.

Additionally, the paper introduces the "rt" family of languages, developed by Li et al., for managing and expressing trust relationships among entities. The "rt" family incorporates policies defining attributes of principals based on assertions of other principals and combines role-based access control (RBAC) and trust management to manage distributed authority through credentials.
