Zadeh introduced fuzzy set theory in 1965 to address uncertainties in mathematical language, a concept that has become significant in modern society, where uncertainty abounds. It has gained attention from researchers for its practical applications as a powerful tool for handling uncertainty. Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), which extends fuzzy set theory, is particularly noteworthy as it is able to account for uncertainties from both positive and negative perspectives using membership and non-membership degrees, making it more effective than fuzzy set theory. The notion of distance measure in IFS theory, which represents the discrepancy between IFSs, has found wide practical applications such as in pattern recognition, decision making, and medical diagnosis. Although first defined by Szmidt and Kacprzyk in 2000, numerous distance measures have since been proposed to enhance accuracy and practical significance.

The capabilities of intuitionistic fuzzy set theory in addressing uncertainties suggest its potential in solving the portfolio selection problem in uncertain environments. Researchers have proposed a fuzzy linear higher order moment portfolio selection model to capitalize on this feature. To facilitate investment ranking, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, introduced by Hwang and Yoon in 1981, has been extended to fuzzy environments and extensively applied to solving Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems. However, conventional TOPSIS has limitations, such as neglecting the weights of positive and negative ideal solutions distances, as pointed out by Dwivedi et al. Moreover, it does not provide guidance on allocating investment ratios for selected investments, hindering effective risk distribution in portfolio selection.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces basic concepts of IFS and the TOPSIS method, Section 3 modifies the conventional TOPSIS method, Section 4 presents three linear portfolio optimization programming models based on distance measure, Section 5 provides a numerical application to assess the effectiveness and practicality of the models, and conducts a sensitivity analysis, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

Entropy is integral to intuitionistic fuzzy theory as it represents the degree of uncertainty in IFS and has wide applications. In this paper, entropy is employed to assign weights to each criterion in the TOPSIS method. The higher the entropy, the greater the uncertainty and the less the investment intention, which necessitates the maximization of total weighted negative ideal solution distance and the minimization of total weighted positive ideal solution distance. Additionally, each selected investment should have positive investment ratios. 

Furthermore, the Electre approach, initially proposed by Benayoun et al., is widely used for MCDM, especially with uncertainties addressed by the IF Electre method developed by Wu and Chen. The modified TOPSIS method can help investors properly estimate the returns and risks of stocks when historical data is insufficient or unavailable, which is crucial for constructing a rational portfolio strategy.
