We define the truth assignment for each edge (x, c) as follows: if an edge of b belongs to g but not to g1, then the truth value of the corresponding literal is set to true. If two edges correspond to the positive and negative literals of the same variable x, this creates an induced subgraph h in g, which contradicts the situation.

Our approach involves implementing a simple rule: every optional edge corresponding to a true literal is added to g1 to construct a "sandwich" graph g, and then searching for a side-effect h sandwich subgraph. It is important to note that every vertex in the constructed instance (g1, g2) belongs to either an hc clause subgraph or an hx variable subgraph, and possibly to both. While a vertex may belong to at most one hx variable subgraph, it is possible for a vertex to belong to multiple hc clause subgraphs. A side-effect h is an induced subgraph isomorphic to h of some sandwich graph g, such that h is associated with neither an hc clause subgraph nor an hx variable subgraph.

We choose optional edges corresponding to true literals to define a sandwich graph g. As the simple rule eliminates all hc clause subgraphs of g1 without creating an hx variable subgraph of g2, we need to prove that the sandwich graph g does not contain any side-effect induced subgraph h associated with neither an hc clause subgraph nor an hx variable subgraph. Assuming for contradiction that g contains such a side-effect induced subgraph h, there must exist a variable x such that the side-effect subgraph h contains at least one of the two vertices.

We then present two applications by considering two specific graphs, denoted as kp (the complete graph on p vertices) and 3k2 (a graph consisting of an induced matching with three edges). A p-wheel is defined as a graph consisting of a chordless cycle on p vertices and an additional vertex u adjacent to all p vertices on the cycle. We denote as e[3k2] the edge set of the 3k2 graph.

In this study, we introduce a new variant of SAT, termed k-girth LCNF 2-3SAT, which leads to the classification of the graph sandwich problem for h-free graph classes where the forbidden graph h is 3-connected, contains an anti-matching (i.e., a matching) of size 3, and contains a matching of size 2.
