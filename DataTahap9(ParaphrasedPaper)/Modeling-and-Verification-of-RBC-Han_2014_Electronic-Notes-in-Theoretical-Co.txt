The radio block center (RBC) is an essential component of the Chinese Train Control System Level 3 (CTCS-3), which serves as a protocol for safety-critical systems. The accuracy of the RBC handover protocol significantly impacts the safety of these systems, making it crucial to ensure its correctness. In an effort to achieve this, formal methods have been utilized to model and validate the protocol. In this study, we employed the Modeling, Simulation, and Verification Language (MSVL) as a formal language for modeling and verifying the protocol, with the results demonstrating that the behavior of the RBC handover aligns with the specified requirements.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief introduction to the MSV toolkit for MSVL. The RBC handover protocol is detailed in section 3, with sections 4 and 5 dedicated to the modeling, simulation, and verification of the protocol. Finally, we present the conclusion in section 6.

Two scenarios are considered for the handover: 1. RBC hands over with two normal radio stations, and 2. RBC hands over with only one normal radio station. The procedures for handover differ in these cases, and the focus of this paper is on the second scenario, using RBC1 to represent the handover RBC and RBC2 to represent the takeover RBC.
