The traditional proof theory of propositional logic deals with proofs that can be very large. Studies in proof theory have revealed exponential differences between normal or cut-free proofs and their corresponding non-normal proofs. There is a growing trend among proof-theoreticians to use proof-graphs, rather than trees or lists, to represent proofs, in order to study the complexity of propositional proofs and develop more efficient theorem provers that take into account the size of propositional proofs.

It is important to note that FPL-graphs combine information from formula graphs and R-nodes, which can be differentiated using different types of lines. F-nodes and the edges between them are represented using solid lines, while R-nodes and the edges between them and neighboring premises and/or conclusions are represented using dashed lines. Additionally, delimiter nodes are shaded.

Lemma 2.5 provides a criterion for determining whether a given graph G is an FPL-graph. Among other things, it states that we need to verify that each node of G belongs to one of the possible types that generate the construction cases described in definition 2.2.

In this section, we outline the normalization process for FPL-graphs. The elimination of a maximal formula is very similar to the procedure for MIMP-graphs, as described elsewhere. However, in this case we consider maximal formulas in conjunction, disjunction, and implication. We also introduce the concept of reordering, as the removal of a maximal formula leads to a reordering of nodes.

The preservation of the premises and conclusions of the derivation during this process is proven naturally. Upon inspecting each elimination of a maximal formula, it becomes evident that the reduction step (as per definition 3.4) of the FPL-graph does not alter the set of premises and conclusions (indicated by the D-nodes H and C) of the derivation being reduced.
