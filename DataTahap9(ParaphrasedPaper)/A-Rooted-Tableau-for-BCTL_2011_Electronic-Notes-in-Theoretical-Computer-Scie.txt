The size of the closure set increases linearly with the length of the input formula. The number of hues grows singly exponentially with the size of the closure set, and the number of colors grows exponentially with the number of hues. Rules are only applied to rule nodes, with at most one rule node per color. Each step takes at most polynomial time in the number of colors or singly exponential time in the number of hues. Therefore, the execution of BCTL*RTAB will stop within a time that is at most doubly exponential in the length of the formula.
