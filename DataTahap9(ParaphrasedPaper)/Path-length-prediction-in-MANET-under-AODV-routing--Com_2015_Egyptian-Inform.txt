The mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a dynamic network of mobile nodes that can communicate with each other through single-hop or multi-hop connections. The number of hops, also known as the path length, plays a significant role in packet delivery, routing load, and delay. The path length between source and destination nodes depends on various factors, including node mobility patterns, routing algorithms, and transmission ranges. This study aims to predict the path length in MANETs using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. Path length data collected from MANETs using three different mobility models (Manhattan grid, random waypoint, and reference point group) is used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of forecasting path length between source and destination nodes for ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing in MANET. The study concludes that MLP-based neural network models are more effective than the statistical ARIMA model in forecasting path length between mobile nodes.

The reference point group mobility model (RPGM) can be applied to scenarios where the mobility behavior of soldiers moving as a group in a battlefield needs to be studied. Each group has a logical center or group leader, and the movement of the group leader influences the mobility behavior of all other members in the group. The random waypoint mobility model is a simple and widely used model to evaluate the performance of MANETs. It involves pause times between changes in direction and/or speed, with mobile nodes randomly selecting new destinations after a specified pause time, and traveling with a randomly chosen speed.

The ARIMA process, proposed by Box et al., is a stochastic process used to analyze time series data. The ARIMA model is denoted by ARIMA(p, d, q), where p denotes the orders of autoregression, d represents the integration (differencing), and q represents the order of the moving average. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model is described, which consists of an input layer, hidden layer(s), and an output layer. The neural network is used to extract an estimation of the autoregressive structure hidden in time series data.

Furthermore, a delay prediction mechanism integrated with the optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol for MANETs is proposed. This mechanism uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and a radial basis function to predict non-stationary time series models of queuing delay in MANETs.

The study also describes the process of forecasting the path length value between mobile nodes using the ARIMA model and MLP network, along with the determination of the p, d, and q parameters for the ARIMA model and the experimentation with various parameters of the MLP network, including the number of neurons and learning rate. This experimentation is conducted for different mobility models, and the effect of variations in learning rate on predicting the path length between mobile nodes is assessed.

In summary, this paper focuses on predicting path length in MANETs using ARIMA and MLP models, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of these models in forecasting path length between source and destination nodes in different mobility scenarios.
