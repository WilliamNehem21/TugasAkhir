The effective management of customer relationships within an organization encompasses the principles, methods, and tactics of customer relationship management (CRM). CRM, when used in conjunction with web and app technologies, empowers organizations to comprehend the behaviors and preferences of customers or potential customers, and subsequently engage in activities aimed at persuading them to transact and make decisions. The application of CRM extends across various domains, including business, healthcare, science, and other service industries, signifying widespread adoption.

The emergence of big data has propelled us into a digital age where the public generates copious amounts of data across sectors and industries. Organizations capture, collect, and process this data using digital sensors, communication channels, computing systems, and storage mechanisms, thereby amassing valuable information with implications for businesses, scientific endeavors, government operations, and societal advancement. A profusion of data originates from smartphones, computers, parking meters, buses, trains, and supermarkets. Search engine companies accumulate vast quantities of data daily, converting it into actionable information for external use as well as internal purposes.

Recognizing the value of the data they gather, organizations—both public and private—now perceive data as a valuable asset, transcending its original purpose. The ability to process immense volumes of data has given rise to a burgeoning industry of data analytics services. For example, the collaboration between IBM and Twitter in the realm of data analytics involves the sale of analytical insights to corporate clients, thereby furnishing businesses with real-time insights for informed decision-making. Leveraging each partner's respective strengths and expertise, this partnership holds strategic significance, representing the latest development in decision support data management. The impact of big data extends to various business functions, encompassing CRM, ERP, and supply chain management, as evidenced in the subsequent section where recent literature concerning CRM and big data is examined.

Value is generated from the processing of big data, supporting informed decision-making. Organizations must refine and process data to extract value from big data analytics. For example, value derived from big data analytics can aid in detecting and addressing potentially life-threatening conditions in newborns by analyzing their heart rate data. Another application of big data involves optimizing the performance of machines or devices; for instance, the Toyota Prius is equipped with cameras, GPS, sophisticated computers, and sensors to enhance road safety measures.

Employing big data and its advantages can enable organizations to enhance their CRM strategies. Conversely, big data analytics is the process of uncovering various data types within big data itself. Several CRM strategies can be advanced through big data and big data analytics.

The integration of big data into CRM can undoubtedly bolster long-term customer relationships and give rise to an array of impressive CRM activities. For instance, Netflix effectively harnessed big data to operate its streaming video service, enabling the company to discern customer preferences and making quantifiable marketing decisions. Big data has the potential to enhance CRM strategies at a pace double that of traditional processes.

When coupled with big data capabilities, CRM features become more assertive in terms of marketing strategies, such as push notifications targeted towards potential audiences via smartphones. Users of web and app platforms who engage in activities like commenting, "liking" pages, or returning to the platform are identified as potential customers who can be targeted for push notifications. Numerous third-party applications exist to facilitate the setup of push notifications for web and app platforms. This technology enables automatic or manual configuration of notifications, keeping customers informed about new content through text messages, shared links, or smartphone notifications offering promotions at nearby stores. CRM targets metrics such as sales transactions, promotional activities, and product awareness, while concurrently devising strategies for nurturing long-term customer relationships and fostering loyalty. It is imperative for businesses to not only focus on short-term customer relationships, but also to devise strategies for attracting, retaining, and extending relationships over the long term.
