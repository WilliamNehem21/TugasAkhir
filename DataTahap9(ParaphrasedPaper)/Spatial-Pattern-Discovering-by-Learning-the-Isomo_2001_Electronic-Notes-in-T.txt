The topic of inexact graph matching has been extensively explored for the purpose of establishing connections between a set of object or scene primitives extracted from an image and their counterparts in a model or reference. However, there has been limited work on how to construct such a model or reference. This study introduces a framework for automatically generating contextual pattern models to learn a parametric pattern ARG (attributed relational graph) model from multiple sample ARGs. The learned pattern ARG characterizes the observed patterns under varying conditions, and the maximum-likelihood parameters of the pattern ARG model are estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Specifically, analytical expressions are derived for estimating the density parameters of the pattern ARG model under Gaussian attributed and relational density distribution assumptions, leading to the development of the contextual Gaussian mixture model. The theory and methodology are applied to the task of unsupervised spatial pattern extraction from multiple images, with potential applications in data summarization, graph matching, and pattern detection, particularly in digital image and video libraries.

Recent research in content-based image and video retrieval has seen increased interest in ARG and graph matching techniques, where users submit a set of sample images to search for similar images in a database based on their summarized information. Some approaches utilize ARG for representing samples and employ two-graph matching techniques for retrieval, while others use relational graphs to annotate images. However, existing methods do not fully address issues such as contextual information of image pixels, matching ambiguities, or computational complexity.

The use of multiple sample ARGs provides more comprehensive information about patterns, and it is proposed to learn a parametric pattern ARG from a set of sample ARGs to account for variations in attributes and relations caused by noise, lighting conditions, and transformations. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 formulates the automatic contextual pattern modeling problem, Section 3 derives expressions for estimating the parameters of the pattern ARG via the EM algorithm, Section 4 provides analytical expressions for estimating the density parameters of the contextual Gaussian mixture model, Section 5 discusses how the learned pattern ARG model can be used for pattern detection, Section 6 addresses implementation issues, Section 7 presents experimental results, and Section 8 concludes with a summary and discussions.

The manual specification of node and relation correspondences for a large set of sample ARGs is labor-intensive, and it is impractical to manually label patterns within their backgrounds in observed images. Additionally, the observed images may have varying numbers of image primitives due to noise, different backgrounds, or broken elements during the detection process.

In most applications, it is reasonable to assume Gaussian attributed and relational distributions for the pattern ARG model, known as the contextual Gaussian mixture (CGM) model, for which analytical expressions for estimating distribution parameters can be derived during the EM algorithm. Initializing the pattern ARG model is the crucial first step, where the number of model components is determined, and the structure and parameters are initialized using an average number of nodes and attributes from a selected sample ARG. Subsequent components are initialized iteratively.
