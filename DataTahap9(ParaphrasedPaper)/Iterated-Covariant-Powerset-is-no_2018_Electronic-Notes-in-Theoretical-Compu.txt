The concept of a monad, as described in academic literature such as [19, ch. vi], has various applications in the mathematical foundation of programming science, and has emerged as a significant design pattern in languages like Haskell [12, 33] and Scala. Depending on the context, monads can be seen as abstract ideas of computational effects [26, 34], or as collections for gathering computed values, or as structures of values to be computed upon. These perspectives are not mutually exclusive; for example, the (covariant) powerset monad can be interpreted either as a simple form of unstructured collections or as a carrier of nondeterminism as a computational effect.

If a functor preserves preimages and admits a nontrivial idempotent term, then there exists no distributive law of "t" over both, considered as pointed functors. This contradicts some known positive results about the existence of distributive laws, although it does not entirely invalidate them. In [13, sec. 4], it is proven that every functor preserving weak pullbacks admits a distributive law over the monad. According to [25, thm. 2.9], every analytic functor has a distributive law over every commutative monad. Even though "t" is commutative and not analytic, it is possible to find an analytic functor that satisfies the conditions (1) and (2) mentioned above. Additionally, [15, lem. 8] demonstrates a straightforward distributive law of any monad over the underlying functor of another monad, provided that the two monads are linked by a monad morphism. While all of these works focus on constructing distributive laws of the functor-over-monad or monad-over-functor shape, we highlight the absence of distributive laws of pointed...

This proof is essentially the same as the one presented in [32, prop. 3.2] for the probability distribution monad when taken as "t", wherein the same sets "a" and "u" and the functions "f", "g", and "h" are utilized. We adjusted the assumptions so that the proof also encompasses the case of "t".

A monad morphism can be observed in both "t" and "tt" derived from monoids as in (8), and monad morphisms between such monads correspond to homomorphisms between the corresponding monoids. However, the only monoid homomorphism from z2 to our "m" is trivial and therefore non-injective. This leads to a contradiction, as...
