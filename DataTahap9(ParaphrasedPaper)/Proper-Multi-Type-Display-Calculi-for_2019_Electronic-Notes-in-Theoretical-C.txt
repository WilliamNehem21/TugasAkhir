In contrast with other methodologies, the multi-type approach offers greater modularity, enabling the encoding of logic that cannot be represented by analytic rules alone. This makes it possible to extend the theory to encompass weaker versions of rough algebras based on semi de Morgan algebras or general lattices, thereby accounting for the proof-theoretic aspects of rough concepts. Importantly, the multi-type methodology embeds the logics of rough algebras into a broader context of properly displayable logics. Properly displayable logics are examined as a collective, allowing for uniform provision of various metatheoretic results across large subclasses, including semantic cut elimination, finite embeddability property, and finite model property. Moreover, the modular nature of the proof-theoretic environment of properly displayable logics facilitates systematic interaction between different logics, thus enabling the derivation of dynamic epistemic logics based on the logics of rough algebras. This opens up new possibilities for enriching the theory of rough algebra logics.

In this section, we use the symbol h to represent any of the logics defined in section 2.2. The corresponding class of single-type and heterogeneous algebras is denoted as a and ha, respectively, and d.a represents the display calculus for h. The verification of the properties of every d.a closely resembles that of analogous properties of other calculi designed using the general methodology of multi-type calculi. Consequently, we provide only a brief outline of this verification.

Here, we present a summary of the verification of the soundness of the rules of d.a with respect to the semantics of perfect elements of ha (as defined in Section 3.6). The first step involves interpreting structural symbols as logical symbols based on their position (precedent or succedent), as outlined at the beginning of the section.

In the same vein, we briefly outline the proof of cut elimination and subformula property for d.a in this section. Proper display calculi have been designed to allow for the inference of cut elimination and subformula property from a metatheorem, following the strategy introduced by Belnap for display calculi. The metatheorem to which we will appeal for each d.a was proven in [citation].
