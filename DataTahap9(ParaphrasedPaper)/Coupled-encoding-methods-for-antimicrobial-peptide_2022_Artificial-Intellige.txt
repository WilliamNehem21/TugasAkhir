The authors of this academic paper suggest an approach to streamline the process of identifying promising antimicrobial peptide (AMP) candidates for in vitro testing. They propose that by leveraging machine learning models to accurately predict potential AMPs and by combining different models to minimize the false positive rate, researchers can reduce the number of non-antimicrobial peptides progressing to in vitro testing. Specifically, the authors utilize support vector machine (SVM) models with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, as SVM models are capable of effectively solving binary classification tasks and have been widely used in AMP prediction. The authors also discuss the trade-off between precision and recall in their approach, highlighting that while more rigorous methods may classify fewer peptides as antimicrobial, they are more likely to be true positives, thus increasing precision but decreasing recall. Conversely, more liberal methods may categorize more peptides as antimicrobial, resulting in lower precision but higher recall. Additionally, the authors emphasize the importance of scaling features to similar ranges to optimize the performance of the SVM model. They further stress the potential of their approach to enhance the efficiency of AMP discovery and conclude that the combined testing methodology can lead to fewer in vitro tests and more AMP discoveries, including the synthesis of previously non-existent peptides with antimicrobial activities.
