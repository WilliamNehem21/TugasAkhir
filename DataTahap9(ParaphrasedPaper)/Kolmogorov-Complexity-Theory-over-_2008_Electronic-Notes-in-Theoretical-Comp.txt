In practical terms, [28, corollary 4] offers an alternative demonstration of a recognized lower limit in the algebraic complexity theory of polynomials. This illustrates how the real incompressibility method serves as a natural complement to fact 1.1d). Another example of its application is provided in observation 4.1.

It is important to note that any finite information, such as the number of real constants following a certain pattern or the length of the input used to simulate m, can be integrated in this manner without increasing the size of the encoding. This simplifies various potential challenges from classical Kolmogorov complexity, as demonstrated in [20, example 2.1.4].

While the latter response may generally be incorrect, there exists a finite number of queries u1,..., un that share a common m beyond which all are accurately reported; similarly, the negative ones vj also exhibit the same quality. Therefore, for m m, n, g(x, m) = f(x).
