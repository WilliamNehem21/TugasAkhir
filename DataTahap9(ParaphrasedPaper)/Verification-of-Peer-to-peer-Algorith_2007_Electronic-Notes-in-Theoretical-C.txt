In recent years, there has been a significant emphasis on distributed applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which are decentralized and highly dynamic, allowing an arbitrary number of nodes to join and leave the network. The main function in most P2P systems is the efficient locating of data items, and determining whether a node is reachable in the network is a critical challenge for such systems.

In existing literature that describes algorithms for P2P systems, such as the original chord paper by Stoica et al., correctness proofs are presented at a high level of abstraction and do not typically provide operational semantics. Meanwhile, model-checking techniques are not directly applicable to verifying P2P systems due to their inherent dynamic nature and infinite-state behavior. Therefore, it is a considerable challenge to find the appropriate level of abstraction for modeling the algorithms and conducting the verification.

In general, nodes can join the network in any order, and since the internal structure of the system is concealed from the observer, a significant issue is how to specify the behavior of a ring. The proposed approach is to introduce a token ring protocol, involving an abstract token that circulates clockwise along the ring, in addition to the chord protocol.
