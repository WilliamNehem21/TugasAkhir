The electric vehicle (EV) market has experienced rapid growth despite concerns about driving range. One recent idea is to charge EVs while they are in motion, using dynamic wireless charging that allows for power exchange between the vehicle and the grid while the vehicle is moving. Part of the existing literature focuses on developing methods to intelligently route EVs in need of charging. This involves using inter-vehicle communication (IVC), which is vulnerable to cyber attacks such as spoofing. To address this issue, the paper introduces a probabilistic cross-layer intrusion detection system (IDS) based on machine learning techniques. The proposed IDS is capable of detecting spoofing attacks with over 90% accuracy, and it incorporates a new metric called position verification using relative speed (PVRS) that significantly influences the classification results.

This paper also presents an innovative method that leverages IVC to eco-route EVs, allowing them to charge while moving through the city without requiring significant changes to the existing road infrastructure. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of cooperative awareness messages (CAM) and inter-vehicle communication to optimize waiting times for EV charging, as well as the potential impact of spoofing attacks on the efficiency of the system.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work in the domain of spoofing attack detection. Section 3 describes the topology and types of implemented attacks. Section 4 details the proposed probabilistic IDS and the newly introduced PVRS metric. Section 5 presents the experimental evaluation setup and the impact of the implemented attack in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, as well as the experimental results of the probabilistic IDS. Section 6 discusses recent authentication and key-distribution techniques used in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) to enhance communication security. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the findings and concludes the work.

In addition, the paper examines methods for GPS spoofing detection and mitigation, as well as the comparison of different charging systems. It demonstrates that the proposed method significantly reduces the waiting time for EV charging and the charging time needed for an EV, as the EV continues to charge along its route.

Furthermore, the paper describes the use of machine learning techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (K-NN) and random forests (RF), in the IDS, and explores the potential of ensemble learning to improve classification performance. The paper also discusses the challenges posed by spoofing attacks and their impact on V2V communication.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of developing robust intrusion detection systems to address emerging security threats in the domain of dynamic wireless charging and inter-vehicle communication, and presents experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
