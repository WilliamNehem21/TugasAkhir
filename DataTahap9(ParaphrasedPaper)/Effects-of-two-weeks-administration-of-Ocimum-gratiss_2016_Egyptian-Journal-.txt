The study involved assigning rats to different experimental groups and treating them with gentamicin and a plant extract from O. gratissimum. Group 2, which served as the toxic control, received 100 mg/kg/day of gentamicin for a week, while groups 3, 4, and 5 were pre-treated with gentamicin and then received varying doses of the O. gratissimum extract. The results showed that the extract improved the histopathological alterations in the kidney tissues of the treated groups, indicating its potential for managing gentamicin-induced nephropathies.

To obtain the O. gratissimum extract, the plant leaves were collected, dried, ground into powder, and then subjected to aqueous extraction. The resulting extract was filtered and evaporated for later use in the study.

The rats' food consumption and water intake were monitored, and blood and urine samples were collected for analysis of various markers of renal function. The kidneys were also examined for biochemical and histological changes.

The study found that the O. gratissimum extract induced significant histological changes in the intestines of the treated rats, potentially enhancing nutrient absorption and exhibiting anti-diarrheal effects. Additionally, the extract appeared to have a hypoglycemic property and may contain major mineral elements, contributing to increased food consumption and body weight in the treated groups. Furthermore, the extract seemed to have a protective effect on renal function, as evidenced by improvements in urine volume, creatinine clearance, and markers of oxidative stress.

Overall, the study demonstrated that O. gratissimum extract has a nephron-restorative effect in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, suggesting its potential for managing kidney injury caused by gentamicin.
