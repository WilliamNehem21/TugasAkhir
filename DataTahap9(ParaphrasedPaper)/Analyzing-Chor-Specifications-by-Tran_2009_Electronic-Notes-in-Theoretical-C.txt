The paper discusses the concept of choreography, which specifies activities and interactions among a set of services from a global perspective and the generation of local implementations or peers from this specification. It introduces an encoding of the choreography calculus into the fsp process algebra, enabling validation and verification of choreography specifications using the fsp toolbox. The paper also addresses the issue of realizability, which refers to the ability to generate peers that precisely implement the choreography specification.

Recent works have focused on techniques to check the realizability of a choreography and define well-formedness rules to ensure its realizability, but they often lack tool support and do not allow for choreography specification validation or code generation.

The paper is organized as follows: it introduces the chor and fsp calculi, presents the encoding of chor into fsp, extends the fsp encoding to consider peer generation and the realizability issue, outlines a prototype tool supporting the approach and Java code generation, compares the proposal to related works, and concludes with remarks.

The chor language describes peers from a global perspective, while the peer language provides a local view of interactions. An example of a metal stock market is used to illustrate the concepts. The paper introduces the encoding of chor into fsp, which allows existing tool support for fsp to be used.

The paper also discusses how generation of fsp processes for a choreography specification can be performed using specific functions, and it addresses potential deadlocks and modifications to ensure realizability. Additionally, it examines tools for automating the realizability test, such as wsat, and compares these tools to the approach presented in the paper.

In summary, the paper presents a formal and tool-supported approach to tackle the realizability issue for choreography, which is different from previous works in its consideration of a specific choreography specification language. The approach enables verification of choreography specifications and code generation through fsp encoding.

The paper concludes by outlining plans to extend the approach to consider asynchronous communication, acknowledging the potential complications in the analysis and verification stage. It also discusses open problems related to realizability results for queues of different sizes.
