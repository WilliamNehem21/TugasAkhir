Partial evaluation (PE) is a method to optimize programs by specializing them with respect to a part of their input, known as the static data. This involves performing computations that solely depend on the static data at specialization-time, while those dependent on dynamic data remain in the specialized program. The goal is to reduce the running time of the specialized program compared to the original.

Poly-controlled partial evaluation (PCPE) is an effective approach for online partial evaluation of logic programs. Unlike traditional partial evaluation algorithms with fixed control strategies, PCPE allows considering a set of control strategies. For each call pattern, PCPE can select any of the control strategies in the set, enabling the use of different specialization strategies for different call patterns. As a result, PCPE can produce residual programs that are not achievable using traditional partial evaluation alone, often leading to hybrid solutions with better fitness value for various resource-aware functions.

This study explores the potential of using an oracle to determine the most promising control strategy for each call pattern based on specialization results achieved using different strategies, while pruning the other branches in the process. The aim is to enable the generation of a single specialized program without the need for extensive evaluation, provided the oracle makes effective decisions. However, the practical utility of this approach relies on the oracle's ability to make sound decisions, as some PCPE specialized programs may outperform traditional PE, while others may produce suboptimal results.

Ensuring that the number of specialized atoms remains finite is crucial, achieved by replacing atoms with more general ones to guarantee termination. Most existing control strategies prioritize time efficiency and do not explicitly handle observables, with heuristics typically aimed at maximizing certain factors while keeping the number of specialized atoms at zero. Nevertheless, perfect information can only be obtained by observing and expanding the PCPE-tree a posteriori, as partial information guides the decision-making process.

The process of finding a vector of oracle constants is framed as a maximum constraint satisfaction problem (Max CSP), with the goal of maximizing the number of satisfied constraints within the set of o-constraints. While finding an optimal solution to this problem can be costly due to the large cardinality of o-constraints, a simplified model emerges by considering o-constraints occurring in a PCPE-path of maximal fitness.

The study conducted experiments to assess the quality of specialized programs obtained with Oracle-Based PE (OBPE) and compared the cost of this approach with other specialization techniques, including standard PE and the optimized generate+evaluate PCPE. The findings suggest that OBPE outperforms standard PE and introduces only a reasonable constant overhead factor, making it a promising approach for program specialization.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of effective control strategies in program specialization and emphasizes the potential of PCPE in obtaining hybrid specializations. Additionally, it introduces OBPE as an efficient alternative to traditional PE with the potential to generate superior specialized programs.
