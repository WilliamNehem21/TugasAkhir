We anticipate that the compilation of time-series data presented in this study will not only benefit seismologists, but also appeal to a broader audience, including data scientists interested in meaningful data such as seismograms collected on the earth's surface. After detailing the automated labeling procedure for the waveforms (section 2), we provide an intricate description of the dataset's characteristics (section 3). Section 4 presents an application of supervised machine learning to a binary classification problem. Specifically, we demonstrate the capability of a convolutional neural network trained on our dataset to differentiate earthquakes from noise in unlabeled data (i.e., test set) based on single-station recordings.

In this segment, we illustrate a basic application of the dataset to a signal classification problem. More specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to distinguish between noise recordings and earthquake recordings, thereby representing a local-earthquake detection algorithm for a single station.

The entire architecture employs the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, with the exception of the last layer, which uses a fully-connected layer with one neuron to return the waveform classification using a sigmoid activation function. Cross-entropy and the Adam optimization algorithm are used as the loss function and optimization algorithm throughout the model, respectively.

We have demonstrated in section 4 that the trained model can be utilized to detect small earthquakes in regions not represented in the training set. The high achieved accuracies (96.7%, 95.3%, and 93.2% on the training, validation, and test sets, respectively) provide evidence that the same method can be applied to real-time earthquake detection at individual stations by streaming continuous data in batches of 27 seconds, provided that the seismograms are pre-processed as detailed in section 2. To further enhance the algorithm's performance, one potential approach could involve introducing one or more recurrent layers to account for the temporal relationship between the seismic phases arriving at the receivers.

The goal of enriching existing catalogs by identifying small, local earthquakes undetectable by commonly employed methods, particularly in areas with low receiver density, is without the need for multiple stations. We have shown that the diverse geological and tectonic settings covered by our data support the algorithm's generalization capabilities. However, for specific tasks such as improving the completeness of catalogs in specific locations, it may be beneficial to focus solely on a subset of the dataset. Training a machine learning algorithm on such data could enable the incorporation of geographic characteristics of the investigated region into the trained model, potentially leading to higher detection accuracy. Additionally, it may be worthwhile to explore whether such a dataset could efficiently simulate seismic ambient noise and provide insights into noise distribution.
