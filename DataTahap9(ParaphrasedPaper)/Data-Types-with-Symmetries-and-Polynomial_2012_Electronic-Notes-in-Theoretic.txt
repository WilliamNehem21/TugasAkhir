Incorporating symmetries into a data structure involves allowing for permutations of data within a given shape. Quantum physics, for example, imposes this kind of symmetry at a fundamental level, as seen in the case of indistinguishable particles. The concept of multiset, and its extension as a functor, serves as a fundamental example of this idea.

From a species perspective, there are additional reasons for incorporating these symmetries. It was recognized that the 1985 notion of analytic functors is not optimal for enumeration purposes, as taking cardinality does not yield the exponential generating functions crucial to enumerative combinatorics, unless the analytic functor is polynomial. This issue was addressed by Baez and Dolan, who introduced the concept of groupoids and showed that working with groupoids from the beginning, instead of sets, is necessary to obtain correct cardinalities.

Condition (2) specifies that every edge is the input edge of a unique node, except the root edge, while condition (3) ensures that reaching the root edge is possible within a finite number of steps. The edges not in the image of t are referred to as leaves.

In the context of perturbative quantum field theories, particularly in the bphz renormalization, the nesting of graphs, especially 1-particle irreducible (1pi) Feynman graphs, is of interest. Kreimer's work revealed that the bphz procedure is captured in a Hopf algebra of (non-planar) rooted trees, which expresses the nesting of graphs.
