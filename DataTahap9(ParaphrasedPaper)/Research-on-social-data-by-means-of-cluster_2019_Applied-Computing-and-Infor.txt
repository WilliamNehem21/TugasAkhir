An approach to categorizing families and understanding the key factors influencing this categorization involves analyzing social data using cluster analysis and data mining techniques. Data mining is a method for discovering valuable information and hidden patterns in databases, widely used in various research fields. Analyzing social data sets poses challenges due to the way they are collected and stored.

Data mining involves the automatic discovery of useful information in large databases through the integration of machine learning, statistical calculation, linear algebra, and mathematical optimization concepts. Clustering techniques present challenges when applied to social data due to the structured forms typically used for data collection, resulting in mixed types of variables and null values.

In this study, we utilized the silhouette method to determine the optimal number of natural clusters within the data set. The silhouette method visually represents the quality of the clusters by displaying how samples are positioned within the clusters and identifying any samples that may belong to multiple clusters.

We employed the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm, an extension of the k-means algorithm, which is known for its speed, efficiency, and simplicity. The dissimilarity matrix required by the PAM algorithm was computed using the daisy function, which can handle mixed data types, including numeric, categorical, and ordinal variables.

In addition to cluster analysis, data mining also encompasses classification techniques for predictive analysis. Decision trees were used for interpreting the clustering results and visualizing the most relevant variables for cluster separation.

Feature selection, a data mining process aimed at removing unimportant feature variables, was employed to determine the most important variables for analysis. It involves assessing the relevance and redundancy of variables and selecting the most relevant subset of features.

The study's findings revealed that families in different clusters exhibited distinct income levels and food security indices. Families in cluster 1 generally provided support to others and had higher income from social security, while families in cluster 2 had lower income from social security but higher food security indices.

Overall, working with categorical values poses a significant challenge for data mining researchers. Future endeavors may focus on improving the processability of data sets by standardizing variables to numeric values, changing data collection methods, or employing clustering and classification techniques capable of handling categorical variables.
