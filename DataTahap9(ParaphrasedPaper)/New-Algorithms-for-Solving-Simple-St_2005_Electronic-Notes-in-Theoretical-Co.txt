This academic paper introduces novel algorithms for determining optimal strategies in two-player games with probabilistic moves and reachability winning conditions, also known as simple stochastic games. The paper addresses the open problem of whether simple stochastic games can be solved in polynomial time, and presents a technique for representing the search space as a subset of the hyper-cube [0, 1]^n and dividing it into convex subregions for efficient linear optimization.

The focus of the research is on simple stochastic games, which are turn-based games with random moves where the objective is to reach a final position with the best possible associated payoff. The paper highlights the relevance of simple stochastic games in the context of other important graph games and their applications in computer science, such as parity and mean-payoff games.

The paper is organized into sections that cover basic definitions and properties of simple stochastic games, algorithms for finding optimal solutions, and the use of strategy improvement algorithms for performance evaluation. The authors present two algorithms for solving simple stochastic games, along with a modification that simplifies the computation process at the expense of sub-optimal improvements.

The authors compare the performance of their algorithms with strategy improvement methods and emphasize the importance of complexity analysis in evaluating the efficiency of different solution approaches. The main contribution of the paper is a new technique for finding optimal values in simple stochastic games, which is based on a geometric interpretation of node valuations and the identification of player strategies within the hyper-cube [0, 1]^n.

Overall, the paper presents valuable insights into the problem of solving simple stochastic games and proposes effective algorithms for determining optimal strategies, with potential applications in computer science and operational research.
