The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the SSL/TLS protocol, examines man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on SSL/TLS-enabled applications, and outlines existing countermeasures for MITM threats on SSL/TLS-enabled transactions. Section 3 introduces the suggested approach for safeguarding SSL/TLS-enabled applications from MITM attacks. Section 4 evaluates the proposed solution and compares it with similar strategies. We wrap up the paper in Section 5.

One-time Password (OTP) manual (e.g. scratch card) refers to a paper or card containing an OTP that must be securely printed and sent to the customer. The user can utilize the OTP to access the system, and once used, the OTP becomes obsolete. In other words, an adversary cannot exploit a previously used OTP, as a different OTP will be used the next time.
