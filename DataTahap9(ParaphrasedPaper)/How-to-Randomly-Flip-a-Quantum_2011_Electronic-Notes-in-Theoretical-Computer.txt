We demonstrate that a significant category of quantum channels, specifically the convex closure of the spin channels, can be algebraically represented by classical channels with four inputs and four outputs. This finding is utilized to devise an experimentally feasible approach for random qubit flips when the basis of preparation is unknown. This method can be employed to disrupt, though not necessarily eliminate, any concealed communication relying on quantum information, as well as to eliminate steganographic information concealed within quantum data.

The capability to randomly flip classical bits is a fundamental operation with various applications, including the disruption of undesirable communication or the removal of hidden steganographic information in data. Each of these applications contributes to the security of systems. The process for randomly flipping classical bits proceeds as follows: when presented with a bit, a coin is flipped, and depending on the outcome, the bit is either flipped or left unchanged. This process eradicates any correlation between the transmitted and received information, rendering it impossible to transmit information using bits that have been randomly flipped.

In an ideal scenario, one would hope to observe these properties similarly reflected in the context of qubits, since each choice of basis defines a classical channel, which will be further discussed in the subsequent section. Despite initial reservations, we now focus on entropy-increasing channels on qubits.
