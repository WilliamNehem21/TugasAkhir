Adaptive noise cancellation is a technique used to estimate signals that have been corrupted by additive noise or interference. This method involves using a primary input, which is the corrupted signal, and a secondary or reference input that captures the noise correlated with the noise present in the primary input. The reference input is adaptively filtered and then subtracted from the primary input in order to obtain the signal estimate. This method can be applied whenever a suitable reference input is available.

Thakor and Zhu introduced a variety of adaptive filter structures for noise cancellation and arrhythmia detection in ECG signals, targeting different forms of noise such as baseline wander, 60 Hz power line interference (PLI), muscle artifacts, and motion artifacts. Hamilton examined the performance of an adaptive 60-Hz notch filter compared to a nonadaptive filter for reducing PLI in ECG signals. Ziarani and Konrad proposed a nonlinear adaptive method for eliminating PLI from ECG signals, demonstrating robustness and high immunity to external noise. Raya and Sison developed an adaptive noise cancellation method for removing motion artifacts in stress ECG signals using an accelerometer. Martens et al. proposed an improved adaptive noise canceller for reducing the fundamental PLI component and harmonics in ECG signals. 

Behbahani simulated and tested an adaptive noise cancellation method employing the least mean square (LMS) algorithm for removing 60 Hz PLI from ECG signals. Lin and Hu developed an efficient recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive notch filter for suppressing PLI in ECG signals, and also proposed a PLI detector using an optimal linear discriminant analysis algorithm. Dhubkarya et al. implemented an adaptive noise canceller for denoising ECG signals and tested its performance using various algorithms including LMS, normalized LMS (NLMS), and RLS. Chandrakar and Kowar employed the RLS algorithm for removing different types of noise from ECG signals, while Kim et al. proposed a motion artifact removal method using a cascaded two-stage LMS adaptive filter for an ambulatory ECG monitoring system.

Ebrahimzadeh et al. compared different ECG noise reduction algorithms such as LMS, block-based least mean square (BBLMS), NLMS, unbiased and normalized adaptive noise reduction (UNANR), and RLS. Sharma et al. used an adaptive noise canceller with an LMS algorithm for ECG noise removal and observed that an increase in step size increases noise as well as the rate of convergence. Satheeskumaran and Sabrigiriraj proposed a variable step size delayed least mean square (VSSDLMS) adaptive filter to remove artifacts from ECG signals. Qureshi et al. proposed a cascaded three-stage adaptive noise canceller for eliminating baseline wander, 60 Hz PLI, and motion artifacts from ECG signals using the SSLMS algorithm. 

Gilani et al. employed an LMS-based adaptive noise canceller to remove 50 Hz PLI from ECG signals, while Venkatesan et al. studied a delayed error normalized least mean square (DENLMS) adaptive filter with pipelined architecture to remove white Gaussian noise from ECG signals. Xiong et al. showed that the cosine-based adaptive algorithm is superior to the standard LMS algorithm for reducing high amplitude motion artifact noise from ECG signals. Similarly, Saxena et al. used an NLMS-based adaptive noise canceller to remove 50 Hz PLI from ECG signals. 

Manju and Sneha performed ECG denoising using Wiener and Kalman filters, finding that the Wiener filter performs better than the Kalman filter for ECG noise removal. Khiter et al. proposed a novel adaptive denoising method called self-correcting leaky normalized least mean square algorithm with varied step size and leakage coefficient for reducing muscle artifacts from ECG signals. Yadav et al. utilized sign adaptive filters for processing and analyzing ECG signals, noting that the performance of these filters can be compromised due to the clipping effect caused by the application of the signum function. They also found that a cascaded four-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the LMMN and LMF algorithms outperforms other configurations in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement.

Overall, the aforementioned studies focus on various adaptive noise cancellation methods and algorithms for denoising ECG signals, emphasizing the importance of effective noise reduction techniques for improving the quality and accuracy of ECG signal analysis.
