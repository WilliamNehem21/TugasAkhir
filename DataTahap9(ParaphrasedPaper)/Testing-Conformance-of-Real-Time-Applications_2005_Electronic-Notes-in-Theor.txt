The paper introduces a new method for automated testing of real-time applications, with a focus on robotic applications, by using high-level specifications that are translated into networks of timed automata. These timed automata are then used to generate analog or digital-clock observers. The system under test (SUT) is instrumented to export observable events and corresponding time-stamps, and the traces generated by the SUT are fed to the observer for checking conformance with the specification. The proposed approach has been applied to the K9 Martian Rover Executive of NASA. The method is dynamic, making use of instrumentation of the SUT and run-time verification technology, and has the potential to be fully-automatic.

The paper presents the methodology in detail, showcasing how plans can be translated into networks of timed automata, and how observers can be generated automatically from timed automata. The paper also discusses the application of the method on the K9 rover case study and provides insights into the advantages and challenges of the proposed methodology.

The proposed approach is compared with related work that is based on the instrumentation of the SUT and runtime analysis of the instrumented SUT using an observer. The paper highlights the automatic and efficient process of translating plans into networks of timed automata, along with the potential uses of these automata for purposes other than generating an observer, such as checking for specific properties and measuring delays.

The paper also discusses the specific structure of robotic applications, the process of instrumentation of the execution platform, and the testing procedure, including considerations for on-the-fly and off-line testing. Challenges and considerations relating to state estimation and the complexity of timed automata are also briefly addressed.

Furthermore, the paper describes the prototype observer generation tool, known as TTG, and details the process of generating an off-line observer from an if language specification automaton. The paper also discusses the K9 rover executive, its coordinating components, and the challenges of accessing the execution platform for testing purposes.

In conclusion, the paper outlines the proposed methodology for testing real-time applications and emphasizes the automatic generation of observers and the instrumentation of the system under test. The paper also discusses future research directions, such as studying the representation of observers as finite automata and identifying classes of timed automata for which certain problems can be solved.
