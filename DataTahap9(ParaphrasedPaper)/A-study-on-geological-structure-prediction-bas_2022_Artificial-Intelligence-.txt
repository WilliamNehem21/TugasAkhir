The Central Asian Orogenic Belt is a large accretionary orogenic belt situated between the Tarim Plate, the Siberian Plate, and the North China Plate. It is considered one of the most intensely accretionary regions in the Phanerozoic era globally. The Xingmeng Orogenic Belt, located in the eastern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, is a crucial suture zone between the North China Plate and the Siberian Plate, predominantly found in Inner Mongolia and northeast China. This area has undergone various evolutionary processes since the early Paleozoic era, including subduction, closure, and collision orogeny of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The Carboniferous period witnessed significant tectonic activity in this region, thus understanding the geological tectonic process during this time has great significance for comprehending the evolution of the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt. However, previous studies have encountered challenges in constraining the regional tectonic evolution solely using volcanic rock geochemical indicators due to their susceptibility to multiple solutions and various influencing factors. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new, more comprehensive method for inferring the tectonic setting of basalt.

In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely used in the earth sciences to address this challenge. Compared to traditional geological methods, the machine learning approach involves establishing a training model based on a global database and then utilizing this model to predict the tectonic setting of the study area, considering a broader range of variables and providing quantitative probability measurements for the qualitative structural environment discrimination. To explore the tectonic setting of the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt in the Carboniferous period, a training model was established using a global database, and 31 basic Carboniferous rock samples from the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt were collected for prediction. The results of the prediction showed that most of the samples exhibited an island arc tectonic setting, with the predicted probability distribution of island arc falling between 0.65 and 1. This finding contributes new evidence for the existence of a ditcharcbasin system in the Carboniferous period of the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt.

The Xingmeng Orogenic Belt is positioned in the southeastern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt and has experienced multiple periods of oceanic slab subduction and collision since the early Paleozoic, leading to the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The exposed strata in this area include various formations such as the Dashizhai Formation, Linxi Formation, Manketou Ebo Formation, Manitu Formation, and Baiyingaolao Formation. Additionally, there are carboniferous tectonic melanges and development of triassic, jurassic, and cretaceous granites in this region. The fault structures mainly trend in different directions, and the paleozoic strata in the study area exhibit varying degrees of ductile deformation.

The Carboniferous strata in this region are confined to a small area, with the Hongliuyuan Formation being the primary exposed formation. Its lithology consists mainly of normally deposited clastic rocks intercalated with carbonate rocks and volcanic rocks, indicating a rhythmic deposition composition. To address the complex geological structures and tectonic environment of the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt, machine learning methods, particularly deep neural networks (DNN), have shown promise. DNN, a framework of deep learning, can provide advanced modeling for complex nonlinear systems, offering a higher level of abstraction and discriminant power.

The evolution of geological structures in the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt has become increasingly intricate, as evidenced by the superposition and transformation of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, the Mongolian-Okhotsk Ocean, and the Paleo-Pacific tectonic domain. One of the most contentious issues in this context is the timing of the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, with diverging views regarding the subduction models and the existence of a trencharcbasin system during the Carboniferous period. To address these controversies, machine learning methods have been employed to train and predict the tectonic setting of rock samples from different regions, providing valuable insights into the subduction age and intensity of the Eastern and Western segments. The results indicate the existence of extensive subduction in the Paleo-Asian Ocean during the Carboniferous period, supporting the view that oceanic subduction was ongoing during this time. Additionally, the temporal and spatial evolution revealed differences in the subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean from west to east, indicating variations in the subduction processes through time and space.

In conclusion, the study suggests that the Carboniferous Xingmeng Orogenic Belt was formed in an active continental margin environment and belongs to the island arc tectonic setting, shedding light on the complex tectonic history and evolution of this region.
