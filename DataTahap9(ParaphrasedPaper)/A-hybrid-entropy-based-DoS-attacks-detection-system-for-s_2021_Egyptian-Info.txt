The level of trust among nodes in a network can be influenced by various factors. This paper focuses on addressing the issue of trust in a network where members may or may not be part of a denial of service (DoS) botnet. The authors propose an algorithm to detect whether nodes are participating in DoS attacks and assign a trust value to them based on this information. The algorithm then bans the offending nodes for a specific duration and notifies their administrator to provide them with an opportunity to rectify their behavior. If malicious activities persist, the nodes are banned indefinitely.

Software-defined networks (SDNs) pose new security challenges, and this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the security threats associated with this type of architecture. Specifically, it delves into the threat of DoS attacks and how information about such attacks can be integrated into a trust mechanism to inform routing decisions within the network.

While previous research has addressed the detection of DoS attacks using metrics such as entropy, this paper proposes a novel hybrid system that combines both entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) to detect DoS attacks in SDNs. The proposed system identifies a DoS attack when the entropy of both the source and destination IP addresses falls below a certain threshold. Additionally, it incorporates a model that takes into account the past behavior of the network to detect ongoing attacks.

The experimental setup used to test the proposed DoS detection mechanism involved a fully connected SDN with 20 nodes and one controller. The algorithm tracks the number of rounds in which a node exhibits malicious behavior, and then calculates the percentage of rounds within a given window during which the node was flagged as malicious. This percentage is compared against predefined thresholds to determine the likelihood of malicious behavior.

Overall, the paper introduces an algorithm to assess the trustworthiness of nodes in a network, with a focus on detecting and addressing DoS attacks in SDNs using a hybrid approach incorporating entropy and KL-divergence metrics.
