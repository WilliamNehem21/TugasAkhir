This research paper presents an enhanced approach for denoising images using a nonlinear thresholding function with adaptive Bayesian thresholding in the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. The method addresses the limitations of conventional thresholding techniques by estimating the noise deviation in different sub-bands based on the coefficients of various direction and level sub-bands in the NSCT domain and determining the thresholds for each sub-band using a Bayesian threshold estimation method. Subsequently, a nonlinear thresholding function is employed to mitigate the shortcomings of soft and hard thresholding functions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes Gaussian white noise, yielding higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values and preserving image texture and details, thereby producing visually superior results.

As the number of image sensors per unit area in modern image capturing devices increases, the sensitivity to noise artifacts also rises. Consequently, camera manufacturers rely on image denoising algorithms to mitigate these effects. Recently developed denoising methods employ diverse strategies to address this issue, with wavelet-based techniques being particularly effective in reducing Gaussian noise in images while retaining important signal features. The ability of wavelet transforms to compact the energy of a signal into a small number of coefficients makes them instrumental in image noise reduction and has led to their widespread use over the past decade.

The research paper focuses on denoising images corrupted by white Gaussian noise using the NSCT domain, a linear transformation that divides its coefficients into two groups: those of the original image and those of the noise. The approach involves estimating thresholds for each sub-band through an adaptive Bayesian threshold method and utilizing a nonlinear thresholding function to handle NSCT sub-band coefficients. This process results in the restoration of the image signal after reconstruction based on the new NSCT coefficients. Furthermore, the paper introduces a thresholding function to address the shortcomings of traditional thresholding methods and demonstrates its effectiveness through simulation results.
