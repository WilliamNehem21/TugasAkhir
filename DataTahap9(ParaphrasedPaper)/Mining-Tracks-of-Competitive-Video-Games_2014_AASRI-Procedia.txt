While artificial intelligence has made significant advancements, it lacks the ingenuity and responsiveness of human-controlled players in online games. Online gaming allows for global competition, fostering team spirit and community engagement. The growth of networks has made playing with humans across distances easier and has led to the development of interest communities that sustain games by fostering forums, creating guides, and organizing events.

Our focus is on video games that emulate real collective sports, pitting two teams against each other within a well-defined and regulated gameplay. Specifically, we examine multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, which aim to conquer the opponent's field similar to rugby or American football. These games offer high reproducibility of situations and show similarities to real sports, making it easier to draw parallels and study them within a sports context.

Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a MOBA game, involves two teams of five players competing on a consistent virtual battlefield. Each player embodies a hero with unique powers, following the progression of autonomous armies to demolish opponent towers and buildings. The game's team-oriented nature requires strategic coordination and efficient response to opposing team actions. Our analysis, based on 1,120 DotA games, focused on leveraging topological clues to predict match outcomes. By computing players' movement speed to infer their positions, we normalized topological clues and used supervised classification to validate their relevance.

The results suggest that topological clues are contributory and relevant, offering an alternative approach to understanding game dynamics. By analyzing player behaviors as tracks, strategic recommendations can be derived, complementing existing professional expertise. This method provides a new perspective for game analysis, highlighting the potential of leveraging player behaviors to inform strategic decision-making.
