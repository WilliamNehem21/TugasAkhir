The paper discusses the role of signals in preemptive systems and their reception, as well as the concept of synchronous models in which systems evolve in discrete phases with instantaneous reactions. The paper also outlines the representation of states and transitions in synccharts, describing different types of transitions and the handling of local and external signals. It explains the complexities of reactions in synccharts, emphasizing the challenges related to hierarchy, preemption, and instantaneous chaining of transition firings in communicating finite state machines (FSMs). The paper proposes the use of cooperating reactive cells as active agents instead of communicating FSMs and describes the determination of signal presence status and the concept of fixpoint solutions through dialogs to ensure the determinism of reactions. Furthermore, the paper discusses the broadcast of signal presence status and the process of achieving stability in active cells' evolutions. It also explores different semantic variants for handling suspended cells and terminating reactions. Additionally, the paper covers the computation of potential emitted signals to aid in the resolution of suspended evaluations and the construction of a monotonic decreasing set of potentially emitted signals. The paper concludes by mentioning the formal definition of synccharts through a metamodel and the potential for engineers to adapt the model to their specific needs, discussing possibilities for simplifying the model and introducing variations in signal handling.
