The research has led to the development of two models for predicting the movements of a conductor in time and space based on wind speed. The first model, known as the strip theory model (ST), relies on costly computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations, while the second model, called the wake oscillator model (WO), uses simplified coupling terms and is implemented in a specialized tool.

To accomplish this, the study proposes a three-stage processing pipeline: data collection, data modeling, and data visualization. The pipeline involves collecting data using the WO model, optimizing model parameters with hyperopt algorithm, and constructing an ensemble (ENS) model. The paper outlines the methodology for calibrating the prediction model, presents the study results, and discusses them.

The study focuses on an ENS model that directly operates on time-series WO data to predict the values of y/d. The dataset comprises 10 variables, including hyperparameters of the WO model and the corresponding y/d values. The study also introduces an optimization method for generating WO data using the hyperopt algorithm, and discusses the use of different cost functions, such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and the R2 score, to evaluate model performance.

The ENS model consists of ten XGBoost models and a deep neural network (DNN) that utilize the WO model data to produce predictions. The paper also describes the pre-training and fine-tuning steps of the model, and presents the results of different machine learning models and the ENS model, emphasizing evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R2 score. The ENS model is shown to outperform individual models, attributing its performance to the characteristics of XGBoost and DNN models.
