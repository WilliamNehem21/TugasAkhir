Process algebras provide a sophisticated framework for representing a broad variety of systems, ranging from computer networks to biological systems. When incorporating information about the (stochastic) speed of actions, we move into the domain of stochastic process algebras (SPA), a widely used modeling approach in both performance analysis and systems biology. SPA are typically given a semantics in terms of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) and can be viewed as a high-level language for describing CTMC. As a result, the analysis techniques applicable to CTMC, such as steady-state or transient analysis, can also be applied to SPA. Additionally, many characteristics of CTMC, such as block decomposability, can be extended to the level of SPA, significantly simplifying the analysis. Nevertheless, analyzing a stochastic system is a computationally intensive task, and the aforementioned techniques all suffer from the problem of state space explosion. This issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with components that exist in multiple copies, such as molecules involved in chemical reactions.
