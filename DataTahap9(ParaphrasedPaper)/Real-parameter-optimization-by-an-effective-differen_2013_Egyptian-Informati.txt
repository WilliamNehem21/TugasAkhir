This paper presents a novel differential evolution (DE) algorithm, termed effective differential evolution (EDE), designed for solving real parameter optimization problems in continuous domains. The EDE algorithm introduces a new mutation rule based on the best and worst individuals within the population of a given generation, which is combined with the basic mutation strategy using a linear decreasing probability rule. The newly proposed mutation rule is found to enhance the local search capability of the basic DE algorithm and expedite its performance. To prevent stagnation and premature convergence, a random mutation scheme and a modified breeder genetic algorithm (BGA) mutation scheme are integrated. Additionally, the scaling factor and crossover of DE are introduced as uniform random numbers to enrich the search behavior and enhance population diversity. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed modifications in EDE are empirically investigated, demonstrating efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness in numerical experiments on a set of bound-constrained problems. Comparison results with several classical differential evolution methods and state-of-the-art parameter adaptive differential evolution variants attest to the competitiveness and, in some cases, superiority of the proposed EDE algorithm in terms of final solution quality, efficiency, convergence rate, and robustness.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the standard DE algorithm, while Section 3 provides a detailed description of the new EDE algorithm. Section 4 presents computational results of testing benchmark functions and discusses comparisons with other techniques. Section 5 evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed modifications, and finally, conclusions and future work are drawn in Section 6.

The paper also discusses the stochastic nature of evolutionary algorithms, emphasizing the importance of adjusting control parameters and mutation schemes to enhance their search capability, particularly in complex and large-scale optimization problems. To this end, four modifications are introduced to significantly improve the overall performance of the standard DE algorithm, combining global search capability with a local search tendency. The paper details the dynamic utilization of mutation rules throughout the search process to favor exploration, balance the search direction, and enhance exploitation. Additionally, the utilization of a random variable for the scaling factor (f) in the mutation strategy is proposed to maintain population diversity and bias the search direction for trial vectors. Empirical evaluations suggest optimal settings for certain parameters over benchmark problems, and the paper emphasizes the competitive performance of the proposed EDE algorithm, showcasing its balance between exploration and exploitation tendencies, fast convergence speed, and robustness across various benchmark functions.

Overall, the proposed EDE algorithm demonstrates competitive performance in terms of solution quality, efficiency, convergence rate, and robustness, outperforming conventional DE methods and holding its own against state-of-the-art self-adaptive DE algorithms and their variations (EDE 1, EDE 2, and EDE 3). The principal benefits of the proposed modifications lie in achieving a remarkable balance between exploration and exploitation capabilities, leading to superior performance and robustness, which are critical aspects for evolutionary algorithms.
