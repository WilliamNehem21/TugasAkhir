This paper compares newly proposed models with traditional deep learning methods using the same dataset. It uses pre-trained and state-of-the-art models in a transfer learning paradigm and applies them to an original wound dataset. The used pre-trained deep learning architectures include AlexNet, GoogLeNet, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, ShuffleNet, NASNetMobile, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, VGG19, SqueezeNet, DarkNet19, DarkNet53, InceptionV3, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetLarge. The authors re-implemented all methods using training parameters obtained from experimental results to ensure a fair comparison. The study discusses the best performing AlexNet architecture and presents the success of the models using classification performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score.

The paper addresses the importance of determining granule, necrotic, and slough wound types for patient treatment. It aims to solve a three-class classification problem for these wound types and investigate the effect of deep learning models in medical image processing. To address this problem, the authors proposed three new architectures with 3, 4, and 6 CNN layers by modifying the CNN-based AlexNet architecture. Additionally, they used the SVM classifier for these proposed models.

The results show that the proposed model with 6 convolution layers achieved a performance of over 94% when used with the softmax classifier. The study also found that increasing the convolution layers (6conv_softmax and 6conv_svm models) improved their success. However, experiments with architectures consisting of seven or more layers did not yield improved results in the evaluation metrics.

The paper also discusses the use of confusion matrices to evaluate the performance of the classifier models, providing insights into the classification performance of the methods and the classes to which wound images belong. It compares the three-class classification achievements of this study with those reported in the literature and discusses the performance of the AlexNet architecture in wound image classification and tissue characterization.

The study highlights the significance of wound care and follow-up in the medical field, emphasizing the importance of accurate and early recognition of chronic wounds for reducing treatment costs and analyzing clinical, economic, and educational outcomes. It also recognizes the increasing importance of computer science in contributing to the treatment processes in the medical field, particularly in wound analysis.

The paper concludes by emphasizing that the model with 6 convolution layers (6conv_softmax) was the most successful, achieving 98.85% accuracy, 98.85% sensitivity, and 99.42% specificity, and suggests that future studies can aim to increase performance by modifying or improving other methods closely related to the AlexNet architecture.
