This paper explores a new approach to imaging web documents that is based on the semantic inclusion of textual and non-textual information. The primary aim is to develop a reliable method for displaying relevant search results in search engines based on keyword or image searches. The proposed method, Semantic Inclusion of Images and Textual (SIIT) segments, involves creating short web documents that contain semantically linked image and textual segments. The process of creating these short web documents involves three main steps: first, extracting all images and textual segments from the main content of the web document; second, analyzing the extracted images to obtain semantic descriptions of objects within the images; and third, linking the images and textual segments using linguistic analysis.

The paper also discusses a tool called TNT, developed by L. P. Florence, which is a text and image mining tool based on contextual exploration and offers a reorganization of text guided by images and annotated segments.

The paper addresses the challenge of identifying relevant text in web documents, particularly those containing multiple blocks with more than 500 characters or long text strings used in dynamic sites. To address this, the paper proposes using natural language description and full sentence counters to distinguish relevant text from auxiliary strings.

The proposed algorithm for text extraction was tested on a selected sample of documents and achieved an overall efficiency of 88.99%. The extraction of images relies on the successful identification of the main block of the document, which follows the success of the text extraction process.

The paper also details the testing of a three-phase process for working with extracted images and a support vector machine (SVM) model, involving segmentation and feature extraction using SIFT descriptors. The process involves setting three segments for each input image using k-means, extracting features from segments using SIFT descriptors, and modifying these descriptors based on a selected threshold.
