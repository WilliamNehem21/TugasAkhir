Virtual reality (VR) is often praised for its capability to create immersive and interactive learning environments, which can enhance embodied learning, a phenomenon where individuals feel a virtual body as their own. However, the underlying mechanisms and optimal design approaches for maximizing cognitive learning in VR remain subject to debate. Some suggest that a higher level of interactivity in VR leads to improved learning outcomes, but this notion is challenged by the complexity of VR interactions and their congruence with learning tasks, as well as the cognitive demands they impose on learners. This study aims to explore these complexities to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms influencing embodied learning in VR.

Two studies were conducted, comparing different conditions within each study. The first study compared two conditions: one where participants interacted directly with the virtual environment, and another where they observed pre-recorded animations of the tasks. The second study compared two other conditions: one where participants could freely move and observe the environment, and another where they observed from a fixed position. Following these conditions, participants were tested on their skills in a modified VR environment. The results revealed that movement within the VR environment did not significantly impact learning outcomes. However, the interaction techniques used for manipulating learning content had a significant effect on learning, with non-mirroring interactions leading to worse outcomes compared to direct manipulation.

The study is significant as it is the first to examine the impact of interaction features on procedural learning tasks within VR. The findings provide foundational knowledge to inform the design of VR learning systems, suggesting that fully interactive experiences may not always be necessary and that cost-effective approaches, such as observing recorded animations, may yield similar results. Additionally, the study raises questions about the assumption that a hands-on approach always enhances embodied learning and whether more interaction in VR always results in better learning outcomes.

The concept of active learning in VR is also explored, with some studies suggesting that simply being immersed in a virtual environment and observing learning content can facilitate active learning, while others argue that physical interaction with the environment is necessary. The study challenges the conventional notion that physical interactions are always essential for embodied learning, noting that observation in an immersive VR environment can trigger a similar sense of embodiment leading to effective learning.

The study also sheds light on the importance of minimizing extraneous cognitive load in VR learning environments and ensuring that tasks offer an optimal level of challenge to participants without impeding their learning. Limitations of the study, such as the lack of audio instructions and the use of text prompts, are identified, and suggestions for future research, such as the use of multimodal learning analytics, are proposed to improve the robustness of VR learning systems.
