Noise can arise in images during the processes of acquisition, processing, and transmission. For example, damaged pixels on an imaging sensor can lead to the introduction of random spots of noise with varying intensities in the acquired image, due to the inability of these areas to register incident light. Various types of noise in images include salt and pepper, Gaussian, Poisson, shot, and speckle, all of which are typically categorized as either additive (noise added to the original image) or multiplicative (noise multiplied with the original image).

Anisotropic diffusion has been commonly used to address the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. While it has proven to be effective in denoising images, there is a lack of research analyzing the impact of anisotropic diffusion in other image processing techniques, such as compression, segmentation, inpainting, and tomographic image reconstruction. Another potential avenue for research could involve the application of anisotropic diffusion in neural networks to learn a priori information.

Despite the established understanding that diffusion results in scale-space solutions, the fundamental question remains of determining the mathematical relationship of signal features at different scales. Understanding this relationship could enhance our comprehension of how the diffusion process operates, for example, clarifying how and why pixels diffuse across image regions to reduce noise and spurious features. Additionally, establishing inverse operations may be beneficial for reconstructing the original (noisy) signal after diffusion.

The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metric measures the signal strength relative to the noise content in an image, with higher PSNR values indicating higher image quality. However, PSNR lacks human perceptual qualities. The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) operates on a scale from 0 to 1 and addresses this deficiency by emulating the human visual system, providing higher values for better-quality images.

Finally, several methods, including those developed by Monteil and Beghdadi, Tebini et al., Gupta et al., Rezgui et al., and the present researchers, were employed to restore the original image. Throughout the experiments, PSNR and SSIM were used to assess the quality of the denoised images. Implementation codes have been made available for researchers to replicate the results.
