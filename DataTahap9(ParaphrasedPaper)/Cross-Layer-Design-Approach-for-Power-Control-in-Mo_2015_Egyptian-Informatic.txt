A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a group of wireless nodes capable of transferring data without relying on a fixed network infrastructure or centralized administration. These networks have diverse potential applications including disaster relief, military defense, healthcare, education, and business. In a MANET, each node serves as both a host and a router.

Wireless ad hoc networks operate on the principle of one-hop neighbor node broadcasting, where a transmission signal from a source node propagates to all neighboring nodes within its communication range. Issues related to transmission power often impact the functionality of wireless ad hoc networks. The inability to maintain a consistent transmission power can lead to degradation in transmission range, signal strength, and ultimately, the reliability of these networks.

The cross-layer design approach diverges from the traditional network design, where each layer of the protocol stack operates independently. The Internet Engineering Task Force has been investigating inter-layer interactions and performance in MANETs, highlighting the metrics for inter-layer interaction and the benefits of information exchange among the lower layers, network layer, and transport layer.

Mahlknecht et al. have proposed an energy-aware distance vector routing method for wireless sensor networks, aiming to minimize the impact of mobility and link disconnection. This method relies on route failure notification and route reestablishment notification from intermediate nodes.
