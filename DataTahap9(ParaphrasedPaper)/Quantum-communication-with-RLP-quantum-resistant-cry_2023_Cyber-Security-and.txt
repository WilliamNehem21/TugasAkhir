Quantum computing technology has a significant impact on digitalization efforts in industrial manufacturing, enabling improved performance prediction, operational excellence, and use case identification. In the 21st century, industrial manufacturing facilities handle a variety of sensitive and confidential information, including product data, financial transactions, and exchanges of data between designers and prototype builders. Security and confidentiality measures are essential for safeguarding this information, particularly in defense and critical chip manufacturing contracts. Robust security measures, such as strong identity and confidentiality guidelines, are necessary for production planning and execution within industrial production sites.

Large enterprises and industrial operations rely on core SAP S/4 applications for daily operations, including sales, manufacturing, financial transactions, and production order management. The S/4 systems require data security and accessibility for authorized users, and implementing CipherTrust Transparent Encryption in the S/4 HANA system is essential to protect enterprise data and transactions, ensuring compliance with information security standards.

In quantum computing, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) plays a crucial role in cryptography and offers significant opportunities for protecting critical security information in Industry 4.0. QKD provides a secure method for exchanging encryption keys between communication parties, enhancing the security of industrial operational parameters across production sites. Quantum cryptography, based on the principles of quantum mechanics, offers secure communication methods to protect data privacy, security, accessibility, confidentiality, and information availability within digital manufacturing environments.

Several key principles of quantum mechanics within quantum cryptography include the use of beam splitters for photon quantum entanglement, entanglement-based protocols, and the application of quantum mechanics for secure communication. Implementing device-independent, MDIQKD, and network QKD protocols are recommended as best practices for practical network security within QKD.

Overall, quantum computing and communications applications offer significant benefits for securing sensitive industrial manufacturing information, defense products, and research and development data. The paper addresses the challenges and opportunities of industrial cryptography and quantum communication in this context.
