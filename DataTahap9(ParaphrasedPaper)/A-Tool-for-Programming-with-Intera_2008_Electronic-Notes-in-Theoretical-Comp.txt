This paper presents inblobs, a visual tool created at Minho for integrated development with interaction nets. Existing tools typically require interaction nets and interaction rules to be input in textual form. Inblobs, however, is primarily a visual editor that allows users to graphically edit interaction systems (including interaction nets and rules) and convert them to textual notation for use as input in other net reduction tools. It also enables users to reduce nets within the integrated development environment. Section 2 provides an overview of interaction nets, followed by a description of inblobs in section 3, and detailed explanations of specific functionalities in sections 4, 5, and 6. The paper concludes with a description of the front-end on which inblobs is based in section 7, and a conclusion in section 8.

The paper defines the concepts of free ports, net interfaces, wirings, and empty nets. It also explains the roles of the 0, s, and + agents in constructing and implementing addition within interaction nets.

Inblobs functions as an integrated development environment, allowing users to alternate between reduction and editing steps on the interaction net system and the net being reduced. This feature is especially valuable for quickly prototyping new interaction net systems. Inblobs' reduction process operates directly on the underlying representation of the net used by the visual editor.

The paper describes the process of integrating a copy of the right-hand side of a rule into the current net, and the characteristics of Blobs, a visual editor for directed graphs, which was utilized as the front-end for inblobs. The representation of graphs inherited from Blobs was adapted to contain information specific to interaction nets, including geometric information about the placement of ports in nodes and the connection details of edges.
