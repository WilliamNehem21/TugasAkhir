Thailand is renowned globally for its market of colored stones, owing to the abundance of high-quality natural gemstone sources, particularly ruby and sapphire, and the presence of skilled artisans for gem cutting, as well as professionals in jewelry design and setting. However, there has been a reduction in the availability of good quality gem materials, leading to an increase in prices. Consequently, suppliers have turned to lower quality gem materials, which can be enhanced through heating processes. This heating process, particularly using gas feeding, can bring about changes in the chemical structure of trace elements within the stones, leading to improvements in color and clarity, and has gained widespread acceptance.

In the context of the BCR (Bureau Communautaire de Référence) testing, the oxidation step (BCR 3) generally resulted in the highest effect on extraction, with BCR 1 obtaining higher lead concentrations compared to BCR 3 for most samples from factories 2 to 6. Additionally, cracks in rubies were significantly evident after the BCR 3 step, which correlated with the lead concentrations in the leachate, except for samples from factories 1 and 7, which exhibited clear cracking after the BCR 1 test.

Furthermore, a comparison between two different series of treated rubies revealed that treated rubies in series I exhibited the highest lead content in BCR 2, while series II, which initially underwent BCR 2, yielded lower lead contents than those in series I. This suggests that BCR 2 may yield higher efficiency after being activated by other BCR steps.

This research was supported by the Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (GIT) and the National Research University project of Chulalongkorn University. The authors would like to express their gratitude to Dr. Bhuwadol Wanthanachaisaeng for his coordination and collection of ruby samples from various sources, as well as to GIT and the Environmental Research Institute of Chulalongkorn University for providing laboratory facilities and analytical support.
