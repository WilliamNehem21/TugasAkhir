Our approach to defining proof evidence revolves around analyzing the provability of horn clauses, which are used to encode rules for congruence, symmetry, transitivity, and redexes. This is achieved by allowing explicit control over choice points in such proofs through the use of simple programs known as experts. By varying the definitions of experts and utilizing different indexing schemes, we are able to modularly specify the various types of proof evidence mentioned informally, as well as others. The design of our proof checker ensures that it is sound regardless of how experts are defined.

Moreover, the types ar1, ar2, and ar3 correspond to functions that execute basic computations without needing to inspect the structure of certificate terms. In contrast, the expert predicates typically scrutinize the term to extract information such as substitution terms, indexes for stored formulas, or cut-formulas that are designed to guide the proof process. It should be noted that predicates ending with a capital "c" are clerks, those ending with a capital "e" are experts, and the store predicates are clerks, while the decide, release, and initial rules are associated with experts.
