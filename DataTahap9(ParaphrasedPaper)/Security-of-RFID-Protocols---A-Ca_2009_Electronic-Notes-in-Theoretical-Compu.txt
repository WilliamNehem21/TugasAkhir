Our paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an explanation of our terminology and discusses the HMNB protocol, while Section 3 identifies an authentication flaw in HMNB. Section 4 presents an attack on untraceability, and Section 5 demonstrates a desynchronization attack and a related untraceability attack. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude with a comparison of our attacks to typical attacks on these properties and provide an outlook on future work.

Within our model, the term "reader" refers to the actual RFID reader as well as the database communicating with the reader, as this communication occurs over a secure channel. An "agent" can be a tag or a reader, and a "role" refers to the protocol steps that a tag or reader is expected to carry out. A "run" corresponds to the execution of a role by an agent.

The HMNB protocol assumes that the reader 'r' and tag 't' share a secret ID, which is updated at the end of a successful protocol execution. Additionally, for efficiency reasons, the reader also stores the hash of the ID in 'hid' and the value of 'id' before the last update in 'id'. Furthermore, the tag keeps track of whether its last run ended successfully or not using the variable 's', making the protocol stateful.

We have identified a similar flaw in several other protocols, such as those in[12, 30, 31, 32], which are also challenge-response-based protocols where the response does not depend on the challenge. This common authentication flaw, previously unnoticed and illustrated in a technical report, raises concerns about the security of such protocols.

The ubiquity and wireless communication capability of RFID tags enable their tracing through space and time. From a privacy perspective, this is highly undesirable. While the authors of HMNB claim that their protocol provides untraceability because the tag never sends the same response twice, we have demonstrated that the protocol is not untraceable. We have provided an algorithm that gives the adversary a non-negligible advantage in guessing the selected tag. Additionally, we have discussed the flaw in the security analysis of HMNB.

We have also investigated the security claims of an RFID protocol designed to achieve mutual authentication, strong privacy, and desynchronization resistance while limiting the computational cost for readers and tags. Our findings have led to attacks on tag authentication, tag untraceability, and desynchronization resistance, with the identification of other RFID protocols suffering from the same authentication flaw. We have highlighted the need for automated verification tools to identify such flaws in protocols.

In conclusion, the identification of flaws in the untraceability proof of HMNB and several other protocols indicates a need for automated verification of this notion. Similarly, the attacks on desynchronization resistance in stateful RFID protocols highlight the necessity for a formal definition and verification of desynchronization resistance.
