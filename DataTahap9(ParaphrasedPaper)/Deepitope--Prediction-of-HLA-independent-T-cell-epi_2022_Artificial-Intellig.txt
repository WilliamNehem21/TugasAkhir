As of the current version, the CSV file produced by the IEDB search does not include the HLA associations for each epitope, but it is feasible to use the IEDB epitope ID to find this information. We developed a script to automatically filter out epitopes with unknown associated HLAs and those associated with fewer than two HLAs, thereby ensuring a set of validated promiscuous epitopes. Since this process yielded a small number of peptides, we included the immunogenic peptides used by Dhanda.

Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct predictions among all predictions (TP+TN)/(P+N), was calculated for all performance metrics using the scikit-learn library of the Python language. Additionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FP/(FP+TN)) for every possible decision rule cutoff between 0 and 1, was utilized to measure the performance of the prediction method. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as a common metric for performance assessment, with a value of 1 representing perfect separation of the two classes and 0.5 indicating a random classifier.

To determine if deep learning methods are indeed superior to simpler methods in this problem, we compared DeepTope to four other algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, and Support Vector Machines) using only 15-mers. In all tests, the residues of the 15-mers were one-hot encoded and provided to the methods implemented in Python v3.10.4 using scikit v1.0.2-1.

We conducted 1000 simulations using the T+ set against 1000 different versions of the human set. Results show virtually no difference, as the highest standard deviation obtained for any performance metric was 0.06. The standard deviations for AUC and accuracy were 0.02 and 0.01, respectively. Additionally, none of the human sets differed from the distribution of amino acids expected in humans, and they all yielded high p-values, indicating that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

As the obtained results were no better than random guessing, we did not conduct further testing or attempt to examine how they learn the positional preferences of each residue in human-derived peptides or T+. While each algorithm could potentially be adjusted for better performance, given the poor initial results, we believe that further investigation was not warranted. The CNN-LSTM employed by DeepTope displayed no complexities diverging from a basic CNN-LSTM yet achieved considerably superior results, indicating the need for more complex algorithms capable of capturing higher-order interactions and modeling the interplay of forces encoded in neighboring residues for each position.

Despite the lack of information on the associated HLAs, HLA-independent models could be valuable in uncovering underlying patterns that define an epitope beyond the specificity of each HLA. This may aid in establishing a set of fundamental signatures that ideally span the human population as broadly as possible. The feasibility of generalizing patterns from a set of epitopes for which the associated HLA remains undetermined needs to be explored. Given that not all epitopes in the IEDB have known associated HLAs, a separate test was conducted using T+ epitopes that bind to more than one HLA.

Comparison with CD4episcore predictions revealed that CD4episcore classified only a few peptides in the data set as epitopes. However, it exhibited high recall (TPR) and AUC, effectively capturing the characteristics of most T+ epitopes. Nevertheless, it classified too many peptides rich in positively-charged amino acids as immunogenic. These results underscore the impact of smaller, unrepresentative input data that may bias the predictions and emphasize the need to expand and diversify the database. Utilizing broader databases in conjunction with deep learning methods may lead to new insights into fundamental aspects of immunogenic peptides.

In this study, we trained a CNN-LSTM model to assess peptides for their similarity to immunogenic/non-immunogenic categories using MHC-II mediated T-cell epitopes. We suggest that HLA-independent linear T-cell epitope mapping tools are beneficial for identifying immunogenic peptides due to the presence of underlying non-HLA-specific immunogenic patterns. Therefore, HLA-specificity was disregarded, and the model was trained solely to predict whether a query peptide is best classified as immunogenic or non-immunogenic.
