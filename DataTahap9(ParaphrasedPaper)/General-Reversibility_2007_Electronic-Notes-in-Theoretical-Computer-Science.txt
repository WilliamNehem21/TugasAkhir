The authors initially introduced reversible CCS (RCCS) to represent concurrent computations with reversible actions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the core of RCCS can be analyzed at an abstract level, resulting in a theorem of pure category theory that underlies previous findings. This leads to new examples, with a specific application to Petri nets. 

The relationship between Theorem 4.4 and prior work on RCCS is explored, specifically regarding a weak bisimulation that connects the LTS of transactions to the LTS of reversible histories, treating reversible actions as internal (cf Theorem 5.3). 

Furthermore, the conclusion of Proposition 2.3 suggests that "i" and "r" are subcategories of "c," as they include identities and are closed under composition. This allows for the interchange of "i" and "r" with the subcategories they represent.

We also illustrate the theory with a more substantial example by considering Petri nets as symmetric monoidal (SM) categories. It's important to note that we do not deal with strict symmetric monoidal categories. Additionally, we introduce the notion of a tensor scheme and the associated notion of a free SM category on a tensor scheme, as tensor schemes are closely related to Petri nets. It's worth mentioning that tensor schemes can also be utilized to construct ordinary (i.e., non-symmetric) free monoidal categories.

Finally, the paper observes that decomposing a computation into irreversible-reversible components naturally leads to a factorization system on the category of computations. Future work will investigate these factorization systems in greater detail and explore connections with previous work on factorization systems in rewriting theory.
