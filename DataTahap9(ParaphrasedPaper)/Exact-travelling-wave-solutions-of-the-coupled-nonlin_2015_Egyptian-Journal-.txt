The new (g'/g)-expansion method has been shown to yield a greater number of novel exact solutions compared to other existing methods. These solutions encompass a range of distinct physical structures, including soliton, singular soliton, cuspon, kink, singular kink, periodic, bell-type solitary wave, and solitary wave solutions. The derivation of these various types of exact travelling wave solutions has significant implications for the mathematical underpinning of physics and engineering. Therefore, it is proposed that the novel (g'/g)-expansion method holds great promise as a mathematical tool not only for solving single nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) but also for addressing coupled NLEEs.
