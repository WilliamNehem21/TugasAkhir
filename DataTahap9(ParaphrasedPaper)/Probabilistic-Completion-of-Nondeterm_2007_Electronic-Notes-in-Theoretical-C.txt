In the first section, we offer a brief overview of the different categorical concepts employed, along with a concise list of important symbols. The second section provides a rapid survey of the ways in which choice theories can be combined. The third section presents our principal finding, which concerns the completion of arbitrary nondeterministic models using appropriately distributive probabilistic operators. We introduce the requisite theory for constructing the convex completions functor and thoroughly expound on its adjunction structure. The final section demonstrates how our functors can be leveraged to discover posetal models.

As previously observed, the traditional method for constructing mixed choice models within a category C was to compute LP models in C and then extend them by incorporating appropriately distributive nondeterministic operators. This approach not only enabled us to construct free mixed choice models from objects in C, but also to build mixed choice models from LP models over C. By concentrating on the dual approach, we are able to compute TMC models from TND models in C. Therefore, given any non-standard model of nondeterministic choice in C, we can extend it to mixed choice models.
