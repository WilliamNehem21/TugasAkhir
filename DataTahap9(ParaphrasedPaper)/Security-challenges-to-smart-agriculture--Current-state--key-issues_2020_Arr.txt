Smart agriculture encompasses a range of technologies, devices, protocols, and computational paradigms aimed at enhancing agricultural processes. The integration of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud, and edge computing offers the capacity to manage and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by various components. However, smart agriculture is still in its early stages and lacks robust security features. Future solutions must prioritize data availability and accuracy to support farmers, with security being a critical factor in developing resilient and efficient systems. Given the diverse resources involved in smart agriculture, security considerations include issues like compatibility, limited resources, and handling massive data. Existing protection measures used in traditional internet or internet of things (IoT) settings may not be suitable for agricultural systems, thereby creating additional demands and opportunities. This paper presents a review of the current state of smart agriculture security, particularly in open-field agriculture, discussing its architecture, outlining security concerns, highlighting the major challenges, and suggesting future directions.

Smart agriculture integrates elements from traditional internet, IoT, cellular, and wireless networks, thus inheriting the security issues associated with these technologies. Additionally, it faces specific security challenges such as data and device integrity, data accuracy, and availability. Factors such as exposure to environmental elements, animals, and machinery make smart agriculture susceptible to unique security threats that have not been addressed in other contexts.

The emergence of new technologies, such as smart agriculture, has also given rise to the concept of cyberagroterrorism, wherein computer systems in agricultural environments may be exploited to cause damage to crops, livestock, and financial losses. It is imperative to address these security challenges to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of smart agriculture systems.

The paper identifies a range of security threats and vulnerabilities across different layers of smart farming systems, such as the perception layer, edge layer, network layer, and application layer. It discusses specific security concerns related to each layer and recommends the implementation of innovative security solutions to address these challenges effectively.

Finally, the paper evaluates existing smart agriculture projects and emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security measures in these systems. It identifies specific projects that lack comprehensive security resources and provides insights into potential security implications of these projects.
