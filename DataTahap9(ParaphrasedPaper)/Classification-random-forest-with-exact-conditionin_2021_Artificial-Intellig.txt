The geosciences field frequently utilizes spatial prediction techniques to forecast categorical target variables in the presence of comprehensive spatial auxiliary information. Examples of such applications include predicting land use classes, drainage classes, vegetation species, and geological units. The mapping of categorical variables is integral in various geoscience applications, aiding in risk-aware decision-making in environmental studies. Several methodologies, such as indicator kriging with external drift (IKED), regression-kriging of indicators (RKI), and regression-kriging of memberships (RKFM), have been used to predict categorical variables using this spatial information.

IKED assumes a linear relationship between auxiliary variables and the occurrence of the categorical target variable, incorporating them as deterministic linear functions within the indicator kriging system. Implementing IKED can be challenging due to the simultaneous estimation of external drift parameters and the covariance function of the stochastic component. On the other hand, RKI combines multinomial logistic regression with kriging of regression residuals, while RKFM replaces crisp indicator values with continuous membership values in the RKI framework. 

Another alternative approach for spatial prediction of categorical variables involves using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM)-based methodologies. These approaches, proposed by Cao et al. (2011), assume spatially correlated latent variables to account for spatial dependency in the categorical target variable. Compared to indicator kriging-based methodologies, GLMM-based approaches are computationally intensive but are free of the inherent problems associated with indicator kriging.

Additionally, a method using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on spatially exhaustive auxiliary information is proposed for spatial prediction of categorical variables. This method involves training the RF classifier on the data, followed by comparison with geostatistical and traditional machine learning methods for prediction performance evaluation using simulated and real-world datasets.

The proposed method aims to exact condition the categorical target variable to the data, achieved by combining classification random forest, signed distance functions, principal component analysis, and randomized quadratic programming. The method demonstrates good out-of-sample predictive performance and is capable of handling a large number of categories consistently through the signed distance representation. It also provides realistic prediction uncertainties of the categorical target variable and can quickly update predictive maps when new observations are added.

Overall, this paper presents a novel approach for spatial prediction of categorical variables, demonstrating its effectiveness through simulated and real-world datasets and highlighting its advantages over existing geostatistical methods such as regression-kriging of indicators.
