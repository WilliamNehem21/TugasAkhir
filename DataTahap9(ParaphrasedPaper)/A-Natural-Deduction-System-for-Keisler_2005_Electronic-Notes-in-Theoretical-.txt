The extension must have at least one member if it is not marked. Therefore, the unmarked variables in the labels are to be treated as existentials. The labels are sequences of both marked and unmarked variables, and the order of occurrence is significant. We opted not to utilize constants and functionals to provide a more straightforward exposition. If more complex terms are used, the label should include information about the variables present in the term, although this is not elaborated on in the current text.
