We propose a novel approach in which processes are controlled by sets of actions, called multi-actions, with the typical scenario involving single-action sets. The ordering and reversal of multi-actions are flexible. This concept of multi-actions resembles those in CCS-R, but it has not been previously explored to the best of our knowledge, possibly due to a lack of incentive. However, incorporating biological characteristics into a formal framework can provide valuable inspiration. Once this integration is achieved, the original motive may fade temporarily, prompting the exploration of alternative applications. For instance, this approach could potentially be applied to decentralized transactional mechanisms, although further research is required to determine its feasibility. This avenue for investigation is left open for future exploration.
