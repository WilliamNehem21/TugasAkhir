One approach to decreasing overall energy usage in data centers involves implementing power management (PM) to enable servers to switch between power states, thereby reducing power consumption while maintaining performance levels. In recent years, the concept of power proportionality, where power consumption is directly proportional to utilization, has been identified as one of the three key areas for improving data center energy efficiency. As both PM software and hardware continue to advance, our research introduces a new evaluation method embedded within a data center simulation framework using the multi-method simulation software AnyLogic.

This method extends the PM functionality by providing an interface for specifying multiple strategies, allowing for the use of various state information variables related to traffic, system service, power, performance, and thermodynamics. By formulating more advanced PM strategies, significant improvements in energy efficiency can be achieved while meeting other service-level agreement (SLA) demands.

Our initial step involves utilizing an existing data center simulation framework, which is described in section 2.1, and elaborating on a dynamic PM extension in section 2.2 with the capability to strategically control the power states of servers using different observable quantities. Additionally, an existing specification of dynamic PM strategies within this simulation framework is detailed, addressing how well performance and energy goals are met. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest performance per watt (PPW), though expressing a meaningful combination of power consumption and performance can be challenging due to the potential trade-off between the two, as evidenced in previous work.

Efficiency in power management strategies is evaluated based on how effectively performance and energy goals are achieved. The performance management aim is to minimize response time, while power management focuses on minimizing power consumption. A convenient approach for meeting SLA demands involves setting a response time threshold and determining the percentage of jobs that violate the SLA. Our partners use this method in practice, and it has been observed that better power management strategies result in fewer SLA violations.

Another metric for evaluating power management strategies is the total number of power state switches during the simulation, excluding those made during adaptation, expressed as a fraction of the time spent in a stabilized system (n_ti = t1 + t2 + ... + tn). We further define the PSSFA and a more detailed PSSF in the following sections.
