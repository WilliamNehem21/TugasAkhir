In this academic paper, we introduce a graph-based approach to intuitionistic modal logics, which offers a consistent framework for articulating, examining, and contrasting Kripke-like semantics. This method leverages the adaptable nature of graph calculi to straightforwardly and intuitively represent possible-world semantics for intuitionistic modal logics. We demonstrate the advantages of these concepts by employing them in the analysis of well-known instances of intuitionistic multi-modal semantics.

We also present graph calculi, utilizing diagrams as expressions and incorporating rules that manipulate diagrams to visually capture the semantics of modal operators and accessibility relations. These calculi furnish standardized and versatile formalisms that facilitate the exploration of Kripke-like semantics for intuitionistic modal logics, including satisfaction criteria and valid formulas. We demonstrate these concepts through two case studies based on the logics presented in references [13,5].
