The field of concept-level sentiment analysis involves the identification and categorization of concepts and attributes in user reviews, particularly those related to products and various entities such as political leaders and government policies. Previous research in this area has primarily relied on a limited set of linguistic rules for extracting concepts and their associated features, as well as ontological relations. However, there is a need for the development of enhanced ontological relations to broaden the scope of features and concepts used in concept-level sentiment analysis.

The utilization of ontological relationships in sentiment analysis of online reviews presents a challenge due to the diverse nature of ontological concepts and relations. Existing studies in concept-level sentiment analysis using ontological relationships have been constrained by a limited set of concepts, features, and ontological relations, which affects the effectiveness of sentiment classification in user reviews. Consequently, there is a significant need to develop a concept-level sentiment analysis system that addresses the limitations of previous studies and enables efficient classification of user reviews with respect to product aspects. In this study, we propose a concept-level sentiment analysis system that incorporates an expanded set of concepts and features, as well as enhanced ontology relations to improve the classification of user reviews.

Twitter provides a platform for online users to express their sentiments and opinions on a wide range of subjects, including products, events, and organizations. Some studies have utilized Twitter data to explore context-aware sentiment analysis. For example, Ruba and Venkateson developed a custom sentiment analysis tool based on Twitter posts. In this work, the methodology involves three main steps: creation of a domain ontology, exploration of the ConExp software tool for creating a concept lattice, and application of different software tools such as Lattice Miner, FCArt, Concept Explorer, Galicia, and Toscaj for formal concept analysis related to the domain of phones.

In our study, we selected two models, M1 (SVM) and M2 (MNB), and evaluated their performance using a specific dataset. Let "n" represent the number of records, and we calculated the error rates for SVM (e1) and MNB (e2). Our primary objective was to determine whether the difference between e1 and e2 is statistically significant (Tan, Steinbench, & Kumar, 2016). Subsequently, the SVM classifier was employed to perform sentiment analysis at the concept level. The proposed system's performance was assessed using various metrics and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results were promising, demonstrating improved accuracy (87.5%), precision (88%), recall (88%), and F-score (88%).
