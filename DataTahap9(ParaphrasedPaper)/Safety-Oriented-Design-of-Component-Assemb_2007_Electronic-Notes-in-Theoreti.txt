This paper advocates for the use of compositional reasoning in the context of safety-critical systems and presents a safety-oriented component model through the example of an adaptive cruise controller (ACC) from the automotive industry. The application comprises four components, each with 18 identified fault modes, and the impact of these faults on a safety property associated with the ACC is systematically examined. The analysis is conducted using compositional rules and derived safety interfaces for each component.

The paper emphasizes the importance of rigorous and efficient methods for compositional analysis from components to assemblies, particularly focusing on faults that can compromise system safety. It highlights the need for support tools to facilitate the generation of safety interfaces and refinement checking.

In the context of the automotive industry, the paper introduces an ACC case study to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The ACC extends the conventional in-vehicle cruise control function by adapting the vehicle's speed based on the distance to the preceding vehicle and the current speed limit. Safety assessment procedures involve identifying possible faults in the system and evaluating their impact. The paper also discusses the challenges of formal safety analysis in developing complex automotive electronics and the need for effective tool support in aiding component developers in generating safety interfaces.

The proposed technique is applied to the ACC, with a focus on non-boolean variables, using the tool set SCADE. The paper illustrates the development and generation of safety interfaces for the ACC components, highlighting the potential for reusing partial analysis results in future upgrade scenarios.

While the paper presents promising results, it acknowledges the need for further research to develop more efficient methods for generating safety interfaces, refinement checking, and analysis of environment constraints. Additionally, it suggests exploring the application of these techniques within development environments specifically designed around component-based concepts.

The paper concludes by acknowledging support from the Swedish Strategic Research Foundation (SSF) project SAVE and the National Aerospace Research Program NFFP, as well as expressing gratitude to specific individuals for their contributions to the research.
