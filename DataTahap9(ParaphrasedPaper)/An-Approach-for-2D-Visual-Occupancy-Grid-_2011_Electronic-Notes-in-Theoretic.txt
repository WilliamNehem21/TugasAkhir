This paper introduces a method that utilizes planar information (homography matrix) to construct a 2D occupancy grid map from monocular vision. The initial step involves segmenting the image to categorize its components as either floor or non-floor. This classification enables the identification of free areas and obstacles within the image. The practical results presented in the paper serve to validate this approach.

In terms of environmental discretization, it is possible to define a map consisting of a finite set of cells, denoted as mx,y, each with an aggregated value representing the probability of being occupied. These cells can have values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates an empty cell and 1 indicates an occupied cell.

In a previous study by Oriolo et al., the authors demonstrate the formulation and resolution of perception and planning problems dealing with uncertainties using set theory (fuzzy logic). The map constructed using this technique is defined as a fuzzy set, with each point associated with a real number quantifying the likelihood of it being part of an obstacle. The primary advantage of this approach is the ability to utilize various fuzzy operators to model uncertainties and aggregate information from multiple sources.

Another variation is evident in the work of Yguel et al., which addresses data storage and representation issues for large maps by proposing an occupancy grid representation based on wavelets, referred to as wavelet occupancy grids.

In terms of environmental representation, it is important to consider incorporating auxiliary information such as soil deformation, humidity, and temperature in addition to mapping data. Estrada et al. developed a method called dense SLAM to facilitate the integration of such auxiliary information, which is challenging to incorporate using traditional SLAM methods.

Andrade and Sanfeliu present a solution for mapping dynamic environments using an occupancy grid, employing a force formulation that decreases with time. Additionally, they use a Kalman filter to filter low force marks. Canas and Matellan compare various mapping techniques for dynamic environments using grids.

Yguel et al. proposes the use of GPUs to fuse information and build a grid map, freeing up the processor for other tasks related to the robot. Merhy et al.'s work presents strategies for refining occupancy grids based on probabilistic segmentation in the context of image processing, encoding the probabilities associated with each cell of the grid map as texture levels in an image.

Other works propose the construction of volumetric maps through occupancy grids. One study uses a 3D grid with multiple cameras for tracking people in an outdoor environment, while another builds a grid map using stereo vision with terrain height variance information to calculate the crossing probability for each cell given the defective environment.

Despite these advantages, solutions based on optical sensors face challenges such as lens distortion, restricted field of vision, and low resolutions. Further details about these difficulties and potential solutions are outlined in Taylor et al.

An additional challenge of this approach is that an obstacle in the image is projected onto the world projectively. As a result, cells in the image that are considered not free cannot be mapped into the 2D grid, as the information is limited to the frontier region between obstacles and the floor. To address this issue, an algorithm was implemented to reclassify the non-free cells as obstacles or occlusions.
