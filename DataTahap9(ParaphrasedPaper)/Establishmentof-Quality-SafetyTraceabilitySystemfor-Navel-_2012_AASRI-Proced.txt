The implementation of traceability systems is crucial for managing food quality and safety. Many governments around the world are increasingly prioritizing the establishment of such systems. This study focuses on the development of a traceability system for ensuring the quality and safety of navel oranges in China's central mountain area, covering their production, processing, storage, and distribution.

The tracking and tracing technology for ensuring the quality and safety of navel oranges is broken down into three levels: information collection, information processing, and information services. The information collection phase involves analyzing the business processes from planting to harvesting, assessing potential hazards, identifying factors that impact the oranges' quality and safety, and gathering information related to product processing, quality inspection, logistics, and marketing. This information is used to establish a traceability data center for navel oranges, ultimately supporting the achievement of comprehensive traceability. 

In the information processing phase, methods such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) are used to determine key factors affecting the quality and safety of navel oranges. Information exchange, management, and hardware research and development are also utilized, along with encoding information technology, to facilitate the processing of traceability data.

Furthermore, a quality tracking and tracing coding system for oranges has been designed, incorporating elements such as raw materials, origin codes, batch production codes, and final product traceability codes. By integrating these codes with internal production processes and standards, this system forms the foundation for a comprehensive traceability framework for navel oranges.
