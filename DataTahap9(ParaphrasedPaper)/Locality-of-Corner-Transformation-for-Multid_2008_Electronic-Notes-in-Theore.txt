The complex geometric structure of spatial objects does not inherently lead to an intuitive distance metric for measuring spatial proximity in the data space. However, the use of such a metric provides a formal foundation for analytical work in transformation-based multidimensional spatial access methods, including the preservation of locality in the underlying transformation and distance-based spatial queries. This study examines the Hausdorff distance metric on multidimensional polytopes and establishes a close relationship between this metric on the original space of k-dimensional hyperrectangles and the standard p-normed metric on the transform space of 2k-dimensional points under the corner transformation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the transformation-based technique in preserving spatial locality.

To handle spatial objects with simple geometric structures in a spatial data space, such as line segments, hyperrectangles, or hyperspheres, an elegant object-mapping approach like the corner transformation can be employed to transform the spatial characteristics of objects into points in higher-dimensional space. This approach can then be coupled with an existing point access method. For example, in the mapping of rectangles in 2-dimensional Euclidean space to 4-dimensional points, the corner transformation is based on the coordinates of a pair of antipodal corners of the rectangle. The transformation of a database of spatial objects in the original space into a database of higher-dimensional points in the transformed space, combined with a point access method for the transformed space, results in a spatial access method for the original space. While our study focuses on the corner transformation technique, the concepts developed for its analysis can be generalized to other similar transformations.

Difficulties arise when analyzing the preservation of locality and clustering in transformation-based spatial access methods due to the lack of an intuitive metric that captures spatial proximity for spatial objects with complex geometric structures. Moreover, even with the presence of such a metric, the analysis of locality in a spatial access method modified from or coupled with a point access method is inherently constrained by the locality knowledge of the point access method and the constraints of the modification or transformation. As a result, simple transformation techniques may encounter various potential difficulties and disadvantages relating to the presence or absence of metrics on multidimensional spatial objects, the preservation of locality of transformations, non-uniform distribution in the transform space, and efficient support of complex spatial operations. Recent studies in the literature have addressed the latter two issues, and the former two can be resolved by developing intuitive and flexible metrics for multidimensional spatial objects.
