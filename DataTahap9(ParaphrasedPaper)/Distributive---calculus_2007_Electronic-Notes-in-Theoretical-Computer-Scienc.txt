In this paper, we propose an enhanced calculus that can accommodate unrestricted term rewriting systems by introducing a new evaluation rule governing the behavior of resulting structures, as well as implementing a call-by-value evaluation strategy. We also demonstrate the confluence of the extended calculus and establish the correctness and completeness of the proposed encoding.

The capacity to discern patterns is a fundamental mechanism underlying human reasoning. Pattern recognition, also known as pattern matching, has been a part of information processing models since their inception and has been extensively studied in the context of strings, trees, and feature objects.

Our study shows that the previously introduced encoding can be extended to encompass general term rewrite systems. To accomplish this, we introduce a new evaluation rule that enriches the semantics of the structure operator, and enforce an evaluation strategy to maintain confluence when dealing with the general case.

The content of this paper includes: in Section 2, we present the syntax and evaluation semantics of the proposed calculus, and establish its confluence. In Section 3, we discuss the expressive power of the calculus, specifically through the encoding of non-convergent term rewriting systems. Finally, in Section 4, we conclude and outline future prospects for this work.

We observe that the term "(a d b b d c) a" does not reduce to "b" as expected. Instead, the inability of the rule "b d c" to apply to "a" (in classical rewriting) is recorded in the final result as a "failure" term in normal form. This approach is valuable for explicitly handling failures and allowing rules to accommodate such specific terms, such as for an exception handling mechanism. However, if the user is not concerned with explicit manipulation of matching failures and desires to ignore such behavior, a uniform treatment of matching failures is needed, eliminating them when not relevant to the computation.

Defining such a calculus presents challenges, particularly in dealing with matching modulo a given congruence, which is generally non-unitary, especially for classical theories like associativity and commutativity. This can lead to the existence of infinitely many solutions, without a natural ordering for these solutions (substitutions). For example, when working modulo the commutativity of the symbol "f," the term "(f(x, y) d x) f(a, b)" yields two solutions of the matching problem: "{a/x, b/y}" and "{b/x, a/y}." 

Since the normal form of some terms with respect to a non-confluent TRS is not unique, sets of results need to be handled. We opt to represent sets of results as structures, with the empty set represented by "stk" and the union of two sets represented using the structure operator. In the rewriting calculus, the representation of sets is not unique, as the structure operator is not considered to be commutative, associative, or idempotent.

We provide a proof of the theorem, conducted through induction on the term "m" and then by induction on the largest length of a reduction with respect to "r" of "m" to a normal form. The proof utilizes Theorem 3.2 and is presented within.

The next step in this research involves extending the proposed calculus to general term rewriting systems. A key challenge when dealing with matching modulo a congruence is the multiplicity of solutions. As these solutions cannot be naturally ordered, the structure operator should be considered associative, commutative, and idempotent. Furthermore, the notion of definitive failures should be adapted to the specific matching theories being considered, and a call-by-value strategy should be enforced to prevent matching against uninstantiated terms and avoid the loss of matching solutions.
