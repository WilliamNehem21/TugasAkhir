This research paper introduces the concept of unfolding as a technique for preserving the semantics of programs through the expansion of subexpressions using their own definitions. It extends the unfolding rule for pure logic programs to a fuzzy logic setting and defines two unfolding-based transformation rules for this purpose. The paper also describes the development of a fuzzy logic variant of Prolog, where each program clause can be interpreted under a different fuzzy logic. It adapts the concept of a computation rule and proves its independence, and introduces a transformation system with strong correctness, ensuring that both original and transformed programs compute the same fuzzy answers. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the transformation rules consistently improve the efficiency of residual programs by reducing the length of successful fuzzy SLD-derivations.

The paper also discusses the background and significance of fuzzy logic programming, emphasizing its relevance in handling uncertainty and approximated reasoning. It presents an overview of existing fuzzy logic programming systems and the different approaches to incorporating fuzzy logic into Prolog, highlighting the diversity in the choice of fuzzy logic and the introduction of a theoretical model capable of dealing with multiple valued implications. The operational semantics of the proposed language, F-Prolog, are outlined, and the paper then focuses on the adaptation of computation rules and the development of unfolding-based transformation rules for F-Prolog. The main theoretical and practical properties of these transformation rules are subsequently proven.

In addition, the paper introduces considerations for the inclusion of fuzzy logic in logic programming and describes the extension of the language LF-Prolog, which allows for the interpretation of program clauses under different logics. The independence of the fuzzy computation rule for LF-Prolog programs and goals is established as an auxiliary result, and the paper concludes by summarizing the contributions and findings presented.
