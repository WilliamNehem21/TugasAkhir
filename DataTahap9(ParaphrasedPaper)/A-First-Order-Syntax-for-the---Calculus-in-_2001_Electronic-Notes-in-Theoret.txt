The paper discusses the communication between two processes, P and C, and the formalization of the \(\pi\)-calculus using the Isabelle theorem-prover. The \(\pi\)-calculus is a model of mobile communication systems and higher-order languages, and it allows processes to declare new names and send them to other processes, creating private communication lines. The paper considers an infinitely large set of names and aims to formalize the syntax for the \(\pi\)-calculus.

The authors utilize the Isabelle theorem-prover, which is based on higher-order intuitionistic logic, to formalize the \(\pi\)-calculus. The theorem-prover supports uni cation and backward-resolution style proofs, and it offers various tactics for proving goals based on heuristics and algebraic transformations. The authors also explore different approaches for formalizing the syntax of the \(\pi\)-calculus, considering object-level and meta-level variables, and distinguishing between free and bound names.

Overall, the paper presents an in-depth examination of the \(\pi\)-calculus and its formalization using the Isabelle theorem-prover, providing insights into different formalization approaches and their practical implications.
