In this paper, the focus is on the convex recoloring problem, which involves finding the minimum number of recolored vertices required to make a given coloring convex, meaning that every set of vertices with the same color induces a connected subgraph. While the problem is traditionally studied in the context of trees, this paper concentrates on general graphs and introduces a heuristic approach called GRASP to address the problem. The authors conducted computational experiments to evaluate the performance of their heuristic and compared it to an existing integer linear programming model. The results of the experiments showed that the GRASP algorithm accomplished a similar number of vertex recolorings as the model from the literature but with significantly less time usage. The paper also introduces a set of benchmark instances for the problem.

The convex recoloring problem originated in the study of phylogenetic trees, which are used to represent the evolutionary history of a group of species. The problem is primarily studied in the context of trees, and it has been proven to be NP-hard in this context. While an integer programming model has been proposed for the convex recoloring problem on trees and has demonstrated good computational results, the problem is also NP-hard for general graphs, and to date, only exact algorithms have been proposed for solving it, with no reported computational results.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides basic definitions for the convex recoloring problem, Section 3 discusses existing methods for solving the problem, Section 4 presents the proposed algorithm, Section 5 reports on the computational experiments and their results, and Section 6 outlines the conclusions and suggests future research directions.

The GRASP heuristic is chosen for its simplicity and minimal tuning parameters, such as the percentage of best candidates considered for selection and the stopping condition. Additionally, GRASP has the potential to be combined with other techniques, such as variable neighborhood search and parallelization. The main components of the GRASP algorithm for solving the convex recoloring problem are described in detail, including the construction phase and local search routine, which explores different neighborhoods to find a local maximum. The paper also details the criteria used to select, sort, and recolor candidate vertices in the construction phase.
