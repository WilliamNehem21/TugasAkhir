Therefore, the objective of this study was to create cotton segmentation algorithms that can effectively detect cotton bolls under varying natural lighting conditions using a single threshold value, with minimal errors. The algorithms were evaluated based on their image processing time and segmentation accuracy. Four new cotton segmentation methods were introduced, in addition to existing methods, which could be utilized by cotton harvesting robots for identifying cotton bolls. After analyzing four color spaces, the RGB and YCbCr color spaces were chosen for cotton segmentation under natural light conditions. Optimal thresholds were selected, and morphological opening and closing operations were conducted to eliminate noise and holes in the segmented binary image. The performance of the proposed algorithms was assessed in terms of hit rate, false positives, false negatives, processing time, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

The study found that cotton bolls can be easily detected based on their color features. Among the commonly used color space models for feature segmentation from color images are the RGB, HSV, L*a*b, and YCbCr color models. The choice of an appropriate color space model is critical for the successful detection of specific objects in color images. In this study, the RGB and YCbCr color space models were selected and utilized for developing algorithms for in-field cotton detection. Previous researchers have also used the RGB and YCbCr color space models for extracting the region of interest in various agricultural applications. Four image processing algorithms were developed, three of which utilized the threshold value of chromatic aberration and pixel values to distinguish cotton bolls from the background.

The selection of suitable threshold values is vital for accurate segmentation and recognition of the cotton bolls using the proposed algorithms. Previous studies have employed various threshold methods for segmenting the region of interest from an image. In this study, the color thresholding method was applied to segment images and identify cotton bolls.

The performance of the proposed algorithms was evaluated using two approaches. The first approach involved counting the true detected cotton (TDC), false detected cotton (FDC), and missed cotton (MC), where TDC represents objects in the segmented image that were correctly recognized as cotton bolls. Another approach involved calculating true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) to assess the accuracy of the algorithm's predictions. These measures were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms in identifying cotton bolls accurately.
