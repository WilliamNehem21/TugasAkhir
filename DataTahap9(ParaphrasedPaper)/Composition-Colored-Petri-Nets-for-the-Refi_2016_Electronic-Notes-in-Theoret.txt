The process of refining a model is crucial in model development. When constructing reaction-based models, data refinement involves substituting a single species with multiple variations of that species in the refined model. This paper explores the implementation of data refinement using Petri nets without increasing the size of the model in terms of the number of places and transitions. The study introduces a new class of Petri nets, called composition Petri nets (comp-nets), and their colored counterpart, colored composition Petri nets (comcp-nets), to capture the compositional structure of species.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the concept of structural model refinement, while Section 3 introduces the concept of Petri nets with a compositional part to capture the functioning and compositional relationships between elements in a model. The paper then discusses the implementation of reaction-based models as comp-nets and the method of implementing model refinement using comcp-nets. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

Composition Petri nets are introduced as a new class of Petri nets with two parts: an active part, behaving like a standard Petri net, and a passive part with transitions that describe the composition of elements in different places in the network. In cases where the complexity of a network makes it difficult to understand the corresponding Petri net, colored Petri nets, which have been extended to include a compositional part, can be used to reduce the model size.

The paper proposes the use of comcp-nets to model and implement the structural refinement of a system, emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate color sets, especially for complex places. The properties of comcp-nets, such as boundedness, liveness, and reachability graph, are discussed, and a coloring example using this strategy is provided.

Overall, the paper presents a new class of Petri nets that enables fast model refinement when the compositional structure of elements is known. These Petri nets offer a graphical representation and formalized structural information, making them suitable for handling model refinement and model explosion. The framework allows for a similar approach to modeling as the kappa language, where attributes and internal states of species can be represented in the color set.
