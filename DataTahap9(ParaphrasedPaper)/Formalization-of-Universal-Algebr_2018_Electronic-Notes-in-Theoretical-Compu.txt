The relationships between the definitions of subalgebras, quotients, and epimorphisms (surjective homomorphisms) are interconnected through the three isomorphism theorems. While there is some minimal additional complexity in coding subalgebras, the proofs closely adhere to standard methods. To establish these results, we also introduced the concepts of kernel and homomorphic image of homomorphisms.

The concept of morphism between signatures is associated with the interpretability of similarity types in universal algebra, and has been extensively studied in the literature. Fujiwara initially introduced this concept as mappings between algebraic systems, while Janssen, building on the adjoint group, referred to it as a polynomial derivor. Additionally, Mossakowski et al. extended this notion to a derived signature morphism, which represents a more general form of the restricted signature morphisms in the theory of institutions.
