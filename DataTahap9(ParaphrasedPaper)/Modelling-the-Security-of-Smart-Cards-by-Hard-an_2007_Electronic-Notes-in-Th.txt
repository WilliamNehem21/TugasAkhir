This academic paper demonstrates the application of calculus to model an e-cash smart card system, where the security depends on the interaction between linear mobile hardware, embedded non-linear mobile processes, and local names. It emphasizes that a purely linear calculus cannot express the copying of embedded software processes, and a purely non-linear calculus cannot express the fact that mobile hardware processes cannot be copied.

The paper discusses the development of several process calculi inspired by mobile ambients and global ubiquitous computing scenarios. These calculi combine mobile processes, nested explicit locations, and local names, taking into account the properties of mobile computing devices and mobile computations. The authors argue that mobile computing hardware devices are inherently linear, while mobile software operations are inherently non-linear. They propose an extension of the type and effect system for the Homer calculus, inspired by affine intuitionistic linear logic, to distinguish between affine linear and non-linear uses of variables and to type the names of locations to restrict their content to be linear or non-linear.

The authors claim that the calculus captures the inherent copyability features of mobile computing hardware devices and software processes. They provide an example of a simplistic e-cash system to illustrate this claim. The paper concludes with a proposed future work.

The structure of the paper includes an introduction to the Homer calculus, transition semantics, the type system, and a smart card example. It also discusses related work and presents results of the type system. The paper highlights the implications of the type system for modeling an e-cash system and concludes with potential areas for future research.
