Several research teams are working on refining a generic algorithm that can be effectively utilized by the industry. Meanwhile, digital content, especially images and videos, are vulnerable to attacks. Attackers may seek to remove watermarks from signed images, necessitating the embedding algorithm to be resilient against common image processing attacks.

Huang et al. have proposed a new blind watermarking method based on a neural network in the wavelet domain. The technique involves embedding a scrambled watermark robustly and imperceptibly, leveraging human visual system (HVS) characteristics. The authors have successfully employed a neural network to establish the relationship between the watermark and the corresponding watermarked image, allowing for blind recovery of the exact watermark from the signed image. Experimental results demonstrate the scheme's good imperceptibility and high robustness against various image processing attacks.

Motwani et al. have implemented a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system (FIS) using HVS characteristics—brightness, texture, and edge sensitivities of the gray-scale image—as input. The output of this inference system is used to embed the watermark in the host image in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain. The FIS is based on 27 inference rules, relying on a large training dataset over the entire expected range of variable changes. While the fuzzy logic handles input and output imprecision defined by fuzzy sets and allows for greater flexibility in system description, it lacks adaptability. Therefore, the authors suggest integrating artificial neural networks (ANN) with fuzzy logic to extend system capabilities. The proposed watermarking scheme implements a hybrid fuzzy-backpropagation neural network (BPNN) system, which maps fuzzy inputs to crisp outputs without requiring a large training dataset, thereby addressing the adaptability limitation of a pure fuzzy rule-based system.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the theory of the hybrid fuzzy expert system based on BPNN proposed by Lee and Lu. Section 3 describes experimental details, including embedding, extraction, and robustness. Section 4 discusses the experimental results, and Section 5 presents the concluding remarks. The list of references is included at the end.

This notation, using p= 1, 2, 3,..., n to denote the pth pattern for a total of n input patterns to be trained by the fuzzy-BPNN, is useful for understanding the bias value and the input patterns.
