The paper discusses the implications of using higher-order representation of typing judgments in the context of the metalanguage, particularly in the formalization of proofs in the ATS/LF system. It highlights the advantages of higher-order representations, such as inheriting substitution on typings from the metalanguage, thus eliminating the need for a typing substitution lemma. The separation between statics and dynamics, along with the use of explicit contexts, enables the direct proof of metatheorems using total recursive functions, while still benefiting from higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) for object syntax. The paper also compares the benefits of higher-order encoding over first-order encoding, demonstrating that the former avoids the complexities associated with reasoning about variable freshness and the need to explicitly prove that substitution commutes with lambda binding. Furthermore, the paper briefly mentions the formalization of strong normalization for System F and compares it with previous work, noting that the use of higher-order representation results in a shorter and less complicated formalization.
