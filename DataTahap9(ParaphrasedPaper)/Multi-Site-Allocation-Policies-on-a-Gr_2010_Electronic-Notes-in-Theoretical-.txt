This study investigates a system comprising two sites where grid jobs (gangs) and local jobs compete for the same resources. The research explores different scheduling policies for both gangs and locals, and implements a backfilling method to prevent fragmentation. It proposes and evaluates three different scheduling approaches for the gangs, conducting three sets of experiments using a simulation model under various workloads.

The experiments reveal that approach 2 yields the best overall system performance, completing a high percentage of gangs (100% in medium/low workloads) without significantly impeding the locals. Additional experiments study the impact on system performance when overhead is added due to gangs being routed to multiple sites, indicating that lower overhead results in better metrics for the gangs under almost all workloads. Various values for the threshold of backfilling jobs are also examined, leading to the conclusion that a threshold of 0 is the best solution, resulting in improved metrics for the gangs and satisfying response time for the locals.
