The paper outlines the different stages of farming and their relationship to machine learning (ML). It details the use of ML in the pre-harvesting stage in section 2, the use in harvesting in section 3, and the use in the post-harvesting stage in section 4. Sections 5 and 6 focus on the discussion and challenges of using artificial intelligence (AI), ML, and deep learning (DL) in agriculture.

The pre-harvesting stage is crucial for the overall growth of crops and fruits, and ML is used to capture various parameters such as soil quality, seed quality, fertilizer application, pruning, genetics, environmental conditions, and irrigation. The paper highlights the importance of minimizing overall production losses by focusing on these components and leveraging neural networks and ML to capture their parameters.

The paper also discusses classification and estimation models for soil attributes and soil management surveys that use ML techniques to predict or identify soil properties. Additionally, it explores the development of a real-time decision support system integrated with a camera sensor module for plant disease identification and the use of automated fruit harvesting systems and fruit detection models based on ML algorithms. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for following the ML pipeline with standard experimental methods and making datasets available for testing and validation by other researchers in the field.

In summary, the paper comprehensively surveys the various ML algorithms used in different stages of agriculture, providing valuable insights for researchers working in this area.
