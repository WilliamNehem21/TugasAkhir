This paper introduces a modified version of the strict intersection type assignment system, which extends the system described in previous work by adding intersection and union types as well as the type constant t. This extended system guarantees that lambda terms typeable in the original system translate to x-nets while preserving their type. The main findings of this work demonstrate that this extended notion is closed for both subject-reduction and subject-expansion. 

The intersection type assignment presented in this section is an extension of the basic implicative system for classical logic, incorporating intersection and union types and the type constant t. Future research directions for this extended system, such as termination, semantics, and approximation, should be further aligned with existing systems referenced in previous work. These areas of research will benefit from building upon the results of related studies.
