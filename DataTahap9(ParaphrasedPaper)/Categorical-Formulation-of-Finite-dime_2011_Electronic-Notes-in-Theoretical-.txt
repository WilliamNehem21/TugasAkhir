The findings of this study are anticipated to have significant implications for information theory. C*-algebraic methods are commonly employed to investigate the properties of quantum information, as exemplified by the cbh theorem. The approach to describing C*-algebras presented in this paper offers a novel and more abstract perspective on this subject.

Moreover, these results imply a new, more abstract approach to exploring the practical applications of C*-algebras. While not explicitly discussed in this paper, the most immediate application pertains to the examination of unitary topological quantum field theories. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the special unitary Frobenius monoids addressed in this study have previously been demonstrated to produce conformal field theories. Consequently, the findings of this study suggest that such theories should be viewed as generalized C*-algebras.

The monoidâ€™s mapping into the ring of operators on V retains the property of involution, as it transforms one involution into another. As demonstrated by Lemmas 3.19 and 3.20, we will observe that the mapping is injective and preserves the multiplication and unit of (V, m, u), thus constituting a comprehensive involution-preserving monoid embedding.

Proof. According to Lemma 3.19, the embedding must be a monoid morphism. Notably, it is unnecessary to specify whether the left or right involution of end(a) is being used, as both are the identity in accordance with Lemma 3.18. It is essential to establish that this embedding satisfies the following properties.

Proof. Initially, it is essential to emphasize that the norm specified in Property 1 is not directly associated with the inner products mentioned in Properties 2 or 3, as is typically the case where a norm can be derived from an inner product, and sometimes vice versa. In practice, the norm of a C*-algebra generally does not meet the parallelogram identity, and consequently, cannot directly originate from any inner product.
