Based on our findings, we can conclude that a q-backbone coloring using 2q + 2 colors can be achieved in linear time. We are uncertain whether our bound is optimal when the graph is triangle-free. However, it is clearly optimal when the graph is not triangle-free, as a k4 with k1,3 as backbone suffices. Hence, we pose the question of whether our bound is tight in the case of a triangle-free graph.

Moving on to the coloring of graph g, we demonstrate that it forms a circular backbone coloring. To establish this, we show that given a central vertex v, all of its neighbors in the backbone are assigned an appropriate color. Initially, it is observed that v is assigned color 1, q+3, or q+2. In the first scenario, the allowable colors for its neighbors in f are q+1 or q+2. In the second scenario, all of its neighbors in f are colored with colors 1 or 2. Finally, in the last scenario, all of its neighbors in f are colored with colors 1 or 2q+2. Consequently, cj represents a circular q-backbone coloring of (g, f).
