The basis of restriction categories lies in idempotents, and it can be advantageous when all restriction idempotents split. This occurrence indicates that the restriction structure is split, and the resulting category, denoted as split(c), is a restriction category when c is. Additionally, total morphisms and partial isomorphisms, which are closed under composition and encompass all identities, constitute important subcategories total(c) and inv(c) of any restriction category c. The category inv(c) is not only a restriction category but also an inverse category, serving as the cofree such category. Furthermore, decisions on an object form a local model of kw, and it is necessary to demonstrate that decision transformers retain entailment and propositional connectives, as shown in a subsequent lemma.

In addition, the paper discusses par(c, m) as a classified restriction category under the +1 monad and demonstrates that par(c, m) has restriction coproducts, given that c has coproducts and par(c, m) is classified. Moreover, it is established that 0 is a restriction zero in ion, employing partial inverses to decisions rather than the codiagonal. The paper also investigates the utilization of decisions as predicates in c and inv(c), where dec(x) remains a de Morgan quasilattice in inv(c), despite differences in the homomorphisms between fibres.

The inspiration for employing decisions as predicates is drawn from the study of the categorical semantics of reversible flowchart languages, indicating the practical relevance of this approach.
