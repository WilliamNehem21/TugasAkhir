NAT traversal technology is a crucial element for enabling real-time video streaming between two endpoints. The port predictive algorithm used in NAT mapping rules plays a central role in facilitating NAT traversal. However, many existing port predictive algorithms in NAT traversal methods are overly simplistic or lack clarity. The behavior of NAT port mapping in real network environments is intricate and notoriously challenging to anticipate accurately. This research investigates the behavior of NAT port mapping and proposes a mathematical model aimed at improving the predictability of port assignments in NAT, thereby boosting the success rate of NAT traversal.
