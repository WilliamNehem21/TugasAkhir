The latest wireless communication technologies such as fifth-generation (5G) and beyond, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and cognitive radio networks offer high speed, capacity, low latency, and reliability. Despite being an established technology, wireless sensor networks (WSN) are evolving with modern models and prototypes to meet the demands of these next-generation wireless communication technologies. These new WSN designs, known as next-generation wireless sensor networks (XWSN), have practical applications in smart cities, device-to-device (D2D) communications, e-health, e-agriculture, e-transportation, and e-education.

Network failures in XWSN may result from limitations in sensor node size, quality, durability, storage capacity, processing capability, or from operational complexity, terrain difficulties, or unforeseen factors. These failures can hinder the realization of high reliability in XWSN. Therefore, incorporating appropriate network restoration models is essential to mitigate the effects of network failures in XWSN and other next-generation wireless communication applications.

Recent research has explored the application of XWSN in cognitive radio sensor networks and developed network restoration solutions for emerging next-generation wireless networks. Notably, the use of p-cycles for network restoration in XWSN and other emerging networks has shown significant advantages, including near-ring-based restoration speeds, high restoration capacities, and efficient use of network capacity.

In practical XWSN setups for D2D communications, communication between sensors can be single-hop or multi-hop, and the use of a distributed architecture provides cost-effectiveness, ease of network recovery from failure, and better network scalability. The selection of p-cycles for network restoration, load redistribution, and the use of individual p-cycles for double link failure restoration have all been explored to improve the restoration capacity and network performance.

Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the restoration model and improvement concepts, using a test network of 100 sensors and 250 links in a wide geographical area. The study evaluates the normalised average nodal degree, average path length, and total capacity cost to assess the effectiveness of the p-cycle-based restoration model and the enhancement of restoration solutions.

Overall, the incorporation of p-cycle selectivity, load redistribution, and individual p-cycles for double link failure restoration has shown promise in enhancing the restoration capacity and performance of XWSN for D2D communications. These improvements are vital for ensuring the reliability and resilience of next-generation wireless communication applications.
