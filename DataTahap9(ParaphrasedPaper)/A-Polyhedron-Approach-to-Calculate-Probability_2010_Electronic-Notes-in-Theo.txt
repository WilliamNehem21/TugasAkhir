The primary basis for conducting statistical usage testing of hardware/software systems involves utilizing a Markov chain usage model, which represents the anticipated system usage through a usage profile with relevant probability values linked to state transitions. This paper introduces a constraint-based polyhedron approach to compute the probability distribution for the Markov Chain Usage Model (MCUM) from a given set of usage constraints. A comparison with the maximum entropy technique demonstrates that our polyhedron approach produces results that align more closely with the intended constraint semantics. By employing the polyhedron method, customer profiles can be calculated to better reflect the intended system usage of different customers or customer types. To showcase the applicability of our approach, workflow testing of a complex Radiology Information System/Picture Archiving and Communication System (RIS/PACS) in the medical domain was carried out, yielding promising results.

Given the impracticality of conducting exhaustive testing of real systems, a suitable set of test cases is derived to achieve a specified test objective. Markovian statistics play a crucial role at this juncture.

After identifying all structural components (i.e., states and arcs) of the MCUM, it is essential to obtain appropriate transition probabilities. Ideally, the exact probability distribution of the outgoing arcs of each state in the MCUM is known and fixed. However, this is often not the case, particularly in the context of testing very large and complex RIS/PACS systems, where system usage is influenced by diverse factors. Informed probability generation involves collecting field data, which is then mapped to a usage profile. This method represents the most accurate means of gathering information about system usage, and may involve direct logging of user interactions, screen recording, or direct mapping to the model structure.

Given that customer experts may not necessarily possess statistical and MCUM theory expertise, the process of information acquisition needs to be as informal as possible, with experts describing their knowledge in terms of constraints. Instead of assigning fixed numbers to the MCUM transition probabilities, constraints are posited, which can be automatically transformed to fixed probabilities using algebraic techniques.

When considering certain constraints over others, there exists an infinite set of possible solutions. This aligns with the notion that entropy is a measure of uncertainty and ensures that the information content is limited exclusively by the defined constraints. The basic idea is that, without any constraints, the solution space for the sought probability distribution of a state with k outgoing arcs would be rk. However, the solution space is restricted by the structural constraints and any usage constraints that are stated.
