The requirement that the balance must be greater than or equal to the limit is necessary in order to satisfy the operation specification. From the perspective of the contract view, no transition system should be a model of this operation specification. However, by strengthening the precondition of the withdraw operation to balance being greater than or equal to the limit, and balance minus a being greater than or equal to the limit, the operation specification can be satisfiable. 

We begin by defining a specific type of labeled transitions with output, which serves as the general semantic domain for the semantics of OCL operation specifications. We then define the sets of states where a given precondition or postcondition is satisfied. Using these tools, we establish the models of an operation specification and the concept of satisfiability of an operation specification. The models of an operation specification permit the precondition to be weakened and the postcondition to be strengthened. However, we demonstrate that a canonical model can be chosen as the semantics of a satisfiable operation specification, effectively reflecting the contract view. Finally, we define the potential implementations of a satisfiable operation specification.

In the context of OCL expressions, the expression 'p' may only contain the free variables self and x1,..., xn, while the expression 'q' may only contain the free variables self, result, and x1,..., xn. The reserved variable 'result' is utilized for referencing the result value of a method call.

Operations may not only be specified by a single OCL operation specification, but by multiple operation specifications. The contract view can be expanded to encompass sets of operation specifications for a single operation, rationale being that as each individual operation specification constitutes a contract, the client may opt to fulfill the precondition of a particular operation specification within the set to meet their obligations, and expect the postcondition of the selected contract. In contrast, the supplier is bound by all contracts simultaneously, such that when the operation is called in a state within the precondition domain of a certain contract, they are obligated to establish all postconditions of the contracts whose preconditions are satisfied by the state. Inheritance of operations represents a special case of sets of operation specifications, especially when both the superclass and the subclass define an operation specification for an operation. In such instances, the operation specification of the superclass yields a contract for the operation in the subclass, as all instances of the subclass are also instances of the superclass.

In our explication of the semantics of OCL operation specifications, we have endeavored to be precise in articulating the essential features and peculiarities of OCL. Nevertheless, while the definitions differentiate between methods with and without result, constructors, and queries, and acknowledge queries as an integral part of OCL, we have not encompassed all the different types of parameters, such as in-out parameters, and have also overlooked feature overloading. Despite these oversights, integration into a formal proof environment like Holocl may be of interest. Furthermore, from a modeling perspective, we have not addressed the proof obligations that arise from operation specifications. Addressing these omissions could be an area for future work.
