It is noteworthy that the findings presented in this study do not have a counterpart in the context of finite scenarios. Specifically, the assertion introduced here is still a matter of conjecture in finite scenarios, as referenced in Devos, Johnson, and Seymour, despite being a less stringent version of proposition 4.8 in the context of infinite scenarios (i.e., when a and b are infinite).

The cardinality is either odd or even. A cut, which is minimal in terms of inclusion and non-empty, is referred to as a bond. It is important to note that a cut [a, a]_g of a connected graph g is considered a bond if and only if both a and a are connected.
