The use of inspection techniques allows for the early detection of errors in software development, potentially saving time and effort that would otherwise be spent on testing. To facilitate this process, tool support is recommended, particularly a tool that can automatically and consistently analyze software to maintain a high level of quality. My aim is to automatically identify errors in software designs, thereby avoiding the creation of program structures that are difficult to extend.

The specific application area of a program should be considered when identifying design flaws. For example, a mathematical program may allow for longer methods compared to a program that implements an event-driven user interface. My approach is based on a mental model of design flaws, which provides guidance on recognizing and addressing these flaws. This model is further developed into a set of object-oriented metrics that characterize each design flaw, although initially these metrics are hypothetical.

In his arguments, Fowler suggests that programs with very short methods tend to have a longer lifespan. He also emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate method names, and recommends splitting methods based on the presence of comments. Similarly, Fowler advocates for decomposing classes with many instance variables and removing redundancies by extracting reusable methods. Additionally, Fowler suggests considering the usage of a class to determine if decomposition is appropriate.

When designing a learning method, it is important to define the task the program should fulfill, model the experience the program should draw from, and establish a performance measure to assess the system's improvement over time.

Classification using decision trees involves constructing a tree based on a set of criteria or attributes, using a top-down approach to recursively select attributes that maximize information gain. Once constructed, the decision tree can be used to classify instances and identify design flaws in program locations.

During the detection phase, the user selects parts of the system to be analyzed, and decision trees are applied to these program locations. Program locations identified as tainted by design flaws are presented to the user for verification. The user can accept or reject these suggestions, with the option to add verified instances to the training set.

In the future, it will be important to explore alternative learning techniques such as Bayesian learning for improved detection accuracy. However, decision trees offer the advantage of manual inspection, allowing for explanation and model reflection, which is not feasible with black box methods.

The proposed method involves an IYC plug-in that integrates with the user interface to facilitate the search for design flaws. It presents potential design flaws within a dedicated view, enhancing the user's ability to identify and address these issues.

The proposed approach leverages program abstraction models to analyze specific parts of a program, reducing memory and time consumption compared to analyzing complete programs. This rapid analysis focuses only on the parts of the program that the user is interested in.

In summary, I have introduced a method for detecting design flaws in object-oriented software that adapts to specific usage scenarios. This approach combines object-oriented metrics with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive and learning-oriented approach. An initial case study based on a prototype implementation has been conducted, and further empirical studies are needed for conclusive results. The prototype tool will be improved and made publicly available, with an online component for collecting models and decision trees from a diverse user base to further enhance the detection of design flaws.
