The findings in this paper pertain to convex polytopes as tiles, which are sets that constitute the convex hull of a finite set of points. It can be inferred that the results are applicable to any collection of compact tiles, provided that there exists a homeomorphism of the n-dimensional space that maps each tile to a convex polytope.

Throughout the paper, a tile is defined as a convex polytope in n-dimensional space. Let p be a set of tiles. The union of all the elements in p is denoted by u(p). It is important to note that the tiles may overlap and may not cover the entire n-dimensional space. However, any tessellation of the space by convex polytopes serves as an example of a set p of tiles.

In the context of this paper, a set is considered contractible if it shares the same homotopy type as a one-point set. Therefore, a contractible set is both nonempty and connected. A contractible set in the plane does not possess any holes, while a contractible set in 3-space is devoid of holes, tunnels, and cavities. For a polyhedron in either the plane or 3-space, these necessary conditions are also sufficient for the polyhedron to be contractible. The paper notes that a polyhedron is contractible if and only if it is nonempty, connected, has no holes, and in the case of 3D, has no cavities. The following key facts about contractible sets are relevant to this paper.

It is worth mentioning that since every subcollection of an sn (simple-noncutting) collection of tiles is also sn, Theorem 4.1 implies the converse of Theorem 4.2: if p' is any subcollection of the sn collection p, then np'(p) is contractible for each p in p'.

The paper presents extensions of the fundamental findings of previous works to sn collections of tiles in n dimensions. However, the complexity of computing the topological changes when a non-simple tile is deleted grows rapidly with n even in standard hypercubic tessellations. Despite this, it may be valuable to investigate the computational aspects of determining whether a tile is simple and the broader problem of identifying the local topological changes that occur when a tile is deleted in low-dimensional hypercubic tessellations (e.g., 4D or 5D). These tessellations are utilized in temporal image analysis, and the researchers are currently engaged in exploring this problem in 4D.
