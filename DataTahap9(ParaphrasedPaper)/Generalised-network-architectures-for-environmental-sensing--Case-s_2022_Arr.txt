The Cranfield Urban Observatory is a project that leverages aspects of the Real-Time Technology Centre (RTTC) and aims to provide users with interfaces for monitoring, characterizing, and comparing various environmental and infrastructure systems and behaviors, such as water distribution and power grids. Additionally, the project encompasses a data and analytics facility for national infrastructure, which is a cloud-based high-performance computing cluster designed to receive, store, and present data to advanced analytical and visualization tools.

A wide range of low-cost environmental and physical parameter sensing technologies are now available due to the rapid advancements in accessible electronics, computing environments, and Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures. These sensors can capture various parameters, including physical, chemical, biological, and electrical properties, and the data gathered can provide insights into the environment or specific infrastructure systems. The widespread availability of low-cost wireless communications hardware and software, such as GPRS and global navigation satellite systems, has enabled large-scale global telemetering of geo-temporally referenced data. This, coupled with advancements in encryption and cloud capabilities, has created new opportunities for widespread information transfer.

The paper discusses a generalized network architecture framework for environmental sensing within the context of digital-enabled environmental analytics control. It explores various aspects of network design, operation, and the data pipeline and presents selected case studies and considerations related to data ownership and legacy. It also addresses the challenges associated with data transfer, statutory responsibilities, and international data transfer. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of incorporating plans for data legacy into network design and the need for maintaining appropriate levels of metadata for data discovery and accessibility.

The Cranfield University Urban Observatory, currently in development, aims to enable users to monitor, characterize, and compare diverse environmental and infrastructure systems. It represents a unique opportunity to capture real or near-real-time data from a complex city system, allowing for simulation and testing of various management decisions and scenarios. The observatory project team identified data sharing and collaboration with other urban observatories as crucial to enabling research and generating knowledge. Additionally, the observatory is integrated into the wider Cranfield Living Laboratory initiative, contributing to research, teaching, and decision-making related to urban design and infrastructure development challenges.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the technical, operational, and governance aspects of environmental sensing networks and highlights the potential for leveraging data to address infrastructure modeling challenges and drive improved decision-making and engagement with stakeholders.
