Vincristine is utilized in the treatment of various types of cancers, but its use is limited due to unwanted side effects. In order to address these side effects using a targeted drug delivery approach, we produced vincristine-loaded nanoparticles conjugated with folic acid-chitosan through an ionic gelation method. The nanoparticles underwent characterization using dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DLS indicated the presence of small nanoparticles (<200 nm), while FTIR confirmed the presence of various functional groups associated with the synthesized nanoparticles. SEM revealed spherical nanoparticles with a smooth surface, and TEM confirmed the loading of vincristine in the folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles. The anticancer activity of the vincristine-loaded nanoparticles was evaluated using the MTT assay on NCI-H460 cells, followed by assessment of reactive oxygen species levels, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and apoptotic morphological changes, which confirmed the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were also assessed for their non-toxicity using an erythrocyte aggregation assay. Therefore, these nanoparticles have the potential to be used for treating NCI-H460 cells.

The synthesis of the vincristine-loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles involved dissolving 45 mg of chitosan in 15 ml of acetate buffer and subsequently adding 200 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester of folic acid in DMSO to the chitosan solution. The resulting nanoparticles were categorized into different formulations based on their vincristine content. The nanoparticles were then separated from the solution for further characterization through centrifugation.

In terms of the toxic impact on erythrocytes, the 4:25 formulation, which exhibited the highest encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity, was selected for the assay. The formation of a dark pale yellow colored dicyclohexylurea confirmed the synthesis of the N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester of folic acid. Additionally, the formation of the folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles was attributed to the ionic interaction between the folic acid-chitosan conjugate and sodium tripolyphosphate. The release pattern of vincristine from the nanoparticles indicated slow and sustained release, similar to previous findings on other drug-loaded nanoparticles.

Further experiments confirmed the uptake of the nanoparticles by the NCI-H460 cells and their action on DNA. The apoptotic morphological changes seen in the cells following treatment with the vincristine-loaded nanoparticles indicated their effectiveness in inducing apoptosis. These results were consistent with findings from other studies on drug-loaded nanoparticles' impact on cancer cells. Overall, the prepared nanoparticles exhibit promise for advancing the treatment of cancer.

It seems that the paper describes the preparation and characterization of vincristine-loaded folic acid-chitosan conjugated nanoparticles, their efficacy in treating NCI-H460 cells, and their non-toxicity to erythrocytes. The study also compares the nanoparticles' characteristics with those reported in previous research.
