This academic paper introduces a novel approach to optimize harvest planning by simultaneously assigning crops to fields and determining the best routes for vehicles, taking into account various constraints. Prior to this, the literature has not addressed the strategic assignment of crops to fields and vehicle routing within a single framework, despite the significant impact this process has on the entire agricultural production cycle. The paper presents a two-layered framework, with the first layer involving the assignment of crops to fields at the beginning of the work-cycle, and the second layer focusing on coordinating the harvest at the end of the work-cycle.

The paper's contribution lies in a new method that can aid farm managers in planning crop assignments and determining optimized sequences for servicing fields of the same crop during harvest. The paper formulates eight different integer programs (IPs) to address different problem scenarios. The following sections of the paper discuss the problem formulation and notation, derive algorithms, consider extensions, present numerical examples, and conclude with a discussion of the findings.

The main problem considered in the paper involves the assignment of crops to fields, taking into account a path network, multiple depots, and the presence of multiple harvesters. The paper assumes a fixed number of harvesters for each crop and emphasizes the need to plan routes for each crop, referred to as crop-tours, similar to the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) framework. The paper outlines assumptions and cost coefficients for practical considerations, and specifies that eight customized IPs are derived to address the problem.

The paper discusses strategies for optimal working sequences and cost-minimizing routes for crop-tours. It emphasizes the importance of minimizing non-harvesting time and considers different problem setups relevant to harvest planning. The paper highlights the need for efficient solution methods and suggests the development of optimization techniques to solve the proposed IP problems within a reasonable timeframe, especially for large problem sizes.
