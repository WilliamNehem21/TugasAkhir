The concept of the # component model has been suggested to leverage a component-based approach for the development of high-performance computing applications aimed at distributed architectures. This component model, for general purpose parallel programming, introduces parameterized and recursive abstract component types, enabling skeletal programming.

The current trend in parallelism handling within component infrastructures has focused on encapsulating parallel synchronization inside components, potentially with minimal coordination level extensions. However, this approach does not fully treat parallelism as a coordination level concern, and it is influenced by the common trend of using processes as units of software decomposition. The # component model challenges this trend by proposing an alternative for component-based parallel programming, inspired by the coordination model of Haskell. The model also supports universal and existential bounded quantification, allowing for a generalized use of skeletal programming.

This paper introduces an institutional theory for # - components, providing insights into abstraction mechanisms that could be supported by # compliant programming systems. The paper recommends a basic background in category theory and Petri nets for readers interested in this topic.

The paper also discusses the formalization of the # component model using the theory of institutions, and it concludes by outlining future work on the formalization, specification, and verification of # - components.

The # component model upholds the premise of orthogonality, emphasizing the separation of concerns in parallel programming. This model goes beyond elevating connectors to first-class citizens, by promoting them to components, thereby achieving uniformity of concepts and supporting mechanisms for multi-dimensional separation of concerns.

The proposed institutional theory for # - components has proven valuable, providing insights and introducing abstraction mechanisms from algebraic specification and type theory into # programming systems. Future work will address implementation issues such as type systems for # - components, and extending the institutional framework to deal with specific types of concerns.

In summary, the # component model offers a novel approach for parallel programming, emphasizing modularity and separation of concerns, and providing a foundation for the development of high-performance computing applications targeting distributed architectures.
