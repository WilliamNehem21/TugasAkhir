In section 2, we will provide an informal introduction to mtf and mta, as well as their common core, denoted as mt. Sections 3, 4, and 5 will present three sets of axioms and rules that facilitate the incorporation of propositional calculus in mt, predicate calculus in mt, and zfc in mtf and mta, respectively. Sections 6 and 7 will focus on validating fa in mtf and af a in mta. Finally, in section 8, we will examine an unresolved issue related to an alternative axiomatization of mta.

We still need to verify that m satisfies the qnd. In fact, it is evident from remark 2.10 and definition 2.11.3 that m satisfies a more robust property known as strong quartum non-datur (sqnd), expressed as follows.

For axioms asserting the existence of a specific set (e.g., the empty set axiom or the infinity axiom) with arity 0, each standard set operation corresponds to a term in map theory called a set constructor. A list of the set constructors relevant to the chosen axiomatization can be found in [19, p. 55]. In this paper, we only provide three fundamental examples corresponding to.

Remark 5.2 indicates that mtf-prim implies the validity of the axiom of infinity in mtf. The natural approach to address infinity in mta would be to substitute mtf-prim with a dual axiom mta-coprim. However, as discussed in section 8, we had to resort to mta-infinity.

Here, we briefly discuss the mta-coprim axiom that we initially intended to integrate into mta. Unfortunately, we were unable to establish its consistency in relation to the other axioms of mta. We will state this axiom and explain its significance compared to that of mtf-prim.
