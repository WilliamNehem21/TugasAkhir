Banach's inquiry in 1932 about whether every separable Banach space possesses a basis was finally refuted by Enflo in 1972. Enflo's construction of a Banach space without the approximation property (AP) proved the negative answer to Banach's question. Specifically, a Banach space is said to have AP if the identity operator can be uniformly approximated on every compact subset by finite-rank operators. It is important to note that a Banach space with a basis always has AP.
