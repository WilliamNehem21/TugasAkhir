This study seeks to evaluate the primary energy consumption and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the vehicle cycle of a Chinese passenger car powered by an internal combustion engine, with a focus on the share of coal demand in total primary energy use. The study reveals that the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of a Chinese passenger car are approximately 91.13 GJ and 11.13 tons per vehicle, respectively, with coal contributing around 84.5% to the primary energy consumption and serving as the primary source of CO2 emissions in China. Material production and vehicle assembly processes are identified as the main contributors to energy use and CO2 emissions in the vehicle cycle. Strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of the vehicle cycle include the use of clean energy, vehicle weight reduction without compromising performance, the incorporation of low energy-intensive and low emission-intensive materials in vehicle production, and the advancement of vehicle propulsion systems.

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), global energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to rise from 30.2 billion metric tons in 2008 to 35.2 billion metric tons in 2020, with much of the increase attributed to non-OECD nations heavily reliant on fossil fuels for meeting growing energy demand. Coal is identified as the primary contributor to emissions growth in non-OECD economies, accounting for 54% of the projected increase in total energy-related emissions. The majority of this increase is attributed to China, which accounts for over two-thirds of the total increase in non-OECD Asia's emissions and is one of the top three coal-related emission nations in the world.

The vehicle assembly process is responsible for approximately 29% of the total primary energy consumption in the vehicle cycle, with its emissions contributing about 49.7% of the total CO2 emissions. Notably, the painting process within the assembly line is identified as a key source of emission intensity, with coal representing approximately 84.5% of the energy demand during this stage and being the primary contributor to CO2 emissions.

Material production accounts for 63.2 GJ of energy consumption, which is approximately 70% of the total primary energy consumption, and releases over 50% of the total energy-related CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, the vehicle assembly stage accounts for 29% of the total energy consumption and releases 49.7% of the CO2 emissions in the vehicle cycle. The energy demand and CO2 emissions associated with vehicle distribution and disposal have relatively minor environmental impacts.

Based on the findings presented, there are four key strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of the vehicle cycle. These include vehicle weight reduction while maintaining performance, the use of low-energy and low-emission-intensive materials, the substitution of environmentally friendly energy sources for coal in China, and the development of advanced vehicle propulsion systems.
