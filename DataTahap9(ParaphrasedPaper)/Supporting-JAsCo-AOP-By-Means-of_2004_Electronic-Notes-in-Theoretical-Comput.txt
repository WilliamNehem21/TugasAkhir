This tool demonstration paper introduces a plugin for the eclipse tool platform designed to provide support for jasco, a dynamic aspect-oriented programming (AOP) language focused on component-based software engineering. The jasco eclipse plugin offers a visual integrated development environment that guides developers in programming jasco artifacts using visual wizards. Additionally, the plugin supports running jasco-enabled applications and provides a wide range of debugging and introspection facilities.

Jasco aims to combine the principles of aspect-oriented and component-based software engineering and is designed as an extension of Java, closely adhering to Java syntax and concepts. It introduces two new entities: aspect beans and connectors. An aspect bean is an extended version of a regular Java bean that contains logically related hooks describing crosscutting behavior, while a connector is used to deploy aspect beans within a concrete context and manage the cooperation among applicable aspects.

The technological level of jasco proposes a new component model with built-in traps that enable aspect interaction and a dynamic architecture allowing the addition, change, and removal of aspects at runtime. The jasco eclipse plugin provides wizards for describing jasco aspects and connectors, as well as a joinpoint lookup feature for debugging support. However, the plugin currently supports only basic jasco language and technology features and several extensions to the plugin are being considered.

In summary, the jasco eclipse plugin presents an integrated development environment for jasco AOP, offering support for writing, running, and debugging jasco-enabled applications, with further extensions under consideration to enhance its capabilities.
