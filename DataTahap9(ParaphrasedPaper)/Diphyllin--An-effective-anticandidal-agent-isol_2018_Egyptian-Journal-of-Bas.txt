Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of bioactive compounds extracted from aromatic, toxic, and medicinal plants, either in pure or crude forms, as effective agents in controlling bacterial and fungal pathogens. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the review of literature and the examination of botanicals against candida species. Traditionally, the population of the Indian subcontinent has utilized many plants as medicine to treat various microbial infections.
To prepare the crude extracts, a soxhlet apparatus (Sigma soxhlet mantle, Tamil Nadu, India) was used, with distilled water and ethyl acetate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as the solvents. The crude extracts were concentrated under reduced vacuum and stored for further analysis.
Candida albicans (NCIM 3471), C. tropicalis (NCIM 3118), and C. glabrata (NCIM 3236) were acquired from the National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (NCIM) at the National Chemical Laboratory, Maharashtra, India, and were used for anticandidal analysis. An initial anticandidal test was conducted for the aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts, as well as fractioned compounds, using the well-diffusion method as described by Magaldi et al. Yeast inocula were prepared from 18-hour-old mother cultures and spread on petri dishes containing Sabouraud dextrose agar, with wells made using a sterile cork borer. The extracts and fractioned compounds were dissolved in sterile 4% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and loaded in various concentrations onto the wells.
Approximately 179 mg of dry weight residue was obtained from the identified fractions, with the fractionated compound being crystalline in nature and green in color and soluble in all organic solvents. The RF value of this compound was 0.37 in toluene/ethyl acetate (4:1) in the mobile phase.
In recent years, there has been a notable increase in research focusing on drug development from plant sources to treat infections. Plant material has been used in various biological studies, and among its many properties, its antifungal activity has garnered the most attention. While candida species are typically harmless in healthy humans, they can cause infections in skin and mucosal membranes in immunocompromised situations. In this study, we evaluated the anticandidal activity of C. collinus leaf extracts and their fractions.
