Chromatin accessibility, also known as open chromatin, is a characteristic feature of active cis-regulatory elements that regulate the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Mutations, complex rearrangements, and oncogenic gene fusions of transcription factor genes, as well as disruptions of cis-regulatory elements, can lead to changes in chromatin accessibility. By examining fosl2 cut&run enrichment heatmaps in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells, it was found that there are differences in accessible chromatin sites and enriched DNA-associated protein complexes in different B-ALL subtypes. Furthermore, an analysis of the accessible chromatin landscapes among diverse molecular subtypes of B-ALL revealed subtype-specific chromatin accessibility patterns, which were associated with the regulation of gene expression. The study also highlighted specific transcription factors that play a role in different subtypes of B-ALL, as well as the identification of repressive transcription factors that may contribute to the occlusion of accessible chromatin sites in B-ALL. Overall, the findings underscore the significant changes in chromatin accessibility between B-ALL and precursor B cells, as well as among B-ALL subtypes. The study provides a valuable resource for cancer genomics research and offers insights into the biological and clinical distinctions among B-ALL subtypes. Additionally, the study describes the experimental procedures for gene expression measurements and cell proliferation analyses, as well as the generation of CRISPRi-ready cell populations for further functional studies.
