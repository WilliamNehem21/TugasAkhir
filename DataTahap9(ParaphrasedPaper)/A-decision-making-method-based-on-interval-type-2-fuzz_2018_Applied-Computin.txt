The use of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) was employed to address the challenges of ambulance dispatching and relocation in an urban setting. The application of the ADP model led to a substantial 12.89% reduction in response time in Vienna, Austria, primarily attributed to improvements in dispatching and relocation decisions. Additionally, a study adapted the maximum expected coverage location problem model to determine strategic ambulance placement in Shah Alam, Selangor. In a separate study, the maximal covering location problem was successfully implemented in Johor Bahru, Malaysia using local OpenStreetMap geospatial data and algorithms such as Dijkstra, quick hull, and greedy adding algorithms.

Recently, an examination of ambulance relocation strategies utilized a double standard model to ensure a fair comparison of their performance. These findings underscore the critical role of ambulance location management as an operational research problem, particularly given the multiobjective optimization challenges inherent in emergency management where limited resources must be efficiently deployed.

In terms of decision-making methods, the existing fuzzy sets adaptive weighting (FSAW) approaches predominantly rely on linguistic terms based on type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FS). However, the authors argue for the use of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FS) to capture uncertainties more effectively, as IT2 FS offer greater flexibility for expressing uncertainties compared to T1 FS. Notably, this can be critical for situations where decision-making criteria are inherently uncertain.

While T1 FS-based decision-making methods are generally characterized by crisp outcomes, they are less effective at handling uncertainty compared to IT2 FS. The authors found that through the use of IT2 FS, the results obtained from the IT2-FSAW method were more consistent and better aligned with the intended decision-making preferences, in comparison to the outcomes from the T1 FSAW method.

The strategic placement of ambulances is recognized as a crucial aspect of emergency management, particularly in densely populated areas, with an emphasis on benefiting residents and minimizing loss of life. Ambulance services need to identify suitable and strategic locations to ensure timely arrival at emergency scenes. To assist with this, an interval type-2 fuzzy simple additive weighting method was proposed to evaluate alternative ambulance deployment locations. This method identified one location, denoted as "A1," as the most suitable for ambulance placement, followed by a public clinic, parking lot, petrol station, and highway. It was suggested that further research could involve sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of the proposed method and its application to other real-world scenarios.
