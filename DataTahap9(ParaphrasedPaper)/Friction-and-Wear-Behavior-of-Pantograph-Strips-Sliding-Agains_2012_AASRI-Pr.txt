The electric locomotive acquires electricity power through the interaction between a carbon strip and a copper contact wire in the pantograph-catenary system. The longevity of the pantograph strip and the copper contact line materials is significantly impacted by the wear of the contact pairs [1-4]. To investigate the wear resistance of the contact pair material, a series of experimental tests were conducted on a friction and wear tester under an electric current. Numerous studies were conducted to assess the tribological performance of the carbon strip and copper contact wire under varying sliding speeds and electric currents. This study focuses on investigating the friction and wear behavior of the electrical contact material, and analyzes the surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). A wear mechanism for the contact pair during the electrical sliding process is proposed.

The testing machine used has been previously described in detail [2, 4, 6]. In the tests, the normal force (Fn) is set to 80 or 160 N. Electric current intensities (I) of 0, 10, 30, 50, and 70 A are chosen. The sliding speed (v) is set to 50 km/h, and the duration (t) of each test is 1 hour.

The coefficient of friction is lower with electric current than without electric current. Additionally, the variations of the friction coefficient and the electric current with time follow the same trend during the process of the carbon strip rubbing against the copper. The wear rate of the carbon strip increases with higher electric current. The dominant wear mechanisms in the electrical sliding frictional process include thermal wear, arc erosion, and abrasive wear, along with material transfer.
