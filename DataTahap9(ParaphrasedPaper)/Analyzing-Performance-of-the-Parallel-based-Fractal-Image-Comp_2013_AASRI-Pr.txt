The discussion of image size and resolution has long been central in the field of graphical computing, with increasing relevance in the era of big data. The exchange and storage of large amounts of data over low-bandwidth networks or limited memory devices is a common challenge. This paper explores the application of fractal-based image compression, a time-consuming yet effective lossy method for achieving file reduction. To address the time requirement, a parallel application model was developed to leverage the power of multiprocessor architectures.

The evaluation involved images of varying sizes and two types of machines, one with two cores and another with four. The results highlighted the significant influence of core count on both speedup and efficiency, revealing that a larger number of threads does not necessarily translate to improved performance.

In order to reduce the encoding phase time of the fic method, leveraging parallel programming on multicore processors is a promising strategy. The performance improvement gained from using multicore processors depends on the specific algorithms and their implementation. This paper introduces a threads-based approach for modeling the fic technique as a parallel application and presents a prototype that was evaluated with different-sized images and multiprocessing machines, including both dual and quad-core systems.
