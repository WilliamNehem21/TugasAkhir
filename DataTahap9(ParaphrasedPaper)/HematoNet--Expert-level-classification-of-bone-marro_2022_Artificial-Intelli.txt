The dataset used in this research, collected by Matek et al., comprises 171,375 images from 945 patients diagnosed with various hematological illnesses at MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory. The age of the patients ranged from 18.1 to 92.2 years, with a median age of 69.3 years and a mean age of 65.6 years.

In this investigation, we employed data augmentation to address imbalances in class distribution. Data augmentation is a method for generating additional data from an existing dataset, particularly for images, by applying various transformations such as rotations, translations, zooming, noise insertion, cropping, and flipping.

The use of data augmentation proved beneficial in addressing the uneven distribution of class data, as some classes had as few as 8 images, while others had as many as 29,000. Augmenting the data helped alleviate this issue by increasing the number of images for underrepresented classes, thereby reducing bias toward overrepresented classes.

Our trained model accurately predicted the majority of morphological classifications, and its performance improved as the quantity of training data increased. We evaluated our training method using precision and recall measurements, which are commonly used to assess accuracy.

This database represents the most comprehensive collection available in the literature in terms of the number of patients, diagnoses, and single-cell images. We utilized this dataset to develop and evaluate a novel convolutional and attention network-based model for cytology morphological classification, which surpassed existing CNN models.

The parameters used in our model are as follows: L denotes the number of blocks, and d signifies the number of channels in the hidden dimension. We consistently employed a kernel size of 3 for all conv and mbconv blocks, and each attention head was set to a size of 32 in all transformer blocks. The expansion rate for the inverted bottleneck was f
