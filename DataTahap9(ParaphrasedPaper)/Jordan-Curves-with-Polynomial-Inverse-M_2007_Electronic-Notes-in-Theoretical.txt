The complexity of Julia sets has been the subject of investigation by various researchers, including Chou and Ko, who explored the problem of identifying pathways within a two-dimensional domain and Yu, who collaborated with Ko to study the computation of single-valued analytic branches of logarithmic and square-root functions in the same domain. Furthermore, Yu, Chou, and Ko delved into the computation of the minimum-area circumscribed rectangles and squares of a Jordan curve. These studies utilized turing machines and oracle turing machines as their fundamental model, among others.

In contrast to Theorem 4.2, it is relatively straightforward to confirm that the curve constructed for the upper lower bound for the membership problem, as outlined in Theorem 7.3 of Chou and Ko's work, actually possesses a polynomial inverse modulus. Consequently, we can assert stronger results regarding the membership problem than those advocated by Chou and Ko.

In our earlier discussions, we examined the concept of polynomial inverse modulus of two-dimensional Jordan curves and presented evidence indicating that this property contributes to reducing the complexity of crucial problems pertaining to two-dimensional domains. These problems include the inverse function problem, the membership problem, the path problem, and the analytic continuation problem. Moreover, we observed that the majority of the Jordan curves constructed in earlier studies of two-dimensional domains, which were utilized to establish lower bound results for these problems, exhibit the property of polynomial inverse modulus of continuity. This encompasses the constructions for the lower bounds of the membership problem and the path problem, as well as the fractals created to demonstrate the nonrecursiveness of the area problem (refer to Ko and Ko and Weihrauch for further details).
