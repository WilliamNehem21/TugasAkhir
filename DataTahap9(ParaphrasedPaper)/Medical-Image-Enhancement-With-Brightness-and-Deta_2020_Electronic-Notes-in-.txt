This academic paper discusses the importance of high-quality medical imaging for efficient diagnosis and proposes an algorithm for enhancing contrast, detail and brightness preservation in medical images. The proposed method is based on the multiscale top-hat transform by geodesic reconstruction, aiming to improve image quality by preserving features and reducing distortion. The paper evaluates the algorithm's performance using 100 medical images from a public database, demonstrating improvements in contrast and preservation of brightness. The method is compared with other existing techniques, showing its advantages in enhancing contrast and preserving image quality. The results indicate that the proposed method performs well in terms of contrast enhancement, preservation of brightness, and reduction of image distortion.
