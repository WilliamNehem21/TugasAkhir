We have recommended the use of string multiset rewriting (smsr) as a middle ground for simulating biomolecular systems. This would involve translating higher-level formal descriptions of biological systems into smsr, and simulating smsr descriptions by modifying an existing simulator. In this study, we showcased the translation of one such formalism, cls+, into smsr, and established the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the translation.

Our proposal is that smsr can serve as an intermediate language for simulation purposes. It is relatively straightforward to develop simulators for smsr, such as by expanding the capabilities of the gbs simulator. Moreover, the utilization of the maximal matching operator can aid in translating higher-level languages, particularly those built on term rewriting. Our approach involves viewing a term as a tree, which in turn can be seen as a collection of strings representing all paths from the root to the leaves. Consequently, replacing a subtree is equivalent to replacing a set of strings that share a common prefix. As an example, we demonstrate the translation of cls+[11,2], a formalism based on term rewriting, into smsr, thereby verifying the correctness and completeness of the translation.

We present the string multiset rewriting formalism in this section, which is rooted in term rewriting. Initially, we lay out the syntax of terms and establish a structural congruence relation for them. Subsequently, we introduce rewrite rules and define an operational semantics that elucidates the evolution of terms through the application of rewrite rules.

Patterns play a pivotal role in defining the rewrite rules of smsr. In essence, a rewrite rule comprises a pair of patterns, with the first element describing the term that is altered when the rule is applied, and the second element detailing the changes to the term post-application. The inclusion of variables in patterns enables a rewrite rule to be applicable to any term reached by substituting these variables with appropriate elements or strings. Additionally, the maximal matching operator {|sp|} signifies a multiset of strings that all share the same instantiation of the string pattern sp.
