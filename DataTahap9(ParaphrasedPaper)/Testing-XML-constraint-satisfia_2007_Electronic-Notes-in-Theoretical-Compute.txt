Schemas and integrity constraints have a significant impact on data manipulation, reasoning, and optimization, particularly in the context of semistructured data and XML documents. It is widely acknowledged that the ability to model schemas, constraints, and queries within the same formalism, such as logic, is crucial for addressing issues like subtyping, constraint implication, query correctness, and satisfiability.

The modal logic approach to modeling semistructured data is motivated by the fact that semistructured data and XML documents are commonly perceived as edge-labeled graphs, also known as Kripke models. This approach has been explored in various ways to address different issues, including schemas subsumption, path constraints, query languages, and XPath queries.

A significant contribution has been made by Simeon and Fan, who proposed an extension of DTD to capture classical relational and object-oriented referential constraints, focusing on key constraints and foreign-key constraints. These constraints can be used to enforce references, and their relationship to the XML approach has been noted. Negative results regarding decidability for key and foreign-key constraints have been demonstrated.

Furthermore, the introduction of a notion of XML schema in the literature provides a simple and well-founded understanding of reference typing, elevating references to a first-class status. This notion of schema is more general than the previously introduced normalized ref-schema, and a method for translating a general schema into a normalized one has been demonstrated. This allows for the testing of constraint satisfiability in the presence of schemas to be focused on normalized ref-schema without loss of generality.
