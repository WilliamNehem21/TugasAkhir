In graph theory, structures with multiple sets of edges are referred to as multi-graphs, while a product of two graphs is known as a bigraph due to its two sets of edges. However, in the context of modal logics and Kripke semantics, these structures are commonly referred to simply as labeled graphs, thus losing the distinguishing notational difference.

This paper presents a new property called h-v intransitivity, which, along with existing properties, forms a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite and connected graph to be classified as a product. The necessity of these properties is straightforwardly proven, without assuming the graph to be finite or connected. Conversely, the sufficiency is proven in two steps: first, it is shown that if a finite and connected graph satisfies the five stated properties, then its horizontal and vertical components must adhere to a particular isomorphism. Following this, it is demonstrated that if a finite and connected graph satisfies h-v intransitivity and its components meet this specific isomorphism, then the graph can be identified as a product.

Graph products and multi-graphs are natural extensions of standard Kripke semantics to multi-dimensional modal logics, with applications in expressing properties of distributed systems, among other domains. The paper is organized into sections that introduce the concept of graph products, graph decompositions, and the non-modally definable nature of h-v intransitivity.

This work also addresses the problem of graph decomposition, which involves determining whether a given graph can be decomposed into a product of two non-trivial graphs, and examines the expressive power of hybrid languages in defining h-v intransitivity. The paper concludes with discussions on the limitations of basic modal languages in expressing certain graph properties and the potential for hybrid languages to address these limitations.
