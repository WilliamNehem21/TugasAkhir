Scientists in South Africa have conducted extensive geochemical surveys that began in the early 2000s and have now begun to expand using modern methods that better cover trace elements, particularly those related to energy transition and battery metals (Council for Geosciences, 2022). The resulting data from these programs will be used to create digital maps, assess potential mineralization, and make informed decisions about land use (GEM-GEONorth, 2022). The choice of sample media for these surveys depends on the natural landscape of the region and the capabilities of the surveyor, with different types such as bulk rock, lake sediment, glacial till, and water having their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of collection and processing methodology. The resulting data, including legacy data, is produced using rigorous and standardized methods, facilitating its use, including data fusion.

This study utilizes lake sediment data from the GEM program, which has been generated for decades in Canada to explore surficial geology due to its comprehensive spatial coverage. Re-analyses have recently produced two fully modernized datasets in 2016 and 2021 for specific regions in Labrador and Saskatchewan. As part of a re-analysis campaign in the 1990s, the Labrador area was also re-analyzed. The GEM program aims to re-analyze its collection of lake sediment samples to modernize its surficial geochemical data, although it currently does not utilize predictive prioritization in its program execution. Machine learning algorithms can be employed to predict elemental concentrations and model relationships between elements for matching samples in old and new geochemical datasets.

The use of legacy and modern data, along with standardized methodologies, enables the generation of probable and reliable modern data, extracting additional value from otherwise outdated data. This approach can support both upstream data generation and downstream data usage in exploration geochemistry and is crucial for timely resource discoveries, particularly for critical raw materials. Although knowledge derived from predicted data may not be as accurate or selective as that from actual data, its accuracy is likely to improve as more modern data becomes available for training. In the context of digital societies, advanced knowledge available now may be more valuable than more accurate knowledge that is available later.
