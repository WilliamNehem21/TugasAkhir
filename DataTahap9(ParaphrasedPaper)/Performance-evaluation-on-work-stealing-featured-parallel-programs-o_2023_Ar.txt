The emergence of Intel's multicore products with asymmetric performance capabilities is expected to stimulate the adoption of asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) architectures for a wide range of applications. Understanding the performance behavior of these processors is crucial for effective software development and improved application performance. To facilitate clear communication, this paper refers to the central processing unit (CPU) of the p-core as p-CPU and the CPU of the e-core as e-CPU.

The concept of memory-bounded speedup initially explains how superlinear speedup can occur in scenarios involving large problem sizes on a computer cluster. When a single node experiences slow performance due to memory limitations with a large problem size, adding more nodes can improve the program speed per node. This concept can also account for instances of superlinear speedup in symmetric multicore processors. Investigating whether compute-bounded workloads can exhibit superlinear speedup is an intriguing area for further research.

The normal form heterogeneity model has been introduced as a potential tool for accurately modeling superlinear speedups, but it may not be as effective in representing cases of sublinear speedups, which are expected to arise if the fastest CPU is utilized for serial execution, serving as the baseline.

The existing speedup law does not fully capture the performance behavior of asymmetric multicore processors (AMPs). Specifically, superlinear speedup can occur in AMPs when code originally executed by a slower processor core is subsequently improved by one or more faster processor cores, while sublinear speedup can occur if the serial execution time is obtained from the fastest CPU. This research gap serves as the motivation for the current study.

Despite work-stealing being proposed as a solution to address the issue of unfair workload distribution in dynamic heterogeneous distributed computers, the performance of shared memory work-stealing on AMPs has not been explored. Investigating the performance of work-stealing on AMPs remains an interesting topic for further discussion.

A previous study demonstrated that heterogeneous multicore processors are more efficient than homogeneous multicore processors when handling multithreaded workloads. The authors measured efficiency using the weighted speedup, derived from the total instructions per cycle (IPC) of all running threads divided by the total IPC of the slowest core. However, this study focused on fair work distribution among e-CPUs and p-CPUs in a multithreaded program, emphasizing the need for fairness in workload distribution.

While the existing operating system-level mechanisms ensure fair scheduling for a multi-programmed environment, the user-level mechanism allows multithreaded applications to efficiently utilize multiple CPU/core time and enhance parallelism. However, user-level load-balancing mechanisms, such as work-stealing, are necessary for multithreaded applications on AMPs due to the lack of support for managing user-level threads in the kernel.

The potential efficiency of heterogeneous asymmetric multicore chips, compared to symmetric multicore chips, has been highlighted in previous research. However, further investigation into scheduling and overhead management in asymmetric multicore chips is recommended. The current study presents performance evaluation results that assign threads to the most efficient core CPUs first and enhance execution with the higher performance core.

In the experiments conducted, performance data were collected from an Intel Core i5 1240p processor, which features four p-CPUs and two e-CPU clusters, each containing four cores. The asymmetry in the processor's architecture is instrumental in the evaluation of thread scalability between e-CPUs and p-CPUs.

The findings from the experiments indicate that the work-stealing strategy performs effectively on AMPs and can potentially address asymmetric performance challenges. Contrary to expectations, there is no evidence of performance loss or a decrease in nominal IPC on the p-cores due to asymmetric performance in the Intel Core i5 1240p processor. These results provide valuable insights into the performance behavior of AMPs and highlight the effectiveness of work-stealing strategies in addressing asymmetry.
