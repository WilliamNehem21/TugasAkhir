This paper focuses on the search for a cartesian closed category of quantitative domain categories. The approach involves constructing meet-continuity on l-semilattices inspired by the method of constructing l-frames. The paper also explores the relationship between meet-continuous l-lattices and l-frames, establishing the conditions under which a complete l-lattice is an l-frame. Additionally, the paper investigates the cartesian closedness of the category of meet-continuous l-lattices. The content of the paper is structured into several sections, each discussing specific aspects related to meet-continuity, distributivity, and the categorical properties of l-lattices. The paper also delves into the implications of fuzzy domain theory and highlights the differences and challenges posed by the complicated structure of truth values in the many-valued setting. The discussion emphasizes that the theory of fuzzy domains cannot simply be seen as an extension of its classical counterpart, as the complexity of truth values introduces new challenges and necessitates the exploration of novel properties in future research.
