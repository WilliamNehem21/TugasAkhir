Alex Simpson proposed an approach to deriving monads for computational effects in denotational semantics through observations. This approach involves using a single observation algebra as a computational prototype and generating a computational monad as a free algebra construction based on this prototype. Recent findings have demonstrated the existence of free observationally-induced algebras in the category of continuous maps between topological spaces for arbitrary computational prototypes.

The paper is structured as follows: in section 2, the basic definitions of free observationally-induced algebras are reviewed. Section 3 demonstrates that under appropriate completeness conditions, free observationally-induced algebras exist in cartesian closed categories for arbitrary pre-chosen computational prototypes. Section 4 applies these results to examine a lower powerspace construction in topological domain theory. The paper concludes in section 5.

The identification of free observationally-induced algebras as subobjects of double exponentials is an intriguing outcome. While there are hints of this connection in existing literature, the present work makes a more tangible contribution to the understanding of the relationship between algebraic effects and continuation types. Nevertheless, further investigations are needed to fully assess the benefits of this characterization of observationally-induced algebras. 

The construction of observationally-induced powerspaces as subobjects of double exponentials of Sierpinski space shares similarities with the work of Vickers and Townsend on powerlocales. They demonstrate that both lower and upper powerlocale constructions are derived as subobjects of a double exponential of Sierpinski space, and furthermore, their composition commutes and yields the full double exponential. It is crucial to explore under which conditions free observationally-induced algebra constructions commute and whether it is feasible to obtain full double exponentials with the observationally-induced approach. It should be noted that the category of locales is not cartesian closed, hence it falls outside the scope of the present paper. However, certain exponentials do exist in locales, and there are certainly strong links to the research on free observationally-induced algebras over topological spaces, which warrant further investigation.
