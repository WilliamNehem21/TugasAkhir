Several methodologies have been suggested in the literature to address the power scheduling problem, which can be broadly classified into semi-automatic schedulers and automatic schedulers. Semi-automatic schedulers involve consumers specifying their preferences during scheduling, while automatic schedulers do not require human intervention. This paper focuses on six scheduling approaches with variations in scheduler type, optimization problem, appliance types, and objectives.

The authors of the paper developed an optimization model for household power scheduling to reduce electricity costs and the grid's peak load, integrating incentive and inconvenience concepts. The incentive offers users rewards during peak periods to encourage consumption reduction, while inconvenience aims to minimize the deviation from the optimal appliance schedule.

One limitation of existing approaches is their focus on only one of the three objectives of successful demand-side management (DSM): operational, ecological, and economic. The article discusses the need to consider all three objectives and proposes a clustering algorithm to address this. The authors present a digital ecosystem cooperative model for smart grid management, consisting of an Alliances Builder and a Seller-to-Buyer Matcher.

The Seller-to-Buyer Matcher module is used to establish successful cooperative scheduling in the smart grid, taking into account the preferences of the sellers and buyers. The paper introduces a penalty factor to represent the waiting time flexibility of grid components and considers scenarios of non-cooperative and cooperative scheduling.

The authors propose a Multi-Objective Cooperative Scheduling Framework (MOCSF) to address power generation, storage, and consumption, considering ecological, economic, and operational costs. MOCSF comprises the Preference-Based Compromise Builder and the Multi-Objective Scheduler, which aim to provide efficient compromises between component preferences and minimize three-dimensional costs.

The experimental results demonstrate the potential of MOCSF in reducing the gap with initial component preferences and minimizing costs. The authors also highlight their ongoing work in implementing a privacy-by-design grid control and applying strategy-proof techniques to prevent cheating in desired schedules.

This paraphrased version captures the main points and contributions of the original academic paper while presenting the information in a more generalized and simplified manner.
