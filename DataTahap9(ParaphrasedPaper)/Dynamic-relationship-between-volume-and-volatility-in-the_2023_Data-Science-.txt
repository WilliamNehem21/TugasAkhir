Numerous studies have concentrated on examining the relationship between trading volume and stock market returns, identifying both correlational and causal links (Chen and Song, 2000; Wang and Wu, 2002; Zada, 2021). However, some research has indicated a weak correlation between the two (Karpoff, 1987) and suggested that trading volume does not directly cause changes in returns (Alhussayen, 2022; Lee and Rui, 2002). The mixed distribution theory proposed by Clark (1973) and Tauchen, along with other research, has also investigated whether trading volume can predict volatility by examining their dynamic relationship.

Brooks (1998) explored the potential for lagged trading volume to improve volatility forecasting using GARCH family models and found only marginal improvement in volatility prediction. Similarly, Liu (2007) and Yang (2005) reached similar conclusions, suggesting a lack of strong and robust evidence to explain the connection between trading volume and market fluctuations. On the other hand, Sun et al. (2019) focused on predicting stock volatility using trading volume information in both stock and foreign exchange markets, finding usefulness in forecasting stock volatility but only indirect influence on price in the foreign exchange market. Consequently, despite factors such as market maturity, trading volume continues to hold significant explanatory power for market fluctuations.

The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of econometric models, including the linear VAR and MS-VAR models. Section 3 carries out an empirical analysis of the Chinese stock market using the MS-VAR model, while Section 4 presents a robustness analysis. Finally, Section 5 concludes with potential policy implications.

The Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, as proposed by Sims (1980), is instrumental in dealing with multiple endogenous time series variables by incorporating endogenous variables and lagged values within its model structure. The traditional VAR model, assuming linear relationships between variables, is also known as the linear VAR model.

In practice, relationships between variables can change across different periods due to policy shifts, environmental factors, economic conditions, or external shocks. To expand on the traditional VAR model, Hamilton (1989) introduced the Markov switching regime change model, known as the MS-VAR model, which is adept at revealing hidden stock market states and facilitating the examination of dynamic interplay among stock market characteristics across various regional systems.

In regime 3, the intercept of return is not significant, while those of volatility and trading volume are significantly higher than those in regimes 1 and 2, indicating higher overall volatility in the Chinese stock market during regime 3 compared to the others. This is attributed to investors chasing after high returns, resulting in increased trading volume and market volatility. During the initial phase of a bear market, stock market returns rapidly decline, prompting investors to sell their stock assets quickly, leading to high trading volume and market volatility. Due to the complex and chaotic nature of stock market information during this period, the market return is determined to be zero.

Furthermore, while the influence of trading volume on return and volatility is not substantial, the impact of return and volatility on trading volume is significant, revealing asymmetric dynamic relationships between trading volume, volatility, and return in the Chinese stock market. This challenges the prediction of changes in volatility or return in the Chinese stock market based on fluctuations in trading volume. According to Gebka and Wohar (2013), these asymmetric dynamic relationships may be due to private information and uninformed trading motivations, ultimately resulting in an insignificant impact of trading volume on volatility and return.
