This paper presents a methodology for specifying, verifying, and synthesizing secure systems using an open system analysis approach. The proposed framework enables the modeling of a system with potential intruders and the verification of its overall security by checking whether the system complies with a specified temporal logic formula. Additionally, the framework allows for the automatic synthesis of a control process to enforce the desired secure behavior in the system.

The study builds upon existing research and introduces controller operators, denoted by y d x, which represent the controller program responsible for managing unspecified components in the system. These operators are designed to enforce security automata for ensuring safety properties and non-interference properties under certain assumptions.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the specification framework gn dc, which enables the description of various security properties such as non-interference, agreement, authentication, and non-repudiation. This framework also facilitates the uniform modeling and analysis of dependable systems and dependability properties. The gn dc schema is structured to express and compare a family of security properties.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of process algebra and temporal logic. Section 3 details the approach for specifying and verifying secure systems. Section 4 presents the definition and synthesis of controller programs. Section 5 highlights an approach for dealing with dependability properties. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding remarks.

The verification of an open system, which contains unspecified components, involves ensuring that the system functions correctly and satisfies specific properties. The proposed approach leverages partial model checking to control only the untrusted component of the system, providing an advantage in cases where checking the entire system is impractical or unnecessary. This method allows for the monitoring of only the necessary or untrusted parts of the system.

The gn dc schema employs a verification method based on the most-general intruder concept to avoid universal quantification and focus on a single possible intruder for certain types of relations. However, for properties such as bndc, alternative logic-based approaches outlined in the paper are necessary.

The study demonstrates that dependable systems can be uniformly modeled within the proposed framework, with dependability properties analyzed using the gn dc schema. The separation between the system and its environment provided by gn dc proves to be valuable in this context.
