The advancement of smart home technology is being driven by the integration of wireless remote control, multimedia control, high-speed data transmission, and key technologies for home network compatibility of family controllers to address information transfer needs. Currently, the use of integrated wiring technology in transmission networks limits system application due to high costs. The wireless approach is being explored as a flexible and convenient method to build smart home security monitoring systems, and it has become a prominent area of research.

The development platform for the Zigbee coordinator is based on the ARM920T core S3C2410X microprocessor, serving as the core of the communication program. The coordinator employs the CC2430 wireless transceiver module for short-distance one-to-many communication. The CC2430 solidifies the bottom of the Zigbee protocol stack (PHY layer and MAC layer), and with simple peripheral devices, can form a transceiver module. Long-distance data transmission is achieved using GPRS, with an optional GPRS microprocessor (MC35I) and peripheral circuits.

The power supply circuit, structural model, system clock circuit, system reset circuit, and flash/SDRAM memory interface circuit are essential for the operation of the S3C2410X microprocessor. Additional circuits include the JTAG interface, Ethernet interface, serial port, and wireless transceiver module (CC2430 and its peripherals) to facilitate coordination. The JTAG standard is primarily used for internal chip testing and system simulation and debugging. The standard JTAG interface consists of four simple lines. The coordination and transfer of data between the GPRS devices are managed using the MAX232 and RS232 serial port functions. The wireless transceiver module is primarily used for establishing and initializing Zigbee star networks and for sending and receiving data between multiple Zigbee end devices. 

The system hardware design incorporates an SMS module with integrated SMS protocol and GSM/GPRS module for SMS and MMS functions, controlled via the AT command module and data transfer through the RS232 interface. Furthermore, it includes a 600 KB flash memory space for uploading and sending MMS messages.

The system has the capability to automatically detect outsider invasions, fires, and other indoor anomalies. Its intelligence is evident in the system's software monitoring of environmental states, self-learning, and adaptation to environmental changes. In critical states, it can automatically initiate state tracking and monitoring to accurately determine results from multiple images using background subtraction and interframe difference methods based on motion threshold binding assay. The target detection process involves image preprocessing, quantization function, motion detection, small target motion tracking and detection, and discrimination and processing of abnormal situations.

Combining traditional sensor alarm systems with image monitoring systems for smoke, gas, fire, theft, and home appliances allows for the formation of a new type of smart home system. Users can receive MMS messages via mobile phones or PCs and set remote phone controls to achieve flexible and convenient home security monitoring. The system offers a practical method for intelligent home environment by enabling multiple wireless networked monitoring devices and remote control of home appliances for smart home remote monitoring.
