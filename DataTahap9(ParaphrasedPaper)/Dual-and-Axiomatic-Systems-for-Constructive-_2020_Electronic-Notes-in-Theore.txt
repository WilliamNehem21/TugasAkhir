The significance of modal logic in philosophy, mathematics, and computer science is well-established. Modal logic has found applications in concurrent and distributed computations, necessitating the need for a verification process that now heavily relies on proof assistants. The incorporation of the necessitation rule addresses the controversy surrounding the validity of the deduction theorem, as well as the (mp) rule, which is stated in a multiplicative style to establish a correspondence with usual axiomatic systems. The use of lists as contexts in the deduction theorem introduces challenges for formal verification, necessitating the use of a routine induction on lists to prove the admissibility of a rule.

The system discussed by the authors emphasizes explicit propositional reasoning and an implicit judgment reasoning. They mention that the derivability relation is subject to the inclusion of a true in a possibility, and propose a method involving an explicit rule called (tp) to implement this feature. The system's expressiveness is mechanized by an inductive definition, with the use of rule (tp) being considered mandatory. Furthermore, the authors introduce starting rules that enable inference on any formula within a context, not just the first or last one. They also introduce admissible rules and discuss a transfer process between contexts, allowing for the simplification of proofs by replacing modal reasoning with simpler propositional reasoning in certain cases.

Additionally, the authors present a method for translating natural deduction proofs into axiomatic derivations, aiming to empty the validity context and achieve a context of true assumptions that can be directly managed. This translation is achieved through induction on NS4-derivations.
