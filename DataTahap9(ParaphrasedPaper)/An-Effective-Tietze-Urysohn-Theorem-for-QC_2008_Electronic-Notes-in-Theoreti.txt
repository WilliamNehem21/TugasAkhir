The Tietze-Urysohn theorem asserts that every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subspace of a normal space can be extended to a continuous function on the entire space. In this paper, we present an effective version of this theorem in the Type Two Model of Effectivity (TTE). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of "quasi-normality" for QCB-spaces, which is a slightly weaker form of normality than the traditional definition, and demonstrate that this property still allows for the extension of continuous functions. 

Our work focuses on the category of quasi-normal QCB-spaces, which contains all separable metrisable spaces and forms a Cartesian closed subcategory of QCB. We also address the transitivity property of the subspace operator on topological spaces, emphasizing the differences in behavior between functionally open and functionally closed subsets.

We establish that quasi-normal QCB-spaces exhibit the property that any zero-set of a functionally closed subspace is also a zero-set of the original space, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposition by providing effective versions of the lemmas in Section 4. By effectivizing the proofs of their topological counterparts using Lemma 5.1, we are able to establish the effectivization of Proposition 4.6.
