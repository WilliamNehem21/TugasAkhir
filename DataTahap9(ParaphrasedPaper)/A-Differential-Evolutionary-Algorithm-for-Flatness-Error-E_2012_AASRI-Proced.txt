The paper introduces a differential evolutionary algorithm (DE) for conducting minimum zone evaluation of flatness errors. This heuristic evolutionary algorithm is based on population optimization and is shown to be efficient and robust compared to other methods. The objective function calculation approaches for planar error are developed in accordance with the ISO standard's definition of minimum zone solution. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DE, demonstrating its advantages over conventional evaluation methods in terms of algorithm simplicity and flexibility.

ISO standard Y14.5 specifies that form tolerances on a component should be evaluated with reference to an ideal geometric feature, and recommends the use of the minimum zone concept for form tolerance evaluation. For flatness tolerance, it is defined as the smallest possible value of the normal distance between two parallel planes enclosing all measurement points.

The paper emphasizes that while the least squares method (LSM) is commonly used for geometric error evaluation due to its ease of implementation and computational efficiency, it does not guarantee the minimum zone solution specified in the ISO standard and may lead to overestimation of form tolerances and the rejection of good parts.

In the proposed DE, when the values of certain parameters of a newly generated trial vector exceed their corresponding upper and lower bounds, they are randomly and uniformly reinitialized within the specified range. Subsequently, the objective function values of all trial vectors are evaluated, followed by a selection operation.

The study presents an effective DE for implementing the minimum zone method in flatness error evaluation. It formulates the mathematical model of the minimum zone method's objective function and provides methods for generating the initial population. Comparative analysis with conventional evaluation methods highlights the algorithm's simplicity and flexibility. Practical examples from industrial applications are used to validate the proposed method's ability to efficiently search for optimal solutions and demonstrate its suitability for form error evaluation in coordinate measuring machines (CMMs).
