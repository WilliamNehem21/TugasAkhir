This paper investigates the impulsive Nicholson's blowflies model, focusing on the oscillation and global attractivity. By employing the Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem, the study establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of positive periodic solutions for the system described in equation (1.1). Additionally, the research delves into probing the nonexistence of positive periodic solutions for the same system. The findings of this study build upon and enhance previous works in the field.
