This academic paper explores tissue P systems with non-restricted, symmetric versions of mate and drip operations, demonstrating that such systems are computation complete with a minimal number of two cells when operating on strings. The study also examines scattered context tissue P systems with mate and drip operations, establishing similar computational completeness with no more than four cells being used during any computation. These results extend to the corresponding (mem)brane systems.

The research builds upon prior efforts to combine membrane systems and brane calculi by investigating tissue P systems with mate and drip operations. By considering non-restricted, symmetric variants of these operations, the study leverages the direct correspondence between these systems and those investigated previously. The research focuses on tissue P systems with mate and drip operations working on strings placed on the membranes of the cells, demonstrating their computational completeness with the minimal number of two cells during any computation. Similar computational completeness with a limit of four cells is also established for the variant with scattered contexts. The paper concludes with open questions and additional insights.

In this study, the operations in the model of (mem)brane systems have specific interpretations. The fusion operation (u|a, b|v; x) combines two membranes carrying multisets sua and bvw into one cell with the multiset suxvw. The drip operation (u|c|v; y, z) splits a membrane sucvw into two membranes suy and zwv, with s and w representing arbitrary splits of the remaining objects. These interpretations are applied to the model of tissue P systems to define the mate and drip operations.

Finally, the study explores a scattered context variant of the drip operation, where the cutting site c can be surrounded by a scattered context u and v at the left and right, respectively. This interpretation specifies that applying the drip operation to []s1us2cw1vw2 yields the two cells []s1us2y and []zw1vw2.
