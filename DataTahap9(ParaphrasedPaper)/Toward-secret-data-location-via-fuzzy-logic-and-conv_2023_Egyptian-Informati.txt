Steganography falls within the information security domain and focuses on covertly transmitting secret messages using multimedia content as carriers. It typically involves hiding confidential data within the spatial content of an original digital medium, such as an image, resulting in a transformed image, known as a stego. Recent advancements in steganography have led to the development of content-adaptive schemes for digital images, with a focus on concealing data as a fidelity constraint for source coding practices.

Steganalysis, the process of detecting hidden messages in stego images, can be classified into various categories based on the output of the analysis, including detective steganalysis (image classification), locative steganalysis (locating hidden data), quantitative steganalysis (predicting payload size), and forensic steganalysis (extracting secret bits of the message). Researchers have made significant efforts in binary classification and locative steganalysis, with the use of rich models and ensemble classifiers showing promising results.

Liu et al. (2015) introduced a steganalysis scheme focused on locating concealed information using steganography in the spatial domain. Inspired by their work, Hu et al. employed fuzzy logic to develop a method for locating flipped bits resulting from modern adaptive steganography. This method demonstrated high accuracy in determining the location of modern adaptive steganography but faced challenges in locating non-adaptive steganography due to the random spread of pixel modifications.

A novel steganalysis scheme is proposed in this paper, leveraging image modification maps to create fuzzy correlation maps for locating modified pixels in an image. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental results, showing superiority over existing algorithms in two considered scenarios. However, the performance of the method is dependent on the quality of the modification map generated by the steganographic method, which may limit its effectiveness in practice. The study offers potential solutions for detecting adaptive steganography and improving the accuracy of steganalysis through modification and correlation maps.
