In line with global trends, the demand for renewable energy production in Latvia is on the rise. Currently, the majority of the country's renewable electricity is generated from hydropower plants, with only 1% being derived from the cogeneration of biomass (Energy Strategy 2030, 2011). This biomass is considered a promising resource for increasing Latvia's renewable energy output. The development of cogeneration plants has been strongly encouraged by funding from the EU Structural Funds, Cohesion Fund, and European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, which have been made available by the Latvian government and the EU in recent years and are also anticipated in the coming year (2013).

As of now, there are 23 operational biogas production facilities in Latvia, with a total power capacity of 29.92 MW. The goal is to increase the total production capacity to 90 MW by 2030 through the production of biogas from a variety of biomasses (Energy Strategy 2030, 2011). The expansion of biogas production from agricultural biomass brings forth sustainability considerations, and necessitates risk assessment and management in farms that engage in this form of energy production.

The flow diagram illustrates the variables that influence biogas production. These variables are manipulated within other blocks of the production module, such as the "biomass" block which modulates biomass from maize and biomass from grass. The biogas output is assumed to be a potential variable following a normal distribution, which is determined by an average value and a standard deviation. Similarly, the risk variables are identified by experts and linked to the production block variables that are impacted by these risks.
