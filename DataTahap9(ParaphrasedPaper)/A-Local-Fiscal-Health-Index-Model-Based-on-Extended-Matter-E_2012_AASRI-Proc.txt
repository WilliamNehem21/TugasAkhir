As a result of the financial crisis, there has been increasing focus on the health of local finance operations. In response to this, the essay proposes a model for a local fiscal health index to address issues related to the operation of local fiscal health. This model utilizes the concepts and application mechanism of extenics and matter-element models to construct an extended matter-element evaluation model, which serves as the method for evaluating the local fiscal health index model. Through expert investigation and the entropy weight method, the essay selects indicators that impact the local fiscal health of operations, establishes the local fiscal health index model, and uses the extended matter-element evaluation model to evaluate local finances. The results demonstrate that the local fiscal health index model, based on the extended matter-element evaluation, is a practical model.

Currently, various widely applied methods exist for constructing local fiscal index models, such as expert research methods and data mining. Hana Polackova (1998) established the well-known fiscal risk matrix, known as the Polackova matrix, which introduces the concept of direct debt, contingent debt, dominant debt, and implicit debt, providing an effective tool for analyzing and evaluating local government debt. Lifeng Liu (2001) utilized internal and external factors indicators to evaluate the sustainability and fiscal risk degree of national debt policy. However, these indicators reflect fiscal risk in a partial and scattered manner, exhibiting a certain level of arbitrariness.

The essay introduces a set of evaluation indicators, including tax elasticity (C3), proportion of budget revenue to government revenue (C4), elasticity of financial expenditure to revenue (C5), fiscal expenditure offside ratio (C6), deficit ratio (C7), dependence degree of local fiscal debt (C8), dependence degree of local government fiscal debt (C9), proportion of debt expenditure to debt revenue (C10), debt servicing ratio (C11), debt burden ratio (C12), debt borrowing ratio (C13), and debt repayment ratio (C14). Each indicator is associated with warning, conservative, and safety levels, and they are incorporated into the local fiscal health index model based on the extended matter-element evaluation. The essay calculates the weighting coefficient of indicators at all levels through the entropy method and analyzes the association degree to arrive at the situation of local finance operation. The experiment demonstrates that the local fiscal health index model, constructed using extenics theory, can formalize complex uncertain questions, providing clear concepts, simple calculations, and high-resolution evaluation results.
