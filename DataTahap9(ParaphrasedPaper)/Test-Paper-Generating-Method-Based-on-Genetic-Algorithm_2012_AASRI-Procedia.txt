Continuing education is crucial for individuals who have left school and entered the workforce to enhance their skills and competence. To address the limitations of conventional test paper generation methods, this paper explores the use of genetic algorithms for automated test paper generation. The study delves into the specific design process for generating test papers using genetic algorithms, comparing and defining various parameters. The results demonstrate the efficacy of genetic algorithms for test paper generation.

The test paper generation system serves as an expert system that automatically creates test papers based on specified parameters such as question type and quantity, difficulty level, and scope of knowledge. Traditional test paper generation algorithms often result in local optimal solutions and slow convergence. This paper introduces an efficient intelligent paper generation method based on genetic algorithms, which has demonstrated improved results according to the mathematical model.

Genetic algorithms (GA) are a type of stochastic search process known for their adaptive and robust exploration of a broad search space. First introduced in Bagay's 1967 PhD thesis, genetic algorithms were formally acknowledged and utilized by Professor Holland in 1975. In its basic form, a genetic algorithm operates with a set of n data structures, referred to as individuals, each representing a distinct solution to a specific problem.
