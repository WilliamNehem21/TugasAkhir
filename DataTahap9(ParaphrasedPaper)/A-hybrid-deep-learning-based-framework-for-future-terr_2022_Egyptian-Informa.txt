Terrorism has caused significant humanitarian and economic crises through tragic events that have impacted numerous countries, resulting in thousands of fatalities and substantial damage. In the realm of academic research, several studies in artificial intelligence (AI) have been put forth to counter and anticipate terrorist activities. Predominantly, machine learning (ML) techniques are commonly employed for this purpose. However, as the complexity and volume of data have increased, ML algorithms have struggled to accurately identify and predict terrorist activities. In response to this challenge, we propose a hybrid deep learning (DL) framework, which leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, to capture temporal features from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and forecast future characteristics of terrorist activities. The GTD is a well-established database that records approximately 190,000 terrorist events and incidents worldwide from 1970 to 2020, encompassing various factors such as the type of weapons used, the success of the attack, the nature of the attack, and the category of the terrorist involved. Our approach involves using the CNN to extract complex features from the data, which are subsequently fed into the LSTM model to capture the temporal relationships within the data. Our simulation results demonstrate that the CNN-LSTM model outperforms existing methods, achieving an accuracy of over 96% for bi-classification tasks and 99.2% for multi-classification tasks in predicting terrorist activities. Additionally, our model exhibits a correlation between the occurrence of attacks and the type of weapons used, accurately predicting the types of terrorist attacks and their success rates.

According to the GTD, in 2019 alone, there were 1,411 terrorist bombings, resulting in 6,362 deaths and significant disruption to public life. Despite numerous attempts in modern terrorism literature to predict the future of terrorism, much of these efforts lack a theoretical foundation and are based on ad hoc observations. The lack of formal thinking concerning how social change can engender different forms of terrorism and counterterrorism has led to persistent patterns of terrorism. Therefore, it is essential to address these shortcomings and establish a theoretical basis for understanding the evolution of terrorism and counterterrorism.

The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines related works, highlighting recent advancements in the field and providing a benchmark for evaluating our results. Section 3 presents a detailed description of our proposed hybrid DL framework, including an analysis and explanation of the CNN and DNN algorithms used to forecast various aspects. The findings generated from our research are presented in Section 4, followed by a summary of the results and conclusions in Section 5, along with suggestions for future research directions.

From our literature review, it became evident that no single ML or DL-based approach consistently performs well in predicting terrorist activities for both bi-label and multi-label classification tasks. While certain DL techniques excel in specific types of classification tasks, they struggle to handle highly complex and non-linear data. Given the limitations of existing methods, we propose a hybrid DL-based approach that combines the CNN and LSTM algorithms to predict future terrorist attacks.

To handle the challenges posed by the size and complexity of the data, we applied various preprocessing techniques. These techniques included normalization and dealing with missing data, as well as addressing unbalanced classes through synthetic minority oversampling. We also employed data conversion techniques using libraries such as sklearn to process text data and handle missing values.

We also developed a training algorithm to ensure proper convergence and accuracy of the models. The training process involved setting thresholds for the weights and prediction error rate, and updating the network based on the output features of the LSTM and CNN layers.

The results of our study revealed that the CNN-LSTM model achieved exceptional accuracy for both the bi-classification and multi-classification tasks in predicting future terrorist activities. However, we recognized that the proposed hybrid algorithm may not perform as effectively on more diverse datasets. To improve the model's performance on such datasets, we intend to explore the use of ResNet architectures and transfer learning in our methodology.

In summary, our research proposes a hybrid DL framework that effectively predicts future terrorist activities and offers potential countermeasures to prevent such actions. Additionally, we aim to expand our analysis by incorporating local geographical features of terrorist activities in future studies to gain deeper insights. Moreover, we intend to investigate the use of ResNet architectures and transfer learning to enhance the performance of our model on more diverse datasets.
