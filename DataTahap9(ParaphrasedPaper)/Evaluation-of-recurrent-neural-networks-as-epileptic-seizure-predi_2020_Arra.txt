Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by abnormal brain activity, which manifests as observable neural electrical biosignals. It often results in epileptic seizures, during which individuals experience sensory disturbances, often accompanied by intense pain and involuntary muscle contractions [1,2]. Given the bioelectrical nature of seizures, electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct method for analysis. Through the examination of EEG signals, valuable information can be processed and utilized for monitoring individuals with this condition.

In this study, the approach involves selecting and grouping patients based on the number of epileptic events recorded, followed by maintaining only the common EEG channels across all recordings and adding the data entries containing epileptic events as a target column vector. The data pre-processing steps include reducing the number of channels to less than a quarter of the initially selected channels, extracting five temporal and spectral features, normalizing the data, and encoding the targets. Additionally, two data manipulation techniques—input signals superposition and anticipation of target values—are proposed for training data. Subsequently, two recurrent neural network (RNN) structures are created to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in identifying pre-ictal regions.

The methodology involves setting a peak counting threshold at 80% of the maximum signal amplitude for each EEG channel, obtained through preliminary tests. Following data normalization, the targets are encoded using one-hot encoding to facilitate processing by the artificial neural network (ANN). The study also introduces a technique for anticipating target values during training and observes that this approach yields similar results to other target anticipation techniques without overlapping data.

The results of the study indicate a maximum of 8.33% and 61.3% accuracy in anticipatory seizure onset detection and classification of epileptic events, respectively. The generalization of pre-ictal segments by the ANN was found to be challenging due to the diverse EEG patterns observed among patients. Additionally, the study suggests conducting training and testing with individual patients before generalizing with a combination of patients.

Future research directions include experimenting with the combination of other features, utilizing multivariate discriminant analysis to identify resulting features with greater correlation to pre-ictal periods, and exploring larger databases and deep learning structures. The study also recommends testing similar EEG databases, comparing results, and further analyzing the generalization capabilities of ANNs.
