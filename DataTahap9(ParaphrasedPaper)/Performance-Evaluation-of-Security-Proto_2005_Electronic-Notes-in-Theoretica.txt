We employ a specialized operational semantics to guide us in deducing quantitative metrics for systems that describe cryptographic protocols. The transitions of the system are labeled in a manner that provides additional information. We assign rates to transitions based solely on these labels, with the rates reflecting the distributed architecture running applications and the use of potentially different cryptosystems. We then map the transition systems to Markov chains and assess the performance of systems using standard tools.

In a nutshell, the paper proposes a step towards the development of a unified, formal design methodology to aid users in analyzing the behavior and performance of protocols using a semi-mechanizable procedure. This approach enables performance analysis at the specification stage, preventing potential high extra-costs incurred by delaying until the system is completely implemented. Additionally, it allows for security checking at the same specification stage and can be utilized with any languages endowed with an operational semantics.

The paper demonstrates how protocols specified in Lysa can be compared and measured. This allows the designer to select among different protocol versions based on an evaluation of the trade-off between security guarantees and the cost for each alternative. It also makes it possible to estimate the cost of an attack, if any.

The technical approach involves giving Lysa an enhanced operational semantics and subsequently deriving Markov chains once additional information about the rates of system activities is provided. The performance evaluation is then carried out using standard techniques. The operational semantics, based on enhanced labels, is also utilized to uniformly conduct integrated behavioral and quantitative analysis.

The paper provides an intuitive overview of the framework while leaving the formal development to the appendix. It covers the association of labels with transitions and provides insight into cost functions that enrich transitions with their costs. Additionally, it discusses the extraction of necessary quantitative information to derive continuous time Markov chains.

The presented approach addresses the limitation of merely looking at protocol narrations, which may lead to an inaccurate estimate of costs. Moreover, it demonstrates how protocol versions can differ in efficiency and security guarantees, allowing for informed decision-making in protocol design.
