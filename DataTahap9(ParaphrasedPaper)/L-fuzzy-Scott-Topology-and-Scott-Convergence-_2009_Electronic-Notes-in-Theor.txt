Domain theory, which serves as a formal foundation for programming language semantics, was originally developed by d. scott in the 1960s. Since then, researchers have extensively explored domain models for various programming languages, such as imperative, functional, nondeterministic, and probabilistic languages.

In recent works, researchers have focused on the concept of fuzzy continuous maps between fuzzy dcpos for an arbitrary frame l, where these maps are order-preserving and preserve joins of fuzzy directed subsets. They have also studied a category of fuzzy dcpos that is cartesian closed. Furthermore, they have defined and examined a natural l-topology, known as a fuzzy Scott topology, on fuzzy dcpos.

This paper aims to introduce and analyze an l-fuzzy topology on fuzzy dcpos, which is referred to as an l-fuzzy Scott topology. Additionally, the paper seeks to establish Scott convergence theory for stratified l-filters. Similar to the fuzzy Scott topology, the l-fuzzy Scott topology is a fuzzy counterpart of a crisp topology.
