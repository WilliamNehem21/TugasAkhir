This academic paper introduces a novel internal metric called afs, which was found to be a useful indicator of cluster set quality for persona development. It provides alternative insights into cluster quality compared to existing internal metrics. The hypersona framework, which incorporates afs, was shown to produce a better set of personas for a particular use case compared to a fully automated hyperparameter tuning framework based on a single internal metric. When compared to an existing semi-automated hyperparameter tuning framework called hypercluster, hypersona was found to facilitate a more efficient evaluation and algorithm selection process. Although initially targeted at persona development, the hypersona framework has broader implications for clustering algorithm applications by enabling domain-specific evaluation and proposing a new internal metric. It also demonstrates that clustering algorithms can identify clusters reflecting complex factors with minimal manual intervention.

The paper proceeds with a detailed discussion of related work and motivation behind hypersona in Section 2, followed by an overview of the hypersona framework in Section 3. Section 4 describes a case study and the parameters used, while Section 5 presents the results of the case study. These results are then discussed in terms of the research questions in Section 6, and the paper concludes in Section 7.

The paper also provides an overview of agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) algorithms and the use of internal evaluation metrics to measure cluster quality. It notes that existing methods, such as the hypercluster package, rely on internal metrics and user interpretation to determine the best performing algorithm for clustering.

The study then discusses various approaches to persona development, ranging from manual to almost completely automated methods, and emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate clustering algorithms for automated or semi-automated persona development.

In addition, the paper describes the use of hypersona to develop personas for a specific case study involving survey responses from 519 NQ residents on cyclone preparatory behaviors, psychological characteristics, and demographics.

Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of the proposed internal metric afs and how it provides unique insights into cluster quality, as well as the importance of hyperparameter tuning in clustering algorithms and the challenges in automating this process.

Overall, the paper introduces the hypersona framework as a novel approach for persona development and demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality personas through the use of the afs internal metric and informed clustering algorithm selection.
