Context-aware computing, a significant emerging computing paradigm, involves mobile programs adjusting their behavior based on changes in their environment. However, reusing formal models tailored to mobility hinders the easy specification of context-based interactions. As context-aware applications commonly operate in a mobile environment, adapting a mobility model to account for context-aware interactions enables the reuse of mobility constructs and parts of the proof logic. Our approach involves specializing mobile unity to provide constructs for reasoning about interactions with and manipulation of the context, resulting in a model called context unity, which inherits features of mobile unity, including its notation and proof logic.

This paper discusses the need for a formal model to understand the behavior of context-aware systems and applications, emphasizing the importance of a model that facilitates formal reasoning while being easily implementable. The paper reviews the mobile unity model and introduces the context unity model, presenting its formalization through a simple context-aware system. It also discusses the concept of context, focusing on providing applications with flexible mechanisms for defining individualized contexts that are transparently maintained as the environment changes.

The paper presents a detailed example of a context-aware system expressed in context unity notation and discusses the power of non-deterministic assignment statements in defining contexts. Additionally, it introduces resolution rules for projecting changes onto non-deterministically selected variables, offering a new model for context-aware computing in a mobile environment. The paper also discusses the need for further refinements to simplify the notation, including the inclusion of constructs to react to changing variable states and the exploration of additional possible semantics to provide programmers with more flexibility and control over their defined context.
