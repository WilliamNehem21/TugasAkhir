The paper establishes the decidability of the reachability problem in Petri nets lacking inhibitor arcs, first in [source] and later in [source]. Conversely, the reachability problem for Petri nets containing two inhibitor arcs is proven to be undecidable, as demonstrated in [source]. An open question in [source] pertains to the reachability problem for Petri nets featuring a single inhibitor arc.

The algorithm works by reducing "t" if any of the specified conditions are not met. To address condition 2, Presburger arithmetic is employed to convert the implicit quantitative constraint imposed by the witness places into an explicit restriction on the transitions. Condition 3 guarantees that all quantitative controls are without limit, while condition 4 ensures that all places are also limitless. A covering graph construction is utilized to ascertain compliance with condition 4, with the algorithm employed recursively for each step, akin to its use for condition 1. Notably, the current marking of a node is incorporated as a restriction to the semilinear set during this process. Limited places are eliminated at the expense of a larger structure, which may contain sections derived from restricted parts. These restrictions could result in the loss of property 7 achieved in a preceding recursive step. However, due to their diminished size, property 7 can be reestablished, ensuring the termination of the entire algorithm.
