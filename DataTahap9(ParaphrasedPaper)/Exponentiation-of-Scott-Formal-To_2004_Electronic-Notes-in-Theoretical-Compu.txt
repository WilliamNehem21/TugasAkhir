Let's revisit the concept of continuous relation between formal topologies, which functions as a predictive equivalent of the idea of locale morphism. The definition of a continuous relation is derived from the definition of a frame morphism expressed in terms of relations, by considering the converse relation.

The definition of continuous relation between formal topologies can be significantly streamlined if we focus on the scenario of continuous relations from a unary formal topology to a general one. This simplification is crucial for being able to define the exponential topology of a unary formal topology over an inductively generated one (refer to sections 3.1 and 4.1).

Remark 4.4: The incorporation of a formal topology into its unary image and the elevation of continuous relations to unary topologies correspond to the idea that a topological space can be included in a Scott domain, and that a continuous function can be elevated to an approximable map. This kind of elevation is pivotal in establishing that the category "top" of topological spaces and continuous functions complies with certain diluted concepts of exponentiation, thus enabling the creation of a locally Cartesian closed category from it. In fact, "top" is not Cartesian closed, but it's proven that its exact completion ultimately results in a locally Cartesian closed category.
