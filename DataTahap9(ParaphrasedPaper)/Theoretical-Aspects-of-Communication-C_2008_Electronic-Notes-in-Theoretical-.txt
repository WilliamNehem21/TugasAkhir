The described principles are followed to create a straightforward and type-preserving EPP that is both sound and complete in relation to the original dynamic semantics. This EPP theory, which encompasses type disciplines and EPP mapping, will be published as an additional document alongside the WS-CDL 1.0 specification and will be integrated into an open-source reference implementation of WS-CDL. This approach demonstrates a transition from practical application to theoretical underpinning and back to practical implementation. This progression serves to foster a dialogue between theoretical research and practical engineering, which we argue is highly beneficial for the advancement of rigorous engineering practices and the enrichment of theoretical understanding.

It is important to note the engineering context of the present work, specifically the background of WS-CDL. WS-CDL was developed to meet the engineering requirements for creating business protocols on the World Wide Web, with the central engineering concept revolving around the term "choreography" in its name. The fundamental idea is that the seller must remain independent of the buyer's choice, as conveyed through the external choice mechanism where both operations, "quoteacc" and "quotenogood," are available on session channel "s."
