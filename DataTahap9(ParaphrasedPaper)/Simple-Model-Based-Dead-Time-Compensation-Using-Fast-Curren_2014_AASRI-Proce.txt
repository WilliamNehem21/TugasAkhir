Some techniques aim to address the issue by employing additional detection hardware for each switching element, which is less expensive compared to fast current measurement devices and fast A/D converters. Nonetheless, this approach faces challenges in detecting the momentary current direction during a switch-over, particularly when dealing with current waveforms that exhibit multiple zero crossings within a single switching period. 

The maximal current ripple can be determined using specific mathematical expressions. In an effort to compensate for dead time, a new algorithm was explored in an attempt to accurately calculate the actual current ripple. This method enables the handling of continuous currents even in cases where only slow current measurement is accessible.
