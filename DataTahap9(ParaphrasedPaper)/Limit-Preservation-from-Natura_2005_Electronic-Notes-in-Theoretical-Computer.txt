The crucial point to emphasize is that theorem 2.2 mentioned earlier applies to any natural isomorphism, not just the canonical natural transformation defined from the limit. This theorem establishes that if such a natural isomorphism exists, then the canonical natural transformation is indeed also a natural isomorphism.

Therefore, according to theorem 4.9, the composition of profunctors jf preserves colimits as a functor in f (and similarly as a functor in j). This result is significant in the context of modeling nondeterministic processes as presheaves (which are effectively profunctors from the one-object, one-arrow category). The result ensures that the horizontal composition of 2-cells in the bicategory of profunctors preserves open maps and open-map bisimulation, which is a fundamental theorem.

We would like to express our gratitude to Martin Hyland. The inspiration for this work stemmed from his Cambridge Part III lectures on category theory in the Michaelmas term of 1995, focusing on ends and coends. The results presented in this paper have an air of folklore around them, although we have not found them explicitly stated in the literature. At the very least, we hope that our paper will bring these results and their utility to wider attention. The authors would like to acknowledge their indebtedness to BRICS, Aarhus, where this work was initiated.
