Addressing the need to motivate students in active learning, we undertook the development of new web-based tools with the primary objective of engaging students as actively as possible in their learning process. These interactive Java applets were designed to visually demonstrate algorithm execution, in line with the emathteacher philosophy, and serve as supplementary material for blended learning. The aim was to enhance the power and effectiveness of face-to-face teaching with the flexibility and technical capabilities of elearning, thereby empowering students to take charge of their own learning journey.

One distinguishing feature of these elearning tools, which comply with the emathteacher approach, is their ability to execute the current step if the input is correct, and provide a tailored error message with a hint for the proper answer if not. This feature is particularly beneficial for novice students with minimal background in algorithms, data structures, and programming, as it helps them grasp the concept of algorithms and their functioning. Such interactive features set these tools apart from other systems, offering full interactive learning capabilities.

While impact evaluations of the recently completed "pathfinder" tool are pending, our previous research has created high expectations for its potential effectiveness in supporting learning activities. We have already evaluated the impact of the emathteacher tools by comparing the performance of students in a discrete mathematics final exam, which showed a deeper understanding of the algorithms process in the study group, despite the absence of the algorithm visualization and the framework panels offered by these tools.
