Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are decentralized computer systems made up of numerous small sensor nodes, offering various potential applications. Each node in the network is responsible for sensing the environment, processing the collected data, and communicating with other nodes. The nodes are mostly uniform, with the exception of one or more sink nodes that serve to monitor the network by gathering and transmitting data.

The Lustre model, developed by K. Baradon and A. Vasseur, consists of approximately 1500 lines and incorporates detailed energy models for hardware components with significant energy consumption. The model has also been linked to validation tools.

An accurate sensor network model should thoroughly detail the different radio modes and their associated energy consumption, as well as describe how the medium access control (MAC) protocol triggers mode changes. This informed perspective on energy consumption is vital for understanding properties such as latency, throughput, bandwidth utilization, and fairness.

In addition to radio energy consumption, attention must be given to the energy utilized for data processing, as the processor accounts for a significant portion of a node's total energy consumption. Furthermore, dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a technique used to optimize the energy consumed by the micro-controller, by dynamically adjusting its voltage based on the workload.

Memory consumption is also a topic of interest, as different types of memory (e.g., RAM, flash) have varying energy profiles. Research is ongoing to understand the standby modes of memory and how they affect energy consumption in sensor networks.

Modeling the communication medium, including potential electromagnetic perturbations, is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the network. Furthermore, the use of energy modes in hardware devices must be incorporated into the global model, providing a means to model any energy optimization solution.

The protocol layers are assumed to be implemented in software, and their object code is essential for inclusion in the global model, allowing for detailed analysis of energy-saving mechanisms.

Various network simulators have been developed for different purposes, considering factors such as power consumption and scalability. However, there is a need for formal modeling and validation approaches specific to sensor networks, which may be facilitated by existing tools like Lustre and Lucky.

Lucky, a component of the Lustre toolbox, allows for the description of non-deterministic reactive behaviors and can be used to replace parts of the global model, provided it maintains the same input/output interface.

The formal consideration of non-deterministic behaviors in the context of sensor networks is an area of interest, and the Lustre model provides a suitable platform for such experiments. Additionally, replacing a subset of nodes with a traffic generator using Lucky could offer insights into network behavior and performance evaluation.

It is emphasized that complete protocol stacks and complex radio channel behaviors should be accurately represented in mathematical models used for performance evaluation, as current models may oversimplify these aspects.
