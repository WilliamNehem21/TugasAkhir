In general, it can be noted that utilizing a formalized proof enables rapid testing of the impact of changes on the entire proof, facilitating the assessment of whether lemmas or definitions need to be strengthened or can be relaxed. The availability of a formal proof greatly aided in the compilation of this paper, as Isabelle offers comprehensive support for incorporating formal definitions into papers and conducting validity checks, ensuring the synchronization of formalizations and papers. The inductive rules and the propositions of the lemmas and theorems outlined in this paper have been derived from the formal definitions.
