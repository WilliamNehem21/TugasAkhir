The proposed approach is considered superior to previous methods that rely on measurements such as SNR and SDR, as it has been tested for performance using two metrics: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR).

Independent component analysis (ICA) is the most commonly used method for analyzing latent data, involving the separation of a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents by assuming the mutual statistical independence of the non-Gaussian signals of the sources. ICA methods leverage either non-Gaussianity or sample dependence as properties for separating the components [1,2].

The assumption of independence is usually applicable, making blind ICA separation of mixed signals highly effective. Methods utilizing the statistical properties of the signals can identify independent components by minimizing the statistical dependence of the estimated signal components. The non-Gaussianity feature is used to measure independence of the component through kurtosis measurement or negentropy approximation.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical background, including the fundamentals of ICA, PSO, and QPSO. Section 3 introduces the proposed technique. Section 4 describes the experimental results and their evaluation using certain metrics. The conclusion is presented in Section 5, followed by the references in Section 6.

Li et al. proposed a method to mitigate the limitations of blind source separation (BSS) by enhancing particle swarm optimization (PSO), which involves updating the dynamic inertia weight in PSO and introducing a fitness function based on BSS.
