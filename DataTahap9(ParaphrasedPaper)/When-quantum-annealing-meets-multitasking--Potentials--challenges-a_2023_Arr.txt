The emergence of quantum computers has created new opportunities for addressing NP-hard problems. However, current work on quantum annealers assumes exclusive access to all available resources, which may not be resource-efficient if a task only requires a small portion of the annealer, leaving the rest unused. This paper explores the notion of running multiple tasks concurrently on a quantum annealer, similar to the multitasking capabilities found in classical general-purpose processors. While existing annealers do not natively support multitasking, the paper proposes a multitasking scheme for quantum annealers (QAMT) by identifying parallelism in terms of space and time. The proposed scheme packs multiple tasks into a quantum machine instruction (QMI) based on commercialized quantum annealers from D-Wave, and uses predefined sampling time to simulate task preemption. The paper also discusses scheduling algorithms suitable for QAMT and addresses the challenges associated with multitasking on quantum annealers. Experimental results indicate the potential of multitasking in quantum annealing.

The paper contrasts the multitasking capability found in general-purpose processors with the lack of native support for multitasking in existing commercialized quantum annealing systems. It highlights the potential benefits of multitasking in quantum annealers, particularly for time-critical applications and sharing resources among multiple users.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. It situates the work within the existing literature, defines the models for task execution, proposes a multitasking model for quantum annealers, formalizes the QAMT scheduling problem, and presents a simulator to demonstrate the potential of QAMT. The paper also discusses the possibility of extending multitasking capabilities to gate-based quantum computing systems.
