Data were randomly collected from 468 individuals who have used or are interested in using mobile government services. The researcher then performed reliability tests for each construct to evaluate the quality of the measure and to ensure accuracy in the measurements. The questionnaire had seven sections, with the first section gathering demographic data and the subsequent sections obtaining information related to the factors used in the research model (the questionnaire items can be found in the appendix).
