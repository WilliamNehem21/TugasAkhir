Understanding quantum channel behavior is essential for developing efficient error correction methods and verifying the security of various protocols. While traditional mathematical approaches are commonly used in the analysis of quantum protocols, we propose a simpler probabilistic model checking method, which aligns better with classical implementations. This approach allows us to explore the impact of quantum channel noise on security and compare different eavesdropping strategies.

Quantum information theory has opened the door to achieving tasks beyond the capabilities of classical methods, such as the potential for unconditionally secure communication through quantum cryptography. Quantum mechanics principles enable security beyond computational methods when used in classical communication logic. Quantum channels and quantum bits play a crucial role in transmitting classical information, either alongside a classical medium or through the same quantum channel.

We employed a probabilistic modeling approach to create a simple model for channel noise and imperfections, validated using the PRISM programming tool. The results demonstrate similarities to noiseless channel cases, and comparisons of various eavesdropping scenarios align with previous works. The paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the model of quantum channels, section 3 presents details of the PRISM model checker, simulation, and experimental results, and section 4 concludes the paper.

Due to the stochastic nature of quantum phenomena, it is recommended to use probabilistic tools for verifying quantum protocols, as opposed to logical model-checkers like SPIN. PRISM, a probabilistic symbolic model-checker, offers advantages, particularly in the analysis of protocols such as BB84, and has been utilized by protocol developers for this purpose. Papanikolaou proposed an analysis of BB84 for two possible attacks, where the channel is assumed noiseless and all device imperfections are disregarded.
