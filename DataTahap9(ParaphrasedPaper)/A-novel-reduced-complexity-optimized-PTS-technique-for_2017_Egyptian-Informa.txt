The complexity of the search process increases as the number of subcarriers in this method increases. An algorithm based on the cross-entropy method is proposed to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) by reserving tones. The cross-entropy method is utilized to determine the suboptimal values of peak reduction carriers in this approach. However, this method does not achieve a simultaneous reduction in PAPR and complexity. Another approach is presented in the literature, employing a non-linear optimization method to identify the optimal combination of peak reduction tone sets. The proposed PAPR reduction techniques in direct detection optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (O-OFDM) systems focus on low complexity for clipping and quantization noise cancellation. However, the complexity of the search process is not addressed in this technique, and it does not result in a significant reduction in PAPR. Additionally, two other schemes for PAPR reduction using an optimization method based adaptive iterative clipping and pre-coding with clipping and filtering are presented, but neither of these schemes consider complexity reduction. Although clipping is straightforward to implement, it may introduce in-band and out-of-band interferences while eliminating the orthogonality among the subcarriers.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 3 characterizes the wireless OFDM system and formulates PAPR and complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF). The proposed partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique is discussed in Section 4, and theoretical analyses are conducted in Section 5, deriving expressions for CCDF, number of subcarriers, subblocks, and total computational complexity for the suggested scheme. Section 6 presents results and discussions, while Section 7 concludes the paper.

In this proposed method, m values are computed u times periodically, and the rows of the modified phase matrix have distinct values chosen randomly from the allowed phase factors. A different approach is followed for finding the optimized phase factors for the proposed technique, with w representing the number of allowed phase factors.

The proposed method models the amplitude of an OFDM signal using a Rayleigh distribution and the power using a chi-square distribution with zero mean and two degrees of freedom. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the system is expressed as 8.1 dB. The analytical results closely align with the simulation results for both traditional PTS and proposed PTS techniques. The proposed method effectively reduces PAPR compared to traditional PTS, and the reduction in PAPR is improved compared to the T-PTS scheme.

The proposed scheme demonstrates a reduction in complexity percentage compared to the traditional PTS scheme. The complexity reduction ratio (CCRR) is used to estimate system performance, with a higher CCRR indicating better performance of the proposed scheme compared to the traditional scheme. CCRR is also used for comparing scheme complexities. The CCRR values are 56.25%, 50%, and 37.48% for the proposed PTS scheme with b=0.5, 1, 2, respectively, for m=128 and u=2. For the proposed scheme with b=0.5, 1, 2, the CCRR values are 56.89%, 50%, and 36.21% for m=128 and u=2. CCRR percentage is improved for lower values of the tradeoff factor and lower for higher values of b.

This paper proposes a novel low-complexity optimized PTS technique with reduced computational complexity for PAPR reduction in wireless OFDM systems. By applying the proposed technique, simultaneous reduction in PAPR and computational complexity is achieved compared to the traditional PTS scheme. A favorable tradeoff is attained between PAPR reduction and computational complexity by selecting the optimum value of the tradeoff factor. PAPR decreases with the reduction in the number of subcarriers and an increase in the number of subblocks. The analytical results closely match the simulation results, indicating that the suggested PTS technique outperforms the traditional PTS technique in reducing PAPR and computational complexity. The proposed technique enhances the efficiency of power amplifiers and can be applied to current wireless systems such as WiMAX and LTE.
