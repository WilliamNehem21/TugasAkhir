This paper discusses the adaptation of Arabic speech recognition systems for non-native speakers with foreign accents. The research examines the use of adaptation techniques—specifically, maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), maximum a posteriori (MAP), and a combination of MLLR and MAP—utilizing the LDC-WestPoint Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) corpus and HTK toolkit for implementation. Evaluation is conducted at both word and phoneme levels. The results indicate that unique MSA Arabic phonemes, particularly pharyngeal and emphatic consonants which pose challenges for non-native speakers, benefit from the adaptation process using a combination of MLLR and MAP, resulting in an overall improvement of 7.37%. The paper also highlights the influence of the first (native) language on the characteristics of a second language, leading to performance degradation in automatic speech recognition systems when used by non-native speakers.

Bartkova and Jouvet (2004) are cited as having proposed multiple models to enhance the speech recognition of non-native French speakers by adapting acoustic models of French phonemes with speech data from English, German, and Spanish, resulting in significant error rate reduction across 11 language groups of speakers. The authors note the scarcity of research efforts in the Arabic language compared to other languages and outline their goal of investigating how adaptation techniques could improve recognition systems for non-native Arabic speakers. Detailed descriptions of the Arabic language’s phonetic features and phonemes are provided, followed by an overview of the MLLR adaptation technique and the use of the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) for speech recognition system design and testing.

Further, the authors discuss the performance of MLLR, MAP, and their combination, reporting improvements and noting the potential for future research, including the investigation of an evolutionary-based technique for auto-adaptation of Arabic speech recognition systems and the examination of the impact of using other languages as native languages on improving Arabic ASR systems.

In conclusion, the paper delineates the organization of the study, offering a background on the Arabic language, describing the adaptation methods, presenting the experimental framework, discussing the results, and indicating avenues for future research.
