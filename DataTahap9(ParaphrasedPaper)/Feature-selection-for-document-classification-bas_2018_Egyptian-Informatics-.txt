Feature selection involves choosing the optimal subset of data elements in a data set for use in data mining or applications. This paper introduces a novel technique using topological spaces to develop an information retrieval system (IRS). The concept of topological information retrieval systems (TIRS) is defined as a generalization of IRS, and topological near open sets are applied to these systems for feature selection. The paper discusses the indiscernibility of keywords in these systems and their practical applications, and examines the order relation that represents the relationships among documents in the document space.

The use of topological space, particularly near open sets, has become a powerful tool in data analysis, with recent applications in fields such as information analysis in chemistry and physics. The primary aim of this work is to lay the foundation for using topological structures in information retrieval applications. The paper also introduces rough set theory, a mathematical tool that supports uncertainty reasoning qualitatively, and discusses its basic concepts and relations.

The proposed topological information retrieval system is based on the notion of topological near open sets, with knowledge represented by an information retrieval system where each document is characterized by its values on a finite set of keywords. The paper defines the topological bases on the set of keywords and discusses the use of the topological information retrieval system for approximate retrieval. It presents basic mathematical operations on topological systems based on general topology and examines the order relation representing the relationships among documents in the document space. The approximate retrieval is achieved by reducing the unique query using topological methods, such as topological near open sets and their generalizations.

In text learning tasks, many feature selection methods rely on statistical or information-theoretical procedures to analyze the characteristics of a given data set and identify excellent term features. While these methods do not inherently consider the meaning of the text, they are valuable for text learning tasks. The paper mentions the relief algorithm, a statistical feature selection algorithm that uses instance-based learning.

In the context of information retrieval, precision and recall are defined in terms of a set of retrieved documents and a set of related documents, such as the list of documents generated by a web search engine for a query and the list of all relevant documents on the internet for a specific topic, respectively.
