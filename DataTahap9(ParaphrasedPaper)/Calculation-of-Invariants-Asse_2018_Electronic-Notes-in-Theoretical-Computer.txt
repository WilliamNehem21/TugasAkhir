Questions (i) and (ii) are addressed using Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3 for loops with a potentially non-deterministic body that behaves deterministically on the variables in the loop guard. Questions (iii) and (iv) are addressed using a technique based on mathematical induction, specifically for loops of a certain form.

In the proof, a system of formal derivation of predicates is utilized to ensure the correctness of the result, given that the theorem pertains to a formula with instances as predicates. The reader should interpret the following demonstration as a series of demonstrations, each corresponding to an instance of predicates inv, nbg, and dombg, resulting from the application of the derivations in a specific order. The rules of inference used in this work are based on the calculative logic presented in the book by Gries.
