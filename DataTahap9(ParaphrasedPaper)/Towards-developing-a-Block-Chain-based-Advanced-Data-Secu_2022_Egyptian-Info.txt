Smart cities rely on information technology and advanced communication models to collect and integrate various data sources for intelligent and seamless operations. These models are used in applications such as smart transportation, environmental protection, and smart grid, which encompass a wide range of devices such as sensors and other IoT devices. Cloud sensing models have become increasingly popular for effective data sensing, as well as crowd sensing models.

The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, while Section 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed workflow. Evaluation results obtained from a simulation environment are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses potential enhancements to incorporate security into crowd sensing models.

Numerous efforts have been made to address privacy concerns in advanced communication models and transaction services. Crowd sensing is viewed as an efficient tool for cost-effective data collection and problem-solving, with services like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) being popular despite vulnerabilities and potential data leakage. Privacy protection measures, such as the development of privacy wrappers and the application of group signature techniques, have been proposed to address privacy issues in crowd sensing models. Additionally, distributed authority mechanisms and blockchain-based models have been employed to enhance trust and decentralization.

Incentive approaches have also been considered, with blockchain used as a payment gateway to develop a secure communication model. However, privacy protection issues persist, particularly in dealing with malicious participants. While addressing data privacy and anonymity, the proposed models have not fully considered smart contracts and cost-effectiveness. The paper presents a survey of incorporating blockchain models in IoT, including a blockchain-based participant identity and access management model and the use of blockchain with smart contract declarations for complex automation processes. The proposed Object Security Architecture (OSCAR) aims to provide end-to-end security through authentication and authorization models for securing IoT resource access.

The paper proposes a blockchain-based advanced data security and reward model for mobile crowd sensing (DSECCS) to address issues related to participant selection, reward allocation, and data privacy. The model effectively combines blockchain to secure mobile crowd sensing without relying on third-party authority. Smart contracts are employed to mitigate fraudulent activities, and reward allocation is determined based on bidding rate, reputation rate, and data quality. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the model in terms of network evaluation and security factors compared to existing models.
