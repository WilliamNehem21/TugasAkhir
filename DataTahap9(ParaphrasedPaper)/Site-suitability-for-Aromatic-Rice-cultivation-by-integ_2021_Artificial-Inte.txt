One of the most straightforward yet effective ensemble machine learning approaches is bootstrap aggregation (also known as bagging). Bootstrap aggregation is a key method aimed at reducing variance in algorithms with a high number of iterations (Breiman, 1996). The objective of bagging is to decrease variance while preserving the bias of a decision tree and avoiding overfitting. The bagging approach involves creating multiple sets of models from input data. The average of predictions from these models is then used to produce a more robust final conclusion. Utilizing multiple replicas of the trained data subset enhances the accuracy of a single tree (Talukdar and Pal, 2019).

Individuals residing in alkaline soils are more susceptible to zinc deficiencies due to the inverse pH of the soil. Other factors influencing soil fertility include sulfur content, with fast-growing crops having high sulfur uptake. Potassium treatments in rice field soils help maintain soil redox potential and act as a nutrient supply, while plant growth regulators aid in physiological injury repair. Enhanced specificity of interactions between various management strategies and environmental factors (soil types, water logging intensity, etc.), as well as within management practices, is observed. Generally, all Kharif crops in India are cultivated under rainfed conditions with minimal irrigation. To sustain Tulaipanji farming, irrigation systems need to be installed in the study area.
