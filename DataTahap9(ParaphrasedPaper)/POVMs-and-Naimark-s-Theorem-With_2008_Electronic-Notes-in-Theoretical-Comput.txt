1 b.c. is backed by the EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship EP/D072786/1 on the structure of quantum information and its implications for IT, as well as the EPSRC grant EP/C500032/1 on high-level methods in quantum computation and quantum information. He expresses gratitude to Dan Browne, Peter Selinger, and Reinhard Werner for their valuable feedback on a prior version of the presented outcomes.

Remark 2.1 is important to note that the purely multiplicative definition of completely positive maps (i.e., reliant on tensor structure alone) embodies the Kraus representation, where the conventional summation is implicitly accounted for by the internal trace and/or cotrace structure on CPM(C), as represented by the half-circles in the diagrams denoting completely positive maps.

Remark 4.9 Although POVMs do not pertain to the state after the measurement, our analysis does suggest an apparent candidate for non-destructive generalized measurements, at times referred to as PMVMs in the literature. We defer a detailed discussion to future publications.

Remark 4.10 Recognize the delicate role that x-completeness and normalization of the POVMs play in all of this, on which, due to space constraints, we are unable to delve into. We will defer this discussion to an expanded version of the current paper, also forthcoming.
