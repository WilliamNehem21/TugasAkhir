The effectiveness of the learning machine is influenced by parameter c, which controls the penalty for large fitting deviations. An excessively high value can lead to overfitting, while a value that is too small may result in underfitting. Therefore, optimizing these parameters is crucial in improving the performance of support vector machines (SVM).

The conventional SVM faces challenges in parameter selection, leading to issues such as overfitting and underfitting, which can negatively impact algorithm performance and prediction accuracy. By using a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the selection of the SVM penalty factor and kernel function parameters, positive results were achieved. The GA-SVM forecasting model demonstrated good prediction results through confirmation and validation with original data.
