The primary objective of this study is to conduct a logical examination of combined assessments of probability and possibility, specifically evaluating both measures for the same set of events. The central question posed in this work is determining the conditions under which a combined assessment is considered coherent. To address this query, we will introduce the concepts of internal and external coherence for combined assessments. A combined assessment is deemed coherent if it satisfies both the internal and external coherence criteria. To clarify, a combined assessment is coherent if each assessment is coherent on its own (internal coherence), and further, if the assessments adhere to the principle that if an event is probable, then it is also possible (external coherence).

In future research, we intend to expand upon these initial findings to encompass measures of conditional probability and possibility as well. Formulating a logic for conditional measures is relatively straightforward, and establishing a result akin to Theorem 3.4 can be proven. However, we have yet to establish whether the test for combined assessments is NP-complete in that context. On the other hand, while we know that testing assessments of conditional probability and conditional possibility is NP-complete, it remains challenging to provide a comprehensive characterization for external coherence in that context.
