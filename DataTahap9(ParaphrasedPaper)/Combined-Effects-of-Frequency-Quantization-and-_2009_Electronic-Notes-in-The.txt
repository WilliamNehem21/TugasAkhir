Gardner also investigated the scenario in which the input signal was obscured by additive white Gaussian noise and aimed to establish some general guidelines that describe how this additional noise interacts with the quantization uncertainty. Although some analysis of the resultant noise was conducted, the findings were only moderately accurate and were only applicable in specific circumstances. No comprehensive understanding of the issue was achieved.

Furthermore, the intermediate phase represents a range in which the additive noise begins to impact the system, while still displaying a significant reliance on the quantization level. This indicates that the additive noise and inherent uncertainty are interacting in some manner. This phase encompasses several orders of magnitude on both the input and output variance scales, and there are instances where the output variance has exceeded the noise-free level by a significant margin, but quantization continues to have a substantial impact. Consequently, comprehending the behavior in this phase should be of interest for phase-locked loop (PLL) designers. Additionally, it was observed that the probability density function (PDF) of the output uncertainty becomes increasingly similar to a Gaussian distribution as this intermediate phase is traversed.

The final phase is when the output variance becomes independent of quantization, and the graph of the output variance forms a line with a slope of 1. As anticipated and previously mentioned, this is precisely the response of a linear, analog PLL. The PDF of the output in this phase is close to a Gaussian distribution.
