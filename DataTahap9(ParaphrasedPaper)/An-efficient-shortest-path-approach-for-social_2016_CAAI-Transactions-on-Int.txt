Lately, there has been significant interest in the study of social networks within the fields of sociology, informatics, and computer science [1, 2]. A social network refers to a social structure comprising a collection of social actors, such as individuals or organizations, along with the various connections between these actors. Given the substantial amount of data and resources associated with social networks, there is a critical need to analyze problems related to social networks. Research into social networks has been conducted across numerous aspects of sociology, including areas such as social influence and finding the most efficient path from a specified starting point to a designated endpoint within a given network while minimizing the total cost linked to the path. This shortest path (SP) problem is fundamental to the study of social networks.

In a graph, determining the path with the lowest cost from a source node (s) to a destination node (d) is known as the point-to-point (P2P) problem. A common variant of this problem involves setting a single node as the source node and then finding the shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph. Additionally, other variations of the shortest path problem, such as single-destination and all-pairs, can be transformed into a single-source shortest path problem. The single-source problem with non-negative arc lengths has been extensively studied. Traditional Dijkstra's algorithm is often applied to weighted or non-weighted networks without domain-specific information. While Dijkstra's algorithm is a single-source algorithm, it can be adapted to function as a P2P algorithm by terminating at the destination node. However, due to its high time complexity of O(n^2), it may not be suitable for addressing the SP problem in social networks, particularly within large-scale social networks. Modified standard breadth-first search has a time complexity of O(n), but it is better suited to non-weighted networks. As network scale increases, researchers have employed domain-specific information about the network to handle these challenges.

For instance, in traffic networks, natural hierarchies have been utilized to significantly accelerate shortest path algorithms, and various other algorithms have been developed for this purpose. However, it is evident that these algorithms are not directly applicable to social networks. By viewing social networks from a similar perspective to traffic networks, it becomes apparent that the unique characteristics of social networks can be leveraged to address the SP problem. The community feature is recognized as one of the most significant characteristics of social networks.

This paper provides a detailed description of the proposed SPCD (Shortest Path Community Detection) algorithm in Section 2. Section 3 presents experimental results using five datasets, analyzing both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the paper discusses the influence of community path number and community detection methods on SPCD. The paper concludes in Section 4 and identifies avenues for future work.

The proposed algorithm is described in detail in Section 2. It begins with an introduction to community definition and detection, followed by a description of the method for constructing a community graph. Subsection 2.3 provides details on the k shortest community paths, and the section concludes with an explanation of the shortest path in the sub-graph.

The paper then delves into the identification of large edges and the discovery of communities encompassing the shortest path, followed by the search for the shortest path within these communities. The paper introduces a new shortest path algorithm, SPCD, based on community detection. By utilizing community information, SPCD effectively narrows down the search for the shortest path in the network. The paper references the work of Xie et al., who proposed a framework that uses the Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA) to detect communities and cluster larger edges into a community for weighted networks. However, the paper notes that Xie's method cannot be directly applied, and instead proposes a unique approach that involves reversing the target network. The paper emphasizes that, compared to the edges between communities, the cost of edges within the community is smaller and can be temporarily ignored. Consequently, all the nodes within a community are treated as one node in the community graph, and the minimum cost edge between communities is chosen as the connection of the community graph between corresponding community nodes. The aim of the SP problem is to find the smallest path, so the minimum cost edge is selected in this step. This process results in the original network being transformed into a new weighted community graph.

The paper acknowledges that the shortest path may not be included in the shortest community path but in the second shortest or k-th shortest community path. As a result, the paper explains the process for calculating the k shortest community paths, which involves finding the top k paths from the source node to the destination node in order of increasing cost. If the number of paths from the source community to the destination community is less than k in the community graph, all available paths are selected. Given the modeling of the original network to the community graph by the proposed method, the paper asserts that the real shortest path in the original network is included in the community graph, and there is a high likelihood that the actual shortest path can be found in the shortest community path. However, the paper underscores the importance of considering scenarios where the real shortest path may not be included in the shortest community path, but rather in another path among the k shortest community paths. Based on this analysis, the paper outlines the procedure for calculating the k shortest community paths.

The paper also references datasets of network science and nuclear experiments, and highlights the efficiency and approximation error of the proposed algorithm. The paper concludes by emphasizing the excellent performance of the algorithm within specified limits, and suggests that various community detection methods could be employed in this algorithm. It also indicates that future research will focus on developing heuristic methods for combining social network community information for the SP problem in weighted social networks, as well as exploring community detection algorithms suited to social networks.

Additionally, the paper reveals that the proposed algorithm uses a structural clustering algorithm for detecting hierarchical communities in networks, and suggests further exploration of this approach in the future.
