With the development of a high-voltage grid and ongoing power system reforms in China, the intelligent power grid is set to emerge as a key strategic focus for the country's power grid advancement. Within the context of the intelligent power grid system, modifications in power usage and the influence of price disparities are leading to new characteristics in power loads. This study compares the accuracy of forecasting methods including the gray model, trend fitting model, and MV method, demonstrating that the MV method outperforms other techniques in forecasting and has the potential to enhance power load forecasting management in the construction of intelligent power grids.
