The HIV/AIDS epidemic emerged in the early 1980s and has had a significant impact on millions of individuals. The disease is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a lentivirus that progressively attacks the body's immune system, affecting all of its systems and ultimately leading to death. The most advanced stage of HIV is known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The progression from HIV to AIDS and the assessment of behavioral risk factors in key populations are important for understanding the incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

Measuring the prevalence and incidence of HIV/AIDS is crucial for assessing the risk rate of the disease. HIV prevalence refers to the proportion of the population living with HIV infection, while HIV incidence represents the annual or quarterly number of new infections in a population. The ratio of HIV incidence to the size of the uninfected population yields the HIV incidence rate, which indicates the risk of becoming infected over a given time period. Various methods, such as national surveys, sentinel surveillance, specialized surveys of high-risk populations, and back-calculation techniques, are used to gather national statistics on HIV prevalence. However, the social stigma associated with HIV/AIDS poses a major challenge to data collection efforts.

This study analyzed additional characteristics of high-risk groups, such as people who inject drugs (PWID), focusing on demographic, behavioral, and biological features and using advanced data processing and feature extraction techniques to predict HIV risk scores with greater accuracy. The study also explored the applicability of using machine learning classifiers for predicting HIV/AIDS and survival analysis in regions such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, Portugal, Malaysia, South Africa, and China. A predictive model based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and genetic algorithm achieved an accuracy of 84.24%. The study targeted the PWID population from 2012 to 2019, considering 57 attributes, including demographic, biological, and behavioral factors.

The dataset used for experimentation showed that certain features had missing values, which were substituted using data imputation strategies. Automated machine learning-based attribute selection techniques were employed to extract valuable features from the normalized data. Several classification methods, including random forest, part rule induction, and support vector machine (SVM), were used to predict HIV/AIDS status based on the selected attributes.

The dataset used for the research was obtained through the management information system (MIS) utilized by more than 30 sites across Pakistan. These sites employ outreach workers to engage with PWID and provide prevention and treatment services. Data collection involves the use of manual forms and customized devices, with information being recorded in real-time within the MIS.
