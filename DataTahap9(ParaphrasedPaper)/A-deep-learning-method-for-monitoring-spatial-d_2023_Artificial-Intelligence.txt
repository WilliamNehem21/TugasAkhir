The ghost module is aimed at generating a greater number of feature maps while using fewer parameters. In this research, the ghost module was implemented to process the feature maps of hens. The original feature map of hens appears blurred after passing through the YOLOv5 neck network; however, with the integration of the ghost module, a clearer feature map is obtained. 

The study involved the creation of a dataset of laying hens to assess the performance of the enhanced YOLOv5 model in bird detection. This dataset encompassed the entire growth period of the birds, ranging from 1 week to 36 weeks (from baby chicks to hens), and was composed of 3000 images randomly extracted from recorded videos. All images were annotated using LabelImg Windows v1.6.1; birds younger than 2 weeks were categorized as baby chicks, while birds aged 2 weeks or older were labeled as pullets/hens. During the training and testing phases, 2400 and 600 images, respectively, were utilized. The training phase involved running a Python Qt5 application framework for 300 epochs, with a learning rate of 0.01 and a batch size of 16.

Several challenges were encountered during the study, such as issues related to the horizontal scaling factor, which led to missed detections of baby chicks that were too small, as well as the design of the perch zone, where a narrower zone resulted in fewer chicks being included, leading to missed detections. The false detection rates were reported as 0.004.
