This section aims to conduct an algebraic exploration of logics for coalgebras. The primary concept is that just as coalgebras are defined in relation to a functor t over a set, logics for coalgebras are determined by a functor l over boolean algebras. By considering various examples, it becomes clear that logics for coalgebras, presented in a conventional manner, result in a functor on the category ba of boolean algebras.

When dealing with different coproduct structures, the use of a different functor than l becomes necessary. To address this, an alternative approach involving the consideration of the free lalgebra over different presheaves of variables is proposed. For instance, the presheaf of variables w can be explicitly defined as an illustrative example.
