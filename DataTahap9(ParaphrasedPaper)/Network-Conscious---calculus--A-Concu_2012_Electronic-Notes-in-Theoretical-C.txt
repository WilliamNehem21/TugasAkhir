The paper differentiates between two categories of entities: "sites," which are the network's nodes, and "links," which are explicit connections between pairs of sites. It explains that the congruence property can be achieved through concurrent semantics, while striving to maintain a standard interpretation of bisimilarity. The paper also highlights the unsuitability of interleaving semantics in a distributed environment, as it relies on a mutual exclusion mechanism between remote actions that is simpler from a formal perspective but not realistic for modeling concurrent systems.

The authors introduce the concept of well-formed ncpi processes, stating that a process is considered well-formed if each bound link it contains is explicitly bound and not as a side effect of binding a site, and if two links with the same label but different endpoints do not appear free in any of its subprocesses. They provide examples of processes that are not well-formed, explaining the reasons for their non-conformance to the defined criteria.

The paper specifies that the provided calculus solely encompasses point-to-point communication, acknowledging that the network could potentially be utilized for more intricate forms of interaction, such as multicast. The authors suggest potential avenues for further development, such as allowing diverse mechanisms of message exchange and incorporating complex quality of service (QoS) conditions on resources, such as bandwidth restrictions or cost considerations. Additionally, they propose the potential for asynchronous variations, wherein each hop of a routing path could occur in distinct transitions, in order to capture the step-by-step behavior of software-defined networks (SDNs).
