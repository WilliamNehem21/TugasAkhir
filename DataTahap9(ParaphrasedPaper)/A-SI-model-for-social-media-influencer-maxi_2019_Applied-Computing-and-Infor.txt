The exploration of social network mining can be classified into two main areas: the analysis of structural attributes and content examination. A crucial issue in social network contexts is the identification of the most influential entities within the network, impacting domains like viral marketing. However, the challenge of pinpointing the most persuasive node in a social network has proven to be NP-hard, with the exact algorithms for solving this problem remaining elusive. As such, there is ample opportunity for the development of approximation methods and algorithms with proven approximation guarantees. Many existing algorithms for addressing these challenges are based on the greedy algorithm, which, while providing a good approximation, can be computationally demanding. This paper suggests a two-level approach based on the suspected-infected (SI) epidemic model to maximize influence spread, along with a multithreading approach for implementing the SI model, aimed at enhancing the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of influence spread per second.

The concept of viral marketing has gained recognition as an effective marketing strategy. With the proliferation of social networks such as Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter, the influence of social networks on individuals has significantly increased. Social influence plays a critical role in shaping and disseminating information within the network, influencing trends and opinions. Key individuals, known as influencers, are influential in shaping or manipulating opinions in social networks, particularly in marketing or opinion mining. Companies have begun targeting these influencers, who align contextually with their brands.

Social media influencers are individuals in the social network who influence potential customers' purchasing decisions through social networking. Identifying influencers involves determining the optimal subset of individuals (seed set) who can influence other nodes to maximize the spread of information to a larger population.

Recent advancements in the field of social networks have concentrated on studying relationships and quantitative measures of social networks, such as influence, authority, centrality, among others. Influence maximization involves selecting target nodes in a social network to maximize the spread of influence and design marketing strategies or propagate new ideas within the network.

Kemp et al. introduced a greedy approach for identifying k influential nodes from all existing nodes and provided the first approximation-guaranteed solution for the greedy algorithm. They proposed an analysis framework based on submodular functions for identifying seed nodes and demonstrated that a feasible solution can be obtained using a greedy strategy. Additionally, they introduced a triggering model and showed that their proposed approximation algorithm outperformed other known node selection strategies.

Furthermore, social network diffusion has been modeled using theories such as bond percolation, leading to the proposal of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. The SI model, being a progressive model, is preferred for influence maximization problems and can be better exploited for this purpose.

A social network can be viewed as a directed graph where the nodes represent users in the network and the edges represent relationships between users. The influence maximization problem involves selecting the seed set of users to maximize the expected spread of influence or diffusion. The triggering model, based on propagation models such as the independent cascade (IC) and the linear threshold (LT) models, is shown to be NP-hard, and the maximization function exhibits submodularity and monotonicity.

This maximization problem can be expressed as a discrete optimization problem and modeled as a graphical model for learning tree distribution. Traversing the given nodes along the specified threshold length using a spanning tree provides a subset of the final active set.

The SI model, an incremental approach based on the cumulative spread of influence, exploits graph properties via spanning trees to find the longest path and increase influence spread. However, compared to the basic greedy model, it is restricted to local search. A novel approach based on the SI epidemic model, longest-shortest path concept, and multithreading is proposed to enhance the efficiency and maximize influence spread.

Overall, identifying influential users in social media can inform various business strategies, such as product launches and targeting potential consumers. This study concludes that influence maximization and social influence mining are significant components for enabling viral marketing through online social networks. Future research may entail exploring different models and algorithms for influencer identification, as well as parallel problems like link prediction and social network content analysis.
