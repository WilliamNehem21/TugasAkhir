We examine orthomodular structures formed by certain sets of states from finite transition systems, known as regions, which can be interpreted as local states in a distributed, concurrent system. These structures have enough elements to represent meets of specific subsets, with applications to the theory of petri nets, a formal model for concurrent and distributed systems. Our research relates to our interest in petri nets, which were developed to embody principles derived from modern physics, such as the special theory of relativity.

Given a net, denoted as n=(b, e, f), we define k= ip(b), where ip(x) represents the powerset of x, and the elements of k are referred to as cases of n. These cases represent potential global states of the system modeled by n. Transitions in the system, subject to the firing rule, alter the current case, and this property applies to all events.

A region can be seen as a local state of a system described by a transition system, where the local states correspond to conditions that are true or false in a global state. Each region, denoted as r, represents the set of global states in which the corresponding condition is true.

We have defined two maps: h, which associates a coherent, prime orthomodular poset to a transition system, and j, which performs the reverse operation. It has been demonstrated that j(p) belongs to the class of transition systems generated by nets of condition and events (referred to as ce transition systems). Additionally, it has been established that a is embedded in jh(a) for all ce transition system a, and p is embedded in hj(p). In both cases, the embedding is provided by a natural notion of morphism.
