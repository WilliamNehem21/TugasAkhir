When the value of k is not sufficiently large to satisfy the conditions of theorem 3.2, an upper limit can be established, as demonstrated in theorem 3.3. It should be noted that if the upper limit is not tight, it is at most one greater than the sigma chromatic number.

As mentioned in remark 2.5, vertices with varying degrees possess distinct sums of colors. Consequently, each vertex belonging to the first and last k vertices of the graph (in canonical order) has a different color sum from its neighbors, as vertices with the same degree are not adjacent if the degree is less than 2k. The remaining task is to demonstrate that vertices with identical degrees have dissimilar color sums.
