In their research, Lei Zhang et al. examined the depth of the hardness layer in alloy steel through a grinding process, while Fu X.L. et al. investigated the surface hardening of aluminum alloy during high-speed milling. Consequently, there was interest in studying the turning of stainless steel JIS SUS 303 and exploring the factors that affect the quality of the turning process. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing the roundness and hardness of turning stainless steel JIS SUS 303.

The experiment involved two random replicates, and the machined specimens were assessed for roundness using the average value and for hardness using the Rockwell scale B as responses. Measurements were taken at three positions on the machined surface, and the data were analyzed using statistical methods to identify the impact of factors on roundness and hardness.

The appropriate levels of the experimental factors were determined, and the results were subjected to a normality test, which indicated a significant normal distribution, suggesting that the experimental factors were at appropriate levels. The main outcome of the experiment was the identification of factors and factor interactions that affect roundness and hardness.

The primary focus of this research was to investigate turning parameters that influence the roundness and hardness of turning stainless steel SUS 303. The results of the experiment indicated that cooling primarily affected roundness, with non-cooling or dry-cutting leading to poorer roundness quality, highlighting the importance of cooling in the turning process for achieving better roundness quality.

Additionally, the study examined the hardness of the surface after turning and found that cutting speed, feed rate, and cooling or non-cooling did not significantly influence the hardness. Furthermore, the hardness of the stainless steel SUS 303 specimens between the raw surface and the machined surface did not exhibit a significant difference.
