The addition of quantum elements allows for a composite representation of quantum protocols, where quantum components engage with classical finite state components. We believe that explicitly incorporating classical control components enhances the conceptual coherence and accuracy of quantum protocols.

Qubit automata are c-automata with a state space of c2, and individually or collectively create quantum automata. We will outline three specific qubit automata essential for our discussion of teleportation. One of these qubit automata is a quantum automaton, while the others will be combined to make a 2-qubit quantum automaton.
