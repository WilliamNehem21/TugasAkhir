The number of documents under consideration for generating the summary can be categorized as single document summarization or multi-document summarization [10,11]. Single document summarization refers to the condensation of a single document into a shorter version, while multi-document summarization involves condensing a set of documents into a summary. Therefore, multi-document summarization can be seen as an extension of single document summarization. In multi-document summarization, the search space is larger compared to single document summarization, which makes the extraction of important sentences more challenging. In this context, multi-document summarization can be viewed as an optimization problem with the objective of producing an optimal summary containing informative content.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly discusses related works on text summarization problem using global optimization techniques. Section 3 introduces the proposed extractive summarization model. Section 4 presents a cuckoo search-based summarizer for solving the summarization problem. Section 5 details the numeric calculation for the objective function, while Section 6 elaborates on experiments and result analysis. Finally, Section 7 addresses the conclusions.

Extensive experiments have shown that the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm yields significant improvements compared to other algorithms. Wong et al. have developed a new biodiesel engine to achieve fewer emissions, low fuel cost, and a wide operating range of engine using the cuckoo search algorithm. Comparison with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm shows that CS yields similar results to PSO but with fewer user-defined parameters.

Although various optimization algorithms have been proposed in the past, the application of cuckoo search algorithm for developing summarizers is relatively uncommon in the field of text summarization. While Mirshojaei and Masoomi have previously addressed the summarization problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, their application was limited to single document summarization. The results of the cuckoo search algorithm's summarization are compared with those of the particle swarm optimization algorithm, bacterial foraging optimization algorithm, and word summarizer in terms of F-score. Among all cases, the F-score of the cuckoo search algorithm shows relatively better performance than the other methods.

The proposed multi-document summarization system involves multiple documents (d1, d2, ..., dn) and follows a process of preprocessing, input representation, and summary representation to extract the final summary. For implementation, the cuckoo search algorithm can use a simple form where each nest has only a single egg, or it can be extended to cases where each nest has multiple eggs representing a set of solutions.

The experiments conducted in this section aim to test the proposed summarization system empirically. The multi-document summarization model is compared with other algorithms using the DUC datasets, and the analysis of summary results is carried out using the ROUGE tool in terms of ROUGE score.

The performance of the cuckoo search algorithm is data-dependent, and as it is an evolutionary approach, the controlling parameters need to be carefully managed. Therefore, a more systematic approach to parameter selection will be explored in future work. Additionally, the performance of this approach can also be examined using other competent nature-inspired algorithms.
