Various studies have been conducted to develop environmentally friendly repellents and larvicidal agents using plants. Medicinal plants have been used as alternative medicine for centuries due to their therapeutic properties, including their synergistic, supportive, and preventive medicinal characteristics. Additionally, these plants have been explored for their potential use in insecticides, such as nanomaterial-based insecticides. Nanoparticles have been found to offer green and efficient alternatives for pest management without causing harm to the environment, as their atom-by-atom arrangement influences their size, shape, and orientation to target specific sites.

The efficacy of silver nanoparticles depends on their size and shape, with smaller monodisperse silver nanoparticles produced using reducing agents like borohydride, while the use of less reducing agents like citrate led to a slower reducing rate. Chemical synthesis of nanoparticles has resulted in toxic and less effective nanoparticles, whereas green synthesis using nontoxic substances and reducing agents has been found to be eco-friendly and less toxic. Several plant species, including Phyllanthus amarus, Annona squamosa, Coccinia grandis, and Eclipta prostrata, were collected and morphologically identified for further experiments.

The larvicidal activity of these plant extracts was evaluated according to WHO guidelines, and the results showed that ethyl acetate and petroleum ether extracts of the terrestrial plants exhibited effective mortality against Aedes aegypti larvae. Similarly, these extracts also demonstrated effective mortality against Culex larvae. The presence of phytochemicals in the plant extracts was found to be responsible for their insecticidal properties, and the synthesized silver nanoparticles showed promising larvicidal activity, aligning with previous research findings.

In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of medicinal plants and green-synthesized silver nanoparticles as effective larvicidal agents against disease-spreading mosquito larvae, providing a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach for vector control. These findings are in agreement with previous studies and contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat vector-borne diseases.
