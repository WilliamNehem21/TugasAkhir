Recently, there has been a growing interest in utilizing optimization procedures to discover the optimal clusters in the clustering process. Numerous algorithms have been developed to mine optimal clusters, with a focus on objective functions beyond the traditional k-means clustering. To achieve more effective clustering results, researchers have designed new objective functions and combined them with optimization algorithms. In this study, we introduce a hybrid algorithm, called "mkf-cuckoo," which combines the cuckoo search algorithm with the multiple kernel-based fuzzy c means algorithm. By integrating the mkfcm objective with the cuckoo search algorithm, we aim to efficiently identify optimal cluster centroids. We conducted comparative analyses using the iris and wine datasets, evaluating clustering accuracy, rand coefficient, jaccard coefficient, and computational time. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm achieved 96% accuracy in the iris dataset and 67% accuracy in the wine dataset.

Subsequently, researchers have focused on minimizing the sum of squared errors as the objective of the clustering process, leading to the development of improved algorithms such as the fuzzy c-means clustering, which utilizes fuzzy logic and membership functions to iteratively find the best centroids. The literature categorizes clustering algorithms into partitional clustering and hierarchical clustering, as well as presenting alternative clustering algorithms such as grid-based clustering, projection-based clustering, subspace clustering, and density clustering.

Optimization algorithms have also been introduced to enhance the clustering process, with researchers aiming to minimize the sum of squared error in clustering objectives using genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, bacterial foraging optimization, simulated annealing, artificial bee colony, and firefly algorithms. Some authors have also explored hybrid optimization algorithms and modifications to standard optimization algorithms, aiming to improve convergence in the clustering process by integrating k-means and fcm operators into their procedures.

Overall, the clustering process can be reformulated as an optimization problem, aiming to search for the best cluster centroids through iterative procedures. However, most algorithms use the same objective of minimizing the sum of squared distances between data objects, lacking effective functions for finding optimal centroids. In our work, we address this by introducing a more effective objective function, utilizing the multiple kernel-based fcm algorithm and hybridizing it with the cuckoo search algorithm to enhance the search for optimal centroids. The hybrid algorithm follows three key phases: initial solution encoding, clustering objective function, and the algorithmic procedure for mkf-cuckoo search.

To improve the efficiency of the optimization algorithm, the initial solution for the clustering process entails selecting random centroids from the input dataset. The objective function, based on distance minimization utilizing kernel-based distance and fuzzy membership functions, is employed as a fitness function. Once a new solution is generated, lower and upper bound conditions are checked to ensure the values fall within acceptable ranges.

Using the iris and wine datasets, we conducted analyses with varying cluster sizes and iterations. The results revealed an accuracy of 68% for the iris dataset with a cluster size of 2. As the cluster size increased to 3, 4, and 5, the clustering accuracy reached 89%, 95%, and 96% respectively, at the cost of increased computational time. Notably, the accuracy was higher for 10 iterations compared to 100 iterations. For the wine dataset, the accuracy was 67%, with the iris dataset demonstrating better results overall.

In conclusion, the hybrid mkf-cuckoo algorithm, which incorporates the cuckoo search algorithm with the multiple kernel-based fuzzy c means algorithm, proved effective in achieving optimal cluster centroids. Our study highlights the advantages of integrating the mkfcm objective into the clustering process and conducting experimentation on the iris and wine datasets. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm through comparative evaluations, achieving 95% accuracy in the iris dataset and 67% accuracy in the wine dataset. Looking ahead, future research may explore further modifications to the cuckoo search algorithm and effective objective functions.
