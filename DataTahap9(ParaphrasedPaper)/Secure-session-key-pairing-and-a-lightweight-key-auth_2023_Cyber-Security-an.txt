With limited resources, essential components of a drone network such as capacity, computing capabilities, and standby time are constrained. This network transmits sensitive and critical data between participating organizations over an unsecured communication channel. It is vital to ensure the integrity and mutual trustworthiness of all parties involved in order to maintain the confidentiality of the material. Given the limited capabilities of drones, it is not feasible to implement sophisticated multifactor authentication methods like fingerprints, bilinear map pairings, and digital certificates within the drone network due to the complexity of computations.

Furthermore, there is a need to minimize the computational and communication costs. In order to design a lightweight authentication mechanism for IoT drone deployments, researchers have developed an Authenticated Key Agreement (AKA) approach, using only hash functions and XOR operations (referred to as DRONE). Although comprehensive security verification of these AKA protocols using known cryptographic testing tools has not been performed, the schemes are lightweight and entail minimal high processing costs. Additionally, an asymmetric wavelet transforms pairing-based key agreement mechanism has been proposed for drone deployments, offering low-cost solutions.

However, these proposed schemes lack formal proofs of security. Additionally, a lightweight AKA technique for authenticating users and piloting drones in drone applications has been developed, using only fuzzy extractor and hash functions, resulting in lightweight properties with minimal memory overhead and computational and communication expenses. It is important to note that a powerful Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary could potentially launch a session-specific temporary information attack if they have access to all exchanged messages in the proposed authentication protocol.

To achieve compact encryption attributes, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is suggested due to its reduced keystrokes, lower memory consumption, and faster field arithmetic, making it suitable for developing public-key cryptography algorithms for resource-constrained devices like drones. The proposed system approach presents several advantages and can accommodate an increased number of drones as the drone network expands, thus necessitating the inclusion of ECC in the strategy. The proposed approach's validity and secrecy can be verified using the widely acknowledged automatic cryptographic protocol verification tool, ProVerif.

Moreover, it has been found that the OpenMote-B hardware platform requires time and energy for each hardware operation. The execution time for various cryptographic operations such as elliptic curve point multiplication and addition has been assessed, indicating the time taken for key generation, exchange of authentication materials, and computation of the final session key. Furthermore, the impact of the number of RF slots available in a time unit on the execution time of the given protocol has been studied, showcasing the significance of this factor.

In terms of power consumption, the proposed system's usage requires a negligible percentage of the battery capacity, making it almost insignificant. Additionally, the proposed mechanisms have been independently verified using the ProVerif tool. It is important to note that the proposed mechanisms guarantee unique session keys to prevent replay attacks and unauthorized construction of identification codes by multiple nodes.
