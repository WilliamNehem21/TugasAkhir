In other terms, contexts can be viewed as placeholders for terms, represented as c[.,...,.] to differentiate them from regular terms. These placeholders can be filled with appropriate terms to form new terms. While theoretical issues were addressed in part 1.1.3, little consideration was given to computational efficiency. PCF-programs are designed to generate constants of boolean or natural types, but they can be extended to operate on other collections, such as the set of real numbers. Traditional computation with real numbers involves floating point approximations, which, while suitable for everyday use, can be highly unreliable in specific situations due to round-off errors. This problem is often overlooked in practical applications. The concept of exact real number computation has been proposed as a reliable alternative to floating point computation, ensuring correct outputs and effective computation to any desired level of precision.
