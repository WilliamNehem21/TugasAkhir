Information technology (IT) governance serves a critical role in managing risks to ensure a secure environment for e-business and e-commerce. To support this objective, various IT organizations have developed different methods for managing risks, which have been partially or fully adopted by enterprises working in diverse fields to identify, analyze, and mitigate risks related to their IT activities.

This paper aims to introduce a comprehensive Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) framework tailored for enterprises employing IT. The framework's structural scope is based on the "STOPE" (Strategy, Technology, Organization, People, and Environment) approach, which is increasingly essential for structuring information security issues across its five distinct domains. The management process of the framework is aligned with the well-established Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) cyclic phases. Additionally, the framework incorporates management criteria for its structural aspects and includes evaluation tools for its procedural phases. It also enables the integration and enhancement of existing risk management methods and standards into its structural and procedural components. The paper highlights the importance of the framework as a potential open reference for enterprise ISRM.

Despite the proliferation of standard and commercial risk management methods, various reports, surveys, and related literature suggest that the adoption of current risk management methods within organizations has been limited due to factors such as lack of awareness, high cost, need for expertise, and lengthy processes. Additionally, low trust in these methods is attributed to poor results, complex reports, and a narrow technological focus. The abundance of more than 200 risk management methods further complicates the selection process for organizations, while the absence of a universally accepted benchmark or comparative framework hinders their practical use in evaluating information security risks.

The ISRM framework proposed in this paper consists of two main parts: a structural view and a procedural view. The structural view encompasses scope and criteria, while the procedural view includes process and tools. The framework will be further detailed in terms of these four dimensions.
