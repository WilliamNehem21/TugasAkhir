The paper demonstrates that although there are r.e. degrees that do not contain any schnorr trivial reals, the schnorr trivial tt-degrees are actually downward closed despite this. Previous research on reals that have low computational complexity according to the Schnorr criterion has resulted in a purely degree-theoretic characterization. The nth canonical serve is denoted as dn, and pruning the 11 branches of the existing tree at branching points is necessary. To maintain consistency, 0s should only appear in the final tree at its branching points, so if a branching point needs to be removed, the 01 and 00 branches at that height should be pruned, leaving only the 11 branch as before.

As mentioned earlier, the schnorr trivial turing degrees are not downward closed. Theorem 4.1 offers further support for the idea that the turing degrees may not be the most suitable framework for considering schnorr triviality, as it indicates that a computationally strong real could potentially have minimal computational complexity.
