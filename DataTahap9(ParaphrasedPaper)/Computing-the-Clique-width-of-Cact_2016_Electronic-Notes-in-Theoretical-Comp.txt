3) The process of creating edges and reassigning labels to vertices is frequently denoted by k, the number of labels used to construct the graph. These operations, collectively termed k-expression, are essential for constructing graphs, which in turn defines clique-width. This is akin to a tree-width, and every graph class with bounded tree-width also has bounded clique-width, as established by Courcelle and Olariu.

4) In order to calculate the clique-width of graph G, it is necessary to combine the labels. Let a and b represent the labels of the root and the remaining vertices of each tree, respectively, while c and d are available labels to be used. To form the k-expression of CN, we start with a common vertex v and label it as c(v).

We also analyze the time complexity of algorithm 2, which is the primary outcome highlighted in this paper. The complexity of algorithm 2 arises from the two nested procedure loops (lines 5 and 6) along with the invocation of algorithm 1 (lines 7 and 11). The first loop (line 2) exists outside the nested loops, and its complexity is assessed separately.
