The use of e-commerce has experienced rapid growth due to its perceived benefits, particularly in the business-to-consumer sector. However, concerns about trust in e-commerce have hindered its adoption by many consumers worldwide. There is currently a growing interest in addressing e-commerce trust issues from an Islamic perspective guided by Sharia law, given the need to cater to the over 1.8 billion Muslims globally.

In the context of e-commerce, an offer is considered as the initial proposal made by either the buyer or seller, and acceptance refers to the consent of the other party expressing agreement to the terms of the offer. While traditionally done verbally, Muslim scholars also recognize the validity of offer and acceptance through writing or electronic means, as applicable in e-commerce. However, the process of offer and acceptance must be connected, clear, and consistent throughout the transaction. The practice of lending money at a fixed interest, known as "riba," is prohibited in Islam, therefore the use of riba credit cards or interest-bearing payment methods, both offline and online, is forbidden.

Third-party assurance, which provides an endorsement of e-commerce vendors through seals of approval, trust marks, and other means, plays a crucial role in ensuring the trustworthiness of e-commerce systems. Islamic religious authorities can also serve as a third-party assurance body to certify the Sharia compliance status of e-commerce systems. Third-party assurance should encompass assurances on Sharia compliance, process, and technology to ensure customer privacy, transaction security, and trust in e-commerce.

The trustworthiness of an e-commerce system is influenced by factors such as integrity, competence, benevolence, and web quality. Trustworthiness is moderated by the religious commitment and trust propensity of consumers, as well as third-party assurances of an e-commerce site. Benevolence, which refers to the goodwill and concern of a trustee to act in the best interest of the trustor, is positively related to the trust that consumers have in an e-commerce vendor. Thus, the perception of the vendor's benevolence is positively associated with trust in e-commerce.
