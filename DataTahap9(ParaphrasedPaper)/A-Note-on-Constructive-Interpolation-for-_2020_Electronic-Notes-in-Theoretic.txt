Subsequent research later demonstrated the interpolation of all regular modal logics through amalgamation. This finding was later expanded to encompass multi-modal logics. In a separate study, Marx established the interpolation property for various modal logics using a technique based on bisimulation. This work also encompassed interpolation proofs for k, fibered modal logics, and multi-modal logics pertaining to knowledge and belief. In all of the aforementioned studies, interpolation was proven using semantic or algebraic methods. While these methods are broadly applicable to various logics, they do not provide a specific construction of interpolants.

The computation of interpolants can also be utilized in generating explicit definitions from implicit ones. We also presented a similar construction for proving the Beth definability theorem for KM. The ability to compute explicit definitions is known to be important in query rewriting algorithms, which have wide-ranging applications across various areas of computer science. Consequently, our focus on the complexity of interpolant size serves as a clear motivation for future research.
