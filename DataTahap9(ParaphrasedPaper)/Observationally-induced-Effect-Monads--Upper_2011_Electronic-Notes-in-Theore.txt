Alex Simpson proposed using an observationally-induced approach to model computational effects in denotational semantics. The key concept involves employing a single observation algebra to define the computational type structure. Simpson argues that this approach not only provides algebraic structure, but also enables the concrete characterization of monadic types. The paper demonstrates the existence of free observationally-induced algebras in the category of continuous maps between topological spaces for arbitrary pre-selected observation algebras. Furthermore, it utilizes this approach to develop both lower and upper powerdomain constructions on general topological spaces, which generalize the classical characterizations on continuous dcpos. The lower powerdomain construction for all topological spaces is defined as the space of non-empty closed subsets with the lower Vietoris topology, while the upper powerdomain construction for a wide class of topological spaces is the space of proper open filters of its topology with the upper Vietoris topology. Additionally, a counterexample is presented to illustrate that this characterization does not apply to all topological spaces.

The paper introduces the general definition of an observationally-induced free algebra construction and establishes the definitions within the category of continuous maps between topological spaces, although the abstract methods can, in theory, be extended to arbitrary categories.

The class of Wilker spaces encompasses Hausdorff spaces and locally compact topological spaces, making it a broad category. Counterexamples, such as the one described in Section 4.1, appear to have an artificial nature. Nevertheless, it is currently unknown whether the Wilker condition is upheld by the standard constructions of denotational semantics.
