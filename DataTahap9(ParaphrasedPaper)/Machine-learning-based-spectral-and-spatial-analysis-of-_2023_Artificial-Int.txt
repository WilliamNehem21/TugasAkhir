Forests play a crucial role in our ecosystems, offering a wide range of ecological, economic, social, and cultural benefits. However, the presence of invasive pathogens poses a growing threat to forest health. Managing these pathogens can be challenging and costly, especially when they are widespread or difficult to detect. Therefore, early and accurate detection of invasive pathogens, particularly those that are not yet widely distributed or are difficult to identify, is essential. Current disease detection methods typically involve visually assessing symptoms and confirming them through molecular analysis when necessary. However, visual assessment is labor-intensive and prone to errors, while molecular detection methods can be time-consuming, costly, and operationally limited.

In recent years, technological advancements have led to the development of new tools, such as spectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence, for rapid and precise plant phenotyping, including the early detection of plant diseases in both crops and trees. By combining traditional imaging with spectroscopy, spectral imaging can capture both the spatial and spectral characteristics of an object, allowing for the identification of subtle changes associated with disease development before visible symptoms appear.

To achieve this, the study utilized hyperspectral and multispectral imaging techniques. The study focused on averaging the spectrums of all the pixels in the leaf regions in order to calculate the averaged spectrum of a leaf sample. This involved several preprocessing steps, such as removing extreme wavelengths, smoothing spectra, and reducing the number of features. Furthermore, classification models built upon machine learning algorithms were employed to interpret spectral and spatial feature importance patterns. Linear support vector machine (SVM) models were used to measure spectral feature importance, while a ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) model was employed to generate class-specific feature heatmaps for spatial feature importance.

The study found that hyperspectral imaging had an advantage in detecting Dutch elm disease (DED) in the early stages of infection, before visible symptoms appeared, due to the rich spectral information it provided. Meanwhile, multispectral imaging combined with deep learning was advantageous in capturing symptomatic spots on the leaves once foliar disease symptoms had manifest because of its high spatial resolution images. The study also highlighted the innovative engineering design of the LeafSpec imaging system, which ensured high-quality imaging and laid the groundwork for further machine learning-based analysis.

Despite these findings, the study acknowledged its limitations. It was conducted as a proof-of-concept study with elm trees grown in a controlled environment, which may not fully represent real-world conditions. Additionally, the study only included four genotypes of American elms due to logistical constraints, and it is recommended that future studies should explore a broader range of elm genotypes to assess the model's generalizability and validate its applicability under varied environmental conditions. By broadening the scope of evaluated elm genotypes and testing in diverse environmental settings, there is potential to refine and extend the applicability of the proposed imaging solutions for advanced, accurate, and efficient DED detection and resistance screening in the future.
