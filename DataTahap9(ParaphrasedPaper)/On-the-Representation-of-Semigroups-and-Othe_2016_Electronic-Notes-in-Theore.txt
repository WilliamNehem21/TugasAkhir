It is evident that the conversion of a general to an individual can be achieved, as can the reduction of multiple arguments to a single argument through pairing. Furthermore, applicative action can be simplified to the semigroup action using the equation k(xy) = bx(ky) mod beta. Additionally, there is another form of reduction known as lambda i.
