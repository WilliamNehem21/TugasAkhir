The process of phagocytosis mediated by Fc receptors involves the triggering of a signaling cascade by antibodies, specifically immunoglobulin (e.g., IgG), which bind to the surface of infectious microorganisms to form a protective coat. This coat is recognized by specific Fc receptors on the surface of phagocytic cells, leading to the extension of pseudopods and the formation of a phagosome. The binding of ligands to the internalized particle occurs in a zipper-like fashion.

The model used quantitative biochemical data on CDC42p to explain the rapid turnover in Rho GTP-binding proteins using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. Based on this ODE model, a process calculus model is presented, allowing for the composition and extension of the ODE model. The process calculus model involves processes interacting through input/output actions, handshakes on channels, and parallel composition.

The values of certain parameters in the model are set, and processes are defined to interact on channels, receive and send messages, and evolve based on specific rates. GDI proteins were initially identified as down-regulators of GTP-binding proteins, but it is now understood that they also serve as transport proteins, shuttling GTP-binding proteins between membranes. GDI proteins interact with GTP-binding proteins to inhibit dissociation and hydrolysis of GTP, thereby facilitating the shuttling of Rho GTP proteins such as CDC42 and Rac to and from cellular membranes.

To capture the effect of GDI proteins in the cycle of Rho GTP-binding proteins, an abstract, hybrid model is introduced, reflecting current biological knowledge. Although quantitative data for the rates of the reactions is lacking, an initial analysis of the protein cycle behavior is presented by setting the unknown rates and varying the quantity of GDI proteins. The potential of SPiM as a tool for systematically exploring the parameter space for plausible rates is highlighted, with the aim of assisting in literature search and experimental data collection.

The long-term goal is to use the model as a generic representation of Rho GTP-binding proteins that can be integrated into larger models. The aim is to work closely with biologists to address the evolving and incomplete nature of biological knowledge and to develop useful process models of phagocytosis.
