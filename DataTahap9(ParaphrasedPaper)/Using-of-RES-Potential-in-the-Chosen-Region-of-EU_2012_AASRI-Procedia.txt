From the perspective of national economies, renewable energy sources (RES) represent domestic sources that have the potential to replace or significantly reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in the future. They are viewed as essential for safeguarding the national economy against the anticipated rise in imported fuel prices and the costs associated with addressing environmental damage. Furthermore, technologies that harness RES have minimal or negligible impact on the natural environment and typically produce little to no waste, thereby avoiding the generation of radioactive waste and decreasing the risk of major disasters. By leveraging these sources, it is possible to build a foundation for sustainable societal development in the field of energy, offering a more promising outlook for future generations.

Since each country possesses varying potential for utilizing RES, it is important to identify the most effective sources for a given country. Different types of RES may be more suitable for one country in comparison to another, largely due to variations in geographical conditions.

In Slovakia, hydroelectric power plants are projected to have the highest installed capacity in 2020, followed by wind power plants on the continent, photovoltaic power plants, biomass, and geothermal energy. Conversely, in the Czech Republic, photovoltaic power is expected to have the highest installed capacity in 2020, with water energy, wind energy, biomass, and geothermal energy following suit. Germany is anticipated to have the highest installed capacity in 2020 for photovoltaic power, followed by wind energy, biomass, water energy, and geothermal energy. In contrast, in Great Britain, water energy is predicted to have the lowest installed capacity in 2020, with wind energy holding the highest installed capacity, followed by biomass and photovoltaic power.
