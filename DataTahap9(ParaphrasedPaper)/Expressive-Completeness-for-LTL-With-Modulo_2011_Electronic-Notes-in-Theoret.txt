The group g is a finite collection of elements {g1, ..., gk, 1}, with g representing an element within the group. The identity of g is denoted by 1. We use the group operator to denote multiplication, and if the ordering of the group is known, we omit it from the subscript of the syntax. Additionally, we represent the logic for the sole use of the group as ltlgrp(g).

Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5 allow us to rephrase formulas containing nested past operators within future operators. It is worth noting that there are complementary lemmas where the past operator is substituted with the future operator, and vice versa. By leveraging these two lemmas, we derive a sequence of lemmas demonstrating that formulas in ltlgrp can be disentangled. These lemmas are established through induction based on the structure of the formula.
