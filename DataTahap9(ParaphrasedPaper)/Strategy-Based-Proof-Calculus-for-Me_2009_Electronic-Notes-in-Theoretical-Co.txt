This academic paper discusses the control mechanisms in membrane systems that are inspired by biological entities. Each membrane in the system may have its own control mechanism and a specific task, and all membranes must work together simultaneously to achieve an overarching goal for the entire system. The paper investigates the control mechanisms of maximal parallel rewriting (mpr) and maximal parallel rewriting with priorities (pri). Other control mechanisms defined in the literature for membrane systems include maximal parallel rewriting with promoters or inhibitors, minimal parallel rewriting, non-synchronized rewriting, and cooperative rewriting.

The proposed solution in this paper combines rewrite theories, strategies, and strategy controllers. A strategy controller determines which strategy is applied in the current state, and a control-free membrane is defined as the set of evolution rules within a membrane. The paper presents the structure and content of the sections, including the main notations and concepts related to rewriting logic, the description of why membrane systems are not rewrite theories, the presentation of the strategy-based rewriting logic for membrane systems, and an implementation based on the Maude strategy language.

The paper also discusses the concept of a rewriting strategy as an algorithm for defining a computation step induced by a set of rules, and the semantics of strategies are defined using a meta-equational logic (MEL) theory. The paper demonstrates that for each state and an appropriate strategy controller, a unique strategy is returned. The paper also identifies the Maude system as a promising candidate for implementing membrane systems due to its implemented strategy language and reflective language features.

The current implementation of the prototype focuses on handling and analyzing membrane systems using the mpr and pri control mechanisms. The paper asserts that the other features of membrane systems can be easily added to the existing prototype.
