The academic paper is organized into several sections. Section 2 provides an overview of related work, while section 3 formulates the research problem. Section 4 explains the fundamental concept of query optimization, and section 5 presents the design of various stochastic query optimizers. The design of cost coefficients and experimental setup is described in section 6, followed by a discussion of the results in section 7. The conclusion emphasizes the effectiveness of genetic algorithms as stochastic techniques that can produce high-quality solutions with low time complexity. Genetic algorithms operate on a population of individual chromosomes and employ heuristics such as selection, crossover, and mutation to improve solutions.

The paper introduces the design and implementation of different stochastic query optimizers, including Simple Genetic Query Optimizer (SGQO), Natural Genetics Query Optimizer (NGQO), Restricted Stochastic Query Optimizer (RSQO), and Entropy-based Restricted Stochastic Query Optimizer (ERSQO). Additionally, the paper discusses the design and functioning of various stochastic distributed DSS query optimizers.

After outlining the approaches used in the study, the paper highlights the challenges associated with exhaustive enumeration and discusses how stochastic query optimizers address these challenges. It is noted that while SGQO can provide optimal query execution plans for moderately complex distributed DSS queries, it may generate redundant chromosomes for more complex scenarios. NGQO aims to avoid redundant chromosomes but may lead to a low diversity problem. To address these issues, RSQO and ERSQO are introduced, with ERSQO combining the concept of restricted growth chromosome design and entropy to tackle the low diversity population problem.

The paper further presents a set of ad-hoc distributed DSS queries designed for the experimentation, focusing on a benchmark database called TPCDS, which is based on customer and sales data. These queries involve relational algebra expressions and consist of different numbers of join operations. The queries are executed on a distributed database comprising various relations.

The efficiency and performance of the different DSS query optimizers are evaluated using decision variables and cost coefficients to calculate the local processing costs (LP_costs), communication costs (CM_costs), total input-output costs (T_costsio), and total processing costs (T_costscpu) of a query. The experimental results show that increasing the replication rate from 20% to 90% can further optimize the total costs of a DSS query. The stochastic approaches, including SGQO, NGQO, RSQO, and ERSQO, are compared, with ERSQO demonstrating superior solution quality and consistent results compared to the other stochastic query optimizers.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive study of different stochastic query optimization approaches for distributed DSS queries, highlighting their impact on solution quality and time complexity. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches in optimizing the total costs of DSS queries, with ERSQO emerging as a particularly promising solution.
