After establishing the context and motivation, the rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines ontologies and domain knowledge representations, while Section 3 provides an overview of ontology-based database information retrieval. In Section 4, the paper examines findings related to ontology-based information retrieval, followed by Section 5 which reviews database schema to ontology schema transformation and ontology-to-database mapping approaches, focusing on aspects such as loss of data and semantics, structural mapping, and domain knowledge applicability. Section 6 discusses the potential of combining database-to-ontology transformation and ontology-to-database mapping approaches for relational query formulation. The paper concludes in Section 7 by outlining future challenges and possible research directions for utilizing ontologies in information retrieval from information and big data management systems.

Database information retrieval involves seeking information within databases, and the need for automation in this process has become increasingly important due to the growing volume of structured and unstructured information in various sources. Several visual information retrieval approaches have been developed to reduce the effort required by end users when interacting with databases, including form-based, query by example (QBE), and query by template (QBT) methods. While these approaches are effective for basic relational database queries, they do not support semantic data retrieval or facilitate the generation of complex queries.

To address the identified limitations, efforts have been made to enhance query formulation methods. For instance, the Quick (Universal Interface with Conceptual Knowledge) system automates query formulation by leveraging ER conceptual schema design knowledge. However, the ER model, commonly used for database design, may not store domain knowledge, limiting its effectiveness in expressing low-level query constraints. More recently, several ontology languages with well-defined semantics have been developed, and ontology-based approaches have been proposed to provide intelligent query formulation services for relational databases.

Various ontology-based visual query formulation systems, such as OntoQF, Visage, and SmartCh, use an ontology browser to visualize the ontology as a tree and enable search queries through concept selection or annotated keywords. Additionally, systems like the EU Translational Research and Patient Safety in Europe (TRANSFoRm) query and data extraction workbench provide interfaces for authoring, storing, and deploying clinical data queries, allowing users to define flexible criteria groups and handle complex queries.

The European TONES project offers access to relational databases through ontologies, establishing links between ontology concepts and relational data to enable data access. Similarly, other approaches aim to improve query answers by leveraging the semantic knowledge expressed in an ontology, transforming database queries using relationships between ontology concepts such as is-a, part-of, and sync-of.

Several ontology-based query refinement techniques have been introduced in recent years, including thesaurus ontology navigation, ambiguity-driven approaches, and information-need driven methods. These techniques enable end-users to interact with expansion terms based on concept hierarchies derived from domain ontologies and associated ontological schema.

The paper emphasizes the need for ontology-based query formulation approaches that leverage the assertion capabilities of ontologies and extend existing frameworks to integrate related domain knowledge for developing a unified domain ontology capturing all domain concepts across multiple databases. Additionally, the literature review reveals the scarcity of tools for directly specifying and manipulating ontology domain knowledge for query formulation, highlighting the potential for future work in this area.

The study also recognizes challenges related to ontology-to-database mapping, including issues arising from low similarity between ontology and database models, as well as limitations in existing mapping definitions. In this context, the paper reviews mature ontology-to-database mapping approaches and discusses the transformation from domain ontology to conceptual schema.

In conclusion, the paper identifies the need for knowledge-driven query formulation approaches that build on the assertion capabilities of ontology languages like OWL-DL, and emphasizes the importance of enabling domain experts to directly specify and manipulate domain knowledge in ontology servers. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for extending the scope of ontology-based query formulation to enhance information retrieval in complex data management systems and context-aware environments.
