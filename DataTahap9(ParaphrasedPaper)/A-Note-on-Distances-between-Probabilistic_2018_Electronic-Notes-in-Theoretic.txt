This paper examines metrics for probability distributions, distinguishing itself by comparing standard distance functions applied to classical discrete probability distributions and quantum distributions. Specifically, the paper focuses on the total variation distance for discrete probability distributions, which is a special case of the Kantorovich distance, and the trace distance for quantum distributions. Additionally, the paper delves into more systematic results regarding these distances in sections 3 and 4, where the logical reformulation of these distances in terms of validity plays a crucial role. The paper also includes concrete examples of distance calculations and describes metric versions of state-and-effect triangles that arise in effectus-theoretic descriptions of state and predicate transformer semantics for probability.

The paper further presents examples of defining quantum states in Python and obtaining the n-marginals of those states, with the observed pattern emerging from experiments. The subsequent sections of the paper take a broader perspective, examining the total variation distance in one section and the trace distance in the next.

In summary, the paper offers both specific distance calculations and general perspectives on these distances, covering both classical and quantum probability distributions.
