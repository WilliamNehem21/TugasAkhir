To address the aforementioned issue, our approach begins by creating models within the refinement calculus of object systems (RCOS) and subsequently verifying the system's real-time safety properties using the UPPAAL tool. The Telemedicine System (TMS), in conjunction with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, can be integrated into telemedicine systems to offer decision support services for decision makers, such as experts and doctors from different hospitals in various countries. RCOS was selected to develop TMS due to its support for both static structural and dynamic behavioral refinement of object-oriented systems, as well as its ability to effectively reduce system complexity by separating concerns. RCOS is based on a well-defined semantic model with a refinement calculus, including a precise notation for object-oriented and component-based design. As a result, formal techniques, including tools like UPPAAL, can be applied in the development process to ensure system integrity.

This paper is structured as follows: in the subsequent section, we introduce the class model and interaction model in RCOS. Section 3 details our approach to constructing TMS using RCOS. In Section 4, we verify the system using UPPAAL. Finally, our conclusions are presented in Section 5.

RCOS has been developed to support model-driven development methods, providing a multi-view modeling environment and integrating object-oriented and component-based design and analysis techniques. It effectively reduces system complexity and ensures consistency and correctness. In RCOS, a component is a fundamental concept, representing an implementation of a contract.

In the system, patient data is transmitted to the EHR data center to generate an EHR item. In EHR mode, doctors only need to select an existing EHR item. Once the generated or selected EHR item is analyzed by the system, reminders, evidence, and guideline links are provided to the doctor.
