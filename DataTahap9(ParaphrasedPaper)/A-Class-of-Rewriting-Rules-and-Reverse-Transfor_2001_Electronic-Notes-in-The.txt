The importance of atom patterns in determining the applicability and results of rule applications requires a suitable syntactic structure for representing the patterns, enabling precise and controlled instantiations. To achieve this, the concept of metaatoms is introduced, which have a structure similar to that of usual atoms, with the distinction that two types of meta-variables—&-variables and #-variables—are used instead of ordinary variables. These two types of meta-variables have distinct instantiation characteristics, allowing for precise specification of rewriting rules and enabling rigorous exploration of essential properties of various types of transformation steps, such as the correctness of expanding transformation and systematic generation of correct rewriting rules from a problem specification.

The primary focus of this paper is to establish an appropriate syntax for a wide range of rewriting rules, with the aim of defining the syntactic structure of the components of rewriting rules and their instantiations in a manner that facilitates precise specification of rule applicability and the outcomes of rule applications.

Another objective is to introduce the concept of reverse transformation and demonstrate that within the rbet framework, an et rule is reversible, meaning that it is possible to derive a rewriting rule whose operation reverses that of another rewriting rule by syntactically reversing the latter rewriting rule, with the correctness of the former being contingent solely on the correctness of the latter.

Additionally, the paper discusses the regulation of instantiations when a rule denoted as r1 is replaced by another rule. This replacement ensures that any instantiation of the new rule is controlled in such a way that the #-variable #y can only be instantiated into an ordinary variable not present in the other part of the clause resulting from an application of the rule. This instantiation constraint prevents the instantiation of #y into the ordinary variable x when the rule r2 is applied to the first body atom of c1, thereby impeding the transformation of c1 into c3.

The importance of rigorous description of rewriting rules and their applications is stressed, with the assertion that precise conditions for instantiations of meta-variables in rule applications are necessary. These conditions should be general and consistent across all rewriting rules, without being specialized for any particular case.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the notions of &-variables and #-variables, defining them as meta-variables with specific naming conventions. The paper also discusses usual first-order terms and meta-terms, as well as their associated atoms and meta-atoms, and clarifies the standard notation for lists.

In conclusion, the paper addresses various aspects related to the syntactic representation of atom patterns and metaatoms, including the appropriate syntax for rewriting rules, the concept of reverse transformation, and the regulations governing instantiations of meta-variables in rule applications, emphasizing the need for rigor and generality in these representations.
