These methodologies serve as a set of tools for evaluating the performance of the studied information systems over a finite period of time, considering the presence of censoring. The analysis aims to determine the time between system failures and the number of...

The focus of the research is to examine the impact of artificial threats to information security (ATIS) on the information security protection subsystem (ISPS) and to use the theory of Markov random processes for analytical description, as well as the theory of mathematical programming for formulating and solving the corresponding optimization problem. The main goal of the study is to formally characterize the optimal information security scheme (SIS) for the target information system.

As a result, the study aims to achieve the following objectives: to formally characterize the relationship between ATIS and ISPS in terms of quality metrics using Markov chains; to formulate an optimization problem for the composition of ISPS based on the mathematical framework obtained, ensuring that the target information system maintains functional status with a certain probability at any given moment; and to test the proposed method for optimizing the composition of ISPS in a real information system and analyze the outcomes.

The probability that a specific protective mechanism within ISPS counteracts the impact of a given ATIS is examined, with a set of vectors comprehensively characterizing ISPS's ability to mitigate various combinations of ATIS. It is also noted that multiple protective mechanisms can counteract a single ATIS concurrently, a phenomenon that can be described analytically.

The derived mathematical framework indicates that optimal SIS configurations include r2 and r4, while the relevance of r1 becomes evident for longer censored time intervals, particularly for critical applications of the information system. The foremost concerns in this context are reliable user authentication and the integrity of information resources due to stringent user and service control, reflecting the specific operational requirements of the studied system.
