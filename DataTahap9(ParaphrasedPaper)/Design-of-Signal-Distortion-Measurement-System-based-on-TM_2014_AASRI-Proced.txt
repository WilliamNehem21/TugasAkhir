In contrast to directly calculating the real Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), optimization algorithms for the real FFT reduce computation by almost 50% and also save memory space. Clearly, the RFFT optimization algorithm significantly improves computational efficiency, effectively doubling processing speed, and forms the foundational algorithms of our design.

The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) integrated within the digital signal processor (DSP) operates at a resolution of 12 bits, but the effective number of bits (ENOB) for sampling is less than 10, resulting in low sampling precision. To achieve higher precision in sampling, a clear demarcation between digital and analog power design is essential. This involves isolating the ADC input pin (ADCINXX) from the digital signal line and utilizing an external reference.

By implementing the signal distortion measurement method proposed in this research, a signal distortion measurement system with a refined FFT algorithm was designed and developed. Field tests demonstrate the feasibility of this method for measurement purposes, with notable success in mitigating spectrum leakage phenomena and enhancing measurement accuracy. Furthermore, the signal distortion measurement instrument utilizing the proposed method offers advantages, such as simplicity in construction, cost-effectiveness, portability, and resolves the inconvenience associated with field testing in engineering applications. This method exhibits promising practical applications.
