This academic paper aims to examine the satisfaction of vulnerable individuals with teleconsultation services, such as e-health assistance provided by healthcare professionals in their communities. The study includes an assessment of teleconsultation-based services offered to low-income and clinically vulnerable populations around the world, with a focus on monitoring, treating, and preventing COVID-19. Additionally, it explores ways to enhance services and provide treatment from a human rights perspective.

The research findings suggest that a distributed electronic health record (EHR) system offers advantages over a centralized EHR, particularly for individuals in urban areas who are accustomed to the central e-health system. However, the absence of a backup plan poses a challenge for the centralized EHR. As a solution, the study aims to develop an interoperable distributed system integrated EHR that utilizes loose coupling to make data more flexible, addressing these difficulties. The proposed framework also includes data recovery, specifically a Master Patient Index (MPI).

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of literature related to the problem domain, Section 3 outlines the system architecture and development phases, Section 4 discusses the experimental results and evaluation of the study, and Section 5 presents the conclusion.

The study draws on recent research on e-health systems to inform the development of an advanced approach to address current healthcare challenges. It highlights the development of an ICT-based approach for the treatment of chronic diseases, as well as the cost-effectiveness of telehealth and e-health services for primary care patients. The evolving nature of e-health services is attributed to the availability of smart devices and innovative health technologies.

The paper also reviews various methods and technologies related to distributed EHR systems, exploring their findings, outcomes, and limitations. The development of login modules for clients and local doctors is described, detailing how the system will act as a remote healthcare center for rural patients and the necessary components for service delivery.

The significance of interoperable distributed e-health systems in developing countries is emphasized, along with the role these systems play in addressing current healthcare challenges and promoting advanced and sustainable healthcare practices.

The study emphasizes the importance of developing distributed e-health systems to improve public well-being and healthcare outcomes while reducing costs. The potential benefits of distributed e-health, including remote interactions with patients, rapid access to medical care specialists, and remote monitoring capabilities, are highlighted, especially in the context of developing countries.

The experimental results highlight several challenges associated with the shift from hospital-based healthcare services to electronic healthcare services, including the need for organizational, cultural, and technical changes and support. The paper also underscores the challenge of implementing an incomplete health standard and the necessity for greater knowledge among rural doctors, patients, and health professionals to effectively utilize these systems.
