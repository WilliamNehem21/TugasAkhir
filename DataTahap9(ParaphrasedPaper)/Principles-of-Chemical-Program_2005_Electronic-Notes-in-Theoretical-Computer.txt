The concept of the chemical reaction metaphor has been a subject of discussion in academic literature, depicting computation as a chemical solution where molecules, symbolizing data, interact based on reaction rules. Chemical models employ the multiset as their fundamental data structure, with computation progressing through the rewriting of the multiset that consumes elements in accordance with reaction conditions and generates new elements based on specific transformation rules. While various formalisms such as multiset rewriting, the hmm-calculus, and the p-systems have been introduced in the mid-eighties since the advent of gamma, these models differ in properties and expressive capacities despite sharing a common paradigm. This paper aims to delineate the fundamental principles underlying chemical models, with the aim of establishing a foundational calculus encapsulating the core essence of the chemical paradigm, from which other extensions can be derived and compared to existing chemical models.
