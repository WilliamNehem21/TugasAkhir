The negative arc variables under consideration in this study are compared to other prime implicants. The correctness and completeness of the core are proven in Theorem 5.1 in the appendix, which demonstrates that a core is always derived from a prime implicant and that for any core, a corresponding prime implicant can be found. In the context of breast cancer, synthetic lethality highlights the importance of identifying drug targets based on network dynamics, where two genes are considered synthetic lethal if mutations in either gene alone are viable but mutations in both genes result in cell death. For example, in breast cancer, the BRCA/PARP pair represents a synthetic lethal partnership, with PARP inhibitors preventing DNA repair in BRCA-deficient cancer cells, leading to apoptosis. The presence of specific arcs is relevant to drug resistance mechanisms, as the deletion of these arcs may confer insensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis. Research has shown that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 attenuates DNA damage-induced apoptosis by PARP inhibitors, thus interfering with the synthetic lethality mechanism. However, there is currently no evidence confirming that p53 mutation provides resistance to PARP inhibitors. These findings suggest that abductive inference could enhance our understanding of drug resistance by providing insights into the role of necessary arcs.
