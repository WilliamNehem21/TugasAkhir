The intricate structure of the large coal-fired power generation system exhibits strong interconnections and nonlinear associations between energy consumption and external factors such as resources and load demand. To address this complexity, a fuzzy rough set (FRS) attribute reduction method was introduced to identify and retain the essential features related to energy consumption while eliminating redundant attributes. By utilizing the reduced attributes as input variables, this approach provides a valuable foundation for analyzing the energy consumption of the coal-fired power unit.

The coal-fired power generation system is comprised of numerous intricate subsystems, with intricate, high-dimensional nonlinear associations between various operating parameters. Understanding these relationships under different operating conditions and reconstructing the system's operating state enables the identification of optimal controllable parameters for the boundary conditions, leading to the formulation of operation optimization strategies. This comprehensive approach can be characterized as the analysis of complex systems modeling.

Consequently, the extraction of 10 attributes using the FRS attribute reduction algorithm provides valuable input variables. The findings align with theoretical analyses, highlighting the critical influence of unit boundary condition parameters on energy consumption. This methodology serves as a crucial foundation for further research on optimizing unit consumption characteristics and operating parameters.
