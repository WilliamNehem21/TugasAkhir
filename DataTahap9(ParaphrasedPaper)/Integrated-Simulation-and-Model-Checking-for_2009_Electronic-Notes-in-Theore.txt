The process of model-checking provides valuable insights into the behavior of biochemical systems by addressing quantitative queries that are challenging to answer through stochastic simulation alone. However, the computational complexity of model-checking can render it infeasible for large systems, and the finite state representation requires a priori bounds to be set for the numbers of molecules of each species in the system.

This paper introduces an approach that combines stochastic simulation and the Prism model checker to address these challenges. The stochastic simulation is used to identify reasonable bounds for molecular populations relevant to the experimental context, which are then employed to parameterize the Prism model and restrict its state space. Additionally, a simulation pre-run is utilized to identify time intervals of interest for model-checking when such information is not available from experimental data.

The primary objective of this work is to explore how the integrated use of stochastic simulation and model-checking can enhance the understanding of biochemical systems. Specifically, the paper investigates how to leverage the knowledge obtained from the simulation to enable feasible model-checking. The simulation results are used to establish sensible lower and upper bounds for the molecule counts of the species involved. Through a simple example, the paper demonstrates that the use of the estimated bounds accelerates model-checking significantly without introducing significant error.

The novel aspect of this paper lies in the two-fold integration of simulation and model-checking. Firstly, simulation is employed to bound the model-checking problem, and later, model-checking results obtained through both exact and approximate probabilistic model-checking are compared. The former method explores the full state-space of the model and employs linear algebra to solve the underlying Markov chain, while the latter uses simulation to address the model-checking problem within a satisfactory confidence interval.

Analyzing biological process models through probabilistic model-checking holds significant appeal, as it provides a thorough stochastic treatment of small-scale phenomena of interest to computational biologists. Unlike a single simulation run, the results computed by probabilistic model-checking offer a definitive answer without the need for repeated analysis and ensemble averaging. Furthermore, the use of a reward structure over the model enables the expression and evaluation of complex analysis questions through model-checking, thereby revealing significant temporal behavior of the system.

However, the probabilistic model-checking approach faces the challenge of state-space explosion, limiting its application to problems involving low copy numbers of species. Even in cases where all chemical species have low copy numbers, it is necessary to place a bound on the maximum molecule count for each species. For biochemical processes involving synthesis, establishing such bounds is often unfeasible. This paper describes the application of stochastic simulation to bound discrete-state models, thereby converting an unbounded model-checking problem into a bounded one.

The paper specifically focuses on the application to biochemical networks, which consist of species interacting through reactions described by kinetic laws. The quantitative behavior of a biochemical network depends on the initial values of the species involved and the kinetic parameters.

In some instances, bounds on the number of molecules can be derived from existing knowledge and experimental data. However, such information is often incomplete, making the derivation of bounds challenging, especially in cases with high variability among different experiments. The paper proposes using stochastic simulation to estimate the minimum and maximum number of molecules for each species, with the number of simulation runs chosen based on the variability of the specific system under study.

In conclusion, the paper presents a novel approach that combines stochastic simulation and model-checking to enhance the understanding of biochemical systems. The integration of these two techniques addresses the challenges posed by the computational complexity and state-space explosion associated with model-checking, ultimately providing valuable insights for the analysis of biochemical networks.
