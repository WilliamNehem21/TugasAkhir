Methods like active learning can be utilized to predict the properties of molecules or new compounds using limited data. Transfer learning enables the use of related prediction tasks' data for modeling, while active learning builds predictive models from minimal sets of informative training instances. These approaches are especially valuable in medicinal chemistry for addressing novel targets with limited compound information. Overall, there is significant potential for advancing computational methods that will have practical applications in the field of medicinal chemistry.
