Recent advancements in signal processing have led to a significant expansion in the field, primarily driven by the introduction of advanced algorithms. Moreover, there has been a growing interest among researchers in developing hardware-efficient digital systems. This article focuses on the development of a hardware-friendly powers-of-two finite impulse response (FIR) filter using the self-organizing random immigrants genetic algorithm (SORIGA). The study includes a comparative analysis of various multiplier-less FIR filters in terms of hardware complexity when implemented on an FPGA chip. The proposed design is evaluated and compared against several state-of-the-art powers-of-two FIR filters to demonstrate its hardware cost superiority.
