This scholarly paper explores the concept of double negative feedback in biological systems, which can lead to bistability and hysteresis. The authors discuss a module that may be responsible for the irreversibility of the start transition of the cell cycle. They conducted experiments on budding yeast cells to demonstrate bistability in the cell cycle, but the irreversibility of this transition has not been tested.

The paper presents an analysis of this module using probabilistic model checking and stochastic simulations on a simple budding yeast cell cycle model. The authors demonstrate that irreversibility can be eliminated by weakening the positive feedback loop. The paper proceeds with a brief description of a model of the budding yeast cell cycle, focusing on the cdk/cycb-cdh1/apc interaction. The authors then present a quantitative analysis of the stochastic model using probabilistic model checking, followed by the discussion of results obtained through stochastic simulation of the detailed model of the cell cycle.

Additionally, the paper includes blenx code obtained through the translation of ordinary differential equations and a description of the blenx language needed for understanding the model code. It also covers the declaration of rate functions and the generation of numbers using the leap-frog technique. The paper concludes with the presentation of the blenx code for the cell cycle model, which is composed of three files defining the model, declaring the functions, and defining the type definitions. Each element is defined through the let constructor, with proteins represented by bproc and their dynamic behavior encoded by a series of events. Further details on the translation from ordinary differential equations to blenx are available in related literature.
