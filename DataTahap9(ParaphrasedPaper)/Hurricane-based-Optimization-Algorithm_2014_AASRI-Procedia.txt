In order to solve large-scale optimization problems accurately, conventional optimization algorithms are not efficient enough due to the high-dimensional search space. To address this limitation, new optimization techniques have been developed, many of which are inspired by natural or man-made processes, with the primary objective of finding feasible solutions that are reasonably close to optimal.

However, these algorithms face a significant drawback in being susceptible to getting stuck in local minima. As a result, various other optimization techniques have been developed, such as the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA).

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a concise overview of hurricanes as meteorological phenomena, and delves into the concepts and ideas behind one particular algorithm in detail. Section 3 presents the experimental results, and Section 4 concludes the paper.

In the Hurricane Optimization Algorithm (HOA), wind parcels spiral outward from the eye, their velocities controlled by a predefined model. During this process, the wind parcels search for a lower pressure zone (i.e., a new eye position). When a new lower pressure is found, its position becomes the eye, and the process starts anew.

To validate its performance, HOA is tested using several benchmark functions of varying dimensions. The statistical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions. Future work should involve comparing HOA with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
