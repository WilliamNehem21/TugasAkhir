The study investigated the impact of various parameters on the oil yield of Terminalia catappa L. kernel (TCK) and examined the possibility of using TCK oil as transformer oil. The study employed response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model the solvent extraction process of TCK oil and determine its physicochemical properties. Gas chromatography (GC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffractometry were utilized to analyze the fatty acid compositions, functional groups, and crystalline structure characteristics of the oil and residue. The study utilized commercial ANN software and MATLAB R2017a to predict TCK oil yield using multilayer feedforward neural networks trained with incremental backpropagation. The optimal network topology was determined iteratively, and the predicted oil yields were compared with experimental values to evaluate the efficacy of the optimization methods. The models' significance was evaluated using p-values, and the differences in fatty acid composition were attributed to factors like geographical location and variety. Additionally, the study examined the physicochemical properties of the oil using standard methods like ASTM D97 and D93, and provided references on the use of RSM and ANN in modeling and optimization studies.
