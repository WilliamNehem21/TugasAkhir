A new approach to the semantic interpretation of multialgebras is presented in this paper, building upon classical findings related to algebraic theories. A notable discovery during the study was the identification of a straightforward method for representing derived operators in a multialgebraic specification using term graphs. The concept of sharing, inherent in the framework, allows for the immediate representation of both nondeterminism and domain-restriction, yielding an effective tool for specification within this context.

These conventions aid in understanding two fundamental operations on term graphs. The composition of two term graphs involves matching the roots of the first graph with the variables of the second graph, followed by the elimination of these variables. For instance, term graph g3 is the composition of g1 and g2. The union operation essentially entails the disjoint union of the term graphs, where the lists of variables and roots are concatenated. Term graph g4 illustrates the union of g1 and g2.

The subsequent lemma provides a summary of several findings regarding the existence of relevant pushouts and pushout complements, which are essential for executing the DPO construction in directed acyclic graphs (DAG) using rules in the format described above. Only plain morphisms are considered as matches (as per Definition 3.1) in consideration of Lemma 7.3.
