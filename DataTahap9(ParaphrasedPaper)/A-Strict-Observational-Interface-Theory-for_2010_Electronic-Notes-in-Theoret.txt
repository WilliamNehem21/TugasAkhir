Service-oriented computing is a widely accepted architectural approach for developing large, distributed software systems. One key advantage of such architectures is the ability to orchestrate services, combining them to create more complex functionality and generate new services. This paper focuses on the application-level protocol compliance checking of service orchestrations and service protocols using the semantic domain of modal input/output automata (MIOS). The authors introduce new concepts of refinement and compatibility based on a practical example and demonstrate that these concepts form a valid interface theory. They provide a framework for the application-level analysis of service orchestrations, complementing existing work on compatibility analysis. The paper also introduces the MIO workbench, a verification tool for modal input/output automata, to support their domain-specific interface theory.

The emergence of service-oriented architectures (SOAs) has transformed the enterprise software landscape, enabling open and standardized communication between individual, self-describing components known as services. Service orchestration, the composition of individual services to form a new service, is particularly important in this context. By leveraging techniques from the model-driven community, service-based systems can be modeled and transformed to platform-specific models and code.

Implementing a given protocol in a service orchestration is a complex task. The paper aims to assist developers by providing application-level protocol breach analysis, focusing exclusively on protocol actions and omitting lower-level implementation issues such as race conditions. Furthermore, the analysis of service protocols and orchestrations aims to ensure independent implementability, allowing for the seamless interchange of different services with the same protocol.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the fundamental notion of interface theories and modal input/output automata. Section 3 discusses the standard definition of weak modal refinement and its limitations, leading to the introduction of a refined notion tailored to the specific needs of the paper. The subsequent sections elaborate on the development and application of this refined notion in the context of service orchestrations and interface theories.

In addition to the focus on MIOS, the paper highlights the limitations of existing approaches in the industry, such as the semantic and analysis of web service orchestrations based on industry standards like BPEL, and emphasizes the need for early application-level verification as a precursor to existing approaches. The authors argue that existing approaches prioritize specific aspects of service orchestrations and do not fully address application-level verification. They propose a different approach, leveraging interface theories and the refinement notion unique to their work to enable more comprehensive application-level verification of service orchestrations.
