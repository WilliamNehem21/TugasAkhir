The literature has previously addressed the computability of compact sets and operators on compact sets (cf. [13, 15, 16]), as well as the complexity of certain compact sets such as Julia sets (see [2, 12]). However, the complexity of operators on compact sets has not received as much attention.

In the final section of this paper, we explore the computation of the convex hull of a compact set. We find that, in general, the complexity of the operator is exponential. We also establish a connection to the P=NP question for compact sets that are regular and simply connected. The proof of this connection is influenced by a similar construction in a related work, which considered, among other things, finding the maximum value of a real function.

For the study of complexity in examples, it is important to note that the numbers used in the definition above should be given in unary notation, meaning as a string of length n. Additionally, the grid bound b should be expressed in unary. Furthermore, oracle queries need to be formulated as specified.

The complexity result for the cross product can be demonstrated similarly, with the only modification being that for an input (n, (d1,.., dk+k')), we make the first oracle call with (n, (d1,.., dk)) and the second one with (n, (dk+1,.., dk+k')) rather than the identical queries mentioned earlier.

In the preceding section, we observed that the projection operator typically possesses exponential complexity unless the underlying set is convex. Therefore, computing the convex hull of a compact set is also expected to be a complex operation. We delve deeper into this issue, particularly as we were unable to extend the results for the projection to connected sets.
