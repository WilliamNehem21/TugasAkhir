Recently, several machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, have proven effective in identifying key parameters influencing oil and gas well production and predicting their production levels. These methods predominantly focused on medium-to-long-term production forecasts in the monthly or yearly units, with fewer applications in the daily production time series or abnormal monitoring of a tight gas field's entire lifespan. To address this gap, we propose a deep network prediction method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and compare its efficacy with traditional data-driven machine learning approaches such as random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR).

Decision trees (DT) are supervised learning algorithms that establish the best decision scheme by constructing a decision process and computing the corresponding mathematical expectation. However, they are susceptible to overfitting, leading to the use of ensemble learning methods like RF to enhance robustness. RF constructs numerous DTs through random sampling with replacement of the dataset to improve prediction ability while minimizing overfitting. On the other hand, SVR employs a linear function as its model function, constructing an interval band around the linear function and calculating the loss for data samples falling outside the interval band. This is executed using a specific loss function, and SVR also incorporates the kernel function method from support vector machines to extend into higher dimensional data space.

Recurrent neural network (RNN) structures, such as LSTM networks and gated recurrent units, have been proposed to overcome the challenge of long-term transmission of input. Traditional RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies due to issues such as gradient explosion or vanishing gradients, which are mitigated by the introduction of LSTM networks and gated recurrent units.

When analyzing gas well reservoir indicators, both static geological and dynamic production data are considered. Static geological data encompass factors such as wellhead position coordinates, depth, resistivity, sonic interval transit time, rock density, and shale content, while dynamic production data cover daily gas production, gas pressure, casing pressure, and production time under varying dates. This study focuses solely on daily gas production time series for the comparative analysis of different prediction methods.

Upon applying random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and DLSTM-FNN models to predict the daily gas production time series for 1692 tight gas wells in the Sulige gas field, it was found that DLSTM-FNN exhibited superior prediction accuracy, particularly in the testing set. Although RF presented a smaller error in the short training sample set, it demonstrated the largest error in the test set, whereas DLSTM-FNN showcased the best predictive performance.

The DLSTM-FNN deep learning model was evaluated for dynamic daily production prediction using 1692 time series of wells in the Sulige gas field, demonstrating strong time series modeling capabilities and outperforming other models. Its superior performance, accuracy, and reliability make it well-suited for dynamic daily production prediction in tight gas fields, with potential applications in other areas through transfer learning.
