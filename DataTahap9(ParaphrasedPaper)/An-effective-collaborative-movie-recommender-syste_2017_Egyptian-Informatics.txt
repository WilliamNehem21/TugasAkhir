The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a concise overview of prior research on collaborative recommendation systems and clustering-based collaborative recommendation. Section 3 outlines the proposed approach, referred to as the k-mean-cuckoo approach, for a movie recommender system. Section 4 presents the experimental results conducted on the Movielens dataset, and finally, Section 5 summarizes the article and highlights future directions for research.

The number of clusters ranged from 4 to 68. When the cluster count was 4, the mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.825169, and it decreased by 15% as the number of clusters increased to 68. This suggests that the MAE decreases as the number of clusters increases. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that increasing the number of clusters enhances the proximity between the objects within each cluster. Consequently, closely related elements are grouped together, leading to more accurate predictions. As the number of clusters increases, each user has more options for cluster assignment, potentially resulting in fewer users per cluster as the total number of users is fixed. The closeness between each user and their assigned cluster intensifies with an increasing number of clusters, thus lowering the discrepancy between the calculated and actual values, thereby reducing the mean absolute error.

A model's root mean squared error (RMSE) for predicting the estimated variable xmodel is defined as the square root of the mean squared error, where xobs represents observed values and xmodel denotes modeled values at time i. This calculation is then iteratively summed n times, and the result is divided by n before being raised to the power of half.

One potential drawback of the proposed approach is that if the initial partitioning does not yield favorable results, it may reduce efficiency. For future work, alternative nature-inspired algorithms could replace the cuckoo search algorithm. The most promising approach would be to identify clustering and optimization algorithms that offer optimal performance in terms of both accuracy and speed.
