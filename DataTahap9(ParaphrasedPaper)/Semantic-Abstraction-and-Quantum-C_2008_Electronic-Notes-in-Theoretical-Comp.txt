The Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, as demonstrated by various references, ensures a type of optimality for the abstractions created through PAI, representing the closest form achievable to the concrete semantics, with proximity being defined in terms of the norm-induced distance in the Hilbert space. Given its numerical nature, it provides an estimate of the information loss in the abstraction.

Generally, even when there is no uncertainty about the system's state, the specific observation (along with the associated state reductions) that will occur is left to chance among several possible options. The probabilities of particular observations are contingent on the observed state and its relationship to the intended observable O (see, for example, references [14, p99] or [18, p88]).

This formal model of quantum measurement, also known as projective measurement, relies on the ability to spectrally decompose observables, which involves finite-dimensional self-adjoint operators (see, for instance, reference [19, thm 10.21] for the general finite-dimensional case as well as reference [15, thm 5.2.2] for the general infinite-dimensional case).

We briefly review the Deutsch problem and the quantum circuit designed to solve it. For this discussion, we focus on a unary Boolean function, but the findings can be readily extended to the case of n-ary Boolean functions in the same manner as the generalization of the Deutsch algorithm to the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (as mentioned in various sources).
