The paper introduces new ways to measure and quantify cybersecurity issues aimed at supporting decisions related to mitigating vulnerabilities. The measurements are collected from various online cybersecurity repositories, with a focus on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repository, which compiles vulnerability reports augmented with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores. The paper points out potential biases in vulnerability-mitigation decisions that rely solely on CVE or National Vulnerability Database (NVD) records as primary data sources, particularly in cases where vulnerability properties evolve over time and in different deployment environments. Consequently, the paper proposes the inclusion of additional relevant data sources, such as manufacturer-provided data and online security reviews, to further enhance the existing CVSS scores.

The authors employed Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) to consolidate severity scores of vulnerability instances and generate ground facts for a machine learning (ML)-based vulnerability-severity computation algorithm. The approach uses training data from vulnerability repositories like NVD and SecurityFocus and suggests the incorporation of additional sources, such as CERT. A new query logic is also proposed to identify relevant vulnerability instances while excluding possible false positives based on specific keywords. The paper also describes a novel machine-learning-based structure for vulnerability assessment, which aims to reconcile compatibility issues of CVSS scores using a majority voting system within the proposed machine-learning model.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background and formally states the problem addressed, followed by Section 3 discussing vulnerability data sources, standard vulnerability-severity metrics, and related vulnerability assessment processes used in the CVSS mechanism. Section 4 introduces the vulnerability assessment prototype, while Section 5 presents the evaluation study of CPS vulnerability and related factors. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding remarks and discusses future research directions.

The paper further discusses the use of text-mining techniques in industrial blogs and research papers to extract relevant cybersecurity information. Additionally, it details the functionalities and features of various cybersecurity data sources, including CVE, NVD, SecurityFocus, and Shodan, while providing insights into vulnerabilities affecting industrial control systems and internet-connected devices.

The authors emphasize the need to consider multiple data sources for vulnerability assessment, as reliance on NVD scores alone can introduce bias due to potential errors in the manual scoring process. They propose a majority voting module to reconcile scores from different sources and calibrate severity scores based on property attributes.

Subsequently, the paper presents a vulnerability analysis case study of prominent CPS components, such as PLCs, RTUs, MTUs, and HMIs, with a focus on querying and filtering relevant vulnerabilities, computing CVSS v3 base scores, and analyzing statistical patterns of existing CPS vulnerabilities. The authors also discuss identified vulnerabilities in CPS infrastructure, presenting specific examples of vulnerabilities affecting industrial assets and providing relevant statistics.

In conclusion, the paper underscores the importance of enhancing vulnerability-severity scoring systems by reconciling inconsistent scores from various cybersecurity data sources and employing a majority voting technique to facilitate machine-learning model training. The proposed approach is demonstrated to achieve high accuracy and micro F1-score thresholds, and a case study involving CPS vulnerability reports from multiple repositories is presented to validate the vulnerability assessment model. The findings highlight the diversity of vulnerability patterns when relying on different cybersecurity data sources, underscoring the need for a comprehensive vulnerability analysis approach to enhance cybersecurity awareness.
