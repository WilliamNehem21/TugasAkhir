This academic paper introduces the concept of completely positive maps and discusses their construction. It also emphasizes the technical detail that the construction does not preserve biproducts, necessitating the need to work in the free biproduct to interpret classical types.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the definitions of various classes of dagger categories. Section 3 discusses the basic properties of idempotents and self-adjoint idempotents along with their splittings. Section 4 presents the cpm construction and introduces the interpretation of classical types as self-adjoint idempotents on quantum types. Finally, in Section 5, the paper explores various technical properties of idempotents in dagger categories and concludes by observing that the category cpm(fdhilb) of Hilbert spaces and completely positive maps does not satisfy the square root axiom of positive operators.

The paper also discusses a method for completing cpm(c) with classical types using the splitting of idempotents, which provides an operational interpretation and implementation of classical bits in terms of quantum bits. It highlights the significance of the unique square root axiom in fdhilb, and its physical interpretation in relation to the continuous evolution of nature.

The category cpm(fdhilb) is recognized as an important subject of study due to its role in finite dimensional quantum mechanics, as well as its significance in the denotational semantics of quantum programming languages and protocols. The interaction between classical and quantum entities is of particular interest, both at the level of morphisms (mixed vs. pure, completely positive vs. unitary) and at the level of objects (tensor vs. biproduct, simple vs. composite).

The paper makes progress in understanding this category by demonstrating that classical data types can be associated with certain self-adjoint idempotents on purely quantum types. It explores the theory of self-adjoint idempotents and their splittings within the framework of dagger categories, noting similarities and differences with properties of projections in Hilbert spaces, particularly concerning the square root axiom, which holds in fdhilb but not necessarily in cpm(fdhilb).
