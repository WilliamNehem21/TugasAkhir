Several attempts have been made to integrate defeasible reasoning into logics beyond propositional logic. After an initial exploration of preferential predicate logics by Lehmann and Magidor, subsequent investigations have focused on introducing notions of defeasibility in deontic logics and of defeasible subsumption for description logics. However, there is currently no widely accepted semantics for preferential reasoning in modal logics, along with a corresponding syntactic characterization.

The formal constructions in these attempts closely resemble those proposed by Kraus et al. and by Lehmann and Magidor, but they differ in that propositional valuations are replaced with elements of the set UN. In Section 4, an extended example is presented, including an instance of a modal preferential model.

Recent work by Casini and Straccia in the context of description logics has the potential to enhance the algorithm from an implementation perspective. They proposed a syntactic operational characterization of rational closure for the description logic ALC, but without providing a semantic counterpart. The algorithm, which draws on previous work by Lehmann and Magidor, Freund, and Poole, relies on performing a number of classical entailment checks (for ALC) and is easily amenable to implementation. It is evident from their description that the number of classical entailment checks required is quadratic in the size of the knowledge base under consideration.
