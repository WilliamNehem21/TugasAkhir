The function j(x, n) fulfills the principles of effective uniformity. We refer to the topology created by i(n, k) as the fine topology and apply the prefix "fine" to these concepts. We do not assign any prefix to concepts that are defined using the Euclidean topology.

In the proof of proposition 3.1 in [reference], the critical properties are those outlined in lemma 2.1, whose two-dimensional counterpart is lemma 3.2. Additionally, the fact that the complement of a finite (disjoint) union of fundamental dyadic intervals can be expressed as a finite disjoint union of fundamental dyadic intervals is essential. This fact also holds for fundamental dyadic rectangles. Consequently, we can establish the following proposition.
