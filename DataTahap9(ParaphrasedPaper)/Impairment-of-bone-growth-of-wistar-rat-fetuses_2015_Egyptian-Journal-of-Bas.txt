This research investigated the impact of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia on limb ischemia and bone cell differentiation in Wistar rat fetuses. The pregnant rats were divided into control, diabetic, and hypercholesterolemic groups. The fetuses of diabetic or hypercholesterolemic mothers exhibited delayed bone differentiation, as evidenced by histological and transmission electron microscopic examination, ossification, total calcium content, and electrophoresis. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have reported a reduction in bone formation and delayed fracture healing in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, experimental studies have shown that diabetes is associated with decreased bone formation, increased apoptosis of bone-lining cells, and reduced expression of osteocalcin and collagen types. Atherosclerosis, like diabetes, is closely linked to bone health, with factors involved in atherogenesis also influencing osteoclast formation and function. These findings suggest a potential relationship between atherosclerosis and bone health. The study was conducted in accordance with approved animal care and bioethics procedures.

The study provided insights into the impact of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia on bone cell differentiation in rat fetuses, shedding light on potential mechanisms underlying bone impairments associated with these conditions. The findings support the need for further research to understand the interplay between metabolic disorders and bone health, with potential implications for the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions.
