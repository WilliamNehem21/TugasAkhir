This paper provides an overview of the applications of direct search optimization methods in blackbox optimization over the last twenty years, with a specific focus on the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm. The article discusses applications of MADS in energy, materials science, and computational engineering design, as well as in other fields such as patents. The versatility of MADS is demonstrated through a wide range of applications, and the evolution of its accompanying software, Nomad, as a standard tool for blackbox optimization is highlighted.

An example is presented where the optimization of a design for a helicopter rotor blade resulted in a high failure rate, as well as an instance where the Aspen chemical engineering simulator failed during the optimization of a process to treat a toxic byproduct in aluminum production.

Additionally, the paper discusses the use of MADS for the optimization of materials performance, industrial processes, and the design of new materials, particularly in the context of determining optimal compositions, temperatures, and pressures for alloys that optimize material properties under certain constraints. Furthermore, the application of MADS in the design of innovative materials and the optimization of industrial processes for the production of primary metals is also highlighted.

The paper also addresses the challenge of determining low-cost phase change materials (PCMs) with good heat storage capacity, and presents a method for determining local minima of the liquidus surface to identify potential low-cost PCM materials. Furthermore, the application of MADS for metamaterials, specifically in adapting the spectral response and near-field interactions of split ring resonator metamaterials, is discussed.

The paper contrasts modern direct search methods with heuristics-based algorithms, highlighting the reliability and convergence theory supported by modern direct search methods. It gives examples of engineering design applications and optimization of nanoparticles to illustrate the effectiveness of direct search methods in solving practical problems.

In summary, the review emphasizes the evolution and wide-ranging applications of direct search optimization methods and MADS in various fields, showcasing their ability to handle complex blackbox optimization problems and produce reliable and theoretically supported results.
