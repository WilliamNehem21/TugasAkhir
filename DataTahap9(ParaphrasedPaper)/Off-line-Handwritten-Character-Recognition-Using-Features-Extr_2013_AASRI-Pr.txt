The primary determinants of the accuracy and effectiveness of an optical character recognition (OCR) system are the selection of the pattern classifier and the technique used to extract features. This study focuses on extracting features using a binarization technique to identify handwritten English characters. Recognition of the handwritten characters is accomplished using a multi-layered feed forward artificial neural network as the classifier. Additionally, various preprocessing techniques, including thinning, noise removal, cropping, and size normalization, are employed to prepare the character images for classification. Promising results are obtained when utilizing binarization features and a multi-layer feed forward neural network for recognizing off-line cursive handwritten characters.

The process of deciphering handwritten text from stationary surfaces is known as off-line cursive handwriting recognition. The emulation of human brain functionality in a machine for reading handwritten or printed text has created opportunities to enhance human-machine interaction. The classification of cursive and unconstrained handwritten characters has been a significant challenge in this research field for the past four decades.

Off-line character recognition is currently a dynamic research area. Compared to machine-printed character recognition, there has been limited research in the domain of handwritten character recognition, as noted by Apurva A. Desai. For instance, in 2002, Kundu & Chen utilized hidden Markov models (HMM) to recognize 100 postal words and reported an accuracy of 88.2%. In 2007, Tomoyuki et al. achieved an accuracy of 80.2% in recognition experiments involving 1646 city names of European countries. In 2006, Gatos et al. also contributed significantly to this area.

Binarization is a crucial image processing step in which pixel values are categorized as either white (background) or black (foreground) in a binary image. The objective of binarization is to minimize undesired information while preserving useful details and minimizing background noise.

The use of binarization features in conjunction with a neural network classifier utilizing back-propagation algorithm achieves an impressive classification accuracy of 85.62%. The quality of training samples, feature extraction technique, and the classifier are the primary factors influencing recognition accuracy. Furthermore, there is potential for refining these techniques to improve accuracy, such as exploring the combination of binarization features with other types of features, like projection profile features, in recognition experiments. In addition to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier, other classifiers such as radial basis function (RBF), HMM, and support vector machines (SVM) could be considered for future investigation.
