The situation becomes significantly more complex in the case of multiple errors, as the specific locations of errors and the structure of the circuit become influential. Consequently, the behaviors observed in the best-case scenario (where errors are independent) and the worst-case scenario (where errors are heavily masked) are markedly different. In order to gain a better understanding of the typical behavior exhibited by multiple errors, we turn to numerical simulations. These simulations suggest that the system exhibits behavior similar to the best-case scenario, where there is a high likelihood of failure to detect errors.

It is worth noting that a parallel line of thinking has recently emerged in the field of quantum computing, which shares many similarities with reversible circuits. Specifically, a verification scheme heavily reliant on simulation has been proposed in [citation] and further refined in [citation]. A similar theoretical finding has also been reported in [citation].
