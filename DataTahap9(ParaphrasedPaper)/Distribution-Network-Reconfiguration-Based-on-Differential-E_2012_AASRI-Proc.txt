Due to the reconstruction approach described in this study, all possible solutions are generated and a breadth-first search is conducted over the network prior to executing the load flow calculation. Not only does this method address the reordering issue, but it also involves a layered network in the search procedure, producing branch-level matrix B and node-level matrix N. With these details in mind, performing load flow calculations using the forward and backward substitution method should be straightforward.
