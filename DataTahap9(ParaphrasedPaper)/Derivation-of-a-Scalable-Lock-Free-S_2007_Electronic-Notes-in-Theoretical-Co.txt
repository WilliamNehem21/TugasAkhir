The paper demonstrates how a complex, lock-free concurrent stack can be created from an abstract specification through a series of verifiable steps. The resulting algorithm, which is a simplified version of the one proposed by Hendler, Shavit, and Yerushalmi, allows push and pop operations to be paired off and eliminated without affecting the central stack. This reduces contention on the stack compared to other implementations and enables multiple pairs of push and pop operations to be executed in parallel.

The study considers a system comprising a finite set of concurrent processes accessing a shared stack with elements of type t. Each process sporadically performs an operation on the stack and otherwise engages in non-stack-related actions. The system can be represented by abstracting away its non-stack behavior and focusing solely on its stack operations.

When a process p performs a stack operation, it initially attempts the operation on the stack as detailed in section 3. If this attempt fails, instead of immediately retrying, p endeavors to match up with a complementary operation to facilitate the elimination of both operations. If the elimination attempt is unsuccessful, p makes another attempt at the stack operation. This strict alternation between attempting the stack operation and attempting to eliminate may not always yield optimal performance, so it might be preferable to employ an adaptive scheme to determine, for each attempt, whether to proceed with the stack operation or attempt elimination. This approach is utilized in the implementation of a scalable lock-free queue.

The trypushelim and trypopelim functions are transformed similarly to the trypush and trypop functions as explained in section 2.2. To establish lock-freedom, it is necessary to demonstrate that an operation cannot continuously attempt elimination without ever attempting to perform its operation on the stack, as trypushelim and trypopelim can fail without another stack operation being completed.

This work highlights the convenience of the push operation having already constructed the node value. However, it also establishes a link between the implementation of the elimination mechanism and the underlying stack. Consequently, if the elimination mechanism is to be used with a stack implementation employing a different data structure, this part of the elimination mechanism would need to be modified.
