This academic paper explores the concept of pseudo-telepathy games, which are games designed for multiple players without a classical winning strategy, but with a winning strategy based on the sharing of quantum entanglement among the players. The paper highlights the difficulty of perfectly implementing a quantum winning strategy for pseudo-telepathy games, leading quantum players to make errors despite using a winning strategy. The study introduces a model for pseudo-telepathy games and investigates the impact of various basic noisy quantum channels on the quantum winning strategy for the mermin-ghz game. Furthermore, the paper addresses the question of the level of noise at which quantum players would still outperform classical ones.

The paper also delves into the potential of using quantum entanglement to solve distributed problems without direct communication between parties, focusing on problems for which this capability is absent in classical computing. While standard communication complexity models preclude the possibility of leveraging quantum entanglement to solve these problems due to the risk of faster-than-light communication, the paper explores the positive potential of using non-local correlations between inputs and outputs to address such problems. These problems are often referred to as pseudo-telepathy games in the context of game theory.

Moreover, the paper specifically examines the influence of quantum noise on the quantum winning strategy for the mermin-ghz game, providing a comprehensive definition of the problem. It proceeds to describe the mermin-ghz game, the quantum winning strategy, and the best classical strategy for the game. Subsequent sections of the paper focus on probing the effects of several basic noisy quantum channels on the quantum winning strategy for the mermin-ghz game.
