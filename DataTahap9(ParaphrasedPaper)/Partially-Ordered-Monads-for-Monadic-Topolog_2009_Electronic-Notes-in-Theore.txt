This paper demonstrates that partially ordered monads possess enough structure to model monadic topologies, rough sets, and Kleene algebras. It shows that convergence, as represented by extension structures over partially ordered monads, incorporates concepts of regularity and compactness, leading to the development of a compactification theory. Additionally, the paper explores the modeling of rough sets in a generalized setting using set functors, and it presents examples of using partially ordered monads for constructing monad-based instances of Kleene algebras with various set functors, expanding beyond strings and relations.

The introduction of the concept of partially ordered monads and their utilization within extension structures is attributed to [13, 14], with subsequent considerations for compactifications. While topology and convergence have been influential in motivating the development of partially ordered monads, the paper highlights their utility in other domains, demonstrating their ability to model rough sets in a generalized setting and contribute to a generalized notion of powerset Kleene algebras, extending beyond strings and relational algebra. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces partially ordered monads, Section 3 discusses topology and demonstrates how extension structures enable compactification constructions, Section 4 presents rough sets in a categorical framework, Section 5 examines Kleene algebras and their link to partially ordered monads, and finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

The historical significance of Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories in the study of adjunctions and monads is also acknowledged. Furthermore, the paper explores the generalization of cauchy structures through extension structures, thereby enriching basic triples to become partially ordered monads, which in turn can facilitate compactification constructions of related limit structures. The paper also discusses the relationship between categories of compact topologies and separated compact filter limit structures.

In conclusion, the paper emphasizes that partially ordered monads enrich monads with an order structure powerful enough to generalize convergence, rough sets, and Kleene algebras. It also foresees the potential of rough and Kleene monads for applications in programming languages, decision support models, formal logic, and uncertainties, highlighting the importance of composing partially ordered monads in addition to composing monads.
