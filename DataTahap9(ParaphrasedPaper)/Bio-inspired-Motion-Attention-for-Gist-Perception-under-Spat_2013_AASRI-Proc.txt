This paper examines the impact of motion on the human visual system. The study employs electroencephalogram (EEG) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to demonstrate that the middle temporal area (MT) is sensitive to motion perception. It establishes connections between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), primary visual cortex (V1), and medial superior temporal area (MST), and identifies parallel and circular feedback mechanisms between these areas. The majority of neurons in the MT area exhibit preferences for specific motion directions and angles, with instantaneous firing rates ten times higher at specific phases compared to other phases in individual neurons. Neurons that respond similarly to certain features can form synchronous clusters. The paper also introduces a computational motion field model that mirrors MT neuron activities and offers partial explanations for attention selection mechanisms and visual perception. However, the study notes the necessity for further research on neuronal interconnections and correlations.

The paper aligns with three criteria for human visual perception: sparse criteria, temporal slowness criteria, and independent criteria, focusing specifically on motion cues based on the sparse standard. The sparse criteria indicate that most neurons exhibit relatively low responses to external stimuli, including visual, auditory, and olfactory signals, with only a small number showing distinct activity. Furthermore, the paper outlines the importance of these characteristics in dimensional deduction and feature extraction in visual system research.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the model and algorithm, offering a comprehensive description of the algorithm. Section 3 presents the experimental findings, and Section 4 provides the conclusion and comparison with other state-of-the-art models.

The design concept of the model centers on motion intensity cues, spatial cues, and temporal cues, alongside their impacts on motion saliency mapping. For instance, the capture of a 135-degree vector may indicate proximity to object edges or still conditions. The paper outlines a method for calculating a phase histogram in spatial windows and defines evaluation methods, including precision, recall, and F-measure, to assess the performance of the proposed model.

In conclusion, the paper focuses on motion cues and their influence on the human visual system. The study's results are generally satisfactory, and efforts are underway to simulate the effects of motion in both the top-down and bottom-up pathways, recognizing that individual agents in the real world may yield different outputs.
