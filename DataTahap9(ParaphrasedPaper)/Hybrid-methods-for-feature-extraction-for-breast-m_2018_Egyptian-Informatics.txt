This paper focuses on the development and evaluation of feature extraction methods for identifying malignant masses in mammograms. It introduces seven texture features for the GLCM method and proposes their application on sub-images to improve performance. Additionally, it presents three hybrid methods—wavelet-ct1, wavelet-ct2, and st-glcm—that merge different types of features. The study implements these methods using MATLAB and tests them on two widely used mammogram databases, namely the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database. The performance of the proposed methods is compared and analyzed, and support vector machine (SVM) classification is employed to classify suspicious regions of interest (ROIs) as masses or normal cases. The paper emphasizes the importance of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems in reducing diagnostic errors and enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of radiologists' diagnoses. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methods in improving the accuracy and sensitivity of mammogram classification. Furthermore, the study highlights the need for further research on merging wavelet and contourlet features for feature extraction in mammogram classification. It also discusses the significance of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as key measures of performance in this application. Finally, it underscores the importance of choosing appropriate kernel functions for SVM classifiers and describes the process of parameter tuning and evaluation using cross-validation.
