At the beginning of operation, an induction motor typically draws a significantly higher current than its steady-state value, often around five to six times greater. This elevated current persists until the motor attains its rated speed, usually taking anywhere from a few seconds to up to a minute. This heightened current draw results in a decrease in voltage known as voltage sag.
