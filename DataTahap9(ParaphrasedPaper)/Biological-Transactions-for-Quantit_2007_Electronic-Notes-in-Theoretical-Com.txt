The standard definition of head normal processes needs to encompass all potential prefixes, not just the input and output, as there exist other prefixes. The selection of the head normal form is influenced by biological factors, as each channel in the sum denotes a distinct motif or site in the molecule. It's important to highlight that unlike here, it does not encompass a subset of designations for describing homodimerization reactions (i.e., reactions between two identical reactants). This aspect will be elucidated further when the reduction relation is presented. The process t[p] signifies the enactment of name t described by the internal process p, while processes outside the transaction are termed external.

The "par" rule addresses four distinct types of action. If l= comm(x) and l=(t: start), the condition actt(q)= 0 is introduced to ensure that no transactions are present in the process q. This requirement ensures that actions within the transaction take precedence over the external ones, thereby fulfilling certain desired properties (refer to section 3). Each subcase is described as follows. 

When l=(t: start), it signifies the initiation of a transaction. This necessitates tallying processes congruent to those implicated in the reaction, a task performed by the countt function. The rate associated with the prefix aligns with that of the entire reaction.
