In the field of automata, we adopt an alternate approach as outlined by Gastin and Oddoux. In this approach, transitions are made from one state to a combination of states, and each state can have multiple transitions that are chosen in a non-deterministic manner. This method effectively represents a combination of different states reached from a particular state.
