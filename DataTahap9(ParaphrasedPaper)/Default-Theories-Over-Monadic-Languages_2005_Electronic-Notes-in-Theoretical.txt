The academic paper is structured in the following manner. In the subsequent section, we review the notation and some fundamental outcomes that are utilized throughout this paper. Section 3 demonstrates that expansions for default theories over monadic languages are not contingent upon the size of the underlying infinite domain. Lastly, in Section 4, it is shown that assuming domain closure, expansions for uniterm default theories are independent of the size of the underlying domain. Consequently, it is permissible to confine the analysis to a deliberately defined finite domain.

The provided definition of expansions for open default theories is an adaptation of definition 2.2 to Herbrand b-interpretations with a limitless set of new constant symbols b. The rationale for transitioning to a semantic definition is that, generally, it is infeasible to depict a Herbrand universe utilizing standard proof theory. The only exception is when the theory domain is explicitly finite, i.e., includes axiom(2).
