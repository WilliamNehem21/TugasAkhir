Compactness is a theorem established by Alaoglu-Bourbaki and can be referenced in [6, theorem 8.5.2]. The remaining statements in (i) can be derived from standard duality theory, which can be found in [6, chapter 8.5]. The assertions in (ii) and (iii) are commonly known in the theory of locally convex spaces.
