The mobile market has been experiencing rapid growth, and cloud computing has extended into the mobile domain. As a result, mobile cloud computing has emerged as a new area of interest. Cloud computing involves the provision of virtualized IT resources as a service over the internet. Users can access and utilize IT resources such as software, storage, servers, and networks as needed, with the ability to dynamically scale resources in real-time based on service load and pay for their usage accordingly.

The importance of authentication and data security in cloud computing technologies is addressed in this section. Lim categorized authentication into eight different categories in his paper, and Traian Andrei also referenced Gartner's categorization. These classification schemes are vital for ensuring the security of individuals' or enterprises' data. Particularly in cloud computing, ensuring the availability of the entire system is crucial when handling large volumes of data. Hence, appropriate encryption methods should be employed. Additionally, in the event of a disruption to the key-stored server, preventing unauthorized access to data necessitates the study of key management. Emphasizing the significance of fault tolerance and data recovery technologies is essential for preventing service interruption or data loss in the event of an incident. Examples of cloud service discontinuation and data loss underscore the importance of ensuring these mechanisms function properly. Security guidelines for cloud computing, as recommended by Gartner, include privileged user access, regulatory compliance, data location, data segregation, recovery, investigative support, and long-term viability.

The Ubidata project proposes data processing and synchronization to address these challenges, utilizing a sophisticated architecture and algorithms for hoarding, synchronization, and transcoding. This approach aims to ensure continuous data availability regardless of user mobility and disconnection, as well as the type of mobile device and its data viewing/processing applications. Manuele Kirsch-Pinheiro presents a context-based filtering process for adapting awareness information delivered to mobile users by collaborative web systems. This filtering process relies on a context model integrating physical and organizational dimensions, allowing for the representation of the user's current context and general profiles. These profiles describe potential user contexts and express rules for filtering awareness information based on user preferences, functioning in two steps: identifying applicable general profiles and selecting awareness information based on the current context.

Although there are no specific security technologies unique to cloud computing, existing IT technologies can be divided and applied to each component of cloud computing. Access control and user authentication represent security technologies used for platforms. Access control regulates processes in the operating system to prevent unauthorized access to other processes. Discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), and role-based access control (RBAC) are common access control models. User authentication technologies include ID/password, public key infrastructure (PKI), multi-factor authentication, single sign-on (SSO), mobile trusted module (MTM), and i-PIN.

The aforementioned user authentication security technologies have inherent weaknesses which are briefly examined in this section. For instance, ID/password authentication, while simplistic and user-friendly, requires a certain level of complexity and regular updating to maintain security. Public key infrastructure (PKI) relies on public-key cryptography for authentication, enabling parties to authenticate each other based on certificates without needing to share secret information. However, managing and inspecting the client-side process in a PKI structure is challenging.

This paper delves into user profiling, comprising user information and service information sections. The user information section stores personal details such as name, interests, and hobbies, while the service information section records the services used, including service names and providers.

The paper focuses on access control and user authentication as security technologies within the cloud computing environment. Misuse of access privileges or leakage of personal information used for authentication could have more severe ramifications in the cloud computing environment compared to a standalone system. Effective user authentication in the cloud computing environment requires a combination of the aforementioned technologies or the development of a secure user authentication method tailored specifically for cloud computing. Subsequent research efforts should aim to design and develop an appropriate user authentication service model and protocol for cloud computing.
