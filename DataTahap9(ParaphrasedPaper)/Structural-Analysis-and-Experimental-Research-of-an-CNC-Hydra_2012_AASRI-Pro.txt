The lower part of the frame is fully constrained according to the actual circumstances. Two reference points, with restricted degrees of freedom allowing rotation only around the x-axis in the local coordinate system, are positioned at the centers of the left and right plates of the tool carrier and connected to two holes. To eliminate rigid displacement of the tool carrier, translation constraints in the y and z directions are applied to the contact point between the cylinders and the tool carrier in the global coordinate system. The frame bed-body is meshed with tetrahedral elements, while the beams and tool carrier are meshed with hexahedral elements.

Fifteen points are positioned along the static tool apron and connected to its underside and front. Shearing forces and shear thrust are applied and divided into 16 load steps. The inheritance between forces is removed by setting in the load manager to ensure that the forces take effect in their respective steps. 

In step 1, when the shearing force and horizontal thrust are not yet applied, the minimum stress occurring at the throat fillet is 71.71 MPa, while the minimum displacement occurring at the top of the front vertical plate of the frame is 0.1634 mm.

A comparison of the results of the analysis and the test indicates that there are discrepancies of around 20% due to environmental influences at the test site. For example, the shearing force is calculated based on a traditional empirical formula, resulting in a larger value than the actual value and leading to higher shear stress in the subsequent finite element analysis. Overall, the data fall within the permissible range except for individual testing points. The conclusion can be drawn that the aforementioned finite element method is reliable, and the calculated maximum stress of the throat fillet is consistent with the actual working conditions.
