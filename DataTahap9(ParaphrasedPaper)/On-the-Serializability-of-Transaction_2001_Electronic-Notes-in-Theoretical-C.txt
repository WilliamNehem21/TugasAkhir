The javaspaces platform also enables the use of transactions, where multiple coordination operations can be combined into a single atomic operation. This paper evaluates the correctness of javaspaces' transaction semantics using serializability as a measure. It is demonstrated that serializability is achievable only when restricting the operations to output, input, and read, while it is not achievable in the presence of test for absence or event notification. An alternative semantics is proposed and proven to support serializability.

Additionally, the javaspaces specifications incorporate a locking mechanism for transactions, where an entry read by a transaction is added to the set of entries read and is visible only within that transaction, in order to ensure the serializability of transactions. Active transactions are identified by unique names, and mechanisms for ensuring the global freshness of names are briefly discussed.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the interaction of transactions with read, take, and write operations, and presents a problem related to the serializability of transactions when test for absence operations are involved. It also introduces new labels for write operations and discusses rules and adaptations related to these new syntax elements.
