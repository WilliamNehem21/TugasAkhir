This academic paper discusses methods that depart from the uniform selection of the next state and instead introduce bias based on the number of traces, states, or transitions reachable through each successor. These methods rely on techniques for counting and uniformly selecting words in regular languages, as per the work of Flajolet et al., and implemented in the CS package of the MuPAD environment. These techniques exhibit linear complexity in the size of the underlying automata, enabling the handling of large models. 

Two primary approaches have been developed for counting and uniformly selecting combinatorial structures: the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and the recursive method, as detailed by Flajolet et al. The latter is particularly efficient for a broad class of structures but has limitations in dealing with systems exceeding 10^4 states. The paper introduces the motivation for generating traces of composed models to handle up to 10^27 states and more.

Large models are typically obtained through the composition of smaller ones, with parallel compositions being a significant source of state number explosion. The paper illustrates how uniform random walks in the components can be used to conduct approximate uniform random walks in the global system.

The paper emphasizes the need to maximize the minimum probability (pmin) without compromising the randomness of the method. It mentions that maximizing pmin may result in favoring a specific path, thus yielding deterministic behavior.

The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of the presented techniques in simulation, model-based testing, structural testing, and model checking, and reports encouraging initial results in these areas. The common theme across the discussed methods is their reliance on powerful techniques for counting and uniformly selecting combinatorial structures.
