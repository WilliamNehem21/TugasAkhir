Traditional informal proofs typically employ the principle of bound variable capture (BVC). In this particular case, we can adopt a similar approach by utilizing our induction principle, which provides us with a distinct binder y that is fresh in the context nj. With these freshness premises in place, we can effectively apply lemma 2.9 on substitution composition and thereby conclude this proof through the subsequent steps.
