This research paper investigates the use of two different distance measures, euclidean distance and divergence distance, for fuzzy c-means (FCM) in the context of image classification. The conventional FCM algorithm only utilizes mean information from an image block for feature extraction, while the FCM algorithm with divergence incorporates both variance and mean information. Results from evaluations on a set of Caltech databases demonstrate that the divergence-based FCM yields higher accuracy compared to conventional algorithms using euclidean distance. 

The study also compares these methods with the SOM and k-means algorithms. The fusion of FCM and divergence measures is expected to enhance feature extraction and improve the accuracy of the classification scheme for image classification. The proposed classifier, known as D-FCM, calculates and updates parameters at each application of each data vector, akin to the gradient-based FCM. This method is noted for its iterative application and updating of center parameters, which was reported to be advantageous.

The experimental results indicate that the divergence-based FCM outperforms the conventional FCM and SOM, which rely solely on mean information as their features for image data. It is concluded that the divergence information of image data is crucial for image classification, and a classification scheme that incorporates both mean and divergence information is superior. However, further research is warranted to develop a feature extraction method that can address the confusion between motorbike and airplane data.
