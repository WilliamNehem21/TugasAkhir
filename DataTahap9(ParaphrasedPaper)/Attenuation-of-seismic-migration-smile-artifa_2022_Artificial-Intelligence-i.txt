Artifacts in migrated seismic data can stem from multiple sources such as acquisition geometry, noise, non-primary wavefields, the migration algorithm, or errors in the velocity model. Abma et al. (2007) discuss artifacts arising from the Kirchhoff migration algorithm, irregular azimuth distributions, and acquisition gaps. Both aliasing and non-uniform sampling contribute to artifacts during seismic data processing. Ongkiehong and Huizer (1987) identify binning error as the most significant error in seismic acquisition due to non-uniform sampling. While irregularly spaced traces are accepted by Kirchhoff migration, artifacts occur when the sampling is irregular across all dimensions. Acquiring more data is a potential solution, but it may not always be feasible. Nemeth and Schuster (1999) propose that least-squares migration can help mitigate artifacts resulting from irregular sampling in Kirchhoff migration. However, this solution was prohibitively expensive at the time.

In addition to costly options like improved sampling and least-squares migration, there are more economical processing solutions available to address migration artifacts. Hale (2011) introduces a structure-oriented bilateral filter to manage migration noise. Masjukov and Shlyonkin (2015) suggest a 6D filtering approach for suppressing migration artifacts based on dip decomposition in common offset volumes and semblance-type measure computation via offset for constant dip-gathers. Lou and Simpson (2019) present a dip filter aligned with the local velocity model in VSP migration, which preserves true dip structures and suppresses migration artifacts.

Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the matter can be gained from the summary provided by Dumoulin and Visin (2018). The original U-Net, initially used for biomedical image segmentation, has found applications in geophysical segmentation tasks such as salt segmentation, first break picking, and reflection-diffraction separation (Markovic et al., 2022; Zwartjes and Yoo, 2022).

The authors propose applying their workflow to migrated common offset sections or pre/post-stack migrated stacks, where reflections exhibit local geology and migration artifacts manifest as upward convex hyperbolic shapes. The objective is to train a neural network to identify and extract these hyperbolic migration artifacts while suppressing the smoothly varying background reflectivity. This parallels the approach described by Fomel et al. (2007), who aimed to remove smooth reflection data using plane-wave destruction filters for separation of downward convex diffractions from migrated common offset sections. Deep neural networks have the advantage of being more powerful than plane-wave destruction filters for this task, provided a diverse training dataset can be created. A novel aspect of their approach is that the synthetic events in the network may mistakenly predict steep slopes as migration signals, even when they originate from reflections. To address this, additional characteristics of migration smiles are added to the synthetic data, including weak amplitude relative to the reflection and an apex location tangential to the reflection.

Conventional techniques for migration smile separation can be computationally burdensome and challenging to parameterize. A deep learning-based workflow may offer a simpler and faster alternative, although a common issue with deep neural networks is their ability to generalize to data different from the training dataset. The authors highlight that creating training data through physics-based modeling, followed by migration, limits dataset variation. This approach uses a single, fixed wavelet for wavefield modeling, restricting data variation. Mitigating this limitation requires repeating the modeling with numerous wavelets, which is computationally demanding and therefore not a practical solution.

To improve the generalization of the network, the authors train it to handle migration smiles at various offsets and incorporate a mix of narrow and wide hyperbolae within the same training examples. Although this deviates from physical realism, it appears to positively impact the network's generalization. Similar practices are observed in other machine vision problems, where non-physical distortions applied to input data have been found to enhance the network's ability to predict data not used during training.
