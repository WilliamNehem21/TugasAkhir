This academic paper refers to a concept known as observational coalgebra, which is used to represent a set X. Two important properties of observational coalgebras are identified: strong extensionality and relative finality. Strong extensionality is essential for a proof principle on observational coalgebras, while relative finality is crucial for the coinductive definition of constants and functions on observational coalgebras.

The concept of observational coalgebra is quite abstract and challenging to work with. To address this, the paper introduces the more tangible notion of a complete set of co-operations. The paper first defines the concepts of a cosignature and a co-operation, and then establishes criteria for when a given set of co-operations is considered complete.
