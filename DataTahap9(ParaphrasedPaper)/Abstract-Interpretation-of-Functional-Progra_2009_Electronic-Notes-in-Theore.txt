The paper presents an algorithm for abstract interpretation of an intermediate language in a Haskell compiler, written in Haskell, which computes approximations of possible values for all program variables to optimize the object code. The analysis is carried out by gathering constraints on variables and solving them through fixpoint iteration. The constraints accumulate as potential values of unknown functions become known, and are collected by augmenting the abstract syntax tree using an attribute grammar based preprocessor for Haskell. The paper introduces this preprocessor as well.

In a simple implementation, the function reference could be a tag, and a specific evaluation function performs case distinction on this tag. An alternative encoding proposed by Peyton Jones et al. is where the tag is a pointer to the function's code, resulting in the evaluation of a closure being reduced to calling that code. However, this operation is costly on modern pipelined processors as it stalls the prefetching pipeline. Hence, Boquist suggests reverting to the simple encoding to avoid the overhead of calling the evaluation function.

For pruning, it is essential to know the possible tags for each closure, which requires a global control flow analysis. Boquist outlines an algorithm for this abstract interpretation, and the paper provides a complete implementation used in their experimental Haskell compiler.

The implementation is presented by providing the actual code and utilizing a preprocessor for Haskell that allows for the use of concepts derived from attribute grammars. This simplifies the code presentation, and the paper includes a description of this preprocessor as well.

The paper aims to:

1. Describe the key features of the preprocessor and explain how they address five identified problems.
2. Define the abstract syntax of the language using a syntax declaration, generating corresponding data declarations and a custom fold function to overcome a specific problem.

The paper also introduces the sem rules specifying that attributes a tree node inherits should be passed unchanged to its children. The preprocessor automates the copying of attributes with matching names, as well as synthesized attributes passed up the tree. It also discusses a slightly modified version using syntax declarations for the ag preprocessor, but does not provide a concrete syntax for the language since Grin programs are only an intermediate representation.

Additionally, the paper describes an abstract interpretation algorithm that solves a set of constraints through fixpoint iteration, which are first collected by traversing the tree representing the Grin program. The abstract interpretation reveals the possible tags a variable can refer to, the locations a pointer can point to, and the possible tags for nodes and their parameters. It also addresses potential cases involving variables and nodes, and it outlines a comparison with a different approach using asf.

The paper concludes by noting that the information obtained from the abstract interpretation is detailed enough to inline eval and apply expressions as intended. However, the optimizations depend on more transformations in the compilation pipeline that have not yet been implemented, so the effectiveness of the optimizations remains to be seen.
