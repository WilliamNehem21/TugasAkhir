We investigate the translation of CK natural deduction proofs into IK natural deduction proofs, with both CK and IK being intuitionistic analogs of the basic classical modal logic K. Since the proof theory of these logics generally employs different techniques, our translation can be seen as an effort to reconcile these two approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate that this translation can be extended to CS4 and IS4, and we propose a framework that facilitates a modular approach for all the intermediate systems.

Developing a coherent proof theory for modal logic, whether classical or intuitionistic, has proven to be a complex challenge due to the diversity of modal logic. While there have been several recent proposals addressing this issue, such as those found in [15, 6, 18, 11] and related references, achieving a modular and uniform framework remains difficult.

This report is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the natural deduction systems NCK and NIK and discusses their key properties; Section 3 demonstrates that the modal rules of NCK can be viewed as derived rules in NIK, meaning NCK proofs can be embedded into NIK proofs; Section 4 extends this result to CS4 and IS4; and Section 5 explores a modular approach for all systems between CK and IS4.

Regarding the modal operators, we delve into the four rules in more detail, focusing on the overall rationale behind each rule and explaining the substitution lemma. Furthermore, we establish that CK is a fragment of IK, meaning every theorem of CK is also a theorem of IK. We illustrate how the additional rules work through an example, and we discuss the implications of the proposed embedding.

In this technically-oriented note, we present straightforward observations about two classes of natural deduction systems for intuitionistic modal logics, referred to as C and I systems. We note that C systems, such as NCS4, attempt to accommodate numerous features in a single modal rule, making a modular approach challenging. However, by adopting a different approach, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving a perfectly modular class of C systems through the proposed embedding into the class of I systems.

While I systems enable a detailed analysis of C systems, they may be less flexible in some respects. We ponder the potential restriction of relational assumptions to the empty set or a singleton set, and propose exploring indirect criteria via a transformation of I system derivations into C system derivations as a future research avenue.
