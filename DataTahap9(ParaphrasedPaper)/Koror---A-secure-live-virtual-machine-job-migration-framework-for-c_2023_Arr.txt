The potential for security threats exists across different areas, including data plane, control plane, and migration plane. Attackers may use passive and active techniques to compromise live migration, leading to performance degradation and posing a significant risk to the overall platform.

Securing cloud infrastructure has become increasingly complex as organizations transition their core business functions to the cloud. The traditional network perimeter has been compromised, leading to new security challenges and threats. Organizations are now sharing responsibility for controlling their data and applications with cloud providers.

Improving the security of live VM migration while ensuring efficient operation is a critical research gap. Key issues include reducing migration time, minimizing service interruption, and enhancing migration security. A novel framework incorporating a vTPM agent, along with additional components, is proposed to ensure secure live VM migration in real-time.

Current provisioning and deployment frameworks often involve storing VM and application images and data in unencrypted form or under the control of service providers, posing security risks. Research proposes new scheduling algorithms to optimize performance during wide-area migration, considering factors such as storage I/O workload, temporal and spatial location, and popularity characteristics of individual VMs.

The approaches to live VM migration are classified into three classes, with specific requirements to protect against key migration attacks. Secure live migration platforms need to incorporate mutual authentication, encryption, and mechanisms to prevent various active and passive attacks.

A framework is proposed to improve the security of VM tasks, including virtualization and virtual networking layers, addressing data integrity issues. Additionally, access matrix and integrity properties such as the simple-security property are utilized to restrict state transformation and ensure system security.

Utilizing a vTPM agent can help mitigate the risk of compromising guest OS and reduce the exposed attack surface. Furthermore, ensuring the secure deletion of data from each VM during migration is essential to protect against potential attacks.

Overall, the research emphasizes the importance of addressing security concerns in various aspects of cloud migration, including live VM migration. It also highlights the contributions of researchers like Professor Gutierrez and Roopak Sinha, who have made significant advances in internet of things security, networking, and information security.
