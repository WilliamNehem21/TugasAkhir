One variant of the Fixed-Charge Transportation Problem (FCTP) is the Step Fixed-Charge Transportation Problem (SFCTP), where a fixed cost is incurred for each route used in the solution. In the SFCTP, the fixed cost is proportional to the amount shipped, resulting in the objective function behaving like a step function. Various methods have been developed to address the FCTP, such as the Lagrangian relaxation method, heuristic approaches, genetic algorithms, the more-for-less algorithm, the branching method, and the adaptive genetic algorithm spanning tree-based.

Section 3 of this paper provides a review of previous methods for solving SFCTPs. In Section 4, the paper describes the main architecture of the proposed MAI algorithm and the proposed mutation functions, while Section 5 conducts a parametric analysis for the proposed mutation functions. Section 6 presents numerical experiments with the proposed MAI algorithm, and finally, Section 7 reports the conclusion and outlines future work.

The Artificial Immune System (AIS) treats solutions as antibodies, with candidate antibodies evolving based on their matching degree to the antigen, which represents fitness. The better the match between antibodies and antigens, the lower the mutation degree of the candidate antibody. Owing to its self-organizing and learning capabilities, AIS has been widely applied in various real-world complex applications, including job shop scheduling problems, multi-objective programming problems, and the fixed-charge transportation problem.

In this paper, an alternate mutation-based Artificial Immune (MAI) algorithm is introduced for solving SFCTPs, and a comparison of its performance and quality with earlier proposed methods, such as BAL, KOW, ALT1, ALT2, and ALT3, is undertaken. The proposed shipping procedure allocates transported units based on orders resulting from the decoding procedure, ensuring the validity of specific constraints. Additionally, the paper introduces a set of mutation functions designed to enhance the solution's quality, which are tested using various problem dimensions.

The paper then details the characteristics of 16 mutation functions, each designed to improve the quality of the solution. These functions are based on various parameters such as time, fitness of the solution, and non-uniform factor, and they incorporate a level of randomization to facilitate escape from local optima. The performance of the MAI algorithm is calibrated through the discovery of the best mutation function from the 16 implemented functions, using relative percentage deviation to compare the scale of objective functions in each problem.
