The traditional energy detection (ED) algorithm was analyzed in the study. The study found that the detection capability of the algorithm is reliable for a large number of antennas (similar to the transmitter and receiver count), a wide range of received primary user (PU) signal, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above 15 dB. However, limitations were identified, including increased cost with more antennas, constrained PU signal range under certain conditions, and decreased detection capability at SNR levels below 15 dB. Additionally, the researchers noted that the ED algorithm's performance is notable for 5G-MIMO communication system under specific conditions, such as using 2 transmitter antennas, 4 receiver antennas, SNR above 15 dB, and QPSK mapper type. The study also investigated the threshold effect of the ED algorithm in MIMO communication systems, observing superior performance in terms of detection and false alarms, except for SNR below 5.6 dB.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the 5D signals considered, including F-OFDM, FBMC, and UFMC waveforms. Section 3 describes the sensing of these signals achieved through the recommended mathematical model based on the hybrid filter. Section 4 introduces and discusses the obtained results, and Section 5 presents the conclusion.

Moreover, the study discussed the significance of the sample count (n) and the challenges associated with determining the appropriate number of samples for accurate detection. It also highlighted the limitations of the squaring technique at depleted SNRs and the associated trade-offs with sensing duration extension.

Lastly, the paper summarized that the proposed MIMO sensing system for centralized cooperative users has better detection performance than the system for only one user, particularly for F-OFDM and UFMC waveforms.
