Many cryptographic implementations, such as the openssl library, typically do not include a built-in feature for verifying the success of decryption using a given decryption key. However, in numerous applications, it is assumed that this verification is available, often achieved by adding a publicly known token to the plaintext before encryption, which allows for checking if the decrypted output also contains this token.

The assertion that only the initial components of pairs can be decrypted is not overly strong, as the majority of theories with rules of this nature are not convergent. It should be noted that if 'e' is an independent convergent subterm theory, then 'e+' is also an independent convergent subterm theory.

When viewed as a collection of known terms, the analysis often contains redundancies. For reasons of complexity, we aim to consider the smallest subset of the analysis from which the complete analysis can be reconstructed using appropriate contexts. The initial step towards this objective is to provide the following definition of cores.
