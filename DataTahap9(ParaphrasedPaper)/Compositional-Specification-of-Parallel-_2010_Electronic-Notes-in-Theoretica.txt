The # component model is designed to leverage a component-based approach to software development for creating high-performance computing applications targeted at parallel distributed architectures. This paper introduces a method for specifying # components using circus, which enables reasoning about the functional and behavioral properties of components and their composition. Additionally, it allows for partial code generation through successive semi-automatic refinement steps. The # component model extends the compositional approach of circus, enabling the creation of new circus specifications and widening its applicability.

The rise of parallel architectures, such as clusters, grids, and multi-core processors, has led to increased interest in high-performance computing applications. Consequently, these platforms have attracted significant investments from the software industry. However, the demand for peak performance from programmers necessitates a good understanding of HPC techniques for parallel and distributed programming tailored to specific computer architectures. This has limited the development of general-purpose parallel programming across widespread platforms.

The # component model was developed to enhance the practice of creating HPC parallel software and is designed to be deployed in a pool of computing nodes on a parallel platform while addressing non-functional concerns. This was realized through the design and prototyping of the HPE programming system, which is based on the # component model and employs a framework architecture recently proposed.

Implementing parallel programs is often error-prone, especially when dealing with synchronization bugs in low-level message passing libraries such as MPI. This is particularly challenging in scientific and engineering application domains due to the complex interactions involved in high-level mathematics simulations. Furthermore, ensuring the correctness of computations poses a significant challenge for non-specialist programmers. The authors propose that formal methods could be a valuable tool for addressing these issues.

This paper presents an approach for specifying # components using circus and outlines the rationale for choosing circus. This constitutes an initial step towards integrating existing tools for working with circus specifications with HPE, aiming to enable the translation of behavioral aspects of # components specified using circus into Petri nets. This integration would provide an environment for analyzing formal properties, evaluating performance, and safely implementing parallel programs. Moreover, the paper introduces a new modularization technique for circus specifications, intended for the incremental construction of large-scale specifications.

The # component model introduces several new concepts to achieve expressiveness in describing parallel programming abstractions and to provide the necessary level of abstraction independent of parallel platforms and their supporting infrastructures. The paper devotes a substantial section to formally describe and introduce the # component model, assuming basic knowledge of parallel program structure and employing a simple example to illustrate the idea of # components and their composability. The paper proposes components that are inherently parallel and demonstrates how they can be combined to form new components and applications recursively.

The example presented in Section 2 aims to provide intuition about the decomposition of a parallel program based on concerns, as this is a key principle of the # component model. It illustrates the transition from a process-based decomposition of a parallel program, common in current parallel programming practices, to a concern-oriented decomposition more closely aligned with software engineering artifacts. The paper introduces a model of # components that supports the principles described in the example and allows for the extraction of other properties about the model.

In contrast, conventional component models might be seen as programming systems with a single defined component kind, such as a.NET assembly, a Java bean, or a CCA component. In a # programming system, a library of primitive # components and/or facilities to build them from scratch is provided based on the semantics of different kinds of components.

Practical # programming systems often categorize units of # components as actions, such as units of synchronizers and computations in HPE. Action units denote operations that must be performed in a particular order. A # component may consist of both action and non-action units, and action units may also address non-functional concerns. The paper outlines an approach for giving programmers linguistic abstractions to describe the order in which action units are activated, promoting separation between coordination and computation and presenting the # component model as a coordination model for parallel components.

The alignment with the syntax of circus supports the notion of overlapping composition operations, specifically the join and fold combinators. The paper also proposes syntactical extensions to circus to accommodate overlapping composition operations, with a case study in Section 4 illustrating these ideas.

Furthermore, the paper introduces a technique for specifying enumerated units, relevant for representing parallel programs in single program multiple data (SPMD) style. The approach allows for the integration of circus specifications of # components using the join and fold combinators to form new components. It emphasizes the importance of cocones and colimits in defining the semantics and understanding the fundamentals of composing systems.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive approach for specifying # components using circus and introduces the # component model, a novel method for describing parallel programming abstractions. It also underscores the potential of formal methods and the significance of category theory in the context of software engineering and parallel computing.
