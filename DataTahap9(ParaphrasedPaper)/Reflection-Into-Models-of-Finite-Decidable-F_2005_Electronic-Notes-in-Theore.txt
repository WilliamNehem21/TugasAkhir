As a result, we will focus on the smallest category in which the diagrams of s commute. This category is obtained by taking the quotient of the morphisms cat(s)1 of the free category cat(s) that is generated by the sketch graph g (as described in) under the diagrams of s, which is made possible by proposition 2.2.

A similar reflection can also be demonstrated for finite, decidable lex-sketches that are internal to an arithmetic universe by constructing more intricate trees. It is indeed possible to investigate the existence of the reflection for a broader range of finite product sketches within an arithmetic universe or its variations. It is our belief that within a locally closed arithmetic universe, the reflection should hold for internally generic finite product sketches, as in this paper, the property of the sketch's decidable finiteness was primarily used to quantify over a subset of sketch arrows.
