The software tools FlowJo, LabFolder, PlateDesigner, and PlateEditor have the ability to create randomized layouts, but none of them are equipped to produce layouts that are truly effective. While it is possible to generate multiple random layouts and then assess them in order to select the best one, this approach does not guarantee the selection of effective plate layouts, regardless of the number of layouts generated.

Additionally, it has been noted that while replicates can enhance precision, they do not sufficiently address systematic bias. In general, the impact on estimations of adding more doses is greater than adding more replicates, irrespective of the layout. Effective layouts tend to yield more accurate results even with fewer replicates or fewer doses.

In addition to accommodating the desirable properties of effective microplate layouts, various practical constraints have been integrated into the software. For instance, the software enforces that all concentration levels of a given sample replicate must be present on the same plate. Technical replicates can appear on the same plate, on separate plates, or a combination of both. The dimensions of the microplate, in terms of the number of rows and columns, are incorporated as parameters, allowing for the use of different plate sizes. Furthermore, the software also enables the specification of the number of empty rows and columns at the border of each microplate to mitigate edge effects.

Simulation experiments were conducted using 40 384-well microplates, each containing a specific allocation of positive and negative controls, as well as random samples with varying hit rates. The data from these experiments were processed and analyzed using various regression methods to correct errors and normalize the results. The study concluded by referencing the work of Geibinger, Mischek, and Musliu on constraint programming for real-world industrial test laboratory scheduling. This approach was highlighted as a potentially relevant method for addressing the challenges in generating effective plate layouts.
