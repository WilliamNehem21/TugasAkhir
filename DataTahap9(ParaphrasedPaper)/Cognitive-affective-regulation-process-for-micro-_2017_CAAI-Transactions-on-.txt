This paper investigates the process of emotional state transition, with a focus on how the emotional state of interaction objects affects this process. The authors highlight that cognitive reasoning processes and micro-expression recognition form the basis of affective computing adjustment, and they propose the use of threshold and attenuation functions to quantify emotional changes. Furthermore, the emotional states of the robot and external stimuli are quantified as transfer probabilities, and a Gaussian cloud distribution model is introduced to calculate emotional transitional probabilities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in regulating emotional states in human-computer interaction, as well as enhancing the humanoid and intelligent abilities of the robot. The model aligns with the psychological significance of experimental and simulation findings, enabling the robot to move beyond mechanical emotional transfer processes.

Micro-expressions, which are brief facial expressions not under voluntary control and are used to conceal true emotions, have been identified and studied by researchers such as Haggard, Isaacs, Ekman, and Friesen. These micro-expressions are associated with self-defense mechanisms and the suppression of pent-up emotions.

The paper also delves into the cognitive model as the basis for processing personal information and reasoning. The authors assert that emotional state changes can be inferred from various factors in a given circumstance, including those related to the individual and their environment. The authors also introduce the concepts of antecedent-focused emotion regulation and response-focused emotion regulation, drawing on Gross's process model of emotion regulation, which includes cognitive reappraisal and the suppression of expression.

A theoretical framework is put forth, positing that each basic emotional state has an activation threshold (m) and a saturation threshold (n). Stimulus intensity below m has no effect, while intensity above m activates the emotional state. When emotional intensity reaches the saturation threshold, it peaks, but it typically fluctuates between emotional states of varying intensities, with the robot able to switch among these states. The authors propose using a Gaussian cloud distribution to construct the robot's emotional state transition model.

The authors observe that the robot tends to avoid certain people, places, or things in order to regulate its emotions. They also note that the weak facial muscle contraction associated with micro-expressions results in a very low-intensity emotional state in the stimulating space. It is suggested that these findings provide valuable insights for the development of emotionally intelligent robots.
