This academic paper presents a control flow analysis method for statically approximating the dynamic behavior of processes expressed in the beta-binders calculus. The analysis aims to describe the essential behavior of each box within a system, tracking all possible variable bindings and inter-box communications. By offering a basis for establishing static checks of biological dynamic properties, the analysis can be applied to model the interaction between a virus and cells of the immune system.

The paper suggests that biological systems can be abstractly modeled as concurrent systems, and their behavior is often represented by a transition system, which is computationally challenging to explore due to its size. To address this issue, static techniques can be used to reduce computational costs when modeling complex biological systems. The static analysis of the system specification at compile time enables the extraction of possible behaviors, laying the groundwork for static checks of biological dynamic properties. The paper demonstrates the capability of the analysis to establish simple properties, such as the absence of interaction between two boxes or the isolation of a box.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the beta binders formalism, Section 3 introduces the control flow analysis, Section 4 discusses potential applications of the analysis, and Section 5 demonstrates the analysis through an example. The paper concludes in Section 6 with an evaluation of the approach.

The paper acknowledges the undecidability of predicting at compile time whether the communication between x(y).q1 and xz.q2 will occur at runtime, as the binder x could be hidden or unhidden depending on the last interface operation. In the analysis, such communication is predicted as possible.
