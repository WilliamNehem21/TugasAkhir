The use of stemming is widespread in natural language processing systems, and the development of an effective stemmer is crucial due to its direct impact on the performance of applications. Stemming Arabic terms is particularly challenging given the language's complex inflection and derivational structure.

This paper introduces the new broken plural rule (BPR) algorithm, which includes new rules and the subset rule algorithm, to develop a root-based approach for Arabic stemming. The study aims to combine an Arabic stemmer with the BPR algorithm, supported by appropriate terms and conditions. The paper is organized as follows: relevant works are covered in section 2, the ISRI works are detailed in section 3, and the methods used in this study are described in section 4. Additionally, experiments conducted to validate the suggested algorithm are presented in section 5, and the analysis and comparison of the proposed stemmer with other Arabic stemmers are provided in section 6. The conclusion is presented in section 7.

The paper also discusses the concept of a stopword list, which consists of words that have no semantic meaning and only serve as syntactic operations. These words have significant effects on various natural language processing applications, such as information retrieval and text categorization. Furthermore, the paper mentions the development of a new Arabic light stemmer to improve the precision of existing algorithms.

In addressing the challenge of stemming broken plural words in Arabic, the paper describes the development of new rules for stemming broken plurals in accordance with accurate Arabic grammar. The new BPR algorithm is applied to the original ISRI stemmer, resulting in the ISRI+BPR stemmer. Experimental results demonstrate the success of the BPR development and its effectiveness in improving the performance of root-based Arabic stemmers. The paper concludes by discussing potential future extensions of this approach to all Arabic derived names.
