This research article presents an expansion of a class of globally convergent evolution strategies to address general constrained optimization problems. The proposed framework handles relaxable constraints using a merit function approach combined with a specific restoration procedure, and handles unrelaxable constraints using either an extreme barrier function or a projection approach. Under reasonable assumptions, the extended framework guarantees global convergence properties for first order stationary constraints. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various problems, including those from the cutest collection and known global optimization problems.

The primary objective of this study is to extend a globally convergent framework to accommodate both quantitative relaxable (QR) and unrelaxable (UR) constraints. The author acknowledges that a preliminary version of this work was developed during their PhD thesis (Diouane, 2014, Chapter 5). The merit function is defined based on previous research and is used to evaluate trial steps and determine their acceptance. The extension of the globally convergent evolution strategies to a general constrained setting involves a combination of two approaches: a feasible approach for UR constraints, and a merit function approach with a restoration procedure for QR constraints.

It is important to note that if a solver fails to find a feasible starting point for a given problem, the problem is considered unsolved and the convergence test is not applied. The performance and data profiles are computed for a maximum of 3000 function evaluations. The algorithms are implemented in Matlab, and the resulting implementation is referred to as ES-MF.

The results indicate that the merit function approach outperforms the extreme barrier approach, particularly for small budgets. Relaxing the constraints leads to better optimal solutions, which supports the use of the merit function approach (ES-MF) over the extreme barrier approach (ES-EB). Additionally, the directional direct search-merit function (DDS-MF) method, along with a merit function-aided version of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), are also explored and compared.

In summary, the proposed globally convergent evolution strategies with a merit function provide a comprehensive approach for handling constrained optimization problems. The introduced extension includes a restoration procedure and effectively addresses quantifiable relaxable constraints. The convergence analysis is organized based on the frequency of restoration entry, similar to previous work.
