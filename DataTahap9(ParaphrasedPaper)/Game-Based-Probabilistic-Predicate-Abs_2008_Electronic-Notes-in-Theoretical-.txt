This academic paper discusses the use of Markov decision processes (MDPs) for modeling and verifying systems with both probabilistic and non-deterministic behavior, such as communication, network, and security protocols. Existing implementations of MDP-based abstraction techniques are limited in scalability, working only at the model level. The paper introduces language-level abstraction techniques that build game-based abstractions of MDPs directly from high-level descriptions in the Prism modeling language, using predicate abstraction and SMT solvers. The developed techniques have been applied to various case studies, successfully verifying larger models than was possible with existing implementations and demonstrating the benefits of a compositional approach.

The paper addresses the challenge of scalability in verification of systems with non-deterministic and probabilistic behavior, and proposes a language-level abstraction method that can separate the non-determinism introduced by the abstraction from the original MDP. The paper introduces a technique for constructing abstraction directly from high-level descriptions of MDPs, and emphasizes the importance of obtaining distinct upper and lower bounds for reachability probabilities, which can serve as a measure of the quality of the abstraction.

The paper also discusses the use of controlled Markov decision processes (CMDPs) and presents a compositional approach for abstracting ACMDPs. Furthermore, the paper explores the parallel composition of ACMDPs and presents a language-level abstraction method that addresses the limitations of existing model-level abstractions.

The paper also discusses practical approaches for abstracting MDPs, highlighting the use of MDPS and stochastic two-player games as abstract models. It introduces a tool called RAPTURE that performs abstractions and refinements for checking bounds on reachability probabilities. Additionally, the paper presents experimental results from a range of case studies, illustrating the ability of the developed techniques to generate game-based abstractions for larger models and the benefits of adopting a compositional approach.

In the future, the paper aims to improve the performance of the proposed tool chain using symbolic decision procedures and integrate it with an abstraction-refinement loop for MDP verification. The authors also plan to extend the current method to imperative programming languages.
