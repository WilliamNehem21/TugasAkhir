The effectiveness of the proposed method was also assessed using other clustering metrics and achieved high results. The suggested system can be implemented in both internal and external cloud infrastructure, allowing for the detection of attacks on the external cloud network, as well as on the internal physical network or in the virtual network between hypervisors.

E-government represents an innovative technological transformation that governments can utilize to enhance citizen-state relations by providing high-quality services to citizens. Cloud computing serves as a new means of delivering services over the internet, with all resources (hardware, software, and network resources) provided as a service. Cloud-based e-government is recognized as the predominant paradigm of distributed computing systems in the field of e-government, employing cloud services as a fundamental component in constructing intelligent networks of collaborative applications distributed within or outside the state.

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has identified various types of threats to the cloud, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. One of the most common and damaging types of attacks affecting the cloud's effectiveness is DoS, which is utilized by hackers to disrupt the availability of services and resources to legitimate users.

Several studies have been conducted to detect DoS attacks in the cloud, with supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms commonly utilized for this purpose. Clustering algorithms are a prevalent form of unsupervised approach, in which clustered data can be used to label the data points.

The research paper proposes a method to detect DoS attacks in the network layer, employing a hybrid model that combines principal component analysis and clustering algorithms. The proposed approach was evaluated in terms of clustering quality against baseline algorithms such as agglomerative clustering, k-means, and DBSCAN, using various datasets including CSE-CIC-IDS2018, NSL-KDD, and HTTP CSIC 2010.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of related work, Section 3 explains the cloud network infrastructure, introduces the DoS attack scenario on the cloud, and presents the framework of the proposed DoS attack detection system model. Section 4 describes the machine learning methods used in the proposed hybrid model, while Section 5 outlines the clustering metrics employed to evaluate the quality of the clustering. Section 6 presents an application scenario of the proposed system in a cloud network, and Section 7 provides the results obtained from experiments on various datasets. Finally, Section 8 offers the conclusion of the research.

In conclusion, the paper underscores the significance of comprehensive security measures in protecting against DoS attacks in cloud environments, advocating for a combined approach utilizing machine learning methods for effective detection and prevention.
