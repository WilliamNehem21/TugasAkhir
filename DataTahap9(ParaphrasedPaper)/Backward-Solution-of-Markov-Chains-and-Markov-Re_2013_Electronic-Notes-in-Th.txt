The state space S is divided into two parts: the set of transient states (ST) and m sets of recurrent states (S_RI, recurrent classes). The sub-matrix T represents the sub-stochastic DTMC of the transient states ST. Each rectangular sub-matrix F_I is the probability matrix representing the transition from the transient states ST to the i-th recurrent class. Each square sub-matrix R_I represents the DTMC of the i-th recurrent class.
