This paper introduces cellpackexplorer, a tool designed to assist cellpack developers in detecting errors and improving their algorithm. By visualizing the impact of recipe parameters on the final packing output, cellpackexplorer aims to support both numerical and visual methods for understanding the algorithm output, catering to developers with different backgrounds. The tool's effectiveness was evaluated through case studies and questionnaires, revealing its capacity to facilitate model building for both novice and expert users. Moreover, the paper discusses the tool's potential implications within the wider visualization community. Overall, the study presents a detailed user, data, and task analysis that compares the model building tasks of cellpack developers with model usage tasks explored more extensively in the visualization community. The tool's development process, including the iterative design cycle and user feedback, is also outlined, highlighting its flexibility and adaptability to the evolving needs of cellpack developers. Through its client-server design with a web front-end, cellpackexplorer facilitates easy sharing of results and allows interactive filtering of large datasets. The paper concludes by discussing the tool's potential applications in other domains such as meteorology, bioengineering, software engineering, and mathematics, highlighting its versatility beyond the biological domain.
