The conditions in which adaptive or intelligent agents operate have been described across five dimensions: accessibility, determinism, episodic nature, static vs. dynamic behavior, and discreteness vs. continuity. It is particularly challenging to develop intelligent systems for environments that approximate real-world scenarios. The No Free Lunch Theorem (NFLT) states that no function optimization algorithm is superior to random choice. However, for dynamic persistent environments, useful general-purpose optimization protocols exist. There is a gap between the informal and formal aspects of this paper, posing a research challenge. Interaction in environments is characterized by mutual influence or feedback, and persistence of state allows for indirect interaction between agents through the environment. The NFLT presents a paradox in evolutionary computation, but it does not apply to optimization in dynamic persistent environments. Interacting with environments allows natural and artificial systems to gain necessary knowledge. Coadaptation between agents and their environments shapes fitness landscapes, highlighting the role of interaction. Indirect interaction, which occurs via the environment, is a key feature of multiagent systems. The problem of starvation by deadlock in a shared resource scenario illustrates the complexities of indirect interaction. Real-world optimization problems often involve adaptation by multiagent systems to dynamic persistent environments. Decentralized adaptation, as seen in ant colonies and termite behavior, demonstrates the effectiveness of multiagent interaction in solving complex problems. Multiagent interaction is prevalent across various levels, and recognizing adaptation to dynamic persistent environments as distinct from function optimization offers new avenues for research in adaptive systems.
