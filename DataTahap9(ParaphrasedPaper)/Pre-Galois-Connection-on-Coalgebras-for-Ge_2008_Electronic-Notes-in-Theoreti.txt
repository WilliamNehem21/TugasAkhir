The concept of Galois connections has found successful applications in various areas of computer science. By utilizing coalgebras as software component models, we argue that different behavioral models and types of state transitions for components can be viewed as instances of a unified form of coalgebra in a Kleisli category. Within this framework, results related to forward/backward morphisms and component refinement in set theory remain applicable. We introduce the notion of pre-Galois connection in the context of coalgebras for refining state-based software components, which takes into account both the refinement ordering and the dynamics of the components. We examine the properties of this notion in the Kleisli category, showing it to be a valuable tool for relating a component to its refinement and its abstraction, thus providing a basis for reasoning about state-based software designs and reverse engineering.

Over the past decade, component-based software development has emerged as a promising paradigm for addressing the increasing complexity in software design, evolution, and reuse. A component is a modular, deployable, and replaceable part of a system that encapsulates implementation and exposes a public interface. In component-based software development, a component must be specified and then implemented before it can be analyzed and used. The development step from specification to implementation is referred to as refinement.

In terms of future work, our next step will involve applying pre-Galois connection to refinement examples. One challenge is to delve deeper into the concept itself. For instance, we aim to establish theorems predicting the existence of adjoints in a pre-Galois connection. Additionally, we are interested in exploring the completeness of pre-Galois connections for refinement, specifically, whether a pre-Galois connection can be built for every refinement relation.
