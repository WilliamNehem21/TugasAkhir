The value of e-commerce is projected to increase to $1 trillion by 2020, rising from $1.6 trillion in 2010. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has predicted a real GDP growth of 4.9% for the African continent from 2012 to 2016, which surpasses the average global growth rate. E-commerce plays a crucial role in global economic growth, and the challenge of managing the abundance of e-commerce information has led to the emergence of recommendation systems to aid users in information discovery.

However, the complexity of image-based product classification presents obstacles such as high dimensionality of image features, limited content analysis, and other nuanced factors. While substantial research has been conducted in this area, the number of image classes studied and the reported accuracies still fall short for real-time applications. To address these challenges, a content-based image recommendation system utilizing an ensemble of artificial neural networks trained with eigen-based color features to classify product images into 100 classes is proposed.

This study focuses on developing an effective image-based classification model reliant on an ensemble of artificial neural networks and efficient eigen-based image feature representation. The research uses histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and uniform linear binary pattern (ULBP) feature extraction methods to extract color product features and then applies an eigen-based algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the product image features. The proposed architecture also implements cross-validation to validate the model's performance and test its accuracy.

The paper further emphasizes the effectiveness of ensemble learning, demonstrating that an ensemble of machine learning classifiers outperforms individual classifiers. It provides an overview of relevant literature, details the proposed architecture and methods, outlines the experiments conducted to validate performance, presents the results and concludes with suggestions for future research directions.

Additionally, the paper discusses the integration of artificial neural networks and support vector machines in e-commerce product image classification and decision support tasks. It highlights the significance of cross-validation to mitigate overfitting and describes the computational efforts required for determining the correct combination of weights in neural networks. The study also employs the support vector machine as a pattern classifier, and utilizes ensemble learning, specifically bagging, to improve accuracy.

The experiments conducted in the study involve using different image feature extraction techniques to train artificial neural networks and support vector machine models, identifying the most accurate models for ensemble learning. The proposed architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over existing image-based product classification works reported in the literature, with potential applications in recommendation systems and e-commerce domain.

The study concludes by highlighting the potential integration of the proposed architecture into recommendation systems for personalized recommendations and automatic product tagging. It also suggests future research to develop more discriminating features and conduct comparative studies on other state-of-the-art machine learning methods to enhance product image classification performance.
