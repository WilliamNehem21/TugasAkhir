Oxidative stress arises from an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of the biological system to effectively detoxify these reactive intermediates or repair the resulting damage. ROS, through oxidative damage to DNA and subsequent mutation and alterations in gene expression, play a central role in the process of carcinogenesis. Consequently, the protective and beneficial roles of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in combatting various diseases, including ischemic-reperfusion injury, inflammation, and cancer, have been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. SOD, particularly manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), is a crucial enzyme responsible for defending against oxidative damage due to ROS in the mitochondria. Studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of exogenously isolated Mn-SOD from animal blood and plants such as watermelon, pea, garlic, and pearl millet on tumor cells. Moreover, the study suggests that SOD has potential as an anticancer agent.

Heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are commonly used for the prevention or treatment of thromboembolic complications in cancer patients. Earlier studies linking anticoagulant therapy with heparin to improved survival of cancer patients led to several prospective clinical trials testing heparin as a potential anticancer treatment. Preclinical analysis of heparin provides evidence of its anti-metastatic activity in various animal models. Heparin, an acidic polysaccharide belonging to the glycosaminoglycan class, has been shown to have anti-metastatic properties. In addition, several potential anticancer agents have shown an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, which is involved in the promotion of tumor growth.

The study involved the purification of a protein with SOD activity from raphanus sativus roots to investigate its potential effects on cancer growth. The treatments with the purified protein and LMWH showed significant effects on the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum, and these effects were found to inhibit the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells.

The results of the study demonstrate that raphanus sativus root extract and LMWH can potentially inhibit EAC cell growth through mechanisms such as anti-oxidative and anti-angiogenic effects. The study also indicates the potential of raphanus sativus extract in enhancing immune system function and protecting tumor suppressor genes from the toxic effects of free radicals.

In summary, the study highlights the potential therapeutic effects of raphanus sativus root extract and LMWH in inhibiting cancer cell growth through various mechanisms, including anti-oxidative and anti-angiogenic effects. These findings underscore the potential of these agents in anticancer therapy and urge further investigation of their mechanisms of action and clinical applications.
