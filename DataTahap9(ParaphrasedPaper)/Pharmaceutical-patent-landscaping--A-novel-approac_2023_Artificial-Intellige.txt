To categorize compounds based on their stage in clinical trials, we employed data from chembl. Each compound registered in chembl is annotated based on whether it has been a clinical candidate, and if so, at which stage. Chembl assigns phase numbers from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates compounds being researched in the preclinical stage, 1 to 3 indicate compounds being tested in clinical trial phases I to III, and 4 indicates compounds that have been approved by the FDA and/or EMA. Our analysis utilizes this chembl data to identify compounds, along with associated patents, that have transitioned from the preclinical to the clinical stage within the drug discovery pipeline.

We collected information from patent databases for each disease and retrospectively analyzed the patent data to identify leading organizations involved in drug research and discovery (R&D) for individual diseases. Additionally, we investigated case studies for selected targets based on biological networks and examined their patenting trends. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of patent documents in identifying opportunities for drug repurposing.

In this section, we examined the patent data for each disease and provided a statistical overview of the information gathered within the patent corpora. This summary offers insights into the scope of patenting activity within the disease area, indicating whether patents are filed for pharmacological relevance or formulation purposes. We also compared the number of approved patent documents with those still in the application pipeline.

We then analyzed the patenting activity for each disease to identify major pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions making significant contributions to potential drug R&D in the field. We leveraged high-level patent owner classification (organization, acquired, and individuals) and grouped patent owners based on the number of applications they have filed. Subsequently, we reviewed the top patent owners and deduced their historical patenting activity in the field, examining both R&D and formulations separately to better understand the patent landscape related to each disease.

The mode of action (MOA) of a drug in the human body is essential for successful drug discovery. Patent documents allow us to investigate target-based MOA claims within patent applications and their effect on certain indication areas as well as their importance over time based on success achieved in clinical trials. Identifying potential disease targets, their prevalence, and their role in affected patient populations can be instrumental in developing new intellectual property. In this section, we focus on trends in the prioritization of targets in patent literature over the years, while the therapeutic usage of targets has previously been described.

For example, we found a compound that inhibits spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and has the potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Another compound demonstrates anticancerous properties by inhibiting a specific KRAS mutant, presenting an opportunity to test the compound on multiple KRAS mutations and optimize it to create a mutant-specific or general-purpose compound. These examples illustrate how mining patent documents from a compound perspective can provide insights into repurposing compounds for multiple disorders beyond their original patents.

This patent landscape offers a comprehensive and informative understanding of research in the field of small molecule drugs. It not only aligns with scientific literature but also enables competitive intelligence analysis in pharmaceutical R&D. Overall, this patent landscaping approach from a drug discovery perspective highlights the significance of analyzing patents and their utility in making decisions for future drug development efforts. Tracking patenting activities from publicly available resources has the potential to define strategies for target ranking within a therapeutic focus. Therefore, our methodology contributes to the overall understanding of drug discovery and development efforts.
