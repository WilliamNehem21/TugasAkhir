The paper focuses on a category of systems known as feller-dynkin processes, which have a well-established mathematical theory. These systems are Markov processes characterized by continuous state spaces and continuous time evolution, and include variations of Brownian motion.

The study demonstrates a correspondence between cospans of fd-homomorphisms and bisimulations. Specifically, if r is a bisimulation, then the quotient by r results in an fdhomomorphism, which is not a homeomorphism if r is non-trivial. This is a departure from the concept of groups of symmetries that identify symmetries within the system.

In discrete time, it is common to consider multiple actions, and the concepts presented in the paper can be adapted to accommodate several actions. However, for the sake of readability, actions are not discussed in this section.

The paper examines two scenarios. In the first case, the study assesses whether an even or odd number of customers has arrived. In the second case, it investigates whether there are more customers than a critical value.

Remark 6.11 highlights a situation resembling deterministic or Brownian drift with parity as the atomic proposition, with a key difference being the prevention of the set of translations by an even number from forming a group of symmetries through allowance only for positive numbers. Nonetheless, these translations are fd-homomorphisms. The paper proves that there is no larger group of symmetries than symmetry, using a demonstration of the following principles: if x and y are related by rj, then y and x are also related by rj, and transitivity, where if x is related to y and y is related to z, then x is related to z.
