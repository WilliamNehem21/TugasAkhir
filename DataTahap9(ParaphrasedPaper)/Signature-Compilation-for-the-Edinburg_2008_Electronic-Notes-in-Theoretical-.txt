The main purpose of the signature compiler (SC) is to create backend checkers that can efficiently verify proofs based on a specific signature. These checkers are optimized to work most effectively when the proof successfully checks, but they do not provide useful error information for failed proofs. Additionally, the backend checkers allow untrusted proofs to include extra definitions, but not extra declarations, which could potentially undermine the deductive system established by the trusted signature. SC is particularly useful when numerous proofs related to the same signature need to be checked efficiently, as the reusability of the custom checker produced by SC compensates for the time required for signature compilation.

The signature compiler incorporates the necessary code to compute the type of an application of a constant declared or defined in the signature directly into the emitted checkers, eliminating the need for run-time substitutions to calculate the return type of an application of a dependently typed function. As a result, the emitted checkers avoid the resource-intensive operation of substitution when determining the return type of an application of a constant declared or defined in the signature.

SC supports implicit arguments and offers space and performance enhancements over Twelf and its own checkers, as well as significant improvements over the Flea checker. The authors are also looking to further support proofs from decision procedures, with one proposing LF, supported by the signature compiler, as the suitable technology for a standard proof format for the SMT-LIB (Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library) initiative.
