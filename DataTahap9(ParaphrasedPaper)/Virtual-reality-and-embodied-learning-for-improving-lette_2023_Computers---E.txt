The development of reading skills in children is crucial for their academic success and future occupational status. This study aims to build on existing knowledge about educational strategies that can enhance early literacy skills, particularly phoneme awareness and letter-sound knowledge. These skills have been identified as strong predictors of later reading and spelling abilities. Given the challenges posed by Danish orthography, it is important to focus on acquiring phoneme awareness and letter-sound knowledge at an early stage. The study also explores the potential role of embodied learning and virtual reality (VR) technology in improving these skills.

The study emphasizes the significance of attention in children's learning outcomes and its association with reading abilities. Inattentive behavior has been linked to poor reading skills, suggesting the importance of interventions that target attentional control. Previous research has suggested that embodied learning can have a positive impact on attention, which aligns with the focus of this study on improving attentional control through interventions.

The use of VR in educational settings, particularly in STEM education, has shown potential in enriching learning experiences and enhancing student engagement. Additionally, letter-sound knowledge has been identified as a key predictor of later reading and spelling abilities, emphasizing the importance of this skill for literacy acquisition. The study aims to investigate how embodied learning, with or without VR, may influence children's letter-sound knowledge and its impact on their reading and spelling abilities.

The intervention involves whole-body movements, with one group using VR glasses while performing the activities, another using mirrors, and a control group receiving standard teaching. The study will be conducted in collaboration with three primary schools in Copenhagen, with participants randomly allocated to the intervention groups. The inclusion criteria specify that children must have written informed consent from their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to participate in the study.

The study protocol outlines the specific activities and assessments involved in the intervention, including individual testing and the evaluation of letter-sound knowledge. It also addresses ethical considerations, data protection regulations, and the potential implications of the research findings for educational practices.

Overall, the study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of embodied learning and VR interventions in improving early literacy skills. It also seeks to explore the potential impact of these interventions on attentional control and their relevance in educational settings. The researchers hope to use the findings to inform future practices and research in the field of educational technology and embodied learning.
