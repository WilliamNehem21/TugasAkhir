The use of microarray technology has grown significantly in recent years, with applications in drug design, tumor detection, clinical diagnosis and treatment, and environmental health research. However, accurately segmenting the spots in microarray images remains a challenge due to variations in spot qualities such as shapes and sizes. To address this issue, we have developed a new algorithm for microarray spot segmentation based on the integro-differential operator (IDO). This algorithm can detect spots of any size and shape within the microarray image, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the segmentation process. We tested our algorithm on the Stanford Microarray Database (SMD) and found that IDO is effective in improving spot segmentation and analysis.

While some existing segmentation methods assume that all spots are perfectly circular and of the same size, our approach allows for variations in spot shapes and sizes. We also compared our method with other segmentation software such as Scanalyze and Genepix, which are based on fixed circle segmentation.

In addition to circular spots, our method is able to adjust the size of each spot. We employed adaptive shape segmentation methods such as watershed and seed region growing, which allow for flexibility in spot size and shape detection. We utilized IDO to separate the CDNA microarray spots from the background, leveraging its speed, reliability, and wide applicability in image processing and analysis. In our experimental results, we demonstrated the effectiveness of IDO in segmenting real images from the Stanford Microarray Database.

The paper is organized as follows: we explain the proposed techniques in detail in the second section, discuss the experimental results from applying our method on real images in the third section, and provide an analysis of our conclusions in the fourth section.
