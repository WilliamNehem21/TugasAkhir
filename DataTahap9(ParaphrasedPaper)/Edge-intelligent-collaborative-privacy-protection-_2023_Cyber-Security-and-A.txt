Effective medical care and disease diagnosis and treatment are crucial challenges in healthcare. Smart medical care, which leverages the use of wearable devices, mobile phones, and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, can address this issue by enabling functions such as health monitoring and online diagnosis. However, ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive medical data in this process is essential.

To address these concerns, a federated learning training model based on end-edge-cloud layering is utilized to minimize the risk of user privacy breaches. By keeping the original data local, the model reduces the potential for privacy leakage. Moreover, differential privacy techniques are employed during the model upload to the cloud data center and transmission to edge servers, preventing attackers from accessing detailed training data through inference attacks and safeguarding the model's privacy and security.

Differential privacy methods, typically implemented through the addition of fuzzy noise, protect sensitive information by introducing quantitative randomness to the data. Common noise-adding mechanisms include the gaussian and laplace mechanisms.

In the context of the cloud data center, while it offers strong security measures and ample computing and storage resources, its distance from users presents communication challenges.

An examination of the accuracy of models under the breast cancer dataset reveals that the EICPP model demonstrates faster convergence rates compared to the FedAvg and FedMA models. Specifically, EICPP approaches convergence around the 14th round, FedMA around the 20th round, and FedAvg only reaches convergence around the 24th round. Additionally, the final convergence accuracy rates indicate that EICPP achieves 95.47%, FedMA 82.56%, and... [the rest of the text is incomplete, so I cannot paraphrase it].
