The network layer offers significant benefits in terms of conserving network resources through multicast transmissions in various applications such as video-clip streaming and IPTV. The increasing interest in genetic algorithms, particularly in the context of network design and unicast routing, has been observed in recent years. Several studies have explored the use of genetic algorithms for multicast routing, addressing both unconstrained and constrained problems, particularly in the context of QoS for real-time applications.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a problem description and formulation, while Section 3 details the genetic algorithm and its operators. Section 4 presents the proposed algorithm, and Section 5 includes two examples to demonstrate its performance. The conclusion is presented in Section 6.

The proposed genetic algorithm for multimedia multicast routing with bandwidth and delay constraints leverages the kth shortest paths algorithm to construct a route set. This approach aims to enhance the encoding space by identifying routes that meet bandwidth constraints, ensuring improved search efficiency for optimal solutions and global convergence. Genetic operators, including crossover and mutation, are employed to facilitate the convergence of solutions and improve the encoding space.
