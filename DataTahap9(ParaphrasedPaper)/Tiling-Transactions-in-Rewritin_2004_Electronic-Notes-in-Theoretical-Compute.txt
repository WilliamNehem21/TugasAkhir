The paper introduces the concept of separation of concerns in the context of tile and rewrite theories, suggesting that different flavors of tile logic can be achieved through fine-tuning the algebraic structure of the elements in space and time. It explores recent applications of tile logic in logic programming and concurrent semantics, and proposes further application in the semantics of distributed transactions.

The paper discusses an adjunction between zcomp and hcatzcomp for building horizontal computations of tiles, as well as an adjunction between zcompc and hcatzcompc. It also analyzes the relationship between computad refinement morphisms and 2-computad morphisms, asserting that any computad refinement morphism is a 2-computad morphism and vice versa.

Furthermore, the paper extends the zero-safe approach to the framework of tile and rewrite theories, emphasizing the coreflection between the abstract and specification views. It asserts that the abstract system is the best possible representation of the concurrent transactions of its corresponding tile theory, and that the representation results for zero-safe nets follow from the more general constructions defined in the paper.

The concepts of reflection and coreflection are also discussed, highlighting their roles as natural isomorphisms that yield optimal approximations. The paper explores the implications of coreflection from a semantic standpoint, discussing the relationship between a category of operational models and a subcategory of abstract models and presenting the universal property of coreflections.
