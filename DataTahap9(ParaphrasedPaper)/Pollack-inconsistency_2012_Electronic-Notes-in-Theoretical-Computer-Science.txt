The paper discusses the importance of consistency in interactive theorem provers, which refers to the property that false theorems cannot be proven and that users cannot be led to believe that a false theorem has been proved. The authors propose the concept of "Pollack-consistency" as a desirable property for interactive theorem provers. They argue that many existing interactive theorem provers are not Pollack-consistent and present a simple approach to modify the printing code of these systems in order to achieve Pollack-consistency.

The paper also highlights the reliability of interactive theorem proving technology in ensuring the correctness of proofs, with examples of formal theories constructed using interactive theorem provers. It emphasizes the small size of LCF kernels, which allows for manual inspection and high confidence in their correctness. However, the paper points out that some interactive theorem provers exhibit inconsistencies in parsing and printing, leading to errors or misinterpretations in output.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the challenges in achieving Pollack-consistency, such as the complexities of parsing and printing functions in interactive theorem provers. It notes that demonstrating Pollack-inconsistency is easier than establishing Pollack-consistency. The authors also address the perception of users and developers regarding these issues, highlighting the need to raise awareness and convince developers to modify parsing and printing functions to achieve Pollack-consistency.

In conclusion, the paper presents a case for enhancing the consistency of interactive theorem provers by making them Pollack-consistent and emphasizes the importance of addressing parsing and printing issues in these systems.
