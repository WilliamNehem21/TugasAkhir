Essentially, our method shares similarities with others, but we leverage soccer-specific knowledge to automatically detect players without a comprehensive sliding-window approach. Our observation model is influenced by the concepts of aspogamo, but incorporates more universal features, such as the hog detector, and does not require human-guided initialization. It is akin to the approach proposed by [reference], which is focused solely on player detection and does not include tracking information over time.

We autonomously generate color templates based on the FIFA rules, which mandate that jersey colors should be chosen to ensure distinguishability between players from different teams, referees, and goalkeepers. We utilize this rule by initially determining color templates for each type of outfit using color histograms.

We determine the current position and calculate the position with the highest confidence value. If the confidence value at the best position is higher than that at the current position, the iteration continues, starting at the best position. Otherwise, the iteration stops with the current position as the result. Typically, our efficient greedy approach stops after 2-3 iterations and yields satisfactory results.

For multi-target tracking, we employ a single-target Kalman filter for each tracked bounding box. We generate a new measurement through an optimization step based on the confidence map using the Kalman prediction as the starting position. The detection of new and lost targets is carried out with deterministic heuristics guided by the confidence map.
