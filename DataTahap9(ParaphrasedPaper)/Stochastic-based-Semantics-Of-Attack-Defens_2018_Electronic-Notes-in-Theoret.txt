The frequency of cyber-attacks causing financial losses is on the rise, emphasizing the urgent need for a comprehensive security assessment methodology that integrates mathematical principles with practical and user-friendly representations. In this study, we present a stochastic security assessment approach that utilizes attack-defense trees to model security scenarios, and stochastic models for both qualitative and quantitative assessment, illustrated with a straightforward yet realistic case study.

Additionally, there is a significant lack of qualitative foundations supporting the analysis of attack-defense trees. As a result, this work aims to interpret the qualitative behavioral properties of Petri nets within the context of security, particularly in relation to attack-defense trees. By leveraging the isomorphic relationship between finite continuous time Markov chains and bounded stochastic Petri nets, we can conduct both qualitative and quantitative security analyses by transitioning between the two models. Moreover, we introduce a new refinement operator called disjunctive parallel refinement to account for parallel actions, as well as propose a new class of countermeasures known as blocking-type countermeasures inspired by delayed-type countermeasures.

In this paper, we provide a formal framework for the proposed stochastic operational semantics for attack-defense trees based on stochastic Petri nets. We then present the results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses conducted using a simple yet realistic case study. Additionally, we discuss related works and conclude the paper. Notably, the introduction of the parallel disjunction refinement operator addresses the absence of a refinement operator that expresses the execution of parallel actions, offering a more accurate representation of security scenarios involving parallel actions.

Our work contributes to the development of a practical security assessment tool that facilitates system design with security in mind and the strengthening of existing infrastructure. However, there is room for further improvements, and we intend to extend the framework by considering new types of countermeasures and qualitative properties to provide a comprehensive security assessment tool.
