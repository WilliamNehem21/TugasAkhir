Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) is a field of research that places significant emphasis on the role of individuals as members of groups. It views human beings not as isolated entities, but as integral parts of the societies within which they operate and interact. Over time, numerous CSCW systems have emerged, prompting the development of various taxonomies aimed at classifying these tools. However, the increasing complexity of these systems has rendered existing classifications inadequate. In response to these changes, this paper introduces a new taxonomy that provides a more flexible and adaptable means of categorizing CSCW systems, taking into account their evolving nature.

The concept of CSCW was first coined in the mid-1980s by Paul Cashman and Irene Greif, who organized a workshop with participants from diverse fields, all with a shared interest in exploring how computer science could support collaborative work and address the needs of individuals working together. Given the collaborative nature of systems and their potential to facilitate human communication and coordination, it is anticipated that the range of applications and functionalities in this area will continue to expand. As a result, there is a growing need for classification methods that can effectively accommodate the evolving landscape of CSCW tools and systems.

Existing taxonomies have traditionally relied on categorizations based on spatial and temporal dimensions. However, the increasing complexity of contemporary systems presents challenges for fitting them into these traditional classification frameworks. This has led to the proposal of a new classification system based on logical principles, which aims to provide a more flexible and appropriate categorization of CSCW systems.

The paper also delves into the spatial and temporal characteristics of groupware applications, highlighting how they can be utilized in various physical and temporal settings, ranging from shared physical workspaces to remote locations. The authors conducted a survey involving CSCW experts and postdoctoral students from Spanish universities to assess the proposed classification, and the results indicated a strong validation of the need for new classification methods tailored to current CSCW systems.

Furthermore, the paper underscores the adaptable nature of classification systems, noting that tools initially designed for specific functions may often find alternate use cases. For instance, the usage of email has evolved from being primarily a tool for communication across dispersed spaces to also being employed for coordination and collaboration within the same physical environment. This flexibility calls for classification frameworks that can accommodate these changing usage patterns and adapt to emerging needs. Ultimately, the proposed flexible classification system is seen as a fitting solution to address the evolving landscape of CSCW.
