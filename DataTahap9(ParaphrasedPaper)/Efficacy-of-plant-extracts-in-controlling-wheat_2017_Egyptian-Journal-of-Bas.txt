A split plot design with three replicates was employed in this study. The main plots were divided into one and two-spray applications for each treatment, with the first spray being administered shortly after the detection of disease symptoms and the second spray 15 days after the first. The sub-plots were assigned to the various plant extracts under investigation.

The use of plant extracts for the biological control of wheat rust represents a contemporary, advanced, and low-risk alternative for rust management. Various plant extracts have been recognized for their significant role in the control of plant diseases. They act directly or indirectly against plant pathogens, either by inhibiting fungal growth and propagation or by inducing resistance in crop plants. The in vitro-tested plant extracts, including neem, clove, antha mandhaari, black cumin, white cedar, Brazilian pepper, garlic, and garden quinine, exhibited a spore germination inhibition of 93% or more against wheat leaf rust P. triticina. Notably, neem extract demonstrated a 98.99% inhibition of spore germination, which was comparable to the 100% inhibition achieved by the fungicide sumi-8 treatment.

When applied via seed soaking or foliar spray treatments on wheat seedlings, the plant extracts led to a reduction in the number of pustules/leaf, with foliar spraying proving to be more effective. Among the treatments, neem extract was the most effective, providing 100% disease control when applied one or four days post-inoculation. Furthermore, after 22 days from inoculation, plants treated with neem, white cedar, garden quinine, or clove extracts showed no development of pustules, in contrast to those treated with the fungicide sumi-8. Application of a foliar spray at the mature plant stage exhibited high efficacy in reducing leaf rust infection (ACI), with neem extract emerging as the most effective treatment. Additionally, the two-spray application appeared to be more effective than a single spray.

These plant extracts contain groups of compounds that exhibit antimicrobial effects and serve as defense mechanisms against pathogenic microorganisms. The active ingredients in neem, such as nimbin and azadirachtin, are particularly effective in combating pathogens. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of the plant extracts can be attributed to the presence of antifungal components, including azadirachtin in Azadirachta indica, artemesium in Artemisia annua, caratenes in Ocimum sanctum, emodin in Rheum emodi, and eucalyptol in Eucalyptus globulus.

In conclusion, the plant extracts employed in this study, which possess resistance mechanisms, show potential for controlling leaf rust disease in wheat. Based on the results obtained and the successful reports related to plant extracts in controlling plant pathogenic fungi, it is evident that these tested plant extracts hold promise for the organic and eco-friendly management of foliar diseases in wheat. The findings of this study may serve as a foundation for the use of biocontrol agents as a safe and cost-effective method for combating leaf rust in wheat.
