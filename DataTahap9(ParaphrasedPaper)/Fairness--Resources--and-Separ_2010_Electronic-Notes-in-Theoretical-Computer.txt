Our focus on prefixes does not conflict with the observation that fairmerge is non-monotone in terms of the ordering of traces. Our findings challenge the traditional view that non-monotonic behavior implies fairness lies beyond denotational boundaries. In our approach, the lack of monotonicity is found to be inconsequential.

There exists a substantial body of literature that explores different concepts of fair interleaving, described in various contexts. These include earlier definitions based on automata and oracles, as well as a significant body of work utilizing traces. Previous research has aimed to extend the Kahn principle to dataflow networks containing non-deterministic processes. The exploration of diverse forms of fair merge in dataflow networks has yielded original and surprising results about their relative expressive power. As fairness plays a crucial role in the semantics of concurrent programs, our approach may have connections to prior literature in terms of concepts and technical details. However, our development demonstrates how to meticulously articulate these details in a general setting, without the need for book-keeping machinery like oracles, and without requiring the tagging and untagging of actions with channel labels as typically seen in dataflow semantics. Furthermore, unlike most earlier work, our formulation allows for the straightforward derivation of natural algebraic properties such as associativity.
