This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses context theory and its application in modeling distributed systems. Section 3 introduces a framework for specifying information flow properties in distributed systems. Section 4 provides a comparison with related work, while Section 5 presents the conclusion. The paper concludes with an appendix containing the proofs of the main theorems.

The paper presents a general framework that allows for the consideration of complex scenarios in distributed systems. It explores the possibility of obtaining a closed system from a partially specified one by considering various scenarios. In cases where there are unspecified components, different approaches for system analysis are discussed. The paper identifies a crucial difference in behavior that proves to be significant for the central result.

The paper extends the definition of ndc and bndc properties for processes to address distributed systems. It examines partially specified systems with unspecified components, treating them as contexts, and investigates whether these contexts satisfy ndc and/or bndc properties.

The paper builds upon previous research on process algebra operators and extends the results to address compositional properties of bndc with respect to parallel operators. It proposes a different problem specification that accounts for the system's environment.

Future research aims to address the verification problem for centralized and distributed bndc. Additionally, the paper plans to investigate the implications of unspecified components performing low actions, considering them as potential malicious agents or generic processes capable of performing high and low actions.
