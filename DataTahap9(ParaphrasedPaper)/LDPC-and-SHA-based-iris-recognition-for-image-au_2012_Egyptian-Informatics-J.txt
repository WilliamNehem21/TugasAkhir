In this research paper, we present a new technique for authenticating images by incorporating low density parity check (LDPC) and secure hash algorithm (SHA) based iris recognition with a reversible watermarking scheme using integer wavelet transform (IWT) and threshold embedding. The LDPC encoding, as well as the parity matrix and hash string from SHA-512, are embedded into the image for authentication purposes using the reversible watermarking scheme based on IWT and threshold embedding. By reversing the embedding process, the original image, parity checks, parity matrix, and SHA-512 hash can be extracted from the watermarked image. To authenticate the image, a new hash string generated by applying SHA-512 on the error-corrected iris code from a live person is compared with the hash string extracted from the watermarked image. The LDPC code reduces the hamming distance for genuine comparisons to a greater extent than for impostor comparisons, resulting in better separation between genuine and impostor users and an improved authentication performance. The security of this scheme is very high due to the cryptographic strength of SHA-512, which is resistant to birthday attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach ensures more accurate authentication with a low false rejection or false acceptance rate and outperforms existing methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

Incorporating the iris as cancellable biometrics within an image enhances secrecy, and the use of reversible watermarking does not compromise the original image's quality, as the data is embedded in the least significant bit (LSB) of the IWT coefficients. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the lossless data hiding using IWT and threshold embedding technique, Section 3 outlines the enrollment process of the proposed system, Section 4 discusses how the verification process (authentication) works in the proposed system, Section 5 provides experimental results and performance analysis, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

Furthermore, the paper addresses the issue of dimensional inconsistencies between eye images caused by various factors such as pupil dilation, varying levels of illumination, imaging distance, camera rotation, head tilt, and eye rotation within the eye socket.

The paper also provides an example illustrating the LDPC encoding and decoding process, demonstrating how the iris code is constructed and corrected to fulfill the code constraints.
