The study focuses on utilizing multi-attribute-based quantum neural networks for direct hydrocarbon detection in gas fields. The approach involves using data clustering and local wave decomposition based on seismic attenuation characteristics and relative wave impedance features of prestack seismic data as selected attributes for identifying a tight sandstone gas reservoir. Principal component analysis combined with quantum neural networks is employed to distinguish the weak responses of the gas reservoir, which are difficult to detect using conventional technologies. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-attribute-based quantum neural networks in capturing weak seismic responses associated with gas saturation in the gas reservoir, particularly in areas characterized by weak seismic responses. The method is expected to aid in hydrocarbon detection in gas reservoirs with challenging seismic characteristics by complementing conventional technologies.

In addition to the use of multi-attribute-based quantum neural networks, the paper discusses inversion methods for obtaining physical parameters such as longitudinal and transverse wave velocity, density, Poisson's ratio, and relative wave impedance for hydrocarbon detection. It highlights the challenges and limitations associated with the practical application of AVO analysis and emphasizes the successful application cases in clastic rock reservoirs with shallow burial.

Furthermore, the study presents the collection and analysis of prestack seismic data from a tight sandstone gas reservoir in the Sichuan Basin, China. The reservoir is described as a multi-phase multi-stacked delta plain and delta-front-dominated river sand body with strong heterogeneity, low porosity, and permeability. The physical properties difference between sandstone and mudstone in the work area is minimal, and the weak seismic responses complicate gas detection, especially in non-bright spot channels.

The selection of seismic attributes is highlighted as crucial for capturing relevant information related to the structure, stratigraphy, lithology, and hydrocarbons in a specific gas reservoir. The relative wave impedance features are noted as reflecting lithological changes, while the local wave decomposition based seismic attenuation characteristics are related to hydrocarbon contents. Data clustering results on prestack seismic data are identified as representing sedimentary facies and providing insights into lithological assemblage, bedding, and sedimentary characteristics conducive to reflections. Consequently, the study mainly focuses on the relative wave impedance features, local wave decomposition based seismic attenuation characteristics, and data clustering results as the featured seismic attributes for effectively distinguishing the weak responses of the gas reservoir.

The paper also discusses the detailed application of multi-attribute-based quantum neural networks for hydrocarbon detection in a tight sandstone gas reservoir in the Sichuan Basin, China. The study emphasizes the use of the relative wave impedance features, local wave decomposition based seismic attenuation characteristics, and data clustering results of prestack seismic data as featured seismic attributes. Specifically, methods such as the ceemd-based attenuation gradient estimation and wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition are employed within the local wave decomposition based seismic attenuation characteristics. The application of the pso-assisted qgsnn, combined with principal component analysis of the selected featured seismic attributes, demonstrates the capability of the proposed method for detecting weak responses-exhibited gas areas, where conventional seismic attributes and methods give poor gas-prone interpretations.
