A symmetric monoidal m-category is an m-category that has a symmetric monoidal structure on its underlying category. It is not assumed that the symmetric monoidal structure is in line with the m-enrichment. When considering symmetric monoidal m-categories C and D, a symmetric monoidal m-functor from C to D is an m-functor from C to D that also maintains the property of being symmetric monoidal.
