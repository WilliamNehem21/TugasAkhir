Negativity in parameters such as profit and loss, cash flow, and share price change (adjusted, annual) was mitigated by augmenting a fixed amount to each of these parameters in order to ensure that they are on a scale starting from zero. This approach aligns with the methodology employed in other DEA studies, as noted in Pastor and Ruiz (2007). Specifically, an amount of 3789.001 EUR (in thousands) was added to each real number in the profit and loss category, 1454.001 EUR (in thousands) was added to the cash flow, and a value of one was added to share price changes. Furthermore, inventory turns required modification for DEA research, as the general expectation is that higher input amounts should result in higher outputs, indicating a consistent relationship between inputs and outputs. Consequently, inventory turns were computed as the inverse number, where lower inventory turns correspond to higher input values.

This approach could be extended to larger economies, potentially including major European exchange-listed companies or those in North America. The global presence of leading companies in the retail sector in these markets presents an opportunity for fruitful examination. Additionally, given the increasing dominance of manufacturing in Asia, further exploration in this direction could be valuable. In both of these potential extensions, a deeper examination of the role of inventory and assets is crucial to provide additional insights into the issues identified in this research. Another avenue for future research could involve analyzing data from years prior to the global financial crisis, when there were higher interest rates. This would serve to underscore the significance of inventory and assets during that era.
