Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) is a self-learning artificial intelligence model based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system, designed to adapt to changing environments and uncertainties by forming rules for survival. The acceptability of the quadratic model was assessed based on the p-value of the analysis of variance and the correlation coefficient (r2). Three-dimensional surface plots were utilized to study the interactive effects of input variables. MATLAB 8.5 software 2015 version was used for simulating the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and ANFIS. About 70% of the experimental runs were used to train the network, while 15% and 15% were used for testing and validation, respectively, in order to improve the generalization capability of models.

The Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm was employed for modeling the ANN process. Normalization of response and input variables between 0 and 1 was carried out to reduce network error, and the training function used was trainlm, which regularizes the bias value using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The number of hidden neurons was determined through a trial and error method to minimize the error between the predicted and measured values. The p-value and F-value were used to test the significance of the model terms, with higher F-values and lower p-values indicating better significance. It was found that the drying time and temperature had the most significant effect on the response, followed by the interaction of drying air speed and temperature.

The ANFIS model demonstrated a better correlation and more significant prediction compared to the ANN, as indicated by the R2 and RMSE values. Additionally, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and ANFIS were found to be more effective in predicting the moisture content reduction of potato slices in the drying process, with drying time showing the most significant singular effect on the process, followed by temperature. Overall, the results indicated that the quadratic model was suitable for the modeling process.
