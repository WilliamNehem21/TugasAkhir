The paper discusses the FSR algorithm in Section 2, proposed EA-FSR algorithm in Section 3, simulation setup and environmental parameters in Section 4, results presentation and discussion in Section 5, and conclusions and future scope in Section 6.

The paper emphasizes the importance of time in network lifetime, which is influenced by the energy consumption of sensor nodes. Communication tasks consume the most energy, followed by computation and sensing. Routing protocols that consider residual energy for route selection can enhance overall network energy and extend network lifetime.

EA-FSR proposes a new path selection mechanism based on energy, rather than shortest path length, to address energy imbalance and the formation of energy holes. The approach compares the energy of neighboring nodes to select the node with the highest residual energy for packet forwarding.

Simulation results demonstrate that EA-FSR outperforms FSR for varying sensor node mobility, leading to increased network throughput and reduced energy consumption (by almost 12%), thereby prolonging network lifetime. However, there is a slight increase in average end-to-end delay and jitter values.

In the future, EA-FSR can be optimized further to minimize energy consumption and control overhead, possibly by incorporating swarm intelligence. Additionally, the protocol can be further analyzed for parameters such as topological changes, duty cycle variations, and real-time environmental behavior.
