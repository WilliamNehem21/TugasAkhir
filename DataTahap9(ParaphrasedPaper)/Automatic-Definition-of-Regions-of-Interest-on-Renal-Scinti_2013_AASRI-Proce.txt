The paper discusses the use of an image sum based on renal function and proposes a method for tracing the renal region of interest (ROI) by utilizing spatial and temporal detection of contour initialization points and employing a multiagent system to expedite the process. Additionally, it explores a semi-automatic approach for drawing the renal ROI and highlights the application of the region-growing algorithm for this purpose. Another method for generating renal ROI and evaluating renal function in a small population is also presented. Furthermore, the paper introduces the HOG3D descriptor, which is based on spatiotemporal aspects and utilizes 3D gradient orientations histograms. It explains the importance of integral image representation for gradient calculations and the use of regular polyhedra for quantifying spatiotemporal orientation. The paper describes the combination of shape and movement descriptors and presents the application of the HOG3D descriptor on video by dividing it into cells. Lastly, the paper introduces a method for computing transit time of a front at each point in the image and proposes a technique for advancing a narrow band by freezing existing pixels and inserting new ones to track the front propagation.
