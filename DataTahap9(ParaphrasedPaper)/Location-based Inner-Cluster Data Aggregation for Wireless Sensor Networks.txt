The sensor readings are sent to the base station in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Due to the nature of WSN broadcasting, neighboring nodes of the transmitter receive the transmitted messages. To minimize energy consumption, it is important to reduce unnecessary transmissions, which can be achieved through data aggregation methods. Data aggregation aims to prolong the WSN's lifetime by reducing redundant transmissions.

Numerous data aggregation schemes have been proposed for WSN. For instance, Al-Karaki et al. introduced exact and approximate algorithms for data aggregation, Aonishi et al. studied the impact of aggregation efficiency on Git routing, and Gatani et al. proposed a robust and efficient data gathering method. Additionally, Considine et al. presented approximate aggregation techniques for sensor databases, Villas et al. proposed a scalable and dynamic data aggregation-aware routing protocol, and Heinzelman et al. introduced LEACH for network clustering and cluster head election. Younis et al. also proposed HEED, considering residual energy in cluster head election.

These schemes typically involve cluster-based data aggregation with two phases: inner-cluster aggregation and fusion data transmitted to the base station. While WSN clusters are relatively small areas and sensors in close proximity typically have similar readings, most existing cluster-based schemes focus more on the second phase, with all sensors transmitting their readings to the aggregator in the first phase. In the "Location-Based Inner-Cluster Data Aggregation" (LBDA) scheme we propose, we aim to leverage these features to reduce inner-cluster transmissions.

In our proposed scheme, the cluster is divided into four regions and each node can determine which region it is located in using location information. The cluster head for each region is aware of the number of nodes in that region and selects several agent nodes for each region. Additionally, the communication range of the agent node should cover its respective region. Only nodes located in the same region with different readings from the agent node will transmit their data to the cluster head, thereby reducing a certain number of inner-cluster transmissions.
