The ongoing initiative within the EU working group Appligraph is focused on developing standardized exchange formats for graphs and graph transformation systems. The formats, based on the extensible markup language XML, aim to enable the interchange of graph-related documents across different software tools. This development is motivated by the widespread use of graph structures in various computer science applications, where a common format can facilitate interactions among software developers working on graph layout, algorithms, transformation, and reengineering. The XML-based formats are designed to support the exchange of well-defined data structures, and efforts are being made to define document type definitions (DTDs) and XML schema for graph and transformation systems. Additionally, the exchange formats aim to accommodate various types of graphs, including directed, undirected, and hierarchical graphs, as well as graph attributes. The goal is to establish a common framework that enhances interoperability among graph-based tools and ensures widespread support across the industry. These efforts are informed by the consideration of various graph models and their specific application contexts, with the ultimate aim of increasing the readability of hierarchical graphs and facilitating the exchange of graph transformation systems. Once finalized, the common XML-based formats are expected to be widely adopted and utilized within the graph transformation community, contributing to increased interoperability and facilitating the development of graph-based tools.
