The primary objective of this study was to utilize rice straw (RS) in the creation of environmentally-friendly composites by employing corn-based adhesives (CA). To achieve this, RS was subjected to treatments with NaOH and hot-water in order to assess the impact of these treatments on the performance of the resulting composites. The study also investigated the influence of composite density, starch content, and different types of starch (cornstarch, cassava starch, potato starch) on the flexural properties of the composites, alongside an examination of the microstructure of fractured surfaces. The findings revealed that composites made with cornstarch exhibited higher flexural properties. Moreover, composites derived from hot-water treated straw and cornstarch displayed superior interface quality and higher flexural properties, with peak values of flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus observed at a starch content of 10% and a composite density of 0.7 g/cm3. It was suggested that the composites developed in this study may find potential applications in ceiling panels and bulletin boards.

The utilization of straw and other agricultural residues for the production of composite materials has gained global attention. Previous research has mainly focused on using crushed agricultural residues and extracted straw fibers as the main materials for composites, as well as employing discarded tires, formaldehyde resins, and polymers as matrices for composite preparation. While these composite materials have demonstrated enhanced water resistance and acoustic insulation properties, higher internal bond strength, flexibility, and flexural strength, the process of crushing agricultural residues and extracting fiber from straw waste is energy-intensive, and the composite matrices are challenging to degrade. In this study, rice straw and various types of starch (cassava starch, corn starch, potato starch) were utilized to produce composite materials. The research highlighted the influence of composite density, starch content, and varieties of starch on flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus. Additionally, the microstructure of fractured surfaces was thoroughly examined.

In the experimental process, RS underwent extensive washing with distilled water to eliminate impurities, predominantly dust. The washed RS was then dried and stored in hermetic plastic containers to prevent microbial attack before undergoing subsequent treatments. Cornstarch adhesives were prepared by dispersing cornstarch powder in distilled water at a specific ratio and with the addition of sodium thiosulfate to prevent degradation. The resulting adhesives were then mixed with RS for composite formation.

The study identified that the flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus of the composites peaked when the density was 0.7 g/cm3, as this density allowed for appropriate moisture content, uniform starch adhesive diffusion, and complete adhesion to the rice straw. Beyond a density of 0.7 g/cm3, the flexural properties declined due to a more compact internal structure and exacerbated starch adhesive diffusion challenges.

In summary, the research underscored the potential of utilizing rice straw and cornstarch-based adhesives for the creation of environmentally sound composites, presenting applications in ceiling panels and bulletin boards. Additionally, by focusing on the influence of composite density, starch content, and varieties of starch on the flexural properties of the composites, the study provided valuable insights for the advancement of sustainable composite materials.
