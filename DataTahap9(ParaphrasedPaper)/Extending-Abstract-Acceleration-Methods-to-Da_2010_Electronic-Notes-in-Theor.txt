The paper outlines the necessity of obtaining a control graph with numerical variables exclusively and the challenge of addressing non-determinism introduced by numerical input variables when using acceleration methods. The authors propose an extension of the abstract acceleration concept to systems with numerical inputs. They highlight the importance of properly constraining state and input variables in order to accelerate loops composed of translations with resets and inputs. The paper emphasizes the significance of the control graph for logico-numerical programs, such as synchronous data-flow programs without explicit control flow, and suggests the identification of sets of states resembling timed or linear hybrid automata to facilitate abstract acceleration while preventing combinatorial explosion. Additionally, the authors discuss the use of convex polyhedra as an abstract domain for representing invariants on numerical variables.

In terms of contributions and outline, the paper extends the abstract acceleration concept to systems with numerical inputs, providing details on how to accelerate loops composed of translations with resets and inputs. The paper also touches upon the preliminary program model, operations on convex polyhedra, and the general verification framework used for analysis. Furthermore, the authors explain how the partition refinement mechanics in the nbac tool can be employed to generate a control graph manipulating only numerical variables from the program model.

With respect to future work, the authors express a need to address the issue of finding an appropriate control graph for logico-numerical programs, such as synchronous data-flow programs without explicit control flow, in order to effectively apply acceleration. They propose identifying sets of states resembling timed or linear hybrid automata to facilitate abstract acceleration while preventing combinatorial explosion. Finally, the paper discusses various operations on convex polyhedra and their application in handling translations/resets with inputs.
