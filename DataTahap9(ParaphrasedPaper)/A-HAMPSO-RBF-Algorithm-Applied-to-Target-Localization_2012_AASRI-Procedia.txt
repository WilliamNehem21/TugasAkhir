This academic paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm for radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, which incorporates a hybrid adaptive mutation particle swarm. The proposed algorithm utilizes the Hampso method to train the network structure and address the challenges associated with target localization problems. The Hampso algorithm dynamically adapts its optimization strategy by employing uniform distribution mutation and Gaussian distribution mutation to escape local optima. The paper presents a refined version of the Hampso method that accelerates convergence towards the global optimum during iterations. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed Hampso-RBF approach, the study compares it with RBF, genetic algorithm-based RBF, and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based RBF approaches. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed Hampso-RBF approach exhibits superior and faster convergence during the training process, as well as enhanced prediction ability during the validation process, compared to the other three approaches.

The literature confirms the effectiveness of radial basis function neural networks in target localization, yet optimizing their structure remains a challenging task. To address this, the paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm for radial basis function neural networks using the Hampso approach and demonstrates its feasibility and efficiency in target localization compared to PSO-RBF and GA-RBF approaches, as evidenced by computational results.

The paper presents a predictive model for target localization using radial basis function neural networks optimized with the Hampso method. The computational results highlight the superior efficiency of the proposed approach in comparison to RBF, GA-RBF, and PSO-RBF methods, suggesting potential extensions of the Hampso-RBF method to other scientific disciplines.
