Currently, the planning of transmission lines heavily relies on human decision-making and lacks intelligent capabilities. This paper proposes a method that combines the spatial data processing strengths of GIS with the optimization capabilities of genetic algorithms for transmission line planning. The integration of GIS and genetic algorithms aims to minimize human interference and efficiently solve the problem of transmission line path planning. The study constructs a transmission line optimization model based on genetic algorithms and develops a plug-in for transmission line planning using the C# language. The genetic algorithm, simulating natural evolution, quickly obtains optimal solutions for complex combinatorial optimization problems and is widely used in various fields including transmission line planning.

The study takes into account natural and artificial geographical conditions when planning power grid transmission lines. These conditions, such as topography, rivers and lakes, transportation, and land use types, influence the difficulty and cost of planning a reasonable power grid path. The paper emphasizes that the shortest path may not always be the most reasonable, and the objective is to seek the most appropriate path. Experiments show that the path planned by the genetic algorithm is the best when considering various factors.

The planning area for transmission line paths is divided into grids, with each grid assigned a cost value representing different influencing factors. The study utilizes a floating-point coding method to encode genes, which allows for the representation of a larger number, higher precision values, and improved algorithm efficiency. Additionally, a fitness function is defined to minimize the total cost of the line and evaluate the effectiveness of candidate solutions.

The algorithm evaluates individuals based on their fitness and eliminates inferior individuals while retaining diversity within the population. In experiments, the grid resolution of each layer is set to 150 m for optimal efficiency and minimal loss of terrain information.

To improve the planning results, a comprehensive and objective evaluation system is established by considering multiple factors. The transmission line optimization model based on genetic algorithms is designed, and a plug-in enabling the optimization function of genetic algorithms is developed using the C# language.
