We can bolster the mentioned argument by noting that the temporal progression is crucial in physical systems. This is underscored by the potential negative impacts on the system and its environment resulting from the breach of a constraint. This explains the significant development in the study of real-time systems, which are reliant on time-based constraints. These systems require the characterization of both the qualitative and quantitative temporal limitations.
