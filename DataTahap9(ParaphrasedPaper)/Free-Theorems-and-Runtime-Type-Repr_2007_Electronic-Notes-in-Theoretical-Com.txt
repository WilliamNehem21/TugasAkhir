The concept of polytypic programming enables the definition of type-indexed operations for various tasks such as generic parsers, pretty printers, iterators, and other operations that streamline the repetitive aspects of working with algebraic datatypes. However, due in part to its negative interactions with type abstraction, only a limited number of functional languages currently support this approach.

The discussion about representation types and parametricity has gained significance with the emergence of generalized algebraic datatypes (GADTs), which are a variant of inductive families of types initially developed in dependent type theory. GADTs allow for the implementation of representation types, providing the benefits of runtime type analysis. For instance, recent work has demonstrated how GADTs in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) can be employed to create an advanced library of datatype generic routines.
