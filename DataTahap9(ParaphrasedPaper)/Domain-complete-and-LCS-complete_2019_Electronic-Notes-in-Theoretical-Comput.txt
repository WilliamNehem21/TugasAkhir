The proof of that result is postponed until section 18. The important point is that we have a measure extension theorem for a class of spaces that includes both the continuous dcpos of domain theory and the polish spaces of topological measure theory. We will refer to such spaces as lcs-complete, and we acknowledge that this may not be the most suitable name. "Topologically complete" would have been a better name if it hadn't already been taken.

We also define a continuous complete quasi-metric space as x, d such that b(x, d) is a continuous dcpo. This is originally a theorem, not a definition. The original, more intricate definition is attributed to Mateusz Kostanek and Pawe≈Ç Waszkiewicz, and is utilized by Keimel and Lawson, and is credited to Wilker. The eighth theorem of the latter states that every KT4 space, i.e., every space in which every compact subspace is T4, is Wilker. In particular, every Hausdorff space is Wilker.

A space is completely Baire if and only if all its closed subspaces are Baire, which is a stricter condition than the Baire property. Proposition 10.3 and Corollary 10.1 together yield a generalization, extending the fact that every quasi-Polish space is completely Baire.
