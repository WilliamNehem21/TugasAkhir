When applying discounting to weighted timed transition systems, there are several options to consider. One approach involves discounting by steps, as demonstrated in previous work [14, 17], or by elapsed time, as exemplified in other research. It has been demonstrated that for an accumulated weight function within a timed transition system to adhere to a particular natural additivity property outlined in definition 2.2, there are limited options for its definition. Specifically, neither the approach involving quotients nor the step-based discounting demonstrated in previous research [14, 17] result in accumulated weight functions that are discounted over time.
