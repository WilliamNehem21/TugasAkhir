The aircraft is directed to fly to the new altitude level shown in the altitude window at the top center of the flight control panel, by adjusting the value with the alt dial in the center of the panel. Once the desired altitude is reached, the aircraft switches to hold altitude mode.

The described behaviors may appear straightforward, but they become more complex if adjustments are made to the alt dial or the vertical speed (VS) thumbwheel while a mode is already active. For instance, if the alt dial is turned while in change level mode, the new altitude becomes the target, whereas turning the VS thumbwheel transitions the aircraft to vertical speed mode.

Before discussing how this mode operates, various scenarios that it may exhibit are outlined. In each case, the scenario begins with the pilot selecting vertical speed mode with an ascent rate of 2,000 feet per minute (fpm) and a limit of 27,000 feet; the aircraft climbs as directed, and the autopilot switches automatically to capture mode as it passes through 25,000 feet. Now, if the pilot changes the alt dial to a new value while passing through 26,000 feet, the behavior for different values set in the altitude window is considered.

Regrettably, it is not feasible to achieve this. Certain autopilot behaviors depend on the relationship between a new value set in the altitude window and the altitude at which capture mode was entered. This information (i.e., the cap start altitude) is not presented to the pilot and it is therefore impossible to develop a mental model based on available information that accurately tracks the behavior of the real autopilot.

A proposed solution to avoid altitude deviation might not, in my view, support a simple and accurate mental model. Corrections that could support such a model include illuminating a light by the altitude window if a capture will occur (i.e., if limit set is true), or a more radical redesign in which turning the alt dial when in capture mode causes a reversion to level change (rather than vertical speed) mode.
