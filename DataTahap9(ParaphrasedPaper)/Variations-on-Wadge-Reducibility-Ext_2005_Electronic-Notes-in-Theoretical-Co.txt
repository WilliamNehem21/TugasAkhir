We aim to explore the extent to which the fundamental properties (or their weakened forms) of the traditional wadge reducibility are applicable in alternative spaces. For instance, we will examine circumstances under which certain substructures of the wadge ordering approach being well-ordered, identify sets that possess a supremum (or a less strict variant of a supremum) under wadge reducibility, and investigate the connection between wadge reducibility and hierarchies from earlier relevant studies [see also references [18, 19, 11, 12]].

Another potential area of focus involves investigating effective adaptations of the wadge reducibility. Indeed, this line of inquiry was initiated in previous papers [9, 10], which presented effective versions of certain findings from this paper. We also propose a comprehensive realizability framework for exploring both effective and non-effective topology jointly, which could prove beneficial in advancing our research topic.
