The research aimed to investigate the protective effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) and melatonin (MEL) against oxidative damage induced by bisphenol A (BPA) in the liver and kidney tissues of adult male rats. The findings confirmed that BPA caused liver damage, as evidenced by the significant elevation in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, which are indicative of hepatocellular damage. However, co-administration of GBE, MEL, or their combination mitigated the hepatotoxic effects of BPA, as evidenced by a decrease in AST and ALT activities. Additionally, BPA treatment led to an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the liver. However, co-administration of GBE, MEL, or their combination reversed these effects, indicating a reduction in oxidative stress. Furthermore, BPA administration resulted in elevated urea and creatinine levels, indicative of renal toxicity, but co-administration of GBE, MEL, or their combination mitigated these effects. Overall, the study suggested that GBE and MEL possess potent antioxidant properties and can protect liver and kidney tissues from BPA-induced injury in rats, restoring normal organ function and attenuating oxidative damage and inflammation. These results were supported by histopathological analyses, indicating the potential health benefits of GBE and MEL as natural antioxidants in mitigating the adverse effects of BPA exposure.
