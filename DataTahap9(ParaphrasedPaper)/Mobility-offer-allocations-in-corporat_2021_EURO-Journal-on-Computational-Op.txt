This paper introduces and addresses the Mobility Offer Allocation Problem (MOAP) in the context of an applied research project in Austria. The goal is to develop an optimization model and solution techniques for determining an integrated allocation that meets all mobility demands, maintains the vehicle fleet size, and minimizes expenses and emissions.

The research project focuses on implementing a corporate mobility concept that aims to reduce costs and environmental impacts by optimizing fleet size and electrifying the fleet. The concept seeks to provide corporate mobility for both business and private trips by integrating alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, bicycle and car sharing systems, and taxis alongside fleet vehicles. The paper highlights the following key components of the corporate mobility concept:

1. Inclusion of alternative mobility offers beyond fleet vehicles to encourage the use of low-emission transportation modes in a seamless manner.
2. Implementation of key-less access solutions to enable users to access and drive company vehicles using digital devices such as RFID chip cards or mobile applications.
3. Addressing charging scheduling for electric vehicles, with an emphasis on integrating different journey intervals and vehicle admissibility for each demand.

The paper models the MOAP as a generalized operational fixed interval scheduling problem, drawing on related work in interval scheduling and fixed interval scheduling. It describes the challenge of including various factors such as travel times, service times, waiting times, and multiple customer visits in the mobility demand modeling. Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of conflict graphs to optimize vehicle assignments and proposes heuristic solution algorithms in addition to a mixed integer linear programming model for solving the optimization problem.

The study provides insights into the computational complexity of the MOAP, demonstrating its NP-hardness and proposing algorithms for solving the problem. The proposed algorithms are implemented using Java 1.8, and numerical experiments are conducted using the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer on an Intel Xeon machine. The paper also presents the generation of random instances and the evaluation of results for different parameter combinations, demonstrating potential reductions in fleet size and increased vehicle utilization rates.

Overall, the paper contributes to the understanding and modeling of the MOAP and presents practical approaches to address the complexities associated with corporate mobility optimization.
