Service-oriented computing (SOC) is a design paradigm that has emerged from earlier paradigms such as object-orientation and component-based software engineering. Core features of services include compositionality, context-independence, encapsulation, and reusability. To enable formal design and analysis of SOC applications, several service-oriented calculi have been proposed, most of which are based on process algebras enhanced with primitives specific to service orientation. This paper presents a versatile technique for defining the structured operational semantics of Marcaspis, a Markovian extension of the Calculus of Sessions and Pipelines (CASPIS). The proposed technique elegantly handles the stochastic version of two-party synchronization, typical of service-oriented approaches, as well as the challenge of transition multiplicity while preserving important mathematical properties such as associativity and commutativity of parallel composition.

The main contribution of this paper lies in introducing a versatile technique for defining structured operational semantics for stochastic extensions of service-oriented calculi, addressing the problem of transition multiplicity and accommodating two-party CCS-like interactions characteristic of service-oriented approaches. The technique is demonstrated through the development of a Markovian extension, called Marcaspis, for the CASPIS calculus. Marcaspis facilitates integrated analysis of both qualitative and quantitative aspects of formal service specifications. The paper defines a formal structural operational semantics, serving as the basis for associating a continuous-time Markov chain with each Marcaspis specification, while naturally handling the challenge of multiple transitions leading, via the same action, to the same state.

The paper also discusses the updating of synchronization rates to ensure properties of parallel composition, such as associativity, and compares the proposed approach to related work in the field. The authors highlight that the work presented here is an initial step towards establishing a formal toolkit for the specification and verification of quantitative properties of service-oriented architectures. The future research directions include the study of stochastic modal logics for characterizing properties of services and the development of automated tools for verifying stochastic behaviors of Marcaspis processes.
