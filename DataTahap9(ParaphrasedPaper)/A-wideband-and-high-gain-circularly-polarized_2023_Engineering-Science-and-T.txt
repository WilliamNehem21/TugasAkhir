The paper discusses the performance of an antenna array when various sspp branches are activated. The array exhibits an impedance bandwidth overlap of 61.9% (3.17 to 6.01 GHz) and an ar bandwidth overlap of 40.2% (4.01 to 6.03 GHz) in two cp states, with a peak gain of 11.68 dBic.

Nevertheless, existing technologies have limitations in improving antenna bandwidth and may lead to increased size. To address this, the paper proposes a design that integrates spoof surface plasmon polariton (sspp) technology to enhance antenna performance. SSPPs have garnered significant attention in the microwave community and are em excitations that travel along corrugated metal, introducing two chamfered triangles, one of which is connected to the remaining polygonal shape. The specific parameters for the design include l1=40 mm, d1=20 mm, d2=10.7 mm, d3=9.3 mm, d4=0.7 mm, h1=42.6% (3.45 to 4.48 GHz, 4.68 to 5.57 GHz), with a peak gain of 11.68 dBic. The proposed antenna holds promise for wideband and multi-polarization wireless platforms, with potential to increase overall channel capacity and address polarization mismatch issues in complex channels.
