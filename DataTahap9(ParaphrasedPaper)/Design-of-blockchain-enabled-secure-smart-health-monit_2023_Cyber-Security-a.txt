The device referred to as a sensor is also known as a transducer, which is any device that converts one form of energy into another. It translates a physical occurrence into an electrical impulse that can be interpreted. Additionally, there are various approaches to measuring the same object. The actuator, another type of transducer, functions in the opposite manner to a sensor, utilizing an electrical impulse to carry out a physical activity. For example, a temperature sensor can detect heat, and there are different types of sensors available.

The Blockchain-Enabled Secure Smart Health Monitoring (BSSHM) system is useful for monitoring the physiological condition of a patient and transmitting the collected healthcare data to a connected health server, which can be utilized for remote health monitoring and making predictions regarding the patient's health. The secured exchange of data between smart healthcare devices and health servers is ensured through the authentication and key establishment mechanism of the BSSHM, providing protection against various potential cyber attacks.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses relevant related work; Section 3 presents an architecture related to the BSSHM, including network and threat models; Section 4 discusses various phases of the proposed framework in detail; Section 5 performs formal security verification using the automated software validation tool, Scyther; Section 6 describes the practical implementation of the framework; Section 7 discusses the blockchain implementation; and Section 8 provides concluding remarks and future research directions.

Access control in smart devices is a crucial topic for safeguarding access and securing data, and several studies and surveys have been conducted in this area. Rana et al. have proposed an access control approach and a model indicating that smart health clinical frameworks are expected to significantly impact the quality of medical care services.

The advancement of technology has enabled the development of systems that can be remotely monitored and controlled. The proposed scheme utilizes IoT to create a temperature monitoring device based on Raspberry Pi and MLX90614, allowing for smart, non-contact temperature monitoring of a subject, such as a human user or patient. The system utilizes a mouse to control the Raspberry Pi and a Wi-Fi dongle for internet connectivity. LEDs are used for device status indication, while prototyping and testing are carried out using a breadboard and jumper wires. A stable power supply is essential for the smooth execution of experiments, and ensuring component compatibility and quality is crucial.

The Raspberry Pi is a versatile, credit card-sized computer with built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a programmable GPIO header, making it ideal for educational, hobbyist, and industrial use. It can run various operating systems and is popular for a wide range of projects, including media centers, game consoles, and home automation systems.

The implementation of the blockchain phase of the BSSHM is essential for maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive healthcare data. Blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology, stores data in the form of blocks, and due to the encrypted transactions, it prevents unauthorized disclosure and updating of healthcare data.

The secure smart health monitoring system plays a crucial role in healthcare for diagnostics and treatment, and this paper presents an architecture of the Blockchain-Enabled Secure Smart Health Monitoring System, along with threat modeling, formal security verification, and a practical testbed implementation to demonstrate its real-time usability.
