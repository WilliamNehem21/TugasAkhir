The academic paper discusses the utilization of graph variables in constraint satisfaction problems, particularly in the context of metabolic pathways. It introduces the concept of set variables and explains their representation. Additionally, it compares the implementation of path constraints in the Grasper and CP(Graph) approaches. Moreover, it details the modeling of a specific problem within Grasper, outlining the use of a minimization function, subgraph relation, mandatory vertices, exclusive pairs of reactions, and weighting of the graph. The paper also describes a labeling strategy for path extension, referred to as the shortest-path heuristic.
