Various methods, such as Kronecker-based approaches, aggregation/disaggregation, abstraction, approximation, symbolic approaches, and combinations thereof, have been used for model analysis. One particularly promising approach is compositional analysis, which involves analyzing individual components of a model separately and then combining the results to obtain an overall outcome.

The primary focus of this paper is to establish the impossibility of compositional model checking for global time-unbounded CSL until formulas. This impossibility extends to both general compositional Markov models and models with product form. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the Markovian modeling framework, emphasizing product-form models, particularly those of Boucherie type. It also outlines the current limitations of compositional model checking for such models. Section 3 demonstrates the general infeasibility of compositional model checking for the CSL until operator when subformulas refer to state properties of multiple components. This holds true even for the time-unbounded case and for Boucherie product form models. Section 4 addresses the issue of model repair by rate adaptation, presenting an additional impossibility result alongside a proposition allowing for compositional model repair for a broad class of CSL global until formulas. Finally, Section 5 offers a brief summary of the paper.

Fourneau, Plateau, and Stewart consider a synchronization-free system with functional rates, where transitions of one component may depend on states of other components. They prove that the product form holds based on the kernel of transition matrices and under certain conditions. This generalizes previous findings, with the boucherie framework of competing Markov chains being one such example.

The paper also discusses compositional model checking of time-unbounded global until formulas, although this aspect remains nebulous and lacks a resolution. However, the paper highlights the inherent difficulties at this juncture and aims to address them through its contributions. It is revealed that performing compositional model checking of global until formulas, even within a Boucherie product form setting, is impossible.

Note 1 clarifies that the cases where pk= tt and qk= tt are covered by Proposition 4.3. In particular, if qk= tt, component ck remains unchanged during model repair. Additionally, the often-used eventually-operator (tt u...) is encompassed by setting all pk to tt. This demonstrates that the conditions stipulated in the proposition are practical for application.

Condition (ii) is emphasized for its importance in ensuring that if ck is in a state sk that satisfies qk, none of the other processes is blocked by ck. This means that the other processes (j/= k) can still move along the j-dimension of the state space towards their respective qj-states.
