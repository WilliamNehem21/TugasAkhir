Data analysis involves various techniques and tools for working with data. Classification and clustering are widely recognized methods in data analysis, where clustering is a multivariate technique used to group objects in a dataset into clusters or classes, with the goal of placing the most similar objects together while distinguishing them from objects in other groups. Clustering methods are commonly applied in fields such as pattern recognition, machine learning, image segmentation, medical diagnostics, and bioinformatics.

The fuzzy iterative algorithm gk, an extension of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm, was originally proposed by Gustafson and Kessel and subsequently enhanced by Babuška et al. Babuška et al. introduced an adaptive distance norm to identify different geometric shapes of clusters within a dataset when the covariance matrix fi fails to be non-singular due to the selection of the matrix ai. The distance metric in this algorithm classifies objects within a range of 143 to 341 as class 2. The algorithms K-means (KM), FCM, and GK were employed to generate two clusters. GK generated two clusters representing class 1 and class 2, with 67 and 274 samples, respectively. In this clustering, 45 samples from class 2 were incorrectly assigned to class 1, and 120 samples from class 1 were wrongly assigned to class 2. FCM generated two clusters corresponding to class 1 and class 2, containing 53 and 288 samples, respectively, with 36 class 2 samples incorrectly assigned to class 1 and 125 class 1 samples incorrectly assigned to class 2. KM also generated two clusters, with 38 and 303 samples corresponding to class 1 and class 2, respectively.

In the analysis of the liver dataset, the K-means algorithm achieved an accuracy of approximately 9.85% for cluster class 1 and 87.94% for cluster class 2. In comparison, the FCM method achieved accuracies of about 11.97% and 81.91% for class 1 and class 2, respectively, while the GK method achieved accuracies of about 15.49% and 77.38%, respectively.

The results obtained from the three methods demonstrate that the classification performance of K-means is superior, with an accuracy of 55.43%, compared to FCM and GK with 52.79% and 51.62%, respectively, for the liver disorder dataset. Similarly, in the wine dataset, the classification performance of K-means was found to be the highest, achieving an accuracy of 70.22%, compared to FCM and GK with accuracies of 68.54% and 60.68%, respectively.
