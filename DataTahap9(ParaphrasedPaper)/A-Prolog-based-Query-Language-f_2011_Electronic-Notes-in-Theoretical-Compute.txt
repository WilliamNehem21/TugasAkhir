This paper explores the application of logic programming, specifically Prolog, as a query language for querying OWL resources to retrieve both data and metadata related to a specified OWL-based ontology. The paper outlines the process of defining a query language based on a fragment of description logic, encoding the query language into Prolog using logic rules, and identifying Prolog goals corresponding to queries.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the Semantic Web framework and the use of RDF and OWL for ontology modeling, with OWL being based on the description logic (DL). Description logic is presented as a family of logics with different expressivity power, aiming to address the limitations of using first-order logic (FOL) for knowledge representation and inference. The paper also introduces the concept of reasoning and querying tasks in ontology, emphasizing the need for an inference procedure to deduce new relationships and perform instance and property retrieval.

The paper's structure includes sections on the fragment of description logic, the definition of the query language, the encoding of the query language in Prolog, and concluding remarks with future work considerations. It also introduces an inference calculus for proving description logic formulas from an ontology and inferring entailments, which is designed to be implemented in Prolog and limited to handling user-defined complex formulas.

In summary, the paper proposes a query language for OWL based on Prolog, capable of querying both data and metadata of a given ontology, and suggests potential extensions to richer fragments of description logic and OWL in future research.
