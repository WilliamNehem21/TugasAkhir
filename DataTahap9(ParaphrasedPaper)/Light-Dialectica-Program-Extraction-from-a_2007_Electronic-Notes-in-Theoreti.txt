In recent years, there has been considerable research in the area of deriving computer programs from traditional proofs. While significant progress has been made in extracting mathematical insights from classical analytical proofs (as evidenced by recent findings in the field of proof mining, for example in [17, 15, 18, 20, 22]), the meta-algorithms for program extraction implemented on computers have only been able to yield limited outcomes, primarily for small test cases. Furthermore, even in these cases, the extracted program does not necessarily represent the optimal solution.

Minlog, an interactive system for proof and program extraction, has been developed by H. Schwichtenberg and the logic group at the University of Munich. It is grounded in first-order natural deduction calculus and makes use of minimal logic as primitive, in contrast to classical or intuitionistic logic. Additional information on Minlog can be found in [11, 25].
