The language comprises two levels of formulas: classical formulas for reasoning about propositional symbols, and probabilistic state formulas for reasoning about probabilistic structures, which include probability terms denoting real numbers. The syntax of the language is expressed using BNF notation.

The validity of the presented logic is established as a sublanguage of a previously proven sound and weakly complete axiomatization, providing further details in the referenced literature.

The formal structure is noteworthy for its ability to describe the state space as a distribution of classical states, a concept arising from the study of probabilistic transition systems and relevant to reasoning about quantum systems. Two specific examples exploring these aspects will be presented in section 4.

The syntax of epctl can be derived from that of eppl, involving the introduction of ctl modalities at the level of probabilistic state formulas. The definition of classical formulas and probability terms is reiterated for clarity.

Consider the Russian roulette variant from a previous example, incorporating temporal primitives. For instance, expressing that the bullet cannot be shot before the outcome of the coin is heads is achieved as a[(( b)= 0)u(( h)> 0)]. Additionally, in a scenario where the gambler is always playing alone, the probability of self-harm asymptotically tends to 1.

While there exists a more efficient algorithm utilizing eg as a basic modality instead of af, it is not applied here. The algorithm, though exponential in the worst case, assumes the encoding of a probability distribution over valuations as a vector of probabilities. Further investigation is ongoing to identify which probability distributions can be encoded efficiently.
