The construction of middleware systems with services at the core is a key driver in the evolution of middleware systems. However, this evolution has brought forth several challenges, including the migration of execution platforms, intricate lifecycles, increased complexity of the development process, and a lack of precise definitions of concepts in service-oriented architecture (SOA) solutions. To address these issues, two primary actions are proposed in this paper.

The first action involves conducting a study of the architectural principles that govern SOA designs. The architecture should reflect the structure, behavior, and evolution of a system over time. A service-oriented system's architecture should encompass features related to business processes and organizational aspects. The integration of business models has facilitated the swift evolution and widespread adoption of SOA.

The second action entails adopting a methodological approach to reduce the complexity of the SOA development process. The model-driven approach, particularly the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) proposal, is gaining prominence as a trend that can facilitate and enhance the development of SOA solutions. Previous research presented an in-depth examination of extending the MDA proposal to support the specification of architectural modeling within a Model-Driven Development (MDD) process. As a part of this effort, a UML profile for PIM-level service-oriented architectural modeling, together with the corresponding metamodel, is introduced and illustrated using a case study.

In addition to these actions, the paper discusses related works that address SOA principles, UML profiles for service-based developments, and the application of MDA principles to SOA. The presence of service providers is justified by the necessity to integrate enterprise applications, with these providers acting as service containers responsible for presenting and managing services.

The architectural model presented identifies service entities as UML 2.0 packages, distinguishing between inner service providers (internal to the designed system) and outer service providers (external entities collaborating with the system). The roles of services and their interaction with each other, established through contracts, are also discussed.

Other research proposals related to service-oriented architectures and their limitations are examined, such as constraints on generalization to various execution platforms and the absence of comprehensive development methods. The significance of the model-driven approach in addressing issues related to SOA development is emphasized, with a focus on the need for a formal representation of concepts through an architectural description language (ADL) to capture semantics and restrictions.

Overall, the paper presents a structured approach to addressing the challenges and implications of the evolution of middleware systems based on services, emphasizing the need for robust architectural modeling and a methodological framework to streamline the development process of SOA-based systems.
