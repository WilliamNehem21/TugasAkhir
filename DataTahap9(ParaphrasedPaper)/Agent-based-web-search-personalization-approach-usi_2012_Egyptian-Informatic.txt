The internet has evolved into the largest repository of information in human history. However, the vast amount of data available has made the search process more complicated, as traditional search engines yield overwhelming results that may not be relevant due to vocabulary issues such as polysemy and synonymy. As a result, there is a growing demand for customizing web search results based on individual user preferences. This paper introduces a novel approach based on multi-agent systems to personalize web search results. The proposed approach involves creating and maintaining a dynamic user profile using initial information and implicit user feedback. Furthermore, the model optimizes user queries semantically by incorporating user profile preferences and the WordNet ontology. The paper also presents a detailed case study and simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in improving the precision of traditional search engines and addressing vocabulary issues.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of related work. Section 3 presents the conceptual view of the proposed model, while Section 4 describes the model's architecture in detail. Section 5 includes a detailed case study and an evaluation of simulation results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the research work presented in this paper.

Prominent approaches in this area aim to create a comprehensive user profile using various resources, encompassing all user preferences to personalize web search results. However, these approaches have limitations in addressing vocabulary problems and may require user involvement in maintaining and improving their profiles.

To generate personalized search results, three agents interact through well-defined interfaces using standard agent communication languages. The user provides the search query to the interface agent, which optimizes the query semantically by accessing the user profile and WordNet to retrieve related synonyms, before passing the query to the meta-search agent. The meta-search agent interacts with syntactic search engines, retrieves and filters search results, and sends them back to the interface agent. The personalized search results are then displayed to the user, who provides implicit feedback that updates the user profile. The following sections detail the internal components of the agents and their interactions.

After the meta-search agent generates personalized search results, they are passed to the results viewer component for display to the user. User actions on the displayed results, such as clicking links, bookmarking pages, and copying text, are captured by the feedback extractor component and translated into pairs of {document, action}, which are sent to the profiler agent.

The user query is semantically optimized by considering the query-related preferences, the query context domain, and the WordNet synonyms of the query term stems. The model presented in this paper provides a comprehensive solution for overcoming polysemy and synonymy issues.

The user profiler agent consists of two components: the profile builder and profile updater. The profile builder initially creates a user profile from basic information and prompts the user to specify a list of domain interests. The profile updater component continually augments the profile based on implicit feedback and updates stem weights and domains according to user interactions and the WordNet ontology.

In conclusion, this paper has introduced a model for web search personalization using multi-agent systems. The model dynamically builds and maintains user profiles while semantically optimizing queries during the web search process. Additionally, a detailed case study demonstrates the model's ability to improve search engine precision and address vocabulary issues by leveraging user preferences and WordNet ontology.
