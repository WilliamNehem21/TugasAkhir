Tuberculosis (TB) is a resurging infectious disease with significant global medical implications, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although Nigeria has made progress in increasing access to Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course (DOTS) for TB, with coverage reaching 75% by 2005 and a treatment success rate of 75% for the 2005 cohort, TB incidence in Nigeria remains high at 311 cases per 100,000 people. The conventional methods for diagnosing TB, such as physical examinations and laboratory tests, are challenged by the lack of medical facilities in many centers, particularly in developing countries.

This study proposes a decision support model for intelligent TB diagnosis using a genetic-neuro-fuzzy inferential technique, aimed at providing a platform to aid medical practitioners in delivering accurate, timely, and cost-effective TB diagnoses in developing countries. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which mimic biological neurons, have been successfully utilized in various medical areas, including diagnosis of cancer and heart problems. In addition, a combination of neural networks, fuzzy logic, and case-based reasoning has been used to model decision support systems for diagnosing depression disorders.

This study also discusses the use of structured and unstructured databases in the field of TB diagnosis, as well as the incorporation of genetic algorithms to optimize decision variables. The proposed model was simulated using a case study of 10 patients from a hospital in Nigeria, and the study highlights the potential of triangular membership functions of fuzzy logic systems and neural networks for self-tuning and adaptation in new situations. However, the model's effectiveness has only been validated using casual TB records, and the study suggests the further validation of results by obtaining real-life records of TB patients from medical clinics.

The authors express their gratitude to the management of St. Francis Catholic Hospital, Nigeria, for their cooperation, as well as Dr. Ahmed of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex for his assistance with rule-base formulation and model performance evaluation.
