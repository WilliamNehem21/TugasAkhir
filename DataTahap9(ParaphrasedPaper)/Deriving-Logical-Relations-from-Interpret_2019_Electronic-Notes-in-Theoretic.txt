The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the connection between logical relations and predicate logics. The paper first explores the conditions in which predicates in a predicate logic for reasoning about a type theory can exhibit the structure of that type theory. It then shows that similar structure on binary and n-ary relations can be derived from the structure of unary predicates. The paper also examines structure defined through monads. The approach employed in this paper involves the use of category theory, with predicate logic being formalized as a fibration over a category representing the type theory. The paper focuses on type-theoretic structure defined by adjunction (products, function spaces, and sums) and discusses monadic structure as well. The structures considered are closed under products and can always be combined into a single entity. The paper also introduces a treatment of monadic types with the intention of providing more detailed information in future work.

The paper presents a paradigmatic example of a semantic fibration as "pred." In a semantic fibration, the underlying category C represents mathematical objects, such as sets. The fiber of E over an object A of C is a class of maps into A in C, which applies to the example of "pred" as inclusions of subsets. The paper explains the decomposition of adjoints, stating that right adjoints are obtained in two parts. The first part is a Cartesian lifting, which involves substituting terms into the predicate given as an argument. The second part is an adjunction between two fibrations over the same base, depending on the existence of particular logical structure. For example, conjunction is used to give products, disjunction for sums (using the dual result for left adjoints), and implication and first-order quantification produce function spaces.

The paper considers a specific situation in the base involving a commutative square, where horizontal arrows F and G have right adjoints fr and gr. The paper discusses the adjunction of categories over F and fr, pulled back along H and K. Additionally, the paper presents a lemma and an example related to coproducts, demonstrating their application to opposite categories, which yield left adjoints rather than right.

The paper also explores the use of monads to define structure. It discusses the extension of a monad on a category representing types to a category representing a predicate logic for those types, with a focus on the condition that the unit respects a certain property in the construction of the initial lifting. The paper mentions that there are specific circumstances under which this extension is feasible.

The paper indicates that it does not address the presence of algebraic operations in the monad, noting that this will be dealt with separately in a subsequent article.
