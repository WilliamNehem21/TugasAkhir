This academic paper introduces a straightforward model of cooperative information exchange among multiple participants using propositional update semantics, presented as an abstract reduction system. Various properties of the system are explored, including confluence, normalization, properties of normal forms, and reduction strategies, along with potential applications and extensions. The paper discusses how dynamic semantics, in its broad sense, is well-suited for analyzing the pragmatics of information exchange dialogues because of its focus on the update effects of utterances and the shift of attention from individual sentences to discourse. The model is rooted in Stalnaker's theory of assertions, where individuals make private information common ground by eliminating possibilities through assertions. The paper delves into the specifics of the reduction system, explaining the rules of the information exchange "game" and its relation to achieving specific goals in dialogue. Moreover, it explores the implications of the model for the formal analysis of relevance and discusses potential extensions involving dynamic epistemic semantics and public announcements. Additionally, the paper highlights the connection between information exchange and rewriting, particularly from a representational perspective, which aligns with a more term-rewriting system-like structure.
