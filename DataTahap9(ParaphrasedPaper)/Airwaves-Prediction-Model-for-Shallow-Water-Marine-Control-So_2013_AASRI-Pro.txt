One of the primary obstacles in using marine control source electromagnetic (MCSEM) sounding for hydrocarbon detection has been the interference caused by airwaves. In shallow water, the response from the air half-space often obscures the response from the subsurface. This paper introduces a curve fitting method to identify a mathematical function or model that best represents the pattern of the airwaves data. The identified model can function as a predictive model for the behavior of the airwaves. Synthetic data are generated in a geological model that closely resembles the area from which actual MCSEM data were obtained. The performance of the prediction model is evaluated using metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), sum of square error (SSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The results indicate that an exponential decay function can effectively describe the airwaves data, yielding an RMSE of 3.1e-7, SSE of 1.3e-11, and an R2 of 0.990.

It should be noted that in the context of the exponential function's input-output behavior, the parameters "a" and "b" represent the y-intercept and the base of the function, respectively, and "x" is a random variable that determines the function's input. The requirement for "a" to be always positive is essential for the function to have real and algebraic significance, implying that "x" is also always positive. Consequently, the output values of the function, f(x), are either entirely positive or entirely negative depending on whether the sign of "b" is positive or negative. In many applications and in calculus, the common choice for the base of exponential functions is "e."

The study employs a curve fitting technique to identify a model that can serve as a predictive model for airwaves in shallow water. The analysis identifies an exponential decay function of the form f(x) = e^x as the most suitable description for the airwaves data. The results indicate that the exponential decay function achieves an R2 of 0.995, RMSE of 1.6e-7, and SSE of 3.4e-12. The high value of R2, as well as the small RMSE and SSE, suggest that this prediction model effectively conforms to the data. Since the study was conducted using simulated data, the next step would be to perform experimental work to validate the findings.
