Due to the inherent complexity of large systems, it is imperative to adopt a compositional approach (either vertically or horizontally) in their development to mitigate the issue of combinatorial explosion in specifying and verifying them (e.g., [10, 19, 3, 2, 16, 4, 5, 15]). This compositional method enables the construction of large systems by integrating existing systems using defined constructors, thereby simplifying the problem of ensuring correctness for a complex system into similar and more manageable correctness problems for its subsystems.

This process, denoted as "p" representing a production step, involves the availability of a car for the step. In this case, the process "p" will proceed to either acquire the car, adjust the motor, install the windscreen, control the car, and place it on the conveyer belt, or it will acquire the car, install the windscreen, adjust the motor, control the car, and return it. After completion, the process "p" may start again. The first option can be specified as described in [4, 5].

In their study, [4, 5] examined the compositional nature of choppy logic, an extension of classic propositional temporal logic (PTL), which introduces a chop operator. They also introduced a modal process logic that exhibits compositionality; however, this logic is limited to expressing regular properties of processes.
