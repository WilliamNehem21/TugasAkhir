To address the second research question, a feasibility analysis was conducted to aid in making investment decisions. The analysis focused on the investment in HPS projects, specifically the Zilupe and Vecogre HPS, while excluding the Mezrozite HPS due to its negative NPV and EAA values. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the wind turbine project also has negative NPV and EAA, whereas investments in HPS projects showed positive NPV and EAA.
