The study concurrently evaluates several symmetric encryption algorithms, including DES, Triple DES, IDEA, Blowfish, CAST-128, as well as stream ciphers such as RC2 and RC5, alongside the EMDS algorithm. Typically, the performance of such algorithms is assessed through simulation or mathematical methods. In this research, we present simulation results for various metrics used to gauge the performance of both proposed and existing symmetric cryptography algorithms. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of EMDS by implementing the algorithm in Java.

At present, most symmetric encryption schemes are built on the concept of the Feistel network, which involves multiple rounds comprising bit shuffling, non-linear substitutions (S-boxes), and exclusive OR operations. Here, we provide brief descriptions of various symmetric cryptographic algorithms based on the Feistel network.

The Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) was developed by Tuchman to ensure privacy and amalgamation of information during data transmission or storage. The TDEA, which applies DES at each level to protect against brute force attacks without requiring the development of an entirely new block cipher algorithm, was selected for use in financial applications in ANSI standard X9.17. It operates with either two or three keys, with the latter being more secure but also more time-consuming than DES, and is utilized by federal organizations to safeguard sensitive data. The Global Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey of ETH Zurich in 1991, was intended as a replacement for the data encryption standard. The algorithm processes 64-bit plaintext alongside a 128-bit key and generates a 64-bit block of ciphertext as output, leveraging XOR, binary addition, and binary multiplication of 16-bit integers for strength. The CAST-128 encryption algorithm, introduced in 1996 by Carliste, Adams, and Stafford Tavared of Entrust Technology, offers robust resistance to various cryptanalysis techniques and functions with a key size ranging from 40 to 128 bits, enhancing by 8 bits at each step. It operates on 64-bit blocks of plaintext to produce 64-bit blocks of ciphertext in 16 rounds, employing two subkeys in each roundâ€”namely, a 32-bit KIM and a 56-bit KRIS, while the function F is dependent on the round. The Static dictionary is available in encrypted form to both the sender and destination machines, with only authorized users capable of decrypting and making alterations to it. In contrast, the dynamic dictionary is formed at runtime and is not transmitted from the source to the destination machine, thereby reducing bandwidth usage. Key length refers to the number of characters in the encryption key, with the block ciphers discussed in this study utilizing bits in the key. Therefore, when we refer to the length of the key, we are specifically indicating the number of bits in the key. For example, if key K=1010, then the length would be 4 bits.
