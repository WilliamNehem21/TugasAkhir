The study aimed to enhance the refractory properties of Kankara clay, an alumino-silicate found in Kankara village, Katsina State, Nigeria, by blending it with coal ash to produce refractory bricks. The addition of coal ash at varying proportions (5-25 wt%) was investigated, and the resulting blend was tested for properties such as linear shrinkage, apparent porosity, bulk density, cold crushing strength, and thermal shock resistance. The measured values were compared with standard refractory properties for fireclay bricks, and it was found that the properties of the blended bricks met the recommended values for medium fireclay bricks. Therefore, the addition of coal ash improved the refractory properties of the Kankara clay, and the resulting bricks demonstrated good thermal resistance when used in the production of heat treatment furnaces.

Clay, a naturally occurring substance, is widely used in industrial applications. Refractory materials, essential in metallurgical industries, are among the products derived from clay. The production of refractory products involves raw materials such as kaolinite, chromite, magnesite, and various types of clays. Alumino-silicate and magnesite refractory products are predominantly used in metallurgical industries, and clay deposits, with varying compositions due to geological variations, are found worldwide.

The presence of high ash content in coke has implications for metallurgical processes, leading to lower carbon content, increased flux usage, and higher energy consumption for slagging. This, in turn, results in an elevated coke rate and reduced efficiency in the metallurgical process. Studies have indicated that a 1% increase in ash content in coke has a corresponding increase of 1.5-2% in coke rate, 1.5% in flux rate, and a 3-5% reduction in blast furnace efficiency.

Previous research on Kankara clay as a refractory material revealed its low refractoriness, thermal resistance, and high apparent porosity, which were deemed unsatisfactory. Consequently, there was a need to enhance the refractory properties of this clay, prompting the examination of the effects of coal ash on some refractory properties of Kankara clay.

To prepare the clay, it was soaked in water for three days, dried in open air for a week, and subsequently crushed, ground into powder, and sieved. The coal ash was also sieved to a specific particle size. Test samples were then produced by mixing the sieved clay with varying percentages of coal ash, with the resulting clay mixture found to be plastic at a 10% water content. The blend was packed into a metal molding box, pressed using hydraulic press at a pressure of 10 kg/cm2 to enhance homogeneity and surface smoothness. The resulting bricks were tested for thermal shock resistance by subjecting them to heating and cooling cycles until failure occurred.
