The detrimental impact of fluid pressure in high-speed gearing systems, particularly in the main reducer of helicopters, can be mitigated by using shrouds to enclose and approach the high-speed gears. These shrouds play a crucial role in reducing windage and pumping power losses in both axial and radial directions. This paper introduces an improved quasi-analytical method to quantify the power losses caused by windage and pumping effects, considering the gear pump characteristics and the compressibility of the air or air-oil mixture. Theoretical calculations using the improved model are compared with experimental results from open literature. By leveraging the swept volume of the gear pump, the behavior of fluids in the tooth space when the shroud approaches the gear pair can be better understood.

The study also highlights the significant contribution of gear windage and churning losses to the total energy dissipation of the gear system, particularly at speeds exceeding 100 m/s. Shrouds are commonly used to limit these losses and enhance efficiency, which is the primary focus of this paper. Additionally, the paper presents a quasi-analytical method for predicting load-independent losses in closely shrouded meshed gears, taking into account windage and pumping effects.

The paper also discusses the compression and expansion of the cavity and contact of the gear pair, highlighting the influence of fluid density, pressure, and temperature. The behavior of the air or air-oil mixture and various operating parameters are found to significantly impact the system.

Furthermore, the study examines the squeezing/pocketing behavior of the air or air-oil mixture in the tooth space of tightly shrouded meshed gear pairs. It investigates the total load-independent power losses considering windage and pumping effects and improves the theoretical calculation model based on the compressibility of fluids and subsonic compressible flow. The improvements enable estimation of total losses, including pumping and windage losses, across a range of speeds. The paper also identifies areas for follow-up research, such as investigating the influence of air flow and lubricating medium leakage in tight shrouded gear pairs. The study acknowledges funding from various sources for the research.

Overall, this paper proposes an advanced method for predicting and mitigating power losses in high-speed gearing systems, particularly when shrouds are closely approaching the gears, and establishes directions for future research in this area.
