Given these abilities, a wide range of optimization problems can be addressed using distributed computing. However, similar to numerous other heuristic techniques, the speed at which ground states are found decreases as the problem dimension increases. This poses a significant challenge for traditional methods like simulated annealing, as noted in previous research [5, 6].
