A large coal-fired power unit is a highly intricate and unpredictable system that presents challenges in modeling energy consumption, determining coal usage for power generation, and optimizing operational efficiency. The optimization problem can be framed as a model consisting of a target (e.g., maximizing power efficiency or minimizing coal consumption) and various constraints such as power load, coal quality, ambient factors, and operating conditions. While the expression of the optimization problem is clear, determining the optimal targets for operation optimization in the presence of variable boundary constraints, operating conditions, and system features poses a significant challenge.

Advancements in measurement, monitoring, and information technologies have paved the way for optimizing the operation of power units by incorporating data processing, uncertainty quantification, intelligent modeling, and expert system development. Techniques such as clustering and fuzzy rules-based methods are employed in process control and parameter optimization, while neural network (NN) and support vector regression (SVR) methods are utilized to model NOx emissions from coal-fired boilers and optimize operation parameters using ant colony optimization (ACO) and genetic algorithm (GA) methods. These developments serve as a valuable reference for the operation optimization of power plants.

When using the SVR model, the choice of kernel function type, kernel function parameter, and penalty coefficient significantly impacts the accuracy, complexity, and generalization ability of the model. Hence, it is crucial to carefully select and optimize these parameters.

The genetic algorithm (GA) is a powerful optimization algorithm inspired by Darwin's theory of natural selection and biological evolution. It is characterized by its global optimization capabilities, robustness, and wide range of applications in machine learning, process control, economic forecasting, and optimization. GA comprises seven main components: string encoding, initialization, fitness function evaluation, selection operation, crossover operation, mutation operation, and termination criterion.

The optimization process involves the following initial parameter settings: defining the population size, selection operation, crossover operation, mutation operation, and the termination generation for the GA algorithm. In this study, a 600MW subcritical coal-fired power unit with a specific boiler and steam turbine configuration is chosen as the case unit. Various operational parameters and GA settings are specified, such as population size, coding method, crossover probability, mutation probability, and the number of generations for evolution.
