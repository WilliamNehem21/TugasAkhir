First-order entailment (FDE) is a logical system formulated by Priest which can be configured in various ways, including as a 4-valued logic with truth values labeled as t (true only), f (false only), b (both), and n (neither). According to this system, negation maps t to f, vice versa, n to itself, and b to itself, while conjunction and disjunction correspond to greatest lower bound (glb) and least upper bound (lub) operations, respectively. The designated values, denoted as d, are {b, t}, representing the four corners of truth. The FDE logic appears to be a suitable fit for this configuration. To maintain consistency with previously introduced logics, we will represent the values f, n, b, t as 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively.

The resulting logic from this modification of FDE is evidently a proper sub-logic of FDE. Upon examination, it is evident that all the rules of FDE preserve designation except for the rule for disjunction-introduction, which is illustrated by a counter-model. This can be rectified by replacing it with the following rules:

A 3-valued logic pertains to any of several multi-valued logic systems where three truth values are employed to indicate true, false, and an indeterminate third value. This new third value can be characterized as neither false nor true (n). The conceptual development of 3-valued logics, as well as its fundamental concepts, was initially conceived by Jan Lukasiewicz and C.I. Lewis.
