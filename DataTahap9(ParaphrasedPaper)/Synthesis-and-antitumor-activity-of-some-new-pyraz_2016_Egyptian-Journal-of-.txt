A new set of compounds, including pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile and pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3carbonitrile derivatives, was produced by reacting 5-amino-1-tosyl-1h-pyrazole-3,4-dicarbonitrile, a key starting material, with various electrophilic and nucleophilic reagents. The chemical structures of the newly synthesized compounds were verified using modern analytical methods such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS). The cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds against human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma cells (HEP2) was then assessed. Compounds 3 and 4 demonstrated the most significant cytotoxic effects among those tested.

The reaction process involved several steps. For example, p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and tetracyanoethylene were combined in ethanol, and the resulting mixture was refluxed and then cooled to yield a white precipitate. In another step, compound 2 was suspended in pyridine, to which carbon disulfide was added drop by drop. The reaction mixture was then heated and subsequently processed to obtain the desired product. Similar reaction procedures were employed for the synthesis of other compounds such as 8, 9, 10, 13, and other derivatives. Additionally, the obtained products were characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) to determine their chemical structures and confirm their identities.

The formation of specific compounds, such as the 4-imino-5phenyl-6-thioxo-1-tosyl-1h-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine derivative, was confirmed using NMR spectroscopic analysis, which revealed distinctive chemical shifts and signals corresponding to specific functional groups and protons within the molecular framework.
