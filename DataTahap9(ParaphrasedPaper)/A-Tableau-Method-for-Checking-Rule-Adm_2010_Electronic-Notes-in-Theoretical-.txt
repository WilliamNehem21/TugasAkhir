The key result of this paper is that models chn(s4) and their definable variants exhibit the co-cover property. The admissible rules for s4 can be characterized by the class of models with the co-cover property as demonstrated in a more general result in [18, theorem 3.5.1]. Similar characterization results for ipc can be found in [9, theorem 4.1(iv)] and [10, corollary 3.14].

The time complexity of the algorithm is bounded by a doubly-exponential function in the length of r, with step 1 being achievable in polynomial time, step 2 in exponential time, and step 3 in exponential time. Further complexity analysis based on the techniques from [8, 9] suggests that the rule admissibility problem for s4 is conexptime-complete.

We can eliminate all existential quantifiers preceding the p-quantifiers in the formulae using skolemization, allowing us to omit the quantifiers of p. Additionally, we can split long formulae into two parts.

The generated calculus t can be refined by moving negated conclusions in certain rules up to premise positions. This refinement can preserve soundness and constructive completeness, as outlined in [22, theorem 3].
