The gear train is mounted on a support frame and has a transmission ratio of 1:2. One end of the reciprocating mechanism of the manipulator is attached to the manipulator, while the other end is linked to the gear train and the output shaft of the transmission case. When the manipulator picks up plug seedlings, the transmission case drives the crank to rotate, enabling the manipulator to pick up and discharge the plug seedlings repeatedly.

For the transplanting process, 128 plants were transplanted in a single row. The first 8 plants were removed, and the subsequent 120 were continuously monitored. The counts for missed, replanted, lodged, exposed, buried, and injured seedlings were recorded, and various key performance indicators such as coefficient of variation (CV) of plant spacing, missed transplanting rate, qualified rate of planting perpendicularity, and qualified rate of planting were calculated.
