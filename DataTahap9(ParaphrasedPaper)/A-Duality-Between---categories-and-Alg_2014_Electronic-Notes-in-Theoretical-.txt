In the field of domain theory, Stralka and Lawson discuss two fundamental dualities. The first duality exists between the category of partially ordered sets (posets) and the category of algebraic domains, from which other dualities can be derived. The second duality is between the category of domains (i.e., continuous directed complete partial orders) and the category of completely distributive lattices.
