The paper presents a perspective on argumentation modeling in which attacks between abstract entities are delineated. Dung's work has introduced essential concepts, such as argument admissibility, which have been widely embraced by the computational argumentation community. The concept of argument admissibility is based on the idea that to accept a claim, one must not only have a supporting argument for it, but also justify rejecting all conflicting arguments. Unlike in logic, where reasoning pertains to inference within an argument, in argumentation, the reasoning process also involves interactions between arguments.

This section provides an overview of the key definitions related to abstract argumentation frameworks, with a particular focus on formulating abstract argumentation semantics using labellings. The discussion is limited to finite argumentation frameworks in this work.
