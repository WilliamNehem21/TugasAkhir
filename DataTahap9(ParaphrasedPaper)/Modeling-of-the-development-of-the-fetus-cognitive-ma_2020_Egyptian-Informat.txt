The encoding of object-to-object relations (allocentric) can result in imperfect representations of environments in memory if there are imperfections in the encoding process. Some research on cognitive maps suggests that they enable individuals to orient themselves in familiar environments and navigate from one place to another, even in parts of the environment they have not previously visited. However, others argue that cognitive maps are not a unified, integrated representation, but rather consist of discrete elements such as landmarks, route segments, and regions. Numerous studies have focused on high-level cognitive maps in adults, exploring how individuals navigate from one route to another, link routes to move between locations, and vary in their ability to form cognitive maps. However, there is a lack of research on the origin of cognitive maps during the fetus stage, despite evidence that fetuses can move their hands to engage in behaviors like sucking their thumbs and grabbing their umbilical cords, indicating early recognition and spatial learning abilities. This suggests that fetuses may form simple cognitive maps that enable them to reach different objects in the womb. Proprioception and perceptual learning are thought to influence the development of cognitive maps. Studies have shown that proprioception impacts the time required to use spatial representations, whereas factors such as visuospatial abilities can influence the accuracy of spatial representations. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that the pressure felt from tactile sensations influences proprioception, and the resulting sensory data is processed to generate perceptions and proprioceptions. In this process, perceptions and proprioceptions obtained from various sensory neurons are collected in a mechanoreceptors-association map, where association links are created to connect coexisting perceptions. These pairs of proprioceptions and perceptions represent positions in the cognitive map.
