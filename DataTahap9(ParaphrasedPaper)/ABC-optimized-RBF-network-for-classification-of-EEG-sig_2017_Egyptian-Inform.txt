The human brain produces electrical signals that can be detected and analyzed to identify various brain disorders. These signals, known as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, were used in this study to analyze epileptic disorders in the brain. The research integrated artificial bee colony (ABC) and radial basis function networks (RBFNN) to improve the classification of these signals. The study employed the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique to extract features from the EEG signals, and a modified ABC algorithm was used to train the RBFNN. Specifically, the onlooker bees in the modified ABC algorithm were selected through binary tournament, and various kernels such as Gaussian, multi-quadric, and inverse-multi-quadric were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the method for classifying healthy segments, seizure-free segments, and seizure segments. The experimental results showed that the RBFNN with inverse-multi-quadric kernel trained with the modified ABC algorithm outperformed other configurations.

A novel algorithm for training RBFNN using ABC was proposed in this study to enhance its performance. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the materials and methods used, including the proposed algorithm for RBFNN training; Section 3 presents the proposed work; Section 4 describes the experimental studies and analyzes the outcomes; and Section 5 concludes the article with discussion on research issues.

The EEG data for epileptic seizure identification were collected from publicly available online resources. These data were categorized into five types (sets A, B, C, D, and E), with each set containing 100 single-channel EEG segments of 23.6 seconds duration. The data underwent preprocessing to remove artifacts caused by eye or muscle movements. Sets A and B were obtained from healthy patients with eyes open and closed, respectively, while sets C, D, and E were obtained from epileptic patients, with sets C and D recorded during seizure-free activity and set E containing seizure activity.

The study involved three combinations of EEG signal sets: A & E, D & E, and A, D & E. These datasets were used for classification work, and the performance of RBFNN was examined using the gradient descent learning algorithm. Additionally, different basis functions were evaluated for their performance, with Gaussian and inverse-multi-quadric functions demonstrating superior performance compared to the multi-quadric function. The study also extensively investigated the use of the ABC algorithm to enhance the performance of RBFNN.
