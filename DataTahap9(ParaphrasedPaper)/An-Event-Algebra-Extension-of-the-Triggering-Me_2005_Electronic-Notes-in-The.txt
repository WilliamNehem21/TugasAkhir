The paper introduces the use of event algebra to define complex triggering conditions in system design. This algebra is characterized by simple declarative semantics and well-documented properties, allowing for both formal and informal reasoning about the system. Additionally, it facilitates efficient implementation of triggering condition detection with limited resources, which is crucial for embedded applications.

The proposed approach in the paper involves incorporating detection of complex event patterns into the component model. This allows for high-level specification of complex triggering conditions with well-defined formal semantics, supporting formal analysis at design-time when access to component source code is restricted. Furthermore, the paper outlines how the event algebra is integrated into the extended component model and discusses its formal semantics and impact on the system design.

The paper is structured as follows: it begins by surveying related work in Section 2 and provides an overview of saveccm in Section 3. Section 4 describes the proposed extension, including an informal introduction to the event algebra. A more formal presentation of the event algebra and its implications for the extended component model are outlined in Section 5. Lastly, Section 6 concludes the paper.

The paper also discusses component technologies such as Koala and Robocop, as well as the PECOS project, which focuses on developing technology for field devices. Additionally, it mentions event detection mechanisms in large distributed systems and their architecture based on event subscribers and publishers, providing examples of systems that utilize event algebra for registering event patterns.

The paper also delves into the triggering process at the system level, discussing component activation, event streams, and the allocation of components to tasks at compile time. The proposed extension to the triggering mechanism allows for more complex triggering conditions to be specified using event algebra, and the paper outlines informal descriptions of the algebra operators and their incorporation into the saveccm model. Additionally, it discusses the formal semantics and important properties of the algebra.

The paper concludes by discussing the current semantics of the event element, the overhead introduced by auxiliary components, potential improvements to the event element semantics, and ongoing work to enhance the prototype tool's efficiency and evaluate the proposed methods through case studies.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the benefits of incorporating event algebra into the component model to facilitate system design analysis and improve the efficiency of event detection activities.
