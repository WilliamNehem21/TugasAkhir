There is currently no equivalent approach for general iteration. This may be because there is no clear inductive definition of the domain of general iterates, in contrast to primitive iterates and functions definable by primitive recursion, which can be easily defined by induction on the carrier of a Peano algebra. Nonetheless, general iteration has been addressed using closure theory, iteration theories, and coalgebras in algebraic treatments.
