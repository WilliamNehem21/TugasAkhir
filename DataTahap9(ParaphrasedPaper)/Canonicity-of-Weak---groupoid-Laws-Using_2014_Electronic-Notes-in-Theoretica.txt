The abstraction theorem is established through an inductive proof on derivations. The proof of statement (a) is straightforward in each case. Given that the handling of other rules is conventional, we will only focus on the rules relating to identity types here. Although we will not provide a detailed explanation here, the treatment of conversion utilizes a previous lemma.

As described in section 5.4, the parametricity translation effectively extends to inductive families. The approach involves translating an inductive type, denoted as i, to a new inductive type, ir, whose constructors are the translations of the constructors of i. Similarly, the elimination scheme for ir corresponds to the translation of the elimination scheme for i.
