Sangiorgi and Pous conducted a study on up-to techniques, initially focusing on binary relations and later extending their investigation to complete lattices. Their main goal was to identify composable enhancements that could improve modularity. This exploration resulted in the definition of a subclass of compatible enhancements, which is closed under function composition and union. Pous further demonstrated the practical significance of the greatest compatible function, also known as the companion, as a modular criterion for the validity of up-to techniques. His work showed that any function, regardless of its compatibility, below the companion can serve as an up-to technique, and this relationship is preserved under composition and union.

The concept of the companion has been extensively studied and characterized, including its exploration as a categorical object. In subsequent work by Danielsson, the companion was connected to size-preserving functions, a type of up-to technique proven to be valid using types.

The remainder of the paper introduces the fundamental concepts and terminology used in the study. Section 3 introduces the diacritical companion, and section 4 extends its application to higher-order settings, using it as a proof technique to establish that a given pair of functions is below the first-order diacritical companion. The paper concludes in section 5. The theoretical aspects (but not the examples) have been formalized in the Coq proof assistant, and the developments can be accessed at the provided link.

In their prior work, the researchers defined compatibility not only for individual functions but also for sets of functions, allowing for a robust evolution from a strong candidate to a regular one in the case of active progress. This is demonstrated through the definition of strong evolution in section 2.1. To achieve this, up-to techniques were decomposed into pairs of monotone functions (s, f), where s is applied after passive progress and f is applied after active progress.

By considering pairs of functions, the distinction between strong and regular up-to techniques described in section 2.1 was generalized. This decomposition allows for the definition of evolution between two pairs (s, f) and (sj, fj), where s evolves towards fj in the case of active progress.

With regards to first-order intuition, the enhancements allowed after passive evolution are contained in u, while those after active evolution are found in w. Specifically, ustr contains the enhancements allowed after the evolution of the strong component s, and uwk those after the weak component f. Due to the asymmetric nature of active evolution, wwk is used for both components. These functions combine s and f in different ways, and the paper seeks to determine which combinations are allowed in various scenarios. This is achieved with the help of an auxiliary lemma.

As noted earlier, the existing properties of uwk do not support the composition of strong candidates on the right. However, the paper demonstrates that this property can be restored by slightly strengthening the hypotheses of corollary 4.3.
