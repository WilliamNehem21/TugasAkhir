The protein actin serves as the building block for actin filaments, which are a major component of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. The dynamic processes of actin, such as the polymerization of actin monomers into filaments and vice versa, play a crucial role in various cellular functions, including cell motility and phagocytosis.

The stochastic pi-calculus is a process algebra that applies stochastic rates to processes. Using the stochastic pi-calculus machine (spim) tool, computer simulations can be conducted to observe changes over time in the populations of different species within a modeled system. Compositional process models of actin polymerization are developed, reflecting the varying complexities of actin dynamics based on the capabilities of actin monomers. Through simulations using these models, the emergent behavior of a meshwork of actin filaments acting in concert can be observed. The paper presents a demonstration of how filaments built from monomers can be easily modeled as processes, even when monomers have different states or binding capacities. Additionally, the paper introduces an extension to the spim tool with geometric plotting capabilities, enabling the simulation of both biochemical species populations and their spatial distribution over time with respect to individual species parameters. This novel form of computational modeling lays the groundwork for creating models that accurately reflect the behavior of the modeled systems in geometric space.

In the model, each actin monomer is represented as a stochastic pi-calculus process, with the monomers binding and unbinding at their barbed and pointed ends. The process model also includes the formation of dimers and polymers, resulting in linear actin filaments. Simulations are then run to observe the collective behavior of systems with varying numbers of monomers and filaments evolving over time. The filaments are parameterized by coordinates, representing abstract locations for geometric plotting and generating movies illustrating actin polymerization based on the simulation results. The models of actin polymerization aim to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying actin-dependent cellular events and may serve as a template for similar complexation models.

Processes in the model are viewed as choices between zero or more processes, with a process having the ability to perform input/output actions on a channel or delay. Processes can be composed using parallel composition, allowing for the gradual construction of larger models.

The paper also discusses the modeling of complexation of biological species using processes, providing a detailed example of how processes a and b can interact to form the ab complex. The paper presents a simple model of a polymer as the complexation of a potentially unlimited number of single monomers, capturing the states of the monomers and their interactions.

The mechanisms involved in actin assembly, including the role of ATP/ADP, are incorporated into the model to reflect the biochemical systems at play. The model includes the hydrolysis of ATP molecules and the dissociation of phosphates, influencing the assembly and disassembly of actin subunits in branched networks. The output of the simulations includes both changes in the number of processes for biochemical species and their geometric representation evolving over time, which is important for analyzing actin polymerization in the context of cellular events such as motility and phagocytosis.

The extension of the models with further aspects of actin monomers and filaments is also discussed, highlighting the importance of incorporating the spatial and directional aspects of the growth of filaments into the models.

The author's analysis of the models as a composition shows that they can describe a single component of the system as a module of internal states and run multiple instances of this component in parallel to simulate the emergence of polymers of arbitrary lengths. This contrasts with previous models of actin dynamics, where each polymer of a given length needed to be explicitly modeled.

The paper also indicates that the author is working on integrating additional components, such as ADF/cofilin and profilin, into the models to represent the complex mechanisms involved in actin polymerization. These models could potentially be integrated into models of other biological systems to generate hypotheses for wetlab experiments. Future work may include incorporating an analysis of actin filament length and combining the presented models with other models to study actin-related signaling pathways in processes such as phagocytosis. The geometric plotting tool is highlighted as not only contributing to the analysis of the models but also serving as a useful debugging tool for providing precise descriptions of simulation events.
