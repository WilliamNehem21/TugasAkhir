Boolean networks have garnered significant attention as a qualitative modeling technique in the academic literature. These networks consist of a set of regulatory entities that can exist in one of two states: active (1) or inactive (0). While boolean networks have proven effective in modeling genetic regulatory networks, their practical application is impeded by several limitations. Historically, synchronous semantics have been preferred due to their deterministic nature, despite the fact that their assumption of synchronous updates is considered biologically unrealistic. On the other hand, asynchronous semantics, although more realistic, also present limitations, including overly rich behavior and high non-determinism.

In light of these shortcomings, this paper advocates for the use of signal transition graphs (STGs) as an alternative formalism to capture both the behavior of the circuit and its environment in a natural manner. STGs, which are a type of Petri nets, offer a way to represent the interaction between a system and its environment. The paper presents a method to translate a circuit into an STG and then refine the STG into an SI (semi-automatically refinable) model. The constructed STGs exhibit deadlock-freeness and universal state coding, making them amenable to automated analysis techniques such as model checking. The research is supported by grants from EPSRC, BBSRC, and the Royal Academy of Engineering/EPSRC post-doctoral research fellowship, as well as the Newcastle Systems Biology Resource Centre.

The application of STGs and asynchronous circuit techniques in the context of modeling biological systems represents a novel approach, distinct from the widely considered application of Petri nets. This provides a formal framework for the development and refinement of realistic qualitative models of genetic regulatory networks.
