A set of vertices G is defined such that each vertex in G has at least one neighboring vertex in set S, and no two vertices in G share the same set of neighbors in S. In situations where a device may fail to detect an intruder at its own location, it is necessary to install an additional device in its proximity. An approach to analyze such scenarios involves utilizing open neighborhood sets, which may possess advantageous additional properties, such as being open-independent, dominating, open-dominating, or open-locating-dominating.

Previous research has explored various parameters in complementary prisms, including independence, distance, and domination. The recognition algorithm for complementary prisms has been discussed by Cappelle et al., and Duarte et al. have investigated algorithmic and complexity properties of complementary prisms concerning cliques, independent sets, domination, and convexity. This study delves into open-independent and open-locating-dominating sets in the complementary prisms of graphs. The research has presented diverse properties and bounds on open-independent sets in complementary prisms, and complete solutions have been obtained for the cases of cliques, paths, and cycles. The main finding is that if the girth of G is at least five, then... (remainder of the text not provided).
