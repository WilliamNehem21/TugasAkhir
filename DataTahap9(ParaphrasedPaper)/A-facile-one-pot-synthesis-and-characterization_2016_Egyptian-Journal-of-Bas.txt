The paper discusses the preparation of sodium selenosulfite (Na2SeSO3) using a microwave-enhanced method, which is considered safer and more cost-effective compared to the use of Na2Se or H2Se. The advantages of microwave-enhanced reactions, such as ease of product property control, high product yields, temperature and pressure regulation, high product purity, short reaction time, and environmental friendliness, are highlighted. The authors also outline the use of a low-temperature microemulsion environment to prevent aggregation and ensure uniform size distribution of the prepared Ag2Se nanoparticles. The synthesis of Ag2Se nanoparticles is described in three steps, involving the formation of a transparent microemulsion, addition of AgNO3 to the solution, destruction of the microemulsion, extraction and washing of the nanoparticles, and dispersion in n-hexane for storage. The role of capping ligands in preventing crystal aggregation and influencing nanoparticle morphology is also discussed, with emphasis on the potential for controlling nanocrystal growth by adjusting reaction temperature and the nature of the ligand.
