The purpose of this study was to investigate the production of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) in 29 bacterial strains isolated from the sediments surrounding mangrove trees in the Ras Mohamed area on the Red Sea coast, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. It was found that two of the bacterial strains had the ability to produce EPSs, with isolate no. 12 yielding a higher quantity. The strain was identified as being closely related to Bacillus altitudinis. The EPS produced was characterized as a heteropolysaccharide containing mannuronic acid, glucose, and sulfate. In addition, gel permeation chromatography was utilized to determine the molecular weight of the EPS.

EPSs are long chains of high molecular weight polymers produced by various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and blue-green algae. Bacterial EPSs exhibit significant structural diversity, and their novel biological properties make them valuable as natural polymers with numerous biotechnological applications. Microbial EPSs are widespread in extreme marine environments, where they play essential roles in microbial survival. The functions attributed to EPSs are predominantly protective in nature, and their specific roles depend on the ecological functions of the microorganisms in their respective environments. EPSs can support microbial communities in enduring extreme conditions such as temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability, and form a barrier between bacterial cells and their surroundings.

Given the rising antibiotic resistance due to the misuse of commercial antimicrobial drugs, there is a growing interest in exploring new antimicrobial agents from various sources with greater potency and fewer side effects.

In this study, marine sediment was obtained from the rhizosphere of mangrove trees (Avicennia marina) in Ras Mohamed, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. The sample was serially diluted in sterile water, and then plated on a medium containing specific components. The process involved calculating periodate consumption based on absorbance change, monitoring formic acid products, and further steps to extract and analyze the EPS produced.

The purified EPS tested negative for protein content and was found to be composed of mannuronic acid and glucose in a molar ratio of 1:2.2. The chemical composition indicated the presence of uronic acid (14.26%) and sulfate (15.47%).

The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of EPS production in bacterial strains isolated from marine sediments, particularly in extreme environments, and highlight the potential for EPSs in various biotechnological applications.
