The most suitable model we developed for examining the Hancke-Kuhn protocol utilizes a modified symbolic model incorporating basic probabilistic guessing. This model maintains the assumption of perfect cryptography for the standard cryptographic primitives used in the protocol, especially for the keyed hash function. In a probabilistic context, the perfect cryptography assumption implies that the output distributions of the relevant cryptographic primitives are statistically indistinguishable from the uniform distribution. Assuming this for the hash function used in the protocol brings us close to the random oracle assumption commonly used in computational analyses. There is a sense in which the random oracle assumption can be seen as the probabilistic version of the perfect cryptography assumption.

In related work, the closest relative of the PDL formalism, which underpins this work and is briefly summarized in Section 3, is PCL. Both formalisms draw inspiration from strand spaces in spirit and in execution models, although the logical methods diverge. Our probabilistic extension of PDL predates the probabilistic extension of PCL and the probabilistic extension of strand spaces, each with different intents and implementations, conceptually and technically. It would be worthwhile to explore these differences more closely, as certain tasks may benefit from combined modeling methods.

Early security analyses of distance bounding protocols date back to the early 1990s, but interest in this type of authentication has recently resurged due to the need for device pairing and proximity authentication in pervasive networks. The fundamental idea of distance bounding is to combine cryptographic authentication tools, such as hashes or signatures, with a physical constraint, such as limited message exchange speed. Most distance bounding protocols implement this combination using two channel types: standard network channels for cryptographic authentication and timed channels for rapid response. The Hancke-Kuhn protocol is notable for its simplicity and the transmission of both cryptographic data and rapid response on the timed channel. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of information leakage, making the security analysis compelling.

In the context of probabilistic analyses, it is often convenient to disregard events of negligible probability, as every subterm of every term in every security protocol can theoretically be guessed, although these probabilities are usually tolerably small and negligible functions of a security parameter. Tracking all terms and subterms with negligible probability in a protocol analysis can generate a lengthy list without revealing anything of significance. This section provides a basis for formal probabilistic reasoning up to negligible factors.

We have introduced a framework for extending algebraic cryptographic models to probabilistic models and used it to develop a probabilistic extension of the protocol derivation logic. We have demonstrated its application in the analysis of the Hancke-Kuhn distance bounding protocol and anticipate its utility in analyzing other protocols that rely on weak cryptography to leverage non-standard communication channels.
