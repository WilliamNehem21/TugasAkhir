In a thought-provoking inquiry into the subject at hand, the author Z. Xia developed an interactive student network for a cohort of twelve students at Suzhou No.3 High School (see Section 1.4 below). By utilizing this network, students were able to exchange information with one another, thereby creating a novel learning environment and fostering greater interaction among the students. The interactive student network concept, akin to a wireless network system, is expounded upon. Furthermore, the necessity to analyze data derived from these networks is underscored, drawing upon various methodologies employed in modern sciences, including rough set theory, which has found practical application in information and computer sciences. Notably, the paper emphasizes the examination of the completeness of interactive student networks while deferring the discussion of their establishment to future research, thus posing an intriguing question that could implicate mobile communication projects or virtual organization frameworks.
