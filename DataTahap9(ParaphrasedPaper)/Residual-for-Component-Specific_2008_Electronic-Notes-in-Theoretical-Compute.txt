The paper aims to tackle the challenge of component reuse by presenting a technique known as the quotient operation. By leveraging modal and acceptance specifications to describe behavioral interfaces, this operation computes a residual specification that, when combined with the given component, meets the overall system specification. The study demonstrates how this technique can account for weak forms of liveness constraints. Additionally, the paper introduces modal and acceptance specifications as formalisms for behavioral interface description, offering insights into their ability to express liveness properties. It then defines a quotient operation for each formalism to address the issue of behavioral component reuse. The paper investigates two types of component composition: synchronous composition and mixed product with internalization of events. It is organized into sections covering preliminaries, modal specifications, formalization of residual specifications, quotient of modal specifications, enhancements through acceptance specifications, and the quotient operation involving mixed product with internalization of events. Finally, the paper includes an example and outlines potential avenues for future research. The work is influenced by the design of component interfaces using interface automata and the refinement of intended behavior using acceptance automata, with potential adaptations of acceptance specifications in the case of regular prefix-closed language support.
