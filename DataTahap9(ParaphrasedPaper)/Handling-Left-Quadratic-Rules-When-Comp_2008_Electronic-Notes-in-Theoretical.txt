The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces notations and the basic completion approach, Section 3 presents the main theoretical contributions, Section 4 describes a family of examples and related security issues, and finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

Firstly, it is noted that the criteria defined in previous work does not accommodate the management of the xor non-left linear rule. Additionally, the restriction of xor operations to typed terms in the approach described in previous work was to address the xor non-left linear rule, but it is known that some protocols are susceptible to type confusing attacks. The approach introduced can be applied to different types of transition systems and can handle exponentiation algebraic properties to analyze Diffie-Hellman based protocols.

The paper proposes an extension of the completion procedure to handle left-quadratic rules, allowing for the analysis of reachability problems using polynomial steps rather than exponential automata determinization steps in other applications. It is acknowledged that the approach presented for quadratic rules can be extended to more complex transition systems, and there is intention to optimize the technique, as polynomial complexities are preferred over exponential complexities but may still lead to large automata. The authors have been implementing the techniques in an efficient rewriting tool to facilitate investigation of complex systems through backward analysis.

The authors have previously worked on automatic detection of attacks on cryptographic protocols as evidenced by the work titled "Automatic Detection of Attacks on Cryptographic Protocols: A Case Study" published in the International Conference on Intrusion and Malware Detection and Vulnerability Assessment in 2005.
