This paper introduces a method for organizing knowledge in a computer-based training (CBT) system based on information entropy, aimed at improving the system's intelligence and efficiency. By analyzing the relationships between knowledge forms and using information entropy calculations, the paper proposes a method to build a knowledge base and identify problematic knowledge forms that hinder training. This involves using information entropy and combination entropy calculations to retrieve and construct knowledge chains that contribute to training failure, and reorganizing them into the learner's training knowledge base. The paper also presents an algorithm for secondary organization of the knowledge base, which automatically eliminates training knowledge that learners have already mastered, thereby enhancing the CBT system's effectiveness.

The organization of the knowledge base leverages insights from cognitive research, particularly in the context of BINC (biological technology, information technology, nano-technology, and cognitive technology) as summarized by Professor Chen Qing-quan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The development of digital learning from a transmission and behavioral paradigm to a constructivist cognitive paradigm and then to the situational cognitive paradigm is also discussed by Yu Sheng-quan.

The paper discusses the limitations of existing methods such as fuzzy mathematics, rough set theory, and gray system in relation to knowledge reasoning in CBT systems, and highlights the potential of information entropy, as introduced by Claude Elwood Shannon. Shannon's concept of information entropy, formulated in 1948 as part of the mathematical theory of communication, has found applications beyond communication theory, spanning fields such as statistical mechanics, probability theory, communication theory, and algorithm complexity in computer science.

In the context of knowledge element searching, the paper discusses the measurement of uncertainty and probability in relation to knowledge elements that impact training failure, emphasizing the role of information entropy. The paper also proposes a knowledge element search algorithm based on cognitive science perspectives, which aims to enhance the intelligence of CBT systems and improve their availability and efficiency. The proposed algorithm has been tested in the development of an intelligent computer-based aircraft maintenance training system, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. However, the paper acknowledges the need to address specific details such as the division of knowledge element particle size and weight coefficients in future work to further enhance the system.
