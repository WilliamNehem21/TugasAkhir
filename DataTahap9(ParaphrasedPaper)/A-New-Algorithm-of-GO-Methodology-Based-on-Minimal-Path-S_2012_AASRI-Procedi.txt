The system reliability can also be assessed by identifying minimal path sets, which are sets of components that must all function for the system to operate. The Go methodology defines seventeen types of operators (1-17), each representing a specific component, with signal-flows denoting the connections between the operators. Three types of operators in the set represent logical relationships among signals, with each having at least two input signals. When determining minimal path sets in a Go chart, logical operators need to be processed. For example, if the chart includes a type 2 operator (representing an OR gate), the operator and the subsequent ones are added to form a single signal before the gate. If the chart includes a type 10 operator (AND gate), the signals before the gate are combined into one, and the redundant operators within these signals are deleted. Similarly, if the chart includes a type 11 operator, the pertinent operators are modified accordingly.

The Go methodology model is easily constructed based on a functional diagram of a water supply system. The specific type of operator assigned to represent each component is determined based on the function of the water supply system components. For example, the water source, powers, and drive signals are all represented by type 5 operators, while the control signal to the electric pump is represented by a type 6 operator. In this context, the primary input signal is from the water source, and the secondary control signal is the output of the power. Similarly, the control valves respond to control signals and are also represented by type 6 operators, while the check valves, which are two-state components, are represented by operator 1.
