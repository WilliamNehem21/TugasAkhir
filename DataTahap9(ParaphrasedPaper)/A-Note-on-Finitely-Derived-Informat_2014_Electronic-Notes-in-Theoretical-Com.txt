In this research, the concept of f-context, where f represents a finite-subsets-family structure on the attribute set of a formal context, is introduced. The study examines the implication rule systems that arise from consistent f-contexts and demonstrates that the concept hierarchy of a consistent f-context corresponds to a specific type of subset family inherent in the induced implication rules system. Building upon this finding, the notion of a formal implication rule system is proposed.

The paper also presents the concept of an information state of finitely derived information systems, and explores the order-theoretic properties of the partially ordered set of information states based on set inclusion. It is demonstrated that every such partially ordered set is an algebraic domain. Furthermore, the study investigates the relationship between approximable mappings (between given finitely derived information systems) and Scott-continuous functions (between the induced algebraic domains).
