Using cognitive architectures for the analysis of the usability of human-computer interfaces is a widely explored approach. One powerful method for conducting such analysis is through syndetic modeling, where both the interface and the selected cognitive model are described within the same framework, enabling the combined behavior of the two to be examined. This paper suggests the use of LOTOS as a language for syndetic modeling and discusses four challenges that syndetic modeling faces, explaining how LOTOS notation addresses each of these difficulties.

The research conducted here pertains to analyzing the usability of computer interfaces using a formal approach known as syndetic modeling, which involves the integrated description and analysis of both the interface and the cognitive model of the user within the same notation. The formal description technique LOTOS is proposed as being well-suited for such syndetic modeling.

The next generation of human-computer interfaces is expected to be highly complex, incorporating advanced interaction mechanisms such as gestural and multi-modal interaction. It is evident that if these interaction mechanisms are used without constraints, interfaces can become difficult to use. As such, there is a clear need to assess the cognitive demands of specific interaction tasks. The standard approach involves constructing a prototype system implementation and conducting user trials, which is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, leveraging cognitive models to make such assessments is a valuable approach. Syndetic modeling, where both the interface and the chosen cognitive model are described in the same notation and then analyzed together, is particularly useful for such evaluations.

Challenges arise due to the extensive and complex nature of both cognitive architectures and interface behavior. To address the issue of scalability, the paper seeks specification structuring techniques with hierarchical and primitive interaction paradigms. LOTOS, as a language for syndetic modeling, is well-suited for addressing these challenges.

The LOTOS interactor model is presented, which can be used to describe the behavior of components within an interactive system. The modeling technique involves organizing actions along three dimensions and enabling interaction between the user and the application side.

The paper discusses how complexity can be managed using the LOTOS hiding operator, which allows a set of actions to be hidden from the environment. Additionally, tools like lola and smile enable the execution and verification of specifications in a simulation environment.

The paper introduces an interval temporal logic for formulating cognitive properties of interface systems, providing a semantic link between LOTOS and interval temporal logic.

A case study is presented to analyze the capabilities of interface systems to perform certain multimodal tasks, using simulation and deductive reasoning for the analysis.

The choice of LOTOS for syndetic modeling is motivated, highlighting its appropriateness for integrating interface and cognitive specification and analysis.
