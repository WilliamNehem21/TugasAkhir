Multigraphs can be classified into two types: undirected multigraphs and directed multigraphs. In an undirected multigraph, the edges (i, j) and (j, i), if they exist, are always considered identical, unlike in the case of directed multigraphs. For the latest research on the algebraic theory of multigraphs, refer to the works by [4, 11, 13].

A node u is defined as a communicable node for a given instant of time if iu and at least one member of iu is non-null. If u does not have any neighbor nodes, then iu= and further communication is not possible. However, if iu and all the members of iu are null vectors at a specific point in time, it indicates that further communication is temporarily not possible.
