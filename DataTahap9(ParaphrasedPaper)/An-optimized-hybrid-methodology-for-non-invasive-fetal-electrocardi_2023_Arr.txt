The use of electronic fetal heart monitoring during pregnancy has become a standard practice in most developed countries to identify potential health risks for both the mother and the fetus. Non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (NI-fECG), recorded in the maternal abdomen, offers a promising alternative to cardiotocography for providing a more accurate estimation of fetal heart rate. Various methodologies have been developed for NI-fECG signal detection and processing, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

Prenatal cardiac monitoring plays a crucial role in the early detection of fetal pathological conditions. The primary objectives of electronic fetal heart monitoring are to identify potential risk factors that could lead to fetal morbidity or mortality, and to facilitate the timely intervention of obstetricians and pediatric cardiologists in prescribing appropriate treatments or taking necessary precautions during delivery or postpartum care. Moreover, identifying intrauterine hypoxic infection early on is essential for clinicians to intervene and prevent potential complications.

While NI-fECG presents a viable alternative to cardiotocography, challenges such as poor signal-to-noise ratio and limitations in signal extraction need to be addressed. Despite recent advancements in fetal monitoring systems utilizing NI-fECG, the analysis and interpretation of abdominal ECG signals remain challenging due to these aforementioned reasons.

The development of robust and efficient signal processing techniques for extracting fetal ECG signals from noisy recordings remains a significant research challenge. Noise from maternal ECG, uterine contractions, and movement artifacts can significantly impact the quality of the fetal ECG signal. Further research is necessary to enhance the accuracy of signal processing algorithms for improved fetal ECG extraction.

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has widely been used to denoise non-linear and nonstationary mixed signals. In EMD-based techniques, signals are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and denoising involves the selective reconstruction of the signal using IMFs containing useful information while rejecting those carrying mainly noise. Wavelet transform, another signal processing tool, has been utilized for denoising in fetal ECG processing due to its ability to produce a sparse representation for real-world signals.

Furthermore, the study involved the extraction and analysis of independent components using the FastICA algorithm, as well as the application of wavelet transform for denoising and signal quality assessment. A heuristic search on the algorithm demonstrated an improvement in fetal heart rate estimation, indicating the potential for optimal IMF selection to enhance the accuracy of fetal ECG analysis.
