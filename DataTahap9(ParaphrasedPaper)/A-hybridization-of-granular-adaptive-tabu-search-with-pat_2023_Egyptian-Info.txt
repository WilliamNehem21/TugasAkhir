The multi-depot open vehicle routing problem (MDOVRP) is distinguished from the classic vehicle routing problem (VRP) by the presence of multiple depots and the absence of a requirement for the vehicle to return to the depot after serving the final customer. To address this challenging problem, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (GATS-PR) that combines granular adaptive tabu search with path relinking. The main contributions of our work include the introduction of a solution-based tabu search technique in granular tabu search, the design of an adaptive neighborhood selection method with 22 types of move operations for large neighborhoods, and the application of path relinking with a new similarity definition to the MDOVRP for the first time. Our computational results, based on 24 public instances, demonstrate that GATS-PR outperforms the previously state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. Specifically, GATS-PR improved and matched the previous best-known results on 4 and 19 instances, respectively.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work on the MDOVRP, while the definition of the MDOVRP is provided in Section 3. Section 4 details the proposed GATS-PR, and Section 5 reports on parameter tuning, computational results, and the importance analysis of the proposed algorithmic components. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusion.

In previous works, a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation of the MDOVRP was proposed and solved with CPLEX. Additionally, a two-index vehicle flow formulation was presented to address the open location routing problem and the MDOVRP. Other approaches included the design of a multi-start metaheuristic algorithm, which consisted of a constructive heuristic and an iterated local search algorithm for solving the MDOVRP.

In our proposed algorithm, we designed large composite neighborhoods with different functions and impact degrees, allowing for the selection of appropriate move types for achieving a balance between intensification and diversification of the search.

In terms of parameter tuning, we selected various statistics to tune parameters and conducted three independent runs for the selected instances. The obtained results demonstrated the importance of adaptive neighborhood selection.

In future research, we aim to apply GATS-PR to other VRP-related problems, such as the multi-depot VRP and the multi-depot green VRP. Additionally, we plan to investigate an advanced population management mechanism and design alternative similarity definitions between solutions to further improve the search capability of path relinking for solving the MDOVRP.
