Falls represent a significant public health concern, and the resulting harm and treatment expenses are influenced by the speed of the response to the incident. Timely assistance can be facilitated through rapid and effective methods of obtaining information about individuals who have fallen, thereby reducing the risk of further injury.

The image segmentation component employs the background subtraction approach, which involves comparing the current image with a background model and applying a threshold to differentiate between background and foreground pixels in the difference image, thus identifying the target area. Following the extraction of foreground pixels, a shadow suppression method proposed by Elgammal is utilized to mitigate shadow interference. Subsequently, mathematical morphology expansion and erosion operators are employed to address small holes and noise in the foreground image, resulting in a binary motion image after thresholding.

During physical exercise, the aspect ratio of a person may exceed 1. Relying solely on the aspect ratio for assessing an individual's condition can lead to misjudgments. In such cases, the minimum circumscribed rectangle box will increase in size, causing the effective area ratio of the person to decrease accordingly. By combining the aspect ratio with the effective area ratio, misjudgments can be effectively avoided.
