The safeguard system is designed to enhance the reliability and resilience of large complex critical infrastructures by employing distributed autonomous agents for monitoring and safeguarding them. This study details the incorporation of a workflow management system within a safeguard agent to facilitate real-time correlation of data from anomaly detectors, intrusion detection systems, and other system monitors. The workflow management system interprets workflow models represented by augmented Petri nets that model generic forms of attack or failure, and it automatically triggers appropriate responses based on the reasoning results of Bayesian networks linked to transitions in the workflows. The paper also includes a case study example from the management of electricity distribution networks.

The safeguard agent system is implemented as a hierarchically layered system, integrating distributed detection and response with the aggregation of critical information from various sources. The system features hybrid detector agents that monitor operators, system components, and system malfunction detectors within an infrastructure to evaluate the system's state regarding erroneous data or potential attacks. Anomalous data or file integrity violations are identified, and this information is either relayed to the operator or acted upon automatically to mitigate inappropriate behavior. The key agents within the system, including wrapper agents and workflow correlation agents, are discussed in further detail.

Wrapper agents are associated with existing intrusion detection systems and serve to integrate information from these systems into the safeguard system, such as the file integrity checker wrapper agent, which monitors integrity violations on critical system files. Workflow correlation agents include an embedded workflow management system and are responsible for integrating information from various sources and reasoning about the network's state and operator behavior. These agents work in tandem with action agents to provide prompt responses to address emerging issues, such as modifying firewall policies in response to reported security threats.

The paper also outlines the use of the Bossa workflow management system, which offers advantages such as basic Petri net modeled workflows, and the construction of Bayesian networks in XML format using Javabayes software. Additionally, the paper presents a case study involving the emulation of the Slammer worm to evaluate the effectiveness of the safeguard system in controlling its impact on an electricity network.

Future work includes the construction and evaluation of a prototype system for enhancing the survivability and dependability of large-scale infrastructures, focusing on electricity distribution and the management of a telecommunications network. The study emphasizes the importance of correlation in synthesizing information from diverse anomaly detectors and intrusion detection systems to detect patterns of attack over time, while also noting the creation of anomaly detectors to identify deviations from normality and the use of workflows in confirming and responding to analyzed attack patterns.
