The paper discusses an alternative approach to maintaining consistency in the specification of different aspects to be analyzed in the context of telecommunication software. The authors propose semi-automatic methods to integrate existing tools for modeling and analyzing telecommunication software in a transparent manner for users. They suggest that designers of new services should provide a single description of the software in a familiar language, and a toolset would then generate specific specifications for analyzing different aspects, such as reliability and performance. The authors leverage recent work on model-driven architecture (MDA) and XML for automating tool construction, with a focus on the active network paradigm.

The paper also addresses the challenge of avoiding multiple, possibly unrelated descriptions of a system for different development tasks. The authors discuss the use of formal specification languages and tools that cover multiple tasks, such as safety and reliability analysis and performance analysis. They also describe the concept of intermediate representation languages, which group features common to various tools and formal methods.

The authors propose using standard representation languages and technologies, such as XML and MDA, to integrate tools, and they share their experiences with using XML technologies for abstract model checking and model interchange among tools for statecharts. They illustrate the applicability of their approach in the context of developing new services with the active network paradigm.

The paper is organized into sections that describe the authors' experiences with analyzing active networks, their study of MDA and XML for integrating previous analyses, related work in the field, and their conclusions and plans for future work. The authors also discuss their methods for integrating the analysis of active networks and highlight the importance of automating the generation of code for verification tools.

In summary, the paper discusses an approach to integrating tools for analyzing telecommunication software using MDA and XML, with a focus on maintaining consistency in system specifications and automating tool construction. The authors provide insights into the challenges and opportunities in this area and propose future directions for their work.
