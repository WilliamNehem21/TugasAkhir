Various computational intelligence techniques have been utilized in IoT security solutions, such as malware detection, cyber threat detection, suspicious activity monitoring, intrusion detection, and cyberattack detection. Employing computational intelligence approaches can enhance cybersecurity capabilities and safeguard IoT applications and users. A secure and computationally intelligent solution is necessary to protect sensitive healthcare data and ensure private communication between users, database service providers, and owners.

Bringing together the concept of decentralization in blockchain technology and security approaches does not have a straightforward solution, and there is still significant work to be done in this area. While several researchers have explored blockchain-based security schemes, few have proposed a concrete structure or idea for such systems. Hence, the investigation of blockchain-based encryption framework models with security mechanisms is both meaningful and valuable. This research paper introduces a private blockchain-based encryption framework model designed for security purposes.

This section includes various existing efforts by researchers in developing a blockchain-based encryption framework model. The authors of this research utilize blockchain to secure user data, demonstrating its application in intrusion detection systems (IDSS). They also employ blockchain technology in the design of cloud storage to ensure a secure consumer environment. Unlike a single data center or server, a blockchain network distributes resources, including connections.

The authors propose a blockchain-based data-sharing strategy that utilizes smart contracts and attribute-based encryption (ABE) to achieve user revocation. Their architecture incorporates attribute level revocation to manage privileges during data sharing and involves a trusted agency for strategic management and data encryption/decryption, which poses a security risk to user information. The failure of the key management center would result in users being unable to access their information, potentially disrupting the entire system.

The authors must address numerous architectural challenges in implementing blockchain for IoT and maintaining security in industrial applications. Despite these challenges, blockchain technologies hold promise for addressing security, privacy, and trust issues in multi-stakeholder applications.

The authors studied the enhancement of blockchain privacy for securing IoT devices by investigating zero-knowledge proof as a means to improve privacy and alleviate security concerns such as personal information exposure through block queries. A use case explored in this study is intelligent meter control pricing for safe charging in a single-layer blockchain-based secure architecture.

Trained patterns are evaluated against learning criteria, with the output stored in the cloud if the criteria are met and updated otherwise. These patterns are then retrieved from the cloud for predictive purposes during the validation phase. If a disease is detected, a corresponding message is displayed, and the process is terminated if no disease is found.

This proposed study presents a private blockchain-based encryption framework utilizing a computational intelligence approach for encryption. The computational intelligence approach is advantageous in identifying similar attributes in gathered data and the identification process. Test findings on a basic encryption framework demonstrate that the private blockchain-based approach with computational intelligence scales effectively as datasets grow. The results also indicate that using more training data leads to improved performance. The detection accuracy of the resulting security system is 0.93 in the training phase and 0.91 in the validation phase, which exceeds the accuracy of previously published systems.
