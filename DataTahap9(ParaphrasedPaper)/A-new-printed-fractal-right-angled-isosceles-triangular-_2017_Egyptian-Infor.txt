In this study, a notch was incorporated into the ground plane and the patch was modified to create a Koch snowflake design. The resulting antenna demonstrated improved gain, return loss, and omnidirectional radiation pattern with a single iteration. This compact antenna is well-suited for applications in the ultra-wideband (UWB), personal communication services (PCS), wireless local area network (WLAN), WiFi, and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) frequency ranges.

The antenna utilized the following specifications: wsub= 3.2 cm, lsub= 2.2 cm, a= 2 cm, lf= 0.5 cm, wf= 0.6 cm, ls1= 0.025 cm, ws1= 0.08 cm, lgnd= 0.2 cm, x= 0.2 cm.

This section explores the antenna's performance variations resulting from alterations in its design parameters. The outcomes were obtained through simulations using CST Microwave Studio tool to measure return loss, gain, bandwidth, and radiation pattern. Modifying one design parameter at a time and adjusting the remaining allowed for evaluating the antenna's performance according to the desired criteria.
