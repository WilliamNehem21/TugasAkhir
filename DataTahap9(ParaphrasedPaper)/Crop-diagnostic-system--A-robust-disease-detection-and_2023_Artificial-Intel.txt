The study proposes a framework for an aquaponics system that utilizes image processing and decision tree methodology to detect diseases in four leafy green crops (eggplant, chilli, citrus, and mandarin) and automatically generates a report sent to the owner via a mobile application upon detection. Similarly, a CNN-based approach for detecting plant diseases in smart hydroponics has been developed to provide farmers with a tool that exceeds the accuracy of an agricultural extension worker. The analysis of existing literature reveals that deep learning techniques are widely used for plant or crop disease detection and classification, primarily in open-air farms, with limited application to modern farming systems such as aquaponics or hydroponics. Moreover, comprehensive and unified disease detection systems for identifying diseases in multiple leafy green crops grown in aquaponics facilities are lacking.

This research focuses on four leafy green crops—lettuce, basil, parsley, and spinach—and utilizes a dataset comprising healthy and diseased images of these crops acquired from various sources, including an NFT-based aquaponics facility at the University of Alberta, Google search, and the Ecosia search engine. Data annotation, a critical step in developing object detection models, was performed manually using the labelimg tool. The study discusses various categories of annotations, the use of open-source annotation tools, and the selection of two-stage and one-stage detectors for the study.

The study employed the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 to train all models in three phases of the disease detection system. The classification model, implemented in PyTorch using the transfer learning approach with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model, was chosen after model selection. Upon disease detection and classification, causes and treatments of the disease were extracted from the ontology model automatically and displayed on the application panel, providing valuable information for agricultural practitioners to identify disease causes and take necessary precautions to avoid crop wastage and economic loss.

The study presents the results of experiments performed, including the performance evaluation of deep learning models in the three phases of the disease detection system. It discusses the significance of the complete system, emphasizing the importance of maintaining optimal humidity and temperature levels, treating seeds before germination, and using conventional fungicides for disease treatment. The study also addresses the classification of downy mildew disease for each crop individually, despite similarities in treatment methods. It suggests future work to expand the system to include other leafy green crops, extend the dataset with more real-field images, and develop a mobile application to reduce latency and provide data privacy.
