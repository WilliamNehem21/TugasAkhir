Before the spin model for rwlock was finalized, it was clear that there were issues with the implementation. The process of conducting a verification review in itself can be informative. For instance, in the case of rdlock, if there is a writer queued, a reader must wait (with writer preference). At this stage, the count of queued readers is increased, but it is never decreased. This issue was recognized by Red Hat and addressed in the subsequent release.
