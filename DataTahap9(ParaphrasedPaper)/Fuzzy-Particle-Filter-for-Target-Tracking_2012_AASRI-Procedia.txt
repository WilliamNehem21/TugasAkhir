The paper explores the use of a combination of fuzzy particle measurement methods and a superimposed weight sampling algorithm to enhance the timeliness and robustness of tracking. Specifically, Y. Satoh leveraged color characteristics for implementing tracking. The degree of membership of individual pixels (ui,j) and their probabilities of selection (p) are considered, with the aim of reducing non-uniformity in the RGB color space. The paper also discusses the conversion of pixel colors from the RGB color space to the CIE L*a*b color space, and the application of color local rough set theory and fuzzy histogram generated from fuzzy C-means (FCM) histogram to address color non-uniformity issues. Moreover, the paper introduces a unified color space approach based on c rough color fuzzy clustering core and provides an algorithm for estimating the a posteriori distribution of the target state using a particle filter algorithm, which is capable of handling rapid light changes and long-term occlusions. However, the paper acknowledges the limitations of the proposed method, particularly in addressing special traffic weather conditions (such as rain and fog) and multi-target tracking, which are identified as potential areas for future research.
