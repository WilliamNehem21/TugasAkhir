The paper demonstrates that adipose tissue regulates insulin sensitivity through the secretion of adipocytokines, such as leptin, resistin, and adiponectin. Hypoadiponectinemia is associated with the development of obesity and related disorders, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The study investigates the impact of Brazilian propolis on adiponectin levels and signaling pathways in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using male Wistar rats. The results indicate that propolis administration leads to the restoration of adiponectin levels and improvement in insulin sensitivity in the treated diabetic rats. Brazilian propolis, known for its chemical composition of flavonoids, aromatic acids, esters, and other compounds, has been shown to possess various biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic effects.

Furthermore, the findings reveal that propolis treatment ameliorates dyslipidemia and lipid metabolism disturbances in diabetic rats. Additionally, propolis is found to mitigate insulin resistance and reduce fasting plasma glucose levels in diabetic rats, suggesting its potential as an anti-hyperglycemic agent. In addition, propolis treatment is shown to reduce oxidative stress and restore glutathione levels in diabetic rats.

Adiponectin, an anti-diabetic hormone secreted by adipose tissue, is implicated in various metabolic disorders, including obesity and insulin resistance. The study demonstrates that propolis administration restores reduced adiponectin levels in treated diabetic rats compared to untreated diabetic rats, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent for T2DM.
