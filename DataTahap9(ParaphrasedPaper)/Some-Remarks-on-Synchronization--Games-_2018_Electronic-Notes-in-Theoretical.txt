This academic paper examines synchronization games played on planar automata, demonstrating that determining the planar games winnable by the synchronizer is a co-NP hard problem. The paper also presents findings suggesting that planar games are as challenging as nonplanar games, thereby highlighting how planar automata effectively represent the complexities of automata synchronization.

The authors introduce the concept of synchronization games and build on previous research in this area, particularly exploring synchronization of automata from a game theory perspective. They expand the notion of synchronization games to encompass accessibility games, with a specific focus on synchronization games played on planar automata. This focus is justified by the authors' earlier work, which established that planar automata effectively capture the complexities inherent in synchronization.

The game involves two participants, the synchronizer and the spoiler, who alternate choosing characters from designated sets. The synchronizer's objective is to generate a synchronizing string for "m" in spite of the spoiler's choices, while the spoiler aims to prevent synchronization.

The authors also discuss pair-synchronization games and demonstrate that reduction to pairs enables the polynomial-time recognition of games won by the synchronizer, along with a cubic upper bound on the length of optimal strategies. Further analysis reveals that if the synchronizer produces a loop despite optimal play, the spoiler can force this loop indefinitely, leading to a contradiction. This contradiction indicates the synchronizer's victory.

The paper delves into subset synchronization games within the context of planar automata, while simultaneously broadening the scope to include nonsynchronizing automata.
