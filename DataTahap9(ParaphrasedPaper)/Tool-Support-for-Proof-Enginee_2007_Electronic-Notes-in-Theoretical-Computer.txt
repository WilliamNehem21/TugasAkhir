Contemporary integrated development environments (IDEs) provide programmers with a diverse set of advanced tools for understanding and manipulating programs. In addition to basic features such as syntax highlighting and project building, these tools commonly include refactorings and program visualization components. Many of the techniques developed for IDEs can be directly transferred to user interface theorem provers (UITPs), while others can be adapted to leverage the unique characteristics of theorem provers.

While the notion of transferring IDE techniques to theorem provers is not new, there have been significant advancements in IDEs over the past decade, motivated by the demands of developers who need to maintain and extend large existing codebases. The increasing complexity of real-world programs means that even experienced programmers struggle to comprehend them.

As automated theorem proving continues to evolve, the volume and scale of existing proofs, as well as the proportion of old proofs to new ones, will continue to expand. Hence, tools for visualizing, understanding, and automatically altering these proofs will become crucial. Integrated proof environments (IPEs) should integrate these tools in a similar manner to IDEs.

Each component in a proof script is linked to its corresponding component in the adjacent panel. Examples of proof script components include definitions or theorems with tactics, while examples of components in an extracted program include definitions of types or functions. Corresponding components are automatically aligned as the user focuses on different areas in the proof script or extracted program. Additionally, various visual cues, such as light gray for non-incorporated portions of the proof script and pale blue for indirectly generated components, are used to facilitate understanding.

Refactoring plays a key role in restructuring a program to improve its overall organization without altering its behavior. When substantial parts of a proof have been developed separately, refactoring may be necessary to align the underlying assumptions of the different components, thereby promoting proof reuse. Despite the extensive support for automatic refactorings in modern IDEs, UITPs offer minimal support in this area. UITPs should offer facilities for restructuring existing proof scripts, such as encapsulating a group of proof entities within a module. The tools described hold significant value for proof developers as automated theorem proving progresses and proofs of comparable size and complexity become more prevalent.

The availability of data pertaining to the relationship between entities in a proof script and its corresponding proof, as well as the terms in a proof and their counterparts in the extracted program, is evident. The challenge lies not in establishing these relationships, but in effectively documenting and presenting them.

Furthermore, work in this area could potentially yield substantial theoretical insights. While the described refactorings are relatively straightforward, more ambitious refactorings for theorem provers could lead to unforeseen discoveries, similar to the impact of ambitious program refactorings on Java programs that exploit polymorphic type systems.
