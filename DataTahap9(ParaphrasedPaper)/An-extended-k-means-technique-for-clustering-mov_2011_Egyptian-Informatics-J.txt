The k-means algorithm is a commonly used clustering technique in various data mining applications. This paper introduces a new pattern-based clustering algorithm that extends the k-means algorithm to cluster moving object trajectory data. The proposed algorithm leverages the direction of moving object trajectories to determine the number of clusters for the k-means algorithm. Additionally, the silhouette coefficient is used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approach, and experimental results on real and synthetic data demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the technique.

The paper also presents a framework for clustering moving objects using the k-means algorithm, comprised of four phases: computation, selection, clustering, and analysis. In the computation phase, the moving object database is reconstructed to incorporate motion direction properties for each object. The selection phase identifies distinct sets of similar patterns from the output features of the computation phase. The clustering phase utilizes the k-means algorithm, with the number of dissimilar patterns determined in the selection phase serving as the number of clusters. Additionally, the paper proposes an initialization method for centroids based on trajectory dissimilarity and utilizes the silhouette coefficient to ensure the quality of the resulting clustering.

The paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides a literature survey of related work, section 3 defines the problem and presents technical definitions, section 4 describes the proposed clustering algorithm, section 5 presents experimental results, and section 6 concludes the paper and suggests future research directions.

The paper acknowledges the extensive research in spatiotemporal data mining and clustering analysis, highlighting the wide range of clustering algorithms available and the popularity of the k-means method. A detailed definition of trajectory segment is also provided.

Experimental results using synthetic data generated by the Brinkhoff generator demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique in terms of query processing time. Another experiment investigates the effect of changing segment direction similarity percentage on clustering computation time for both the extended k-means (e-km) and k-means algorithms. The results emphasize the performance of the proposed approach under different circumstances. Finally, the accuracy of the e-km algorithm is evaluated by counting the number of dead centroids in the resulting clustering and computing the average silhouette coefficient of clusters.
