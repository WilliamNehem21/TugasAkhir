Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is rapidly broken down in the gastrointestinal tract by esterase enzyme into monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which is the primary metabolite responsible for its therapeutic effects. The half-life of DMF is approximately 12 minutes, whereas the half-life of MMF is 36 hours, leading to the absence of orally administered DMF detection in the bloodstream. DMF has been observed to exhibit antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects attributed to its ability to increase the expression of various antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and catalase (CAT), ultimately reducing oxidative stress through activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-Nrf2 transcriptional pathway, the principal regulator of antioxidant enzymes.

In a study involving rabbits, four groups were formed: group I (control), receiving standard rabbit chow; group II (HCD), receiving 1% cholesterol-enriched chow for 4 weeks; group III (HCDDMF), receiving 1% cholesterol-enriched chow and administered DMF (12.5 mg/kg/day, orally) for 4 weeks; and group IV (DMF), receiving standard chow plus DMF (12.5 mg/kg/day, orally) for 4 weeks. Blood samples were collected from the marginal ear vein at the end of the experiment for the measurement of serum triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The aorta was also assessed for malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), histopathological examination, intima/media (I/M) ratio, and mRNA expression of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).

The enzymatic activity of SOD was determined using the method of Marklund, and histopathological evaluation was performed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. Additionally, DMF was found to significantly reduce CETP expression compared to HCD-fed rabbits, and its antioxidative activity mediated via Nrf2 activation may contribute to its hypolipidemic effects.

The study revealed that HCD-induced inflammation was characterized by increased serum CRP, consistent with previous findings demonstrating a positive correlation between high cholesterol levels and CRP production. Notably, CRP is a proinflammatory protein known to promote atherosclerosis by inducing the expression of adhesion proteins on endothelial cells, recruiting monocytes into the arterial wall, and increasing the production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes.

Furthermore, DMF has been shown to attenuate 7-ketocholesterol (7KC)-induced oxidative stress on 158N murine oligodendrocytes. 7KC, a major oxidation product of cholesterol found in human atherosclerotic plaque, has been implicated in atherosclerosis progression by inducing overproduction of superoxide anions and enhancing the release of inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest a potential role for DMF in mitigating atherosclerosis.
