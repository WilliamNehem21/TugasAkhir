The aim of this research is to facilitate communication between domain experts and formal methods experts by employing visualizations of formal model behavior, allowing domain experts to comprehend and experiment with the formal models. This paper presents a definition of visualizations grounded in game theory, which views visualizations as transition systems synchronized with formal models. It includes examples of visualizations, utilizes them to illustrate winning strategies of games, and illustrates the benefits of this approach in an industrial application of formal models.

The paper discusses the mimic/cpn library, which enables the visualization of colored Petri net models by providing an API for defining and updating visualizations. However, it highlights the inconvenience and clutter caused by the need to modify the model to add visualizations, as well as the library's limitation in handling asynchronous input.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the play-engine, which allows the implementation of a program prototype through inputting scenarios via a specific GUI. However, it points out that heavy-weight techniques are employed for visualization as the model is implicitly created, leading to computational expenses.

The paper suggests that while synchronizing visualizations with formal models is valuable for observing the model's behavior, it does not enable interaction with the model to drive it into interesting states. To address this, imposing fairness during model execution may be necessary.

The research emphasizes the use of visualizations for validation of formal models, allowing domain experts to stimulate and observe the model using visualizations to verify that it reflects the intended behavior. It also discusses the use of visualizations to communicate the result of formal verification, specifically in demonstrating the absence of winning strategies in games. The paper demonstrates the application of this method in an industrial context and outlines how it can aid in creating counter-examples to the existence of winning strategies in games, making it accessible to domain experts unfamiliar with the formalism.
