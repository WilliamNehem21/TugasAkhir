The concept of trace in a monoidal category was originally introduced to provide a categorical framework for understanding phenomena present in various fields such as linear algebra, topology, knot theory, and proof theory. The trace operation is interpreted as a form of feedback operation.

Subsequently, partially traced categories were developed to accommodate situations where the trace cannot always be defined. It was demonstrated that a partially traced category can always be viewed as a subcategory of a completely traced category. We offer a novel proof of this representation theorem, employing a different construction method than the original. However, since both constructions satisfy the same universal property, they are naturally isomorphic.

In sections 3.2 and 4.1, we demonstrate that the original partially traced category can be embedded in this quotiented category through a specific embedding that mirrors the process of partial tracing. Finally, in section 4.2, we establish that our construction adheres to the anticipated universal property.
