This academic paper discusses the different approaches to text summarization, including extractive and abstractive summarization, as well as general and query-based summary methods. The study specifically focuses on a new approach to Arabic text summarization, which combines graph theory and noun count in sentences. The proposed method involves preprocessing techniques such as normalization, tokenization, stemming, stop words removal, and morphological analysis, followed by feature extraction, graph construction, and the application of a modified PageRank algorithm to extract and remove redundant sentences in the summary.

The paper also reviews related works in the field of Arabic text summarization, including machine learning approaches and algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, as well as graph-based approaches using graph theory principles and various metrics to determine the importance of text partitions. The authors also discuss the use of the Al-Khalil morphological analyzer for morphological analysis in the Arabic language, and the application of techniques such as cosine similarity and TF-IDF to enhance the performance of the summarization process.

The study presents the results of the proposed approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of the modified PageRank algorithm in comparison to other algorithms such as LexRank and TextRank. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges posed by the complexity of the Arabic language structure and the identification of nouns in the absence of capital and small letters, as well as diacritics in the written text.

In conclusion, the research aims to improve the performance of text summarization in Arabic by utilizing the modified PageRank algorithm, integrating graph theory principles, and leveraging morphological analysis to address the complexities of the Arabic language. The study provides a detailed analysis of the proposed methodology and its performance evaluation, highlighting the potential of the approach in the context of Arabic text summarization.
