In this research paper, our aim is to develop a more efficient algorithm by reusing data from earlier steps and dynamically limiting the set of test functions. However, based on our current understanding, it appears unlikely that we will be able to provide a priori proof of efficiency in terms of a polynomial time bound for the algorithm.
