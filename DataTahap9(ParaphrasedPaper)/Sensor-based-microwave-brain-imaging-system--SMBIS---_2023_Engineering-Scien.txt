This research focuses on the fabrication of head phantoms for microwave imaging. The authors used various materials such as polyvinyl chloride, agar, sodium azide, gelatin, and others to create tissues mimicking human brain and skull. The fabricated phantoms were then tested for their dielectric properties and utilized for microwave tomography imaging. However, the authors found that the lack of dielectric characteristics in some tissues and the relatively low measured dielectric properties compared to real tissues could lead to ambiguous imaging results. The study also discusses the fabrication procedures of the phantoms, the measurement processes, and the outcomes of the imaging experiments. 

Additionally, the paper introduces an algorithm, ic-cf-dmas, which allows for tolerance of deviation between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and malignant tumors. The authors also describe how the phantoms were used in conjunction with a stacked wideband antenna-based microwave brain imaging system to detect tumors in the head. The experimental results show good agreement between the dielectric properties of the fabricated brain tissues and those of real human brain tissues, and demonstrate the potential for using these phantoms as a supplement in examining the human brain.
