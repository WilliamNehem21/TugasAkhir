Some researchers have developed optimization algorithms that draw inspiration from observations in nature, which are commonly referred to as nature-inspired algorithms. One such algorithm is the bat-inspired algorithm, which utilizes echolocation to gauge the distance between a bat and its surroundings. Another example is the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which was developed based on the schooling behavior of fish and birds. Additionally, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, created by Storm and Price, utilizes mutation, crossover, and selection operations based on population evolution. Similarly, the ant and bee algorithms were developed by emulating the foraging behavior of ants and bees, where pheromones are used as chemical messengers to indicate high-quality solutions. The simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is based on the principles of the metal annealing process.

The cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, also a nature-inspired algorithm, is based on the brood reproductive strategy of cuckoo birds to increase their population. It has been found to be more effective than other nature-inspired algorithms, such as DE, SA, and PSO, with the latter being special cases of the CS algorithm. The CS algorithm outperforms the DE algorithm in terms of convergence speed to reach an optimum solution and is reported to be more computationally efficient than the PSO.

This paper aims to develop and evaluate the performance of cuckoo search algorithms with increasing switching parameters between local and global random walks as the number of iterations increases. Three different CS algorithms were proposed: the first with a linearly increasing switching parameter, the second with an exponentially increasing switching parameter, and the third with an increasing power switching parameter.

In nature, parasitic cuckoos are adept at finding nests where eggs have just been laid and precisely timing the laying of their own eggs. They lay one egg in the host nest, which usually hatches quicker than the other eggs. When this occurs, the foreign cuckoo removes the non-hatched eggs from the nest to reduce the probability of the legitimate eggs hatching. Furthermore, the foreign cuckoo chick gains access to more food by mimicking the call of the host chicks. There are instances where the host cuckoo discovers a foreign egg, and in such cases, the cuckoo either removes the egg or abandons the nest altogether.

In the context of the CS algorithm, a nest represents a solution, and each cuckoo can lay only one egg, representing one solution. The objective is to use the new and potentially better solution (cuckoo egg) to replace a poor solution in the nest.

The original CS algorithm maintains a constant switching parameter between local and global random walks at 0.25, as the algorithm searches for the global minima. Limited research has been conducted on improving the efficiency of the CS algorithm by dynamically changing the value of the switching parameter. To address this gap, each CS algorithm was run twenty times for ten test functions, and the results were recorded in a Microsoft Excel file. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel to determine the mean and standard deviation.

This paper introduced nature-inspired optimization algorithms and emphasized that the CS algorithm is a more universal and efficient algorithm when compared to PSO, DE, and SA. It also reviewed studies that aimed to enhance the efficiency of the CS algorithm, with most improvements based on applying different probability distribution functions (Cauchy, Gaussian, and Gamma) to determine the random walk step sizes. The main contribution of this paper is the investigation of the performance of CS algorithms with dynamically increasing switching parameters. Three CS algorithms using linear, exponential, and power increasing switching parameters were developed and tested against the constant and linearly decreasing CS algorithms, with the CS algorithm using exponential increasing (CSEI) switching parameter found to be the most efficient.
