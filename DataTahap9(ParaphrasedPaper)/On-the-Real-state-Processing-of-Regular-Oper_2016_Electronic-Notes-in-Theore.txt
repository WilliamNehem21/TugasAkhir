In this paper, we investigate aspects of state complexity in relation to the Sakoda-Sipser problem. We examine the state complexity of regular operations and provide new and simpler proofs for some well-known results. Through our analysis, we introduce the concept of "real-state processing" and seek to identify a deterministic finite automaton model that exhibits this property. While we establish preliminary results indicating that such a model does not exist for regular expressions, we are able to demonstrate the existence of a deterministic finite automaton model that possesses real-state processing for star-free regular expressions.

It is known that nondeterministic finite state automata (NFAs) are as powerful as deterministic finite state automata (DFAs) in recognizing regular languages. However, NFAs are more powerful than DFAs, as they cannot be simulated by DFAs with only a polynomial increase in the number of states. The Sakoda-Sipser problem addresses the possibility of simulating NFAs using two-way deterministic finite state automata (2DFAs) with a polynomial increase in the number of states. Resolving this question would have implications for understanding the relationship between two-wayness and nondeterminism.

The paper is organized into six sections. In the first section, we introduce the problem and the concept of real-state processing. We then proceed to examine the state complexity of DFAs and 2DFAs, demonstrating that 2DFAs do not possess real-state processing of regular operations and exhibit a strict superpolynomial separation from NFAs. Subsequently, we explore the capabilities of two-way pebble automata and multiplebble automata, showing that the former is unable to process concatenations, while the latter has real-state processing of star-free regular expressions. 

Throughout our investigation, we consider various models of automata and their inherent limitations, highlighting the challenges in achieving real-state processing within the context of deterministic finite state automata. While our findings suggest that real-state processing may not be achievable within this framework, we remain open to exploring alternative models that efficiently process star-free regular expressions.

In conclusion, we address the key implications of our research, emphasizing that the Sakoda-Sipser problem is fundamentally a question of state complexity and has broader implications for comparing computational tasks using different models of finite automata. Our focus on regular expression processing has led to the development of the concept of real-state processing, shedding light on the unique computational advantages of nondeterminism in the context of finite automata. We acknowledge the need for further investigation into this new notion to deepen our understanding of its significance.
