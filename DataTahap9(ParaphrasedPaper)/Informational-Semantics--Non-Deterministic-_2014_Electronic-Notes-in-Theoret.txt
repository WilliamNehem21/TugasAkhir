The depth 0 approximation prohibits the use of virtual information and only allows valid inferences that can be directly justified by the informational semantics of logical operators. This basic system exhibits the subformula property and can be easily decided in polynomial time. A k-depth approximation permits up to k nested applications of the structural rule for virtual information, and each k-depth system also exhibits the subformula property and has a decision procedure with increasing complexity for higher values of k.

According to intuitionistic logic, a disjunction "a v b" is deemed true if and only if either "a" or "b" is true. This property, known as the disjunction property of intuitionistic logic, is suitable for constructive mathematics but conflicts with everyday usage outside of mathematics, as described by Michael Dummett. 

The notion of a 3nd-valuation describes an information state that encompasses implicit information arising from the informational meaning of logical operators. The assertion is that such an information state contains information that is actually possessed and usable, in the sense that there exists a feasible procedure to determine whether a given formula "a" is true, false, or indeterminate within our information state. This claim is supported by proposition 3.8, which demonstrates that all implicit information arising from the informational meaning is contained within the given information state.

For a detailed proof of the above proposition, refer to [insert reference]. The subformula property of Intelim supports a feasible decision procedure for Intelim deducibility and refutability. This proposition is also proven in [insert reference].
