This data pre-processing tool is a part of the Melloddy project and provides several key features: 
1. Standardization of SMILES based on RDKit v2020.09.1.0 
2. Calculation of binary molecular fingerprints including extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFP6, folded to 32k bits) using the getmorganfingerprint function in RDKit 
3. Aggregation of replicated data based on assay type 
4. Filtering of tasks based on task size and fold distribution criteria for inclusion in training and evaluation datasets 
5. Splitting of the dataset into folds according to a chosen folding scheme, based on the scaffold network in RDKit, to allow consistent assignment of compounds to folds without exchanging sensitive structural information 
6. Binarization of activity values and addition of auxiliary tasks with shifted thresholds, while allowing for user-defined expert values. The approach includes deriving multiple tasks from a single assay and producing a task weighting file for further machine learning.

The network architecture used for single-partner and multipartner models was a feedforward multilayer perceptron, and a post-processing step involved platt scaling using logistic regression implemented in scikit-learn. The test set was partitioned into two subsets for calibration and evaluation, and predictive probabilities were transformed to predictive information entropies. A size quorum was imposed for the calibration set, and tasks failing to achieve specific criteria were dropped from the analysis. 

Considerations were made for labeled and unlabeled datasets, and some investigations regarding the overlap of unlabeled datasets with the internal Melloddy datasets in the 32k bit descriptor space were conducted. The results suggested limited overlap between public and proprietary datasets, contributing minimally to the overall results.

Finally, the scaffold-based splitting strategy was employed to assign compounds to different folds, aimed at avoiding overconfident predictive performance estimates, while acknowledging potential limitations related to similar compounds being assigned to different folds.
