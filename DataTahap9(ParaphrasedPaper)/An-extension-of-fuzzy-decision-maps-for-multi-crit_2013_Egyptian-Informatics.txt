This paper introduces a novel approach called linguistic fuzzy decision networks (LFDNs), which extends the existing fuzzy decision maps (FDMs) model by incorporating fuzzy linguistic values to represent the relative importance and influence of criteria in the preference and steady-state matrices of the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) stage. The LFDN model provides substantial flexibility to decision makers in tackling real-world multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Performance comparison with the original FDM using a previously published case study demonstrates the LFDN's capacity to generate similar decisions within a more realistic decision environment.

Various methodologies have been developed to address MCDM, with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) being notable examples. Fuzzy set theory, initially proposed by Lotfi Zadeh, offers a method for handling uncertainty and imprecise information by representing information using linguistic or fuzzy values instead of numerical values. The paper introduces the concept of fuzzy numbers (FNs) and linguistic variables and their application within the context of fuzzy cognitive maps. The paper concludes with a case study illustrating the application of the proposed LFDN model and a discussion of the results.

Fuzzy numbers, which are fuzzy sets with specific properties, are used to represent uncertainty within the FDM method. The concept of linguistic variables, introduced by Lotfi Zadeh, enables computation and reasoning with words instead of numbers, providing a useful tool for describing complex or ill-defined situations. FCMs are discussed in terms of their advantages, including simplicity, flexibility, and effectiveness, but also potential drawbacks, such as reaching undesired steady states.

The paper also highlights the limitations of the original FDM, which requires experts to quantify precise weight values, ignoring the inherent uncertainty and complexity of real-world problems. The extension of FDM to incorporate linguistic values as a means of handling uncertainty is presented, and results from a case study demonstrate the capacity of LFDNs to address MCDM problems in a more flexible and humanistic manner.
