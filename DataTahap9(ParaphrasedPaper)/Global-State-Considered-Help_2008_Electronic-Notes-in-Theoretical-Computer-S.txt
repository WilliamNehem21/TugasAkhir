The paper begins by examining a calculus without storage and its categorical and game semantics, followed by an analysis of the same with storage. In the process, the theory of expansions will be developed in section 3.1 to establish an injective renaming lemma.

In Definition 3.2, a cartesian category a with a strict initial object is denoted as having nonsingular quotients if every expansion from a non-initial object has a unique quotient up to a unique morphism, and therefore is unique up to isomorphism in the usual manner.
