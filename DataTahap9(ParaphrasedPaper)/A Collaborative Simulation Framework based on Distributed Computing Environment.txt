Complex system modeling and simulation on a large scale involves interdisciplinary knowledge and often requires the use of different modeling languages and methods to create models. As a result, simulation systems built from these models exhibit a heterogeneous and hierarchical structure, which presents challenges in their design and control. This paper proposes a hierarchical modeling approach and develops a synchronous control algorithm based on a synchronous points array. Additionally, a collaborative simulation framework is implemented based on a distributed computing environment to support hierarchical modeling effectively. The framework demonstrates improved performance, especially as the computing load to communication load ratio increases, leading to increased parallelism and enhanced simulation system performance.

While some existing simulation tools can address analysis and evaluation issues of complex systems within a single domain, they lack support for complex system simulation across multiple domains. As systems become more sophisticated and complex, it becomes difficult to solve problems using only one type of simulation tool. Collaborative simulation technology for complex system simulation across multiple domains is becoming an important trend. 

Collaborative simulation often involves combining hydromechanics, aerodynamics, and mechanical control models, requiring the use of various computing models with multidisciplinary knowledge. These models are built using different modeling languages and simulation tools, posing challenges in design and control. To address this, the paper proposes a collaborative simulation framework based on distributed computing environment, which has been shown to provide an efficient mechanism to support hierarchical modeling and improve the performance of the collaborative simulation system.

The paper is structured as follows: in section 2, the collaborative simulation framework is explained in detail; in section 3, an analysis with experimental results is provided; and finally, the conclusion and future work are discussed.

In terms of implementation, a collaborative simulation assembles various complex models hierarchically to form a complex simulation system model. To support this, the paper introduces a synchronous points array and a collaborative simulation framework based on distributed computing environment. The results of experiments on the framework illustrate its effectiveness in supporting hierarchical modeling and improving the performance of the simulation system model as the ratio of computing load to communication load increases.

In the experiment, computing models that compose the system model are distributed across different computer nodes in a distributed computing environment. The collaborative simulation controlling module runs on one computer node, while the models run on other computer nodes. The system model includes 8 loop branches with 16 computing models, each of which iterates 100 times. The performance of the simulation framework is analyzed under different conditions, such as varying computing load to communication load ratios, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework in supporting data sharing among multidisciplinary models and improving the efficiency of complex system simulation.
