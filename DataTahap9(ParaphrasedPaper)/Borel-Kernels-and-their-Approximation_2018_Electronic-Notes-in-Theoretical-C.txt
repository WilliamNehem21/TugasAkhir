This paper presents a framework for analyzing the precise and approximate meanings of probabilistic programs using a categorical approach. Specifically, we develop a symmetric monoidal category of Borel kernels with a dagger structure defined by Bayesian inversion. We establish functorial connections between this category and categories of Banach lattices, which formalize the transition from kernel-based semantics to predicate transformer (backward) or state transformer (forward) semantics. These connections are linked by natural transformations, and we demonstrate the relationship using the endofunctor gpol of pol, the category of Polish spaces. We define gpol(x, t) as the space of Borel probability measures over x with the weak topology, a Polish space according to the Portmanteau theorem.
