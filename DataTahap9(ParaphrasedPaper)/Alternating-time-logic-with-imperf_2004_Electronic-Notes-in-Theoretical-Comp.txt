This research focuses on a modified version of alternating-time temporal logic (ATL) in which each agent possesses a specific memory. We demonstrate that this modification represents a practical compromise, offering a realistic representation while maintaining a reasonable level of complexity. In contrast, many models that incorporate perfect recall and imperfect information encounter an undecidable model-checking problem.

In the context of incomplete information, several researchers have traditionally assumed perfect recall, which assumes that each agent can access the complete history of its information. However, for practical considerations, we propose the consideration of imperfect recall, where the memory of each agent is explicitly described.

For instance, in a scenario involving a banker (B) at a desk (D) knowing the code (C) of a safe (V) in a vault, and a robber (R) attempting to open the safe (O), the robber can threaten the banker to obtain the code. We represent the fact that the banker knows the code through a private variable containing the code. When using ATL with complete information, all variables are accessible to all agents, allowing the robber to easily devise a strategy to open the safe. This, however, appears unrealistic.

We propose the inclusion of an explicit description of the agents' memory in the model. This incorporation of explicit memory leads to two potential solutions for the example: if the robber is depicted as absent-minded, lacking sufficient memory to store the code, then he would not be able to open the safe since he would have forgotten the code by the time he reaches the vault. Conversely, if he has sufficient memory, the perfect recall strategy would also be applicable in this case.

Overall, we have considered various possibilities for modeling agents, including perfect or imperfect information, and perfect or imperfect recall. While incorporating perfection results in more powerful agents, perfect information simplifies the model-checking problems, whereas perfect recall complicates them. Imperfect information and recall, therefore, represent a reasonable compromise, offering realistic modeling capabilities and decidable problems.

In addition, we have explored the role of knowledge in this research, noting its significance in the context of the logics under consideration. We suggest that an explicit knowledge operator could be beneficial, but its specific meaning and implications would need to be carefully considered to align with the strategies employed by cooperating agents. Therefore, it seems necessary to develop a logic in which strategies are made explicit.
