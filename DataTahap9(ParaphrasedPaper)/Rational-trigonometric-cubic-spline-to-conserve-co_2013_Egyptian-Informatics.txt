Researchers across various disciplines often seek spline interpolating functions that can accurately preserve the underlying trend of the data. This paper introduces a rational trigonometric cubic spline with four free parameters, designed to maintain the convexity of 2D data. By imposing constraints on two of the free parameters (bi and ci) in the description of the rational trigonometric function while leaving the remaining two (ai and di) unrestricted, the paper demonstrates through numerical examples that the resulting curves using this technique are C1 continuous.

The paper addresses the importance of preserving the intrinsic properties of data, such as positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. While many spline functions can generate smooth curves, they often fail to maintain the original shape of the given data. The primary objective of this paper is to uphold the inherent convexity of the data.

Convexity is pervasive in numerous practical applications, including the manufacturing of lenses, car modeling, analysis of indifference curves, nonlinear programming, and function approximation. Loss of convexity poses a significant challenge in all of these practical problems.

Significant progress has been made in the field of shape preservation, particularly when dealing with data that exhibits a convex trend. Several methods have been developed to achieve the highest level of abstraction. However, certain existing schemes, such as Brodlie and Butt's piecewise cubic function, suffer from the drawback of introducing additional knots in intervals where convexity is lost.
