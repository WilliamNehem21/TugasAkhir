In this study, we investigate the wadge reducibility of k-partitions in the Baire and Cantor spaces. As far as we are aware, the first result regarding the wadge reducibility of k-partitions in these spaces is presented in Theorem 3.2. The subsequent statement represents a specific instance of this theorem.
