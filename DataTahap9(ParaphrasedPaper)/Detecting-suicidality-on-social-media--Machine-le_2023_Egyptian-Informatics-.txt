The remainder of our paper is structured into several sections. In Section 2, we review existing work pertaining to the identification and prevention of suicidal behavior. Section 3 outlines the proposed methodology, covering data collection, data pre-processing, a novel approach to feature engineering, and the training of machine learning algorithms. Section 4 details the results and subsequent discussion. Section 5 compares our work with previous research, while Section 6 presents the conclusion and outlines potential future directions for this research.

Mbarek et al. designed a model for detecting user profiles indicative of suicidal behavior, incorporating linguistic, emotional, facial, timeline, and public features. In another study, they employed various machine learning algorithms alongside emotional, temporal, and account features to address the prediction of suicidal users. Their approach was validated using data from individuals who had died by suicide, yielding results consistent with expectations.

Our literature review revealed a scarcity of research in the domain of data mining for predicting suicidal ideation on social media and its prevention, necessitating substantial effort. Furthermore, data scarcity is exacerbated by privacy and ethical concerns. Existing literature predominantly focuses on binary classification and utilizes conventional feature extraction techniques. In contrast, our work involved the novel collection of extensive data from suicidal tweets via the Twitter and Reddit APIs and emphasized the development of a feature extraction mechanism to capture rich features. Subsequently, we trained three machine learning algorithms to classify tweets into three categories of distress, as described in Section 3.

Data extracted from social media is inherently noisy, necessitating the application of established methods such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization for data filtering prior to its use in machine learning. Additionally, the language of suicidal ideation lacks discernible lexical and syntactic patterns, prompting a need for manual engineering to analyze a set of features. We proposed a feature engineering approach to differentiate between varying levels of distress, incorporating features such as topic relationships.

Identifying suicidal ideation is treated as a multi-class machine learning problem in our research. We utilized a dataset comprising only two columns - the text title and corresponding label - and employed ensemble learning algorithms for text classification to formulate the problem. The developed model was then validated using a 5-fold cross-validation technique, serving to reduce bias and variance.

Balancing precision and recall is important, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets containing a large number of true negative values. As such, the F1 score was employed to mitigate the impact of these values and give weight to false positives and false negatives.

Our prediction models, developed for both binary and multiclass classification, have practical applications in generating intervention messages. This could enable individuals to engage anonymously with mental health professionals or therapists, circumventing potential concerns about social stigma. Feedback received on the effectiveness of intervention messages could subsequently inform improvements to the model.
