The upcoming section on technical aspects presents additional specialized categorical concepts. The second subsection discusses the interpretation of algebraic specifications, providing essential notations and assumptions for the subsequent content, as summarized on page 9. The following section provides the definition, while section 4 delves into its properties.

Several concepts from fibred category theory are pertinent to this paper. Here, I define them as operations on sets or predicates without considering their fibred nature. For a comprehensive introduction to fibrations, refer to [12,8]. The referenced material is also covered in [4, chapter 3] or [20, chapter 2].

Subsequent sections rely on assumptions regarding the structure and semantics of algebraic specifications. This section elucidates these assumptions and introduces necessary concepts, with a summary at the end of this subsection on page 9.

The paper exclusively considers single-sorted specifications with at most one parameter, with the restriction to one sort being crucial due to the use of morphisms f(x)x as the semantics of algebraic specifications. Additionally, the proposed liftings for specifications are contingent on the liftings of Hensel and Jacobs for data types. This restriction is also evident in their work.

Intuitively, states x and y manifest similar behavior with respect to the coalgebra, suggesting a bisimulation between them. However, as a morphism of elem, every coalgebra morphism must preserve the state's color. Consequently, there is no model of the altered elem specification with two distinct colors, making it impossible to find a pair of morphisms that map x and y to the same element.

Remark 3.3 asserts that the set of canonical forms must be defined during specification development, as the liftings are fundamentally reliant on these forms. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to their selection. If the specification provides normal forms, then one can adopt singleton sets of normal forms as canonical forms. However, the preceding example demonstrates that normal forms are not indispensable.

Consider t as a model of the parameter t, where |t|={t1, t2} represents a two-element set with kt=t1. In this case, the function f that maps both t1 and t2 to t1 is a morphism t t. The initial semantics of s comprise finite lists containing only t1 or t2, along with an additional operation m that appends t1 to its argument list.

This paper presents a definition of predicate and relation lifting for functors obtained as the initial semantics of parametric algebraic specifications. This enables the establishment of the notion of bisimulation and invariance for coalgebras of such functors. The paper also includes examples illustrating that alternative approaches to defining bisimulations for such functors are inadequate.

An apparent method to obtain liftings for algebraic specifications involves using the image of the liftings of Hensel and Jacobs for the initial algebra of the signature along the quotient map that factors the carrier of the initial algebra into a model of the specification. However, this approach does not yield satisfactory notions. Consequently, a modified definition that incorporates sets of canonical forms, developed alongside the specification, is proposed.

Future work entails exploring additional properties and gaining a deeper understanding of the role of canonical forms. Specifically, deriving conditions on the set of canonical forms to ensure, for instance, that the liftings commute with intersection would be of interest. Additionally, implementing algebraic specifications and their liftings in the CCsl compiler to enable broader case studies would be valuable.
