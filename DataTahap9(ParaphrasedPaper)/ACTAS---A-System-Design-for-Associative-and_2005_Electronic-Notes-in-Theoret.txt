The problem mentioned has prompted numerous investigations aimed at addressing it, including efforts to identify a subclass of r, referred to as sufficient conditions, in which regularity is maintained. Additionally, researchers have sought to expand the tree automata framework to accommodate a broader range of tree languages. Previous work has explored the identification of decidable subsets of tree languages that effectively retain regularity. The study also notes that tree languages recognizable with actree automata are closed under union and intersection, and the class of tree languages recognizable with regular ac-tree automata are closed under boolean operations. Furthermore, it highlights that the membership problem and the emptiness problem for actree automata are decidable. The term model's signature is determined by specifying ac-symbols (e.g., ac: f) and declaring constant function symbols (e.g., const: a, b). The tree automaton a is described in the second module, named a, example) as well as the receiver (bob). The protocol involves three steps: Alice selects a number r and sends it to Bob along with an integer h(k(alice), r). It is assumed that h(k(alice), r) cannot be used to retrieve k(alice) by anyone else. In the second step, Bob sends h(k(bob), r) back to Alice. Due to the exponentiation in the implementation of h, it can be presumed... [rest of the text isn't clear]
