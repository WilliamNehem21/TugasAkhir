In this paper, we tackle a specific challenge related to the study of density in category theory. We define a small full subcategory d of a category c as dense if a canonical functor fully embeds c into the locally small functor category setd. This concept of density is crucial in category theory and enables us to establish a satisfactory relationship between a functor-category model of idealised algol, an object-spaces model of interference-controlled algol without size restrictions, and a full embedding between the two. However, we demonstrate that ordinary density is inadequate and argue for the necessity of an enriched version of density, specifically enriched in the category cpo. We present a counter-example to illustrate the insufficiency of ordinary density and then show the existence of the cpo-enriched density we seek. Enriched density is a standard component of enriched category theory.

The languages under consideration are defined over three base types: comm for commands, nat for natural-number valued expressions, and var for assignable variables. Idealised algol is a simply-typed lambda-calculus applied over these base types, with its types generated from the base types through product and function operations, and its syntax comprising the lambda-calculus and a set of constants for imperative programming with recursion.

The category of object spaces is locally small, allowing hom-sets to be sets. While one could address this by focusing on a full subcategory containing a specific set of objects, choosing the appropriate set introduces a tension between the need to ensure the construction's efficacy and the desire for a mathematically natural and appealing model. A potential solution would be to restrict attention to the objects involved in interpreting base types and their products, but this approach sacrifices the distinction between the syntax and its model, which is undesirable as good models should be independent of syntactic considerations.

Our objective is to identify a small dense subcategory of fqop that is closed under finite products. The category of presheaves over this subcategory will be cartesian closed, and fqop will be fully embedded in this category in a manner that preserves products. This will enable us to establish semantics for idealised algol as outlined earlier.
