Large-scale data offers a promising avenue for reducing the need for nitrogen inputs in crop production, spanning genetic improvements to on-the-ground farming. Additionally, collaborative efforts across various fields such as plant health monitoring, advanced machine learning, and cloud-based computational techniques can amalgamate diverse data sources into valuable information and insights. Hence, the analysis of big data, as a promising approach, has the potential to make significant strides in addressing forthcoming challenges in sustainable agriculture.

Moreover, social media platforms, including Twitter, WeChat, and Google Search, represent an important source of extensive data. For instance, they can be utilized to gain insights into fertilization practices and to gather information on fertilizer and grain market dynamics. On one hand, an increasing number of users are promptly sharing agriculture-related information, such as nutritional assessments, fertilization prescriptions, yield and quality data, food consumption, and financial details. On the other hand, social media platforms can also yield access to advanced farming techniques, consumer preferences, and emerging trends in food marketing, thereby offering valuable insights for farmers.
