The particular class of irreversible cellular automata (CA) that possesses multiple attractors has garnered significant interest from CA researchers. Characterizing such CA is essential for developing CA-based solutions for various applications. This study investigates the fundamental properties of attractors in CA and focuses on characterizing 1-dimensional cellular automata with single length cycle attractors (point states). The concept of reachability tree is introduced for this characterization, enabling the identification of pseudo-exhaustive bits (PE bits) that define the point states of a CA. A theoretical framework has been devised to create strategies for synthesizing a single length cycle multiple attractor CA with a specific set of PE bits, resulting in a linear time solution for synthesizing the CA for the given set of attractors and their PE bits. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CA synthesis scheme is particularly effective in designing efficient pattern classifiers for a wide range of applications.

In the early 1980s, Stephen Wolfram extensively studied a family of simple 1-dimensional cellular automata capable of simulating complex behaviors. This discrete lattice structure, consisting of two states per cell with 3-neighborhood dependency, attracted numerous researchers from diverse fields, and a special class of 1-dimensional CA known as linear/additive CA received primary attention. The theoretical framework developed in this study is directed at characterizing non-uniform linear/additive CA.

As researchers characterized the state space of CA, they identified a set of CA states toward which neighboring states asymptotically converge during dynamic evolution. This set of states, known as the attractor of the CA state space, forms a basin of attraction with its neighboring states. CA with multiple attractors in its state space are of primary interest in applications such as pattern recognition, pattern classification, design of associative memory, and query processing.

Characterization of a CA with multiple single length cycle attractors received specialized attention for cost-effective solutions in real-life applications. Issues related to the identification of such attractors in linear/additive CA and the synthesis of single length cycle multiple attractor linear/additive CA were addressed in prior work. In this study, the focus is on characterizing single length cycle attractors in a specific class of 1-dimensional nonlinear cellular automata, and essential properties of CA attractors enabling such characterization are explored. The introduction of the reachability tree provides the theoretical basis for the identification of the attractors of a CA as well as its PE bits defining the attractors. A theoretical framework has been developed and effectively utilized to devise schemes for synthesizing a CA with the specific set of PE bits and having only single length cycle attractors. The proposed synthesis scheme is found to be effective when designing CA-based pattern classifiers for standard applications.

The paper also presents a detailed characterization of single length cycle attractors in the state space of CA. It identifies PE bits to identify the single length cycle attractors of a CA and proposes a theoretical framework to synthesize a CA with the specified PE bits for a given set of attractors. The synthesized CA is effectively utilized to design efficient pattern classifiers.
