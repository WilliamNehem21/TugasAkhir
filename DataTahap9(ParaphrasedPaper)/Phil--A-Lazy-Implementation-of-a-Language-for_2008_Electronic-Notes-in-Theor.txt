The matching mechanism utilizes a cost-based pattern transformation algorithm to perform approximate matching, allowing for operations such as renaming, insertion, and deletion of XML items. The results are ranked based on their cost. To improve efficiency, the implementation employs sophisticated indexing techniques and takes advantage of laziness to avoid creating unnecessary data structures. The paper analyzes the expressiveness of the filtering language and the performance of the system using the XMark benchmark suite.

The ApproxQL query language takes a more flexible approach by providing a sophisticated approximate matching mechanism based on a cost-based query transformation algorithm, allowing for renaming, insertion, and deletion of XML items. However, the language is considered relatively simple and does not offer the full expressive power of modern query languages.

The filtering language has been implemented in the prototypical system Phil using the lazy functional language Haskell. Through experimental evaluation, the paper demonstrates the convenience of a lazy implementation and the effectiveness of the approach, particularly in avoiding unnecessary data structure construction.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 formalizes the filtering language, Section 3 showcases how the filtering problem can be reduced to a tree matching problem, and Section 4 outlines the approximate pattern matching algorithm. Additionally, Section 5 presents experiments and a qualitative as well as quantitative evaluation of the methodology, emphasizing the benefits of lazy functional languages in this application domain. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

The "filteronebest" operator is designed to search for the best approximate match between a given pattern and an XML document, where approximate matching includes renaming, insertion, and deletion of pattern items. The operator aims to return the match with the lowest cost. It searches for a result for every position in the document where there is a tag that matches the pattern root and selects the best matching position.

The methodology utilized discards the injectivity property required in the path inclusion problem, which can lead to a loss of precision but greatly improves efficiency by encompassing several injective embeddings simultaneously. The goal is to find matches even when exact instances of the pattern tree cannot be recognized inside the data tree.

The paper explains that for the sake of efficiency, the implementation uses two indexes to encode the data tree, one for storing leaf nodes and the other for storing inner nodes.

To showcase the usefulness of the approach in a realistic scenario, the system has been benchmarked using the XMark benchmark suite, which consists of 20 queries challenging different aspects of the filtering engine. The paper highlights that due to computational limitations, three queries out of 20 could not be formalized using the proposed formalism.

In conclusion, the paper presents a declarative XML filtering language inspired by the approxQL language, extending it to provide a more expressive framework with new syntax constructs. It also discusses future work directions, such as formalizing a denotational semantics of the language and integrating the filtering language with an ontology reasoner for retrieving the synonymity relation.
