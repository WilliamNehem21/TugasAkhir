Both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insect development depend on periodic pulses of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) to drive each developmental transition. The ecdysone receptor complex plays a crucial role in mediating the physiological and morphological changes induced by ecdysteroid hormones like 20E during insect moulting. While extensive research has been conducted on the molecular action of 20E in holometabolous insects, limited data is available for hemimetabolous insects. 20E, being a lipophilic hormone, is synthesized and released into the hemolymph before entering cells to initiate metamorphosis.

The ecdysone receptor gene encodes a nuclear receptor with two major domains, the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and the DNA-binding domain (DBD). In its inactive state, the ecdysone receptor is located in the cytoplasm, and upon binding of 20E to the LBD, the DBD is activated. The ecdysone receptor protein comprises five domains, including the A/B-transcriptional activation domain, the C-DNA-binding domain, the D-hinge region, and the E-ligand-binding domain.

The moulting process is regulated by several transcription factors in the nuclear receptor superfamily, resulting in up-regulation of late genes in the hormone pathway and facilitating moulting. These nuclear receptors have the ability to traverse nuclear pores due to their heterodimeric nature, binding to specific DNA sites involved in active replication and chromosome remodeling.

Ecdysone signaling plays a crucial role in cuticle degradation and formation during moulting, with the insect cuticle containing a major component called n-acetyl-b-d-glucosamine (chitin).

Targeting specific developmental proteins unique to insects may aid in pest control. Compounds that mimic 20-hydroxyecdysone can interfere with receptor functions and potentially help manage agricultural pests. Effective bioinformatics tools can be utilized to design molecules that dock with ecdysone receptor proteins.

We employed the Glide program to set up receptor grid generation by utilizing default parameters and no special constraints. Molecular simulation involves the evolution of particle positions and velocities based on the laws of classical physics. In this study, we presented the superimposed conformational structure for the AMECR-20E, AMECR-etoxazole, and AMECR-zinc20031812 complexes by calculating the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value.

Historically, arthropod control has relied heavily on chemical insecticides, which are known to pollute the environment and have adverse effects on non-target species, leading to pesticide residues in food. However, there is now an increasing number of databases providing thousands of plant-based compounds that may serve as eco-friendly alternatives for controlling agricultural pests. These bioactive compounds may possess allosteric regulation properties, targeting proteins in other potential binding sites to effectively alter protein conformation and inhibit binding of the natural 20-hydroxyecdysone hormone in its dedicated pocket.

Limonoids, belonging to the tetranortriterpenoid group, are known for their insecticidal, anti-feedant, and growth-regulating activities on insects. The cytotoxic effect of nimbolide, a limonoid, was analyzed on SF9 insect cell lines, demonstrating rapid action on the cells at a concentration of 9.8 Î¼M.

The larvae of many Lepidopteron species are considered major agricultural pests, particularly those belonging to the Noctuidae, Pyralidae, and Tortricidae families. Ariadne merione, a member of the Lepidoptera order and Nymphalidae family, although not considered a serious pest, can be studied in silico to gather insights into target proteins, compounds, and the design of insect-specific biopesticides.
