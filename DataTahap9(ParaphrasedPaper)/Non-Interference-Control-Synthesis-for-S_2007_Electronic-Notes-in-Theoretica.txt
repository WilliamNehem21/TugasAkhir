This academic paper addresses the problem of synthesizing controllers to ensure non-interference for multilevel security dense timed discrete event systems, which are modeled using an extension of timed automata. The paper introduces a refined notion of non-interference for dense real-time systems and investigates the decidability issues related to verifying dense time properties. It then proves the decidability of synthesizing timed controllers for certain types of timed non-interference properties, offering a symbolic method for synthesizing controllers that ensure these properties.

Non-interference is a critical concern in computing environments where programs handling sensitive information may inadvertently leak data to unauthorized parties. Information flow analysis, specifically non-interference properties, addresses this concern by capturing causal dependencies between high-level actions and low-level behavior. This area has gained significant attention in computer science, especially in relation to the verification of information flow security and its application to the analysis of cryptographic protocols.

The paper explores the verification problem for timed non-interference, extending untimed proof techniques to capture time-dependent interference, such as timing covert channels. It also introduces timed non-interference properties in a dense time setting using timed automata.

The paper presents solutions for the timed non-interference control problem and proves the decidability of control problems for timed-stnni and timed-csnni by providing algorithms for synthesizing controllers that guarantee these properties. Additionally, it discusses the issue of partial observability in timed non-interference control synthesis, where the controller may have limited visibility of uncontrollable actions and clocks within the security system.
