Preventing deadlocks is a critical concern when transforming a synchronous system into a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) architecture, as the unbundling of input transitions in this process may lead to out-of-order signal reception. To prevent the system from entering a deadlock state, additional constraints must be introduced in the transformed model. One approach to achieve this is the synchronization using clocks, which allows for different levels of synchronicity, ranging from fully synchronous to fully asynchronous. 

The semantics of transition step execution play a crucial role in formulating the synchronicity levels. For instance, the choice of the execution policy on the petri net model, such as the global maximum step firing parallelism, impacts the system's behavior. Different execution policies may be motivated by various factors, such as performance considerations. In this context, it is essential to consider the activation of clock signals relative to the execution of events in the previous step to avoid the worst-case scenario.

The introduction of maximal output semantics, which binds sets of output transitions to fire concurrently, addresses the limitations of the standard interleaving semantics for petri nets. This new semantic approach provides more restrictive steps compared to the interleaving semantics, highlighting the differences in the richness of processes between the two semantics.

An extension to the concept of localities in petri nets, as originally proposed, has been made to differentiate between input and output transitions. This extension allows for the execution of input transitions as they arrive, while restricting output transitions to execute maximally and in persistent steps only. Analogies can be drawn between this notion and burst-mode circuits, as well as the generalization of burst-mode circuits, based on the flexible introduction of bursts and consideration of causality in I/O operations.

This paper presents a desynchronization methodology for synthesizing GALS systems using petri nets as the model of abstraction. The resulting desynchronized systems, constructed with petri nets, offer finer granularity compared to previous methods, making automation and application more feasible, even for large complex circuits. By applying the theory of localities to a synchronous system model, the proposed methodology preserves the synchronous properties of the input-output signals.

Automating the proposed methodology is crucial to reduce design time and minimize designer intervention. Further optimization of locality allocation is necessary to meet various criteria, such as minimizing interconnection between localities and increasing component speed. Additionally, exploring alternative ways of unbundling transitions could yield different conditions for persistent steps, offering more flexibility in system design.
