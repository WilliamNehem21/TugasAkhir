In recent times, there has been a growing recognition of the significance of history, leading to notable expansion in the cultural contents industry, particularly in the realm of cultural heritage sites, architectural cultural properties, and digital content for the restoration of historical remains using augmented reality technology. However, the majority of existing digital content restoration systems are predominantly utilized indoors. This paper seeks to introduce a 3D model visualization system for cultural heritage sites employing outdoor augmented reality, presenting a method to augment 3D models of cultural heritage sites in real-time video input from outdoor settings using object panorama, the surf algorithm, and GPS. The system aims to provide users with seamless access to information about cultural heritage sites.

With the increasing emphasis on history both domestically and internationally, the cultural contents industry has experienced significant growth, with the restoration contents sector garnering particular attention. The emergence of smartphone applications, particularly those utilizing augmented reality technology, has provided new avenues for the documentation and preservation of architectural and historical cultural assets. Given the limited physical existence and inadequate management of many cultural heritage sites, the use of augmented reality technology for content restoration is seen as a viable solution. However, the current focus on indoor applications for content restoration presents significant locational constraints.

The proposed 3D model visualization system is designed to leverage outdoor augmented reality technology, as opposed to indoor augmented reality, to provide an immersive and realistic viewing experience of cultural heritage sites to students, educators, and the general public. Outdoor augmented reality technology utilizes GPS, compass, and gyroscope sensors to enable the seamless integration of virtual objects within a wide outdoor space, in contrast to indoor augmented reality, which relies on markers within a more confined spatial environment.

The system outlined in this paper introduces a 3D model visualization approach based on augmented reality, enabling users to view accurate representations of cultural heritage sites on their smartphones using live video feed from the actual sites. Unlike existing methods that are confined to indoor spaces and rely on markers, this system allows users to access information about cultural sites with ease, whether indoors or outdoors.
