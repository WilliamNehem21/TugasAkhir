The study aimed to investigate the potential role of green tea polyphenon-60 (PP-60) in reducing metabolic risk factors, oxidative stress, and inflammation, as well as in improving cardiac apoptosis in experimentally induced diabetes. Male rats were induced with diabetes using streptozotocin (STZ) and then orally administered with PP-60 for two weeks. The treatment with PP-60 resulted in improvements in hyperglycemia, HbA1c, insulin secretion, HOMA-IR level, lipid profile, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, oxidative stress markers, and cardiac function. PP-60 also decreased apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and ameliorated DNA damage in the heart, likely through the modulation of caspases and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The findings indicate that the multifaceted effects of PP-60 contribute to its beneficial impact on diabetic heart dysfunction.

Green tea polyphenols have been associated with various health benefits, but the specific molecular mechanisms through which these compounds exert their effects are not yet fully understood. Previous studies have highlighted the potential of phytochemicals, such as catechins in green tea, to modulate oxidative stress-related cardiovascular diseases associated with diabetes.

Polyphenon-60, which contains pure catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), was investigated for its potential benefits in diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy in rats. The study aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of PP-60 by evaluating biochemical and molecular markers.

Rats were divided into different groups for the study, and various parameters related to metabolic, oxidative, and inflammatory markers were assessed. The administration of PP-60 resulted in improvements in body weight loss, serum lipid levels, and markers of oxidative stress, as well as a reduction in cardiac stress. The findings suggested that EGCG, a major component of PP-60, plays a key role in exerting beneficial effects on cardiac health, particularly through the modulation of lipid levels and attenuation of oxidative stress in the heart.

Overall, the study demonstrated the potential of PP-60 in ameliorating early cardiac injury in diabetes-induced rats and shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects, particularly in relation to metabolic, oxidative, and inflammatory pathways. The findings contribute to our understanding of the potential health benefits of PP-60, especially in the context of diabetic heart dysfunction.
