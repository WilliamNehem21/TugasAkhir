The paper discusses the challenges in achieving high polarization isolation and low sidelobe levels in the design of a filtering antenna array. It highlights the impact of mutual coupling on the array's performance and the introduction of an isolation wall to reduce the coupling, leading to increased design complexities. The isolation of the array is measured after connecting it to the power divider, with the resultant isolation being influenced by both the antenna array and the power divider. The paper also addresses the issue of achieving x-polarization radiation by nulling out the y-direction cells and discusses the coupling effects in the parallel coupling lines. Furthermore, it introduces the concept of differential S parameters (SDDHV and SDDVH) to evaluate the polarization isolation performance of the array and reports the measured isolation performance of the developed filtering antenna array. Finally, it presents the design and measured performance of a novel array with improved isolation, which is considered suitable for MIMO applications in 5G base stations.
