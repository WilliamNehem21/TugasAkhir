This academic paper is focused on complete distributions and their relevance to potentially endless programs. The paper highlights the formal verification of vphl within the Coq proof assistant, emphasizing the necessity for a strong foundation for probabilistic hoare logics, especially as they are increasingly used to verify critical code.

The paper also acknowledges the extensive work done in related formal systems, such as probabilistic guarded command language, dynamic logic, and kleene algebra with tests, and directs readers to relevant comparisons and discussions in related literature.

VPHL is intended to serve as a basis for further research and practical application of probabilistic hoare logics. It is designed to be extensible, allowing the addition of new rules without affecting the existing language. These new hoare rules can be classified into core rules and derived rules, with the latter being rules that can be derived using existing rules from the logic. While these derived rules may seem redundant, their inclusion is seen as advantageous for efficient and intuitive reasoning about programs, potentially enhancing the usability of the logic.
