This paper introduces criteria that ensure the thoroughness of real-time maude search and temporal logic model checking analyses, specifically under the maximal time sampling strategy, for a broad range of real-time systems. The paper establishes straightforward conditions for ensuring such thoroughness for object-oriented real-time systems, demonstrating that these conditions are often straightforward to establish even for large and intricate systems, such as advanced wireless sensor network algorithms and active network multicast protocols. The research findings offer thoroughness and decision-making capability for time-constrained search and model checking for a substantial and valuable class of dense-time non-zeno real-time systems, extending beyond the class of automaton-based real-time systems for which well-known decision procedures are available. For discrete time, the results support abstractions that can significantly reduce the state space to enable feasible search and model checking analyses.

While real-time maude is akin to modeling and simulation tools in terms of expressiveness and system specificity, its analytical capabilities more closely resemble those of the aforementioned automaton-based tools, albeit with some limitations. The limitations stem from dealing with general classes of infinite-state real-time systems for which no decision procedures are known, resulting in incomplete formal analyses for some cases.

Employing such a method serves as a genuine counterexample within the system, given that the method does not produce false counterexamples. In this exact sense, all the formal analysis methods supported by real-time maude are indeed valid. An analysis method is considered complete if the absence of counterexamples found using the method genuinely implies that no such counterexamples exist for the analysis in question. To ensure completeness, it is necessary to verify the time robustness of the specifications and the stability of the relevant state properties. This involves two tasks: a standard formal analysis in real-time maude under the maximal time sampling strategy, and the verification of appropriate proof obligations ensuring time robustness and stability. The paper addresses the practical aspect of identifying simple and easy-to-verify proof obligations to fulfill the second task. Additionally, it discusses the interpretive implications of the results for systems involving probabilistic algorithms.

Efficiency gains are realized by advancing time as much as possible, as demonstrated by the example of the maximal time sampling strategy significantly reducing the time taken for bug detection in a nominee selection component. The paper also discusses methods for regaining absolute completeness by introducing new variables or alternative approaches such as forcing time to stop at each moment in discrete time domains.

Furthermore, the paper details the modeling and analysis of the ogdc density control algorithm for wireless sensor networks in real-time maude, highlighting the ease of proving time robustness for this complex specification.

The research also highlights the efficiency gains of using maximal time sampling, particularly in scenarios where time measurements and durations are significantly disparate, making analyses based on visiting each moment in time unfeasible.

In conclusion, the research presented in this paper offers insights and methodologies for thorough and efficient formal analysis of real-time systems using the real-time maude tool, addressing crucial aspects such as completeness, time robustness, and stability.
