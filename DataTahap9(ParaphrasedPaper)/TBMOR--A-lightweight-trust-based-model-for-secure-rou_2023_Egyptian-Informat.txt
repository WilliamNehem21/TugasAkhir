This academic paper discusses the challenges in securing opportunistic networks, which are dynamic networks utilizing node movement for data delivery and are susceptible to malicious attacks due to their indirect connections and dynamic topology. The paper proposes a trust-based model for secure routing of opportunistic networks (TBMOR) to address these security challenges. TBMOR incorporates the positive degree and node activity degree into trust value calculations, evaluates nodes in the network using a dynamic combination of direct and indirect trust, and optimizes the next node list using trust values and pruning strategies. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of dynamically setting energy thresholds to extend the network life cycle by reducing redundancy. Simulation results show that TBMOR effectively resists malicious attacks, has a higher message delivery rate, and lower transmission latency compared to other routing algorithms.

The paper is organized as follows: background and current research on oppnets routing and trust models are presented in section 2, the proposed TBMOR trust model and the routing forwarding strategy are detailed in sections 3 and 4, and three simulation experiments are conducted in section 5 to explore the impact of packet lifetime, node caching, and malicious attacks on routing algorithms. Finally, the paper concludes in section 6.

The paper also discusses various routing algorithms, such as epidemic, spray and wait, message ferrying, utility-based, and trust model-based opportunistic routing, and their impact on packet delivery rate, network overhead, and efficiency.

Furthermore, the paper highlights the significance of trust models and their application in ensuring secure routing in opportunistic networks. The use of trust models is presented as an effective technology to counteract the impact of malicious and private nodes on the security and stability of opportunistic networks.

Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed TBMOR algorithm using the One simulator, comparing it with other routing algorithms to demonstrate its superiority in handling different scenarios, such as varying message lifetime sizes, node caching, and malicious node injections.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and solutions related to securing opportunistic networks, presenting the TBMOR algorithm as an effective approach to enhance security and performance in such networks.
