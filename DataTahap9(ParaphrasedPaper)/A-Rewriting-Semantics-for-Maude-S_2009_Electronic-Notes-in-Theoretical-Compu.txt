The paper discusses the division of labor between the system module (m) and strategy modules (sm) in the context of rewriting logic. The authors argue that separating the declarative nature of system module (m) from the modularity of strategy modules (sm) has multiple advantages, including the ability to use a single system module with multiple strategy modules for different purposes. The authors suggest that adhering to this separation methodology can enhance the development of elan modules. They discuss the use of strategy expressions within rewrite rule definitions and propose the use of strategy declarations for abbreviating strategy expressions.

The paper also introduces the concept of tasks representing sets of tasks using an operator denoted by juxtaposition, with the empty set representing none. Additionally, it presents syntax for representing solved tasks and continuations as terms of sort cont. The treatment of conditional rules is described as more complex, requiring appropriate strategies to satisfy the rewrites in the condition and ensuring that no solution exists when returning the empty set.

The rewriting semantics and the transformation from rewrite theories to rewrite theories are proposed with the use of reflective properties of rewriting logic. The paper suggests implementing the transformation operation as an extension of full maude, leveraging its efficient implementation of the reflective features of rewriting logic.

Overall, the paper delves into various aspects of rewriting logic, including the division of labor between system and strategy modules, the representation of tasks, the treatment of conditional rules, and the implementation of the transformation operation leveraging the reflective properties of rewriting logic.
