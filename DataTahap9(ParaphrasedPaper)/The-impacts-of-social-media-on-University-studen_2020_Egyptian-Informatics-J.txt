In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of internet and communication technologies (ICT) for various applications and purposes, including supporting communication at any time and in any place. The internet has become an essential tool for people to access information without constraints of time and location. Additionally, effective communication is seen as a crucial factor for success in the learning process. The use of ICT has the potential to positively impact the learning process, by facilitating efficient access to learning materials, creating connections with others, and joining interest groups. Social networks, including websites and applications, are commonly used as online platforms for connecting, sharing information, and collaborating with others.

An examination of the business impacts of social media usage reveals that there is variability in the extent to which social media is utilized for business purposes. Many individuals use social media for buying and selling, while expressing little interest in engaging with business groups. Furthermore, there is a predominant preference for traditional shopping methods over e-shopping on social media. There is also widespread dissatisfaction with commercial advertising on social media platforms. Although some individuals believe that promoting products through social media can be effective, there is a lack of confidence in the overall shopping process through these platforms.

The study indicates that students generally hold a positive perception of social media, with an increasing interest in using these platforms for academic purposes. However, they exhibit a reluctance to use social media for business-related activities and do not view e-shopping as a viable alternative to traditional shopping methods. In terms of political implications, students acknowledge the potential influence of social media on political events, but express a lack of desire to actively participate or follow political developments through these platforms. As a result, the focus should be on leveraging social media for educational purposes, establishing these platforms as reliable educational tools, and addressing potential negative effects such as health impacts and addiction associated with social media use.

Facebook emerges as the most widely used and popular social media platform among respondents, followed by the significant use of YouTube specifically for academic purposes. This suggests the potential for universities and other academic institutions to utilize YouTube as a reliable platform for academic activity. Future research could expand the scope of this study to include diverse societies and countries, enabling comparative analysis. Additionally, engaging other stakeholders such as faculty staff members and employers would contribute to enhancing the quality and relevance of future studies.
