This paper introduces a category theoretical framework for managing inconsistencies and analyzing subsystems in system specification languages. The framework leverages concepts from database view updates to treat individual states and components as dynamic system views, allowing for the identification and analysis of inconsistencies with the aim of tolerance. Furthermore, it enables the analysis of potential inconsistencies due to shared variables and provides examples applicable to a general class of specification languages, such as Z and VHDL.

The paper defines nodes and edges in a graph corresponding to a rosetta system and discusses elements of categories intended to be implemented as initial algebras, using specific examples to illustrate these concepts. It also addresses the issue of consistency among shared variables and defines what it means for a trace element to be consistent. Resolution strategies for inconsistencies are outlined, including the addition or relaxation of constraints in the system, with a focus on commuting diagrams.

The study emphasizes the interaction of system components and the detection of errors that may occur only when components are placed in an environment implementing conflicting axioms. The proposed framework, based on category theory, abstracts away from individual language issues and allows for the analysis of inconsistent systems, identification of sources of inconsistency, and comparison of choices available in non-deterministic systems.

Future work will explore defining degrees of correctness of systems, providing further definitions of morphisms between states, and applying fibrations to deduce the behavior of an unknown system based on a certain perspective or subsystem. The common framework ensures that results from different analyses can be expressed using the same vocabulary and that relationships between them will be readily apparent.
