The understanding of biological processes is currently limited, despite decades of experimentation and recent advances in genomics providing a large but fragmented body of information. This paper explores the potential use of formal languages to describe biological pathways, aiming to address the current ambiguity and informality in conveying such pathways through prose or diagrams. The use of formal languages could make important assumptions explicit and allow for direct simulations based on the described pathways.

The paper introduces the Process Modeling Language (PML) and presents example models of biological systems using PML. It also outlines the semantics of PML and demonstrates its composability through a model of cotranslational translocation on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The benefits of PML are discussed, along with potential future work in this area.

The use of formal languages in describing pathways would enforce explicit declaration of binding sites and explicit naming of rules for clarity and precision. The paper also introduces CorePML, which has specific properties including explicitly named rules and restrictions on interactions between molecules in different compartments. It explains the process of transforming a well-formed PML model to satisfy the properties of CorePML.

Furthermore, the paper addresses the handling of compartment changes and extends the discussion on using the bioambient calculus as the underlying machine model for PML. It describes the translation process for rules that describe binding reactions on sites, treating them uniformly as unrestricted function definitions and function calls.

Overall, the paper outlines the potential benefits of using formal languages to describe biological pathways and presents the PML as a tool to achieve this goal, with considerations for addressing issues related to compartment changes and the potential adaptation of the bioambient calculus.
