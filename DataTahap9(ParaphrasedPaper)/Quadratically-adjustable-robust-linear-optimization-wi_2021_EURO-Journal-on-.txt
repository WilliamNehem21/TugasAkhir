The techniques have been applied in various areas such as multi-stage inventory problems, planning and scheduling problems, and treatment-length optimization problems in radiation therapy (Ning and You, 2017). In particular, the use of robust optimization techniques that incorporate imperfectly disclosed data is of significant interest, especially in uncertainty sets that involve the intersection of two ellipsoids and a nonconvex, nonhomogeneous quadratic function. It is noted that generalizations of the s-lemma for non-convex quadratic systems with more than two quadratic functions are often unattainable unless the system exhibits some concealed convexity (refer to Example 2.1). For an overview of the s-lemma and its generalizations, refer to Polik (2007), Jeyakumar et al. (2009a), and Derinkuyu and Pinar (2006).

Jeyakumar et al. (2009b) established that the results do not yield corresponding s-lemma type outcomes for diagonal matrices due to the homogenization of the given non-homogeneous system. Simplified s-lemma results are known for homogeneous systems involving diagonal matrices (Bental et al., 2009; Polik, 2007).
