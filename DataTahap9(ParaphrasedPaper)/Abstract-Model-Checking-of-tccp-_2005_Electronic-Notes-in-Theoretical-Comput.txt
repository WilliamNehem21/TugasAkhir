The elements of these systems, such as timeouts and preemptions, were initially examined for automatic verification in systems specified in the timed concurrent constraint language, TCCP. A comprehensive approach for applying classical model checking techniques to TCCP was then introduced, utilizing temporal logic for reasoning about TCCP programs. The main concept underlying these methods is to exploit the constraint aspect of TCCP to establish a concise representation of the system for input into the model checking algorithms. However, both approaches resulted in inaccurate abstract models due to overapproximation caused by the temporal dimension of TCCP. This issue was addressed by combining over- and under-approximation in the abstraction of TCCP operators, enabling the construction of more accurate abstract models.

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that additional conditions relating to program suspension behavior are necessary for the abstract semantics of TCCP programs to accurately approximate the standard semantics. In cases where these conditions are met, an abstraction-by-transformation method was developed to enable the approximation of TCCP computations. Additionally, a refinement of the abstract semantics was presented to maintain suspension. Nonetheless, the transformation method for implementing abstraction could no longer be directly applied to the refined abstract semantics.

An intuitive approach involves partitioning each time instant into "n" segments. When abstracting a concrete program, the structure of the abstracted program ensures that all agents corresponding to concrete agents (excluding the conditional agent) are executed in the final segment of each "n" block. Moreover, the execution of conditional agents will commence during the relevant segment of the block based on their relative depth.
