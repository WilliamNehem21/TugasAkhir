In China, LNG receiving stations are predominantly located in the southeastern regions, where there is a relatively high demand for electric power resources. Therefore, utilizing LNG cold energy to generate electricity and supply it to LNG receiving stations is a practical approach. This paper presents three distinct processes for combining cold energy generation in order to compare and calculate their respective capacities for enhanced power generation performance under similar conditions.

LNG, as a low temperature liquid mixture, possesses both cold energy and pressure energy. Neither the Rankine cycle nor the natural gas direct expansion cycle can fully and efficiently harness this energy. However, integrating natural gas direct expansion with the Rankine cycle can facilitate greater energy recovery. This paper outlines the design of three different combination processes to compare their respective rates of cold energy generation utilization.

A multi-component mixed refrigerant (MFR) typically consists of a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, and butane, derived from the raw materials of liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. In this design, the molar composition of MFR, including the control of inlet and outlet temperatures for the MFR device, and the outlet temperature of LNG, are determined by reaching the dew point feeding, bubble point discharge, and the cold terminal temperature difference of the condenser. Based on the design principles, the molar composition of MFR is determined as follows: 20% ethane, 70% propane, and 10% n-butane.
