A recent survey conducted by McKinsey revealed that the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in business is rapidly advancing, with over half of the survey participants already implementing AI technology in at least one business function. The most commonly utilized business functions for AI are service operations, product and service development, and marketing and sales. The top three use cases across all businesses are service operations optimization, AI-based enhancement of products, and contact-center automation.

The existing research currently lacks a comprehensive analysis of the current and future potential applications of AI in power systems, encompassing different domains of AI. The study aims to address this gap by providing a thorough review that analyzes the volume of academic works on AI applications in power systems, including publication years, AI domains, and power system use cases, over the past 40 years.

The study is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the factors driving the increased use of AI in the power sector, while Section 3 provides an overview of studies that have reported various use cases of AI in power systems. The methodology is presented in Section 4, and the study concludes with a detailed discussion of the obtained results (Section 5), new research opportunities (Section 6), and a set of conclusions (Section 7).

The growing complexity of planning and operating electrical grids and electricity markets due to a higher number of actors and services has created the need for new tools to accommodate diversified and distributed power generation sources, particularly renewable generation with variable production patterns. Additionally, the increasing utilization of sensors such as smart meters and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has laid the groundwork for new business opportunities to extract value from collected data, ultimately improving energy efficiency and reducing costs for consumers and companies.

Recent studies have shown that AI is among the most utilized digital technologies in energy systems, particularly in power systems. However, the existing studies have been selective in their choice of use cases and analyzed AI domains, making it challenging to conclusively assess which AI domains are most promising for specific use cases or where along the power supply chain AI is most likely to be most beneficial.

A recent detailed study categorized nine broad application domains of AI in power systems into three fields: maintenance and security, general foundations of decision making, and distribution and customer services. The study ranked the applications according to their contribution to the energy transition as well as their maturity. The authors found that the most developed and beneficial AI use cases for the energy transition are those related to general foundations of decision-making.

Another study proposed a three-dimensional indicator that allows for the assessment of the benefit of AI applications in the energy sector, considering economic saving potential, regulatory risk, and technological maturity. The study compared AI applications in 15 use cases, finding that applications are most mature for forecasting, maintenance, and fault detection.

Several academic studies have explored the use of AI, including machine learning, in energy and power systems, focusing on use cases such as energy management, energy saving, smart grids, fault diagnosis, electricity consumption, and generation forecasting. The studies delineated use cases along the power system supply chain elements, including generation, transmission networks, distribution networks, market operations, retail, and isolated grids/microgrids.

The study utilized boolean queries in the Scopus index to quantify the amounts of research dedicated to each AI application and draw conclusions on the technological maturity of each AI application and the most utilized AI domains across the power supply chain.

Furthermore, the study examined the evolution of AI use cases in the power sector, focusing on specific use cases for all power system supply chain elements and AI domains.

In addition to the above, AI-based controllers have demonstrated suitability for deployment within microgrid environments due to their ability to handle complexity and uncertainty intrinsic to smart grids. Furthermore, AI methods have been used for load forecasting and in microgrid modeling to compensate for incomplete or inexact models. Additionally, AI has been employed to cluster consumer electricity consumption profiles and analyze household appliance energy consumption patterns, as well as to identify social-demographic factors associated with the adoption of distributed energy resources.
