In this instance, the exact implementation details are fortunately not integral to the semantics. Consequently, regardless of the quality of the implementation, it would outperform any state-of-the-art lazy interpreter on certain terms. This indicates that the level of administrative work required for completely lazy reduction cannot be compared to the benefits gained from improved sharing, a concept that should be explored more broadly. This differs from optimal reduction, where the costs of administrative work negate the advantages of optimality.

The primary consideration to verify is that the semantic rules are effectively established. Since it is exclusively defined for terms generated by the normalization process described in section 3.1, it is crucial to confirm that the resulting evaluation also conforms to the correct structure. The preservation of the property that arguments of applications and bodies of abstractions are variables or metavariables is evident, as only variables are substituted for variables. Furthermore, the naming property remains preserved, as demonstrated below.

In addition to enhancing comprehension of the theoretical aspects surrounding sharing and efficiency in functional programming languages, this study seeks to serve as a foundational framework for practical applications. Although the legitimacy of various degrees of laziness has waned over the years [19, 5], suggesting that our work may primarily have theoretical significance, we believe this to be unfounded.

Firstly, laziness is not universally impractical, and there are methods to combine the benefits of strictness and laziness, such as static analyses and optimistic evaluation. There is no reason to believe that these techniques cannot be adapted to our framework. Furthermore, emerging classes of functional languages, like proof assistants such as Coq, construct interactive programs (proof terms) rather than being directly written, which may have highly intricate shapes suited to greatly lazy strategies. We contend that the rise of these new paradigms, with their unique challenges, presents an opportunity to reexamine the theory and practice of programming language implementation.
