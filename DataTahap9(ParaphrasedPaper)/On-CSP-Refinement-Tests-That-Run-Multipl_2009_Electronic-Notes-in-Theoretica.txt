In other words, when the refinement's right hand side is simply 'p' and the left hand side is independent of 'p', it is well-known that this precisely captures satisfiable failures in behavioral specifications, i.e., satisfiable predicates in the form. Furthermore, if 'r(tr1,..., trn)' holds, then 'r((tr1, impossible1),...,(trn, impossiblen))' holds as well, since 'r' allows the refusal of impossible events and the nondeterministic choice is over a non-empty set containing at least (impossible1,..., impossiblen).

The important observation is that for each CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) operator, each failure of the resulting process arises from at most one failure of each component. Therefore, each failure of 'h(p)' results from at most one failure of each copy, totaling at most 'n' failures of 'p'. Consequently, the set of failures of 'h(p)' will be of a certain form.

It's also noteworthy that most of the predicates, except for determinism, are refinement closures of more basic properties. It appears that properties in the form considered in the previous paragraph naturally lead to predicates that are not refinement-closed, necessitating the consideration of the refinement closure. This area warrants further investigation as calculating the refinement-closure of such predicates is not straightforward, and it would be beneficial to have some general techniques for this purpose.
