On one hand, both current signature analysis (CSA) and voltage signature analysis (VSA) are employed as methods to scrutinize and track the behavior of active dynamic systems. Thoroughly assessing the outcomes achieved through the application of these methods aids in the early detection of potential issues in the stator winding, rotor, coupling, efficiency, charging system, and bearings, among others. These techniques leverage the electrical machine being monitored as a transducer, enabling the user to assess the electrical and mechanical status from the power panel, primarily by monitoring one of the three phases of the current or voltage of the machine.
