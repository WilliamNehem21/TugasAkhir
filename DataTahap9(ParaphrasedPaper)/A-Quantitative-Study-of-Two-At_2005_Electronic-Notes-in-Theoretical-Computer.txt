We utilize a specialized operational semantics to enable the prediction of quantitative metrics for systems that describe cryptographic protocols, taking into account potential attacks. Our system transitions are labeled with enhanced attributes, and we assign transition rates based solely on these labels. We then map these transition systems to Markov chains and assess system performance using standard tools.

The attacker, as defined in the traditional dolev-yao model, is an entity that operates without fairness. According to this model, the attacker has control over the communication network, allowing it to monitor, intercept, manipulate, and substitute messages at will. These actions are easily represented within a process algebraic framework.

Our approach begins with the description of a specific protocol and a documented attack. We articulate this description using process algebra lysa, enabling the specification of behaviors for both legitimate participants and the attacker running in parallel processes. The quantitative analysis of this specification provides insight into the attacker's efforts in a given scenario.

Our algorithm relies on a shared secret key between a mobile station (MS) and an access point (AP). This key is used to encrypt transmitted messages, along with an initialization vector. However, due to the weakness of the WEP protocol used for encryption, message integrity cannot be entirely guaranteed. We describe a couple of attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities without disclosing the secret key, including an attack on the WLAN authentication protocol.

We propose possible parameters for a cost function, reflecting the features of an idealized architecture and a specific cryptosystem, without defining its actual form. Although abstract, this proposal serves its purpose, as precise instantiation can occur during refinement steps from specification to implementation when actual parameters are available.

The transition rate, q(ti, tj), at which a system transitions from behaving like process ti to behaving like tj is the sum of the individual rates of all possible transitions from ti to tj. This quantity coincides with the off-diagonal element qij of the generator matrix of the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). We use CTMC and its corresponding generator matrix interchangeably to refer to a Markov chain. More formally, the entries of the generator matrix q produce the same bit string as that obtained by encrypting with the correct key through a logical XOR operation. We abstractly represent this action, avoiding explicit constructs for the XOR operation or the handling of RC4(v, k). To illustrate this level of abstraction, we emulate the customary induction rules used to demonstrate the capabilities of the dolev-yao attacker in terms of its knowledge.
