Consider a situation in which several supermarkets or stores share large warehouses that stock supplies for them. Each store is located some distance away from a warehouse and is responsible for the costs of maintaining its products in the warehouse and the transportation costs to its specific location. This scenario can be viewed as a facility location problem, where each store is a terminal and each warehouse location is a potential facility. In the traditional optimization framework, the perspective of the warehouse company takes precedence, and each terminal can be seen as being controlled by a central authority in order to minimize overall opening and connection costs. However, when considering the competitive nature of the supermarkets, this approach to global optimization is no longer feasible. To analyze such scenarios, game theory can be employed.

In the fair cost facility location games that we examine, each player controls multiple terminals and can simultaneously move them to minimize their own costs. In the case of singleton games, terminals sharing opening costs evenly is equivalent to players sharing these costs evenly, as players and terminals are effectively the same in these scenarios. However, when players control multiple terminals, the same equivalence does not hold true. Prior works have explored facility location problems from the perspective of game theory, including the class of valid utility games, which can be considered as facility games when both facilities and players are controlled by singleton players.

The capacitated version of the game has been discussed by previous researchers, showing that for the metric singleton fair cost facility location game, the price of anarchy (POA) can be unbounded, while the price of stability (POS) is hk, where k is the number of players. Furthermore, it is shown to be NP-hard to determine whether there is a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) in singleton capacitated facility location games with arbitrary opening cost sharing.

In this paper, we extend the results from previous works to fair cost facility location games, demonstrating that it is NP-hard to determine whether there is a PNE in this game, even in the metric case, when players are allowed to control multiple terminals. We provide instances of fair cost facility location games with no PNE, based on instances without PNE in weighted network design games used by other researchers. Additionally, we prove that the POS of this game can be as inefficient as the POA for both the uncapacitated metric case and the general capacitated case.

The paper is organized as follows: we provide formal definitions needed to understand our paper and define our game in Section 3. In Section 4, we present instances with no PNE and prove the NP-hardness of PNE existence, as well as link these instances to weighted games. In Section 5, we prove that the POS is as poor as the POA in both the uncapacitated and capacitated versions of fair cost facility location games. Finally, in Section 6, we present our final remarks and discuss future work.

The rest of the paper presents various challenges and complexities involved in fair cost facility location games, addressing the implications for decision-making and analysis in this context.
