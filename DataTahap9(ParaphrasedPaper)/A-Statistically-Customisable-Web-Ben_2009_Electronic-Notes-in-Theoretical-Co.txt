This paper introduces a customizable solution for web benchmarking, comprising three key components: an internet traffic generator for http traffic, a web server with static and dynamic page generation capabilities for testing, and a performance monitor for reporting performance metrics during the test. The tool is designed based on the implementation of probability distributions that capture the statistical properties of internet traffic, such as the inter-arrival rate of incoming web traffic, the number of objects in a web page, and the size of these web objects, which can be tailored for specific capacity planning analysis. The paper details the generation process of web pages and the customizable traffic characterization used for the benchmark, as well as the monitoring process and validation of the implemented probability distributions.

The aim of the benchmark is to create a specific and customizable workload based on probability distributions that model statistical properties of the web test. These distributions define properties such as the inter-arrival rate of incoming web traffic, the number of objects on a web page, and the size of the web objects. Customizing the benchmark using probability distributions is valuable for replicating workloads described in literature and for simulating real traffic in scenarios, as well as validating results obtained from network simulators such as opnet modeler or ns-2.

The paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses the motivation for using probability distributions to characterize the workload introduced by the benchmark, while sections 3 and 4 outline the proposed benchmark, presenting the web page generator and the web traffic generator, respectively. Section 5 describes details about the monitoring process. The paper also discusses the experimental results and the validation of the probabilistic properties.

The paper introduces the use of probability distribution, specifically Pareto distribution, to model the number of objects per page on a web server. The process of constructing the web server site is divided into two steps: creating the web objects based on the assigned distribution for the size of the web objects and then including these objects in the web pages based on the distribution modeling the number of objects.

The benchmarking client sends information to the web server, specifying the probability distributions that affect the number of objects per page and the size of these objects. Subsequently, the web server generates the file structure and sends the paths and names of the web files back to the client.

Before initiating the workload generator, the benchmarking tool performs a performance monitoring process in the web server to gather information about CPU utilization. The monitored processes include the web server process and, for dynamic pages, the database server process.

The test-bed scenario involves two computers connected through a fast ethernet switch, with the web server running on an Intel Pentium D processor at 3000 MHz and 2 GB of RAM, and the client running on an AMD Turion 64 processor at 1600 MHz with 512 MB of RAM.

In summary, the paper presents a flexible web benchmarking tool that can be customized using probability distributions, allowing for the generation of a representative workload based on key statistical properties. The tool also includes a web page generator and a monitoring process to obtain important performance metrics from the web client and server. The paper also provides validation of the customized properties.
