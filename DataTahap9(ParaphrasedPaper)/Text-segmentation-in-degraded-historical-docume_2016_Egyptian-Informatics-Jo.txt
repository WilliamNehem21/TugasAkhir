This paper focuses on improving the recognition rates of historical Indus scripts through the segmentation of text from degraded images, a task that poses significant challenges due to complex backgrounds. The authors propose a new method for segmenting text and non-text in Indus documents based on the observation that text components are less cursive compared to non-text components. The method combines Sobel and Laplacian operations to enhance low contrast pixels and generate skeletons for text components, allowing for efficient study of component structures. Additionally, the authors introduce a criterion for grouping components in the same line, which leads to the classification of clusters into text and non-text based on the characteristics of text components. The proposed method is evaluated on a large dataset and compared with existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of recall and precision.

While there have been significant advancements in text segmentation for various official languages in India, recognizing old scripts like Indus remains challenging due to its complexity. The Indus documents consist of ornamental-looking symbols, making traditional recognition methods ineffective. The paper is organized into sections covering related work, the proposed methodology, and experimental results and comparisons with existing methods.

The authors also review related work in the field of inscription contributions, highlighting various methods proposed by previous researchers. These include preprocessing techniques and segmentation methods for handwritten Kannada texts, as well as the use of steerable directional filters and local connectivity maps for extracting paragraphs from historical document images. Other methods discussed include binarization-free clustering for segmenting curved text lines in historical documents and character detection and grouping for damaged documents.

In their proposed method, the authors apply a skeleton operation to the enhanced image to reduce the width of edge components, while also introducing a process for eliminating components with more cursive branches. Additionally, the paper describes the algorithmic steps for enhancement and addresses potential disconnections between components through smoothing and merging operations. The authors propose an unsupervised nearest neighbor clustering criterion for grouping components and extracting features to classify clusters as text or non-text regions.

The authors conclude by summarizing their proposed method for segmenting text lines from degraded historical Indus documents, emphasizing the novel combination of Laplacian and Sobel operations and the pruning of unwanted components. They also outline their future plans to extend the method to other Indian scripts and to focus on character segmentation and recognition.
