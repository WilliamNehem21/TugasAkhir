Categorial grammars have been the subject of study in the field of natural language processing. In this paper, we specifically examine classical (or basic) categorial grammars, as well as Lambek categorial grammars, which have close ties to linear logic introduced by Girard. These grammars are lexicalized and associate types (or categories) with elements of the lexicon. They are termed "k-valued" when each symbol in the lexicon is assigned to at most k types, and "rigid" when 1-valued. Recently, there has been significant interest in k-valued grammars in the context of learnability. It is important to gain a thorough understanding of the characteristics of these grammars within this context.

In the realm of classical categorial grammar, a classical categorial grammar over a finite set is a finite relation g between types and terms. If <c; a> is in g, we say that g assigns a to c and we denote this as g: c â†’ a. Additionally, we define subt p(g) as the set of subformulas of types assigned by g to some symbol in p.

We define g2d in a similar manner by interchanging the roles of all ui and vi. It is established that g1d and g2d are both rigid injective pcp-grammars (p). For example, when d1 = <(ab; abbb);(bb; b)>, we obtain p rd1 = {a, b, 1, 2, t, #}.

This paper addresses the decidability of each class of k-valued classical categorial grammars and each class of k-valued Lambek grammars. It is demonstrated that the emptiness of the intersection of two languages is an undecidable problem for each class. The proof hinges on a specific class introduced here as pcp-grammars, a subclass of unidirectional grammars, for which several properties are established. Notably, the problem being focused on is undecidable for this subclass, and therefore not trivial.
