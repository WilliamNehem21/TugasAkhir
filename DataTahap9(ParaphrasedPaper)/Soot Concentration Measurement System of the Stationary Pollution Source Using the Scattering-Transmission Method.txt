This academic paper introduces a novel method for measuring soot concentration, which involves combining the scattering integration method with the extinction theory of soot concentration. Unlike the extinction method, this new approach does not require prior knowledge of the average diameter of soot particles in the flow. A soot concentration measurement instrument has been developed and an experiment has been conducted to validate the method.

In the experimental setup, laser 1 is positioned at the focal point of collimator lenses 2 to convert the laser beam into parallel light. The parallel light beam is split into two beams using splitter prism 5. The reflected light is focused on photodiode 3 (opt101) through focus lens 4, where the optical signal is converted into the original light intensity current signal, denoted as i0. The transmission beam passes through the soot space 6 and reaches the photodiode, producing measurement signal i2 that includes transmission light and small angle scattering light. The difference between the photocell light signal i1 and the photodiode signal i2 represents a certain angle of scattering light intensity signal.
