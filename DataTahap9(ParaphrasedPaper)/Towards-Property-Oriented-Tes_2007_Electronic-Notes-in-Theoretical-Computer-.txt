The paper discusses property-oriented testing for reactive systems, which focuses on verifying specific properties of interest within a formally verified specification. Unlike traditional conformance testing, property-oriented testing aims to check whether an implementation satisfies specific properties outlined in the specification. The selection of test cases is driven by test purposes, which target testing at particular functionalities. The paper provides an overview of property-oriented testing approaches for reactive systems, with a focus on labeled and symbolic transition systems.

One key aspect of property-oriented testing is the test suites' ability to distinguish between different implementations. A test suite that is e-complete can distinguish among all exhibiting and non-exhibiting implementations, while an e-exhaustive test suite can only detect non-exhibiting implementations, and an e-sound test suite can only detect exhibiting implementations. The paper emphasizes the importance of obtaining test suites that are sound and e-complete by considering test purposes in test selection, which ensures that implementations exhibiting the desired properties are accepted and non-conforming implementations are detected.

The paper also discusses different approaches for test case selection based on labeled transition systems and symbolic transition systems. For example, the paper introduces a testing tool called TGV, which automatically synthesizes conformance test cases for non-deterministic reactive systems using verification techniques such as synchronous product and on-the-fly verification. Additionally, the paper presents a tool called STG for generating symbolic test cases for reactive systems, which utilizes a special kind of LTS called input-output symbolic transition systems (IOSTS) and offers a more abstract representation of test purposes and test cases, addressing the state space explosion problem.

The authors also propose an algorithm for symbolic test generation based on the IOCO theory, in which the underlying model of labeled transition systems is extended to include location variables and data, leading to the creation of symbolic transition systems (STS). The proposed algorithm aims to combine test generation from STS with on-the-fly execution of test cases and guarantee the soundness and completeness of the generated test cases with respect to the IOCO theory.

The paper emphasizes that both LTS and STS approaches have their challenges, and appropriate techniques for selecting effective test cases and data to form feasible test suites are currently under investigation. The authors suggest that future developments in property-oriented testing for reactive systems will likely involve specific kinds of properties and their associated challenges.
