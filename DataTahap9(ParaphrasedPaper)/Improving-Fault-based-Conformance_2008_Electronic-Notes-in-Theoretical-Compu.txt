Fault-based conformance testing is a strategy that relies on specific fault models to test protocol specifications for conformance. Although this mutation testing technique has been applied to protocol specifications and a case study of web-server testing has been conducted, several issues arose in applying this method to a large industrial project. This paper addresses these shortcomings and presents foundations, techniques, and tools to overcome them. Specifically, it proposes a solution to the problem of state-space explosion in generating mutation tests for industrial scale applications. Additionally, the paper discusses how the previous approach using bisimulation check for test purposes resulted in more test cases than needed and highlights the infeasibility of constructing complete state spaces for industrial specifications with huge state spaces.

The paper provides a comprehensive review of the underlying testing theory and develops the foundations for a new ioco-based test case selection approach. It also presents techniques for dealing with large specifications and outlines the overall approach, followed by experimental results. In conclusion, the paper demonstrates the use of mutation operators at the specification level to generate faulty versions of a specification and highlights the meaning of faults in the context of ioco. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of considering non-determinism in fault-based testing and discusses the applicability of the approach to different specification languages with (io)lts semantics.

The experimental results indicate that up to 77% of test purposes can be generated within a reasonable time, while the remaining 23% are related to complex scenarios of the specification. The paper also compares the performance of different techniques for test case generation and highlights the advancements made in fault-based conformance testing, particularly in reducing the overall number of test cases and improving the slicing technique.

In comparison to previous approaches, the new ioco-based test case generation technique focuses on faults and represents an advancement from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. It reduces the number of test cases and improves slicing techniques, making fault-based conformance testing more suitable for industrial-scale applications.
