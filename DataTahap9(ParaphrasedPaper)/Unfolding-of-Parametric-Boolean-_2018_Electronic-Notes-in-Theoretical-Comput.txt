This academic paper discusses the importance of models in understanding cellular regulatory processes in systems biology. The paper focuses on partially specified models where the missing information is represented as parameters and introduces a new approach to analyzing parametric logical regulatory networks to address combinatorial explosion, common in such models. The analysis of parametric regulatory networks is hindered by the exponential size of the state space and the doubly exponential number of parametrizations, which often limits the scalability of analysis techniques for these networks. The paper proposes a new analysis framework for parametric logical regulatory networks that addresses combinatorial explosion at two levels by introducing a novel encoding of parametrizations and extending Petri net unfoldings to accommodate the parametric setting. A prototype implementation is provided to compute the introduced unfoldings, and experiments are conducted to compare the results of their methods against state-of-the-art methods in parametric regulatory network analysis.

The paper also relates the work to existing methods for handling parameter uncertainty in logical regulatory networks, such as computational tree logic and constraint logic programming for parameter identification, and presents a method for restricting the initial set of possible behaviors for boolean networks by deriving logical constraints from time series data and applying answer set programming to compute a set of transient dynamics best fitted to the measurements.

The paper notes that the exact effects of regulators on their targets are often unknown in biology and therefore abstracted by parameters, where each parameter represents the value of the target assigned to a combination of active and inactive regulators in a particular state. The paper introduces conditions on the edges of the influence graph, such as monotonicity and observability, which can partially restrict the set of feasible parametrizations. Additionally, the paper discusses the encoding of parametrizations, the combinatorial explosion of the state space of parametric boolean networks, and the application of Petri net unfoldings to parametric settings.

In summary, the paper offers a new platform for parameter identification of logical regulatory networks based on Petri net unfoldings and provides a novel approach to encoding parametrizations that allows for efficient analysis of parametric boolean networks while guaranteeing reachability preservation. The paper also outlines possibilities for future work, including the refinement of the over-approximation of feasible parametrizations and the consideration of additional constraints.
