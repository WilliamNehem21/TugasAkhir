An additional contribution of this research involves the introduction of a trace inclusion preorder for weakly bound processes, denoted as p n q, where the traces of process p are included in those of process q. We conduct a comparison of this preorder with a trace inclusion preorder for strongly bound processes. Preorders of processes are a significant and complex aspect of subtyping/subeffecting for type and effect systems. They are also useful for examining the compliance of contracts with implementations and subcontract relations in calculi for web services [5,6].

We will now define a preorder p n q on weakly bound processes, utilizing a set of names n as an index for the preorder relation. This index is necessary to prevent name confusion, as we will explain later. When p n q is true, the semantics of p is included in the semantics of q (second item of theorem 5.7).
