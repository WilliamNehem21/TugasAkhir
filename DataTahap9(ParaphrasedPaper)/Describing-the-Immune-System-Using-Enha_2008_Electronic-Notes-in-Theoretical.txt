This research focuses on investigating a novel class of mobile membrane systems called enhanced mobile membranes, in which new contextual evolution rules dictate the evolution of objects within a membrane under specific conditions. These rules also govern the processes of endocytosis and exocytosis. The study utilizes the enhanced mobile membrane system to model various immune system mechanisms.

The immune system, described in a periodically updated book, comprises a network of cells and proteins that collaborate to detect and eliminate foreign or harmful substances entering the body. While the activation of immune cells may take some time, once activated, the immune system efficiently combats hostile organisms. The immune system mainly relies on white blood cells, produced in large quantities in the bone marrow, which exhibit diverse capabilities. Some cells engulf invaders, while others eliminate infected or aberrant host cells. B cells, a specific type of immune cell, can release antibodies that tag intruders for destruction by macrophages. Additionally, the immune system has the capacity to generate memory cells, enabling it to respond more rapidly and vigorously upon recognizing a previously encountered threat.

The structure of the academic paper includes an introduction to the immune system in section 2, a presentation of enhanced mobile membranes in section 3, examples of the application of these membranes to model immune system mechanisms in section 4, an exploration of the structural properties of mobile membranes in section 5, and a conclusion along with references to conclude the paper.

The immune system involves specialized white blood cells known as lymphocytes, derived from the bone marrow and distributed throughout the lymphatic system, including lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus. Lymphocytes, specifically T cells and B cells, possess receptors that enable them to identify foreign substances. Upon phagocytosis, macrophages present fragments of antigens on their surface to alert other immune cells, aiding in the recognition of intruders. Dendritic cells, found in lymphoid tissues, play a crucial role in activating T cells by presenting antigens. These dendritic cells possess distinct features and migration patterns depending on whether they are activated by infection.

T cells undergo a selection process to retain cells capable of effectively interacting with self antigens, while eliminating those that could harm the host. Cytotoxic T cells destroy infected or aberrant cells, while helper T cells assist B cells in their activation, which leads to the production of plasma cells and memory B cells.

The research also introduces rules governing the transformation of objects within membranes, where the movement is controlled by a multiset of objects within the enclosing membrane, rather than by an object within the moving membrane. The application of these rules forms an evolution step, referred to as a transition step.

In summary, this work investigates the enhanced mobile membrane system as a tool for modeling immune system processes. By employing this new class of mobile membrane systems, the study aims to provide insight into the dynamics of the immune system and facilitate a better understanding of its functioning.
