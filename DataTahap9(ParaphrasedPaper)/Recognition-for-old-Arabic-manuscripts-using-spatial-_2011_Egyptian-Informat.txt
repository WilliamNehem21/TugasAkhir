The analysis of textures is fundamental for recognizing and categorizing objects in various fields, such as historical document manuscripts, which are crucial for preserving cultural heritage. This research focuses on classifying old Arabic manuscripts from different historical periods using texture analysis and a segmentation-free approach. The aim is to differentiate between manuscripts from the contemporary (modern), Ottoman, and Mamluk eras. The classification relies on a spatial gray-level dependence (SGLD) technique, which provides eight distinct texture features for each document. Stepwise discriminant analysis and multiple discriminant analysis methods are employed to reduce feature dimensionality and extract training vector features. Decision tree classification is used to categorize the manuscripts into the three historical age classes. The system was tested on 48 Arabic historical manuscripts from the Dar Al-Kotob Almasria library, resulting in a 95.83% correct classification rate.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest among researchers in studying and analyzing historical manuscripts across different languages, geographical regions, and historical periods to aid in editing, indexing, and archiving processes. This interdisciplinary work is valuable for paleographers as it provides an objective basis for confirming or refuting their findings when confronted with undated historical documents.

Ancient Arabic manuscripts pose particular challenges due to their complexity, which encompasses general manuscript difficulties (e.g., character degradation, stains, and low-quality images) as well as language-specific complexities such as text cursiveness, character overlapping, diacritics, calligraphic variations, ornamental decorations, and unique layout structures. Research on a dataset of 1000 writers who copied a fixed text of 156 words three times indicates that micro-features outperform macro-features in identification tests, achieving an accuracy exceeding 80%.

Individuality and the similarity in handwriting styles are determined by employing distance measures between feature vectors, and writer classification is integrated within the statistical pattern recognition framework. Combining texture-level and allograph-level features results in high writer identification and verification performance, which remains viable even with datasets containing 103 writers.
