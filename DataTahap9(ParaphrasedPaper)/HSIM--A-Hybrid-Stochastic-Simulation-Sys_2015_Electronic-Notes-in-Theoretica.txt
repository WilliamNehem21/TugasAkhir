The tetrameric repressor found in E. coli's lac operon is a notable example of this phenomenon. Despite there being only approximately ten copies of this repressor in each bacterium, its effects are highly noticeable due to its high local concentration near its binding site on the DNA. This concentrated state is a result of the repressor's inherent mechanism of operation and the specific distance between the locations of its binding sites on the DNA. This cooperative process perpetuates itself.

Observing a particle over a time interval t reveals that it is displaced by a position vector r. Repeating this process enables the computation of the average displacement during time interval t, which should yield < r> = 0. This indicates that there is no preferred direction for the random forces exerted by the water molecules on the particle.

The diffusion constant d, denoted in the formula as D = kT/6πηR 
 depends on the size and shape of the particle, as well as the viscosity and temperature of the fluid through which it moves. The factor 6 is related to the dimensionality; 6 applies to 3D motion, while 4 applies to 2D motion, and 2 applies to linear motion. Essentially, diffusion occurs due to the independent Brownian motion of many molecules.

Unimolecular reactions involve a single molecule that can exist in various states. An example of a unimolecular reaction is the spontaneous fluctuation of a protein's structure from one conformation to another. These reactions can be modeled in entity-centered stochastic simulators using probabilities.

Bimolecular reactions require two events to occur: a collision between a copy of each reactant molecule and sufficient energy during the collision. These collisions arise due to molecular diffusion, and the average number of collisions is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, known as the mass action law.

In simulations, physical links between entities and the formation of large aggregates can slow down the diffusion of molecules, potentially leading to significant changes in local concentrations. These effects can have a substantial impact on the behavior of the entire system, which cannot be accounted for with more global methods assuming a permanently homogeneous mixture of molecules.

Hsim is primarily designed for modeling bacteria but can also be used for small eukaryotic cells such as yeast or fungus. The main compartment can be configured to resemble either rod-shaped bacteria or a spherical conformation like yeast, with subcompartments nested into the main compartment.

Molecules are typically represented by a record containing their type, position, size, and a list of links to other molecules. Hsim tracks each molecule in real time, applying rules to mimic chemical reactions between molecules in a real system.

This approach means that when two molecules of species a and b collide, they can trigger a reaction transforming a into species c and b into species d with a certain probability. Similarly, the omission of the second molecule on the right side of the rule specifies a reaction giving only one product.

A specific model in Hsim involves two species, a and b, diffusing in a compartment, with the only reaction transforming one pair of molecules of type a and b into a single molecule of type c, with a probability of 0.135.

The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus utilizes photosynthesis for energy intake and has a metabolism regulated by an internal circadian clock synchronized with daylight through photosensitive receptors. The clock mechanism primarily consists of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. These proteins are genetically regulated, but spontaneous oscillations of the phosphorylation level of KaiC hexamers have been observed in vitro.

An allosteric transition that is very slow can switch the hexamers from one state to another. The KaiA protein activates phosphorylation of the KaiC hexamers in a tense state, while in a relaxed state, the hexamers tend to dephosphorylate. This dephosphorylation is counteracted by KaiA, which is itself inhibited by KaiB. The relative concentrations of the KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins determine the phosphorylation states of the KaiC hexamers.

The compartment is initially filled with globular actin, a protein that can self-assemble into a polarized dimer and polymerize from each end of the initial dimer, with kinetics depending on the end from which the polymerization process starts. The process is reversible, with the polymer being capable of shrinking and releasing globular actin monomers, which can then polymerize again after a certain amount of time.

Hsim integrates both an entity-centered system and an approximate stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), providing the advantages of spatial localization and an efficient method for computing the evolution of a system of reaction rules.
