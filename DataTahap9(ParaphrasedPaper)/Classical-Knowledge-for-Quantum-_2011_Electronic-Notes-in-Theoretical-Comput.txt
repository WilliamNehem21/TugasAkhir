Quantum communication plays a crucial role in quantum computing by addressing the potential risks associated with the exponential speed-up in adversaries' computational power enabled by quantum algorithms. Despite some progress in formal verification of quantum communication protocols, there is currently no applicable formal framework for automatically analyzing their security. This is concerning, as similar to classical security, vulnerabilities have been identified in quantum protocols that were previously believed to be secure. In this paper, we introduce a decision procedure that assesses whether a protocol meets security criteria by deducing the knowledge properties of its participants based on the dynamic and epistemic traces of the protocol.

Our approach leverages the operational rules of distributed measurement calculus (DMC) to generate dynamic traces from the protocol's specification, which are then extended to epistemic traces by considering the participants' perspectives on the protocol's actions. We demonstrate the soundness and termination of our decision procedure with respect to a DMC model and the algebraic axiomatics of epistemic systems. Furthermore, we apply our method to analyze a new quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocol based on graph states. We establish epistemic properties under various assumptions about the security of the quantum channels, but note that our analysis is limited to a single round.

We also explore the concept of appearance maps, denoted as fa for an agent a, which capture an agent's uncertainties about the states and actions of the protocol. These appearance maps are determined based on general rules and are integral to our framework for formal analysis of security in quantum cryptographic protocols. By combining an algebraic rewrite system with a specification language for quantum distributed computations, our approach offers a compositional way of dealing with agents' uncertainties in a protocol while encoding the principles of quantum mechanics.

Looking ahead, we envision developing a software implementation to automate the analysis of protocols using our framework. While a software implementation of the algebra is already in place to support part of the verification process, efforts are underway to create a tool that can automatically derive traces and semantics of a protocol. This will be a valuable future extension of our proposed framework.
