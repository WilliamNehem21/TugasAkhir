Furthermore, category z encompasses two prominent variations of the innocent arena game model: the well-bracketed and non well-bracketed versions. Specifically, there exist structure-preserving functors f and g from the category of arena games and well-bracketed or non well-bracketed innocent strategies to category z. The two functors f and g exhibit key differences.

Acknowledgments: The majority of section 3 was co-developed with Peter Selinger, during the winter of 2000-2001. We have recently become aware that a similar research direction was pursued by Robin Cockett and Robert Seely, focusing on polarized categories and modules. It is still necessary to comprehend how their work is connected to the findings presented here.
