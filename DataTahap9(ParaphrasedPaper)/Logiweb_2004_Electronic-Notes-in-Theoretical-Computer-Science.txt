Logiweb is a system that resembles a web, allowing logicians to publish papers with high typographic quality, human readability, and machine verifiability. It facilitates the inclusion of various components such as formal theories, new constructs, programs, lemmas, conjectures, and proofs within papers. Additionally, Logiweb enables papers to reference each other across the internet and supports proof checking of proofs across multiple papers located at different locations worldwide. Logiweb serves as a medium for archived mathematics and can be integrated with other systems like Mizar. While the World Wide Web supports mathematics through MathML and OMDoc, it is apt for transmitting information that is subject to change.

The system is based on specific data structures, including parsetrees that outline page structures, codices that represent pages in a machine-understandable format, symbols that denote concepts, and aspects that allow symbols to have different meanings in different contexts. The correctness of pages conforms to the default criterion, although individual pages can specify an alternative criterion. Once a page is uploaded to Logiweb, it becomes immutable, and this is enforced by RIPEMD-160.

Codices in Logiweb encapsulate the mathematical content of a page in a structured form that interfaces well with the system's checking machinery and programming language. Logiweb also includes a programming language, which is based on a simple, untyped version of lambda calculus and allows for the expression of side conditions, proof tactics, macros, and rendering schemes associated with a page.

The system accommodates complete notational freedom and provides flexibility in defining new constructs, though introducing the initial construct out of nothing poses a bootstrapping challenge. The procedure for bootstrapping involves publishing a base page, associating symbols with predefined constructs using the proclamation construct, and utilizing these symbols to make further definitions, rules, theories, lemmas, and proofs.

The Logiweb protocol comprises three layers, with layer 0 managing the storage, retrieval, and transmission of bytes. Servers and browsers communicate via TCP or UDP protocols, exchanging messages that may be transmitted continuously in the case of TCP or packed separately in the case of UDP. The protocol involves several message types for operations such as computing nodes, translating file names to references, and loading pages. The browser conducts transitive loading, converting linear parse trees to trees using arities and symbols, and storing arities and aspects in the codex. During macroreduction, the browser synthesizes macro aspects and handles errors in the definitions.
