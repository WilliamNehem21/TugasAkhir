The 1980s and 1990s were pivotal decades in the development of learning systems that form the basis of contemporary internet-based educational media. Virtual learning environments (VLEs) have become widespread and offer various educational content, communication capabilities, and opportunities for skills development. These systems are available in multiple formats, such as single or multi-user, gamified or non-gamified, and with or without 3D immersive features.

However, recent assessments within VLEs have primarily focused on evaluating tangible skills in fields like biology, computer science, and medicine, with limited attention given to higher-order thinking skills and learning patterns. There are also concerns about the over-reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in assessments, with proponents advocating for a balance that incorporates human intelligence. Addressing these gaps, the study aimed to develop an assessment method that enables localized feedback and evaluation of specific learning activities without requiring extensive training data.

To this end, the research focused on assessing the readiness of students for a physical chemistry lab using a 3D virtual environment. Due to safety considerations, practical exercises in handling emergency situations, such as fires or chemical spills, cannot be conducted outside of virtual reality. The study recruited university students, particularly those from science programs, to participate in the research. Despite challenges posed by COVID-19 restrictions, 36 participants were recruited, with a focus on ensuring diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity.

The study involved performing granular analysis of students' actions within the virtual environment, which were then transformed into "motifs" representing specific skills. The research also explored the use of different similarity indexes to compare students' actions with those of experts, aiming to identify the most suitable index for assessing higher-order thinking skills. Through extensive data collection and analysis, the study demonstrated the potential of using motifs and expert data in series-based assessment in 3D virtual learning environments, highlighting the value of these approaches in providing targeted and specific feedback to learners.
