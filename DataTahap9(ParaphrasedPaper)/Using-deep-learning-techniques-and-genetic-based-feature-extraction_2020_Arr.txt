Biometric systems have various weak points that can be exploited by a hacker to gain unauthorized access to a system. An area of vulnerability, and the primary focus of this study, is the susceptibility to presentation attacks. These attacks are centered on obtaining and using counterfeit biometric samples to gain illegal access to secured data. Although biometric authentication enhances security through unique feature extraction, there is a need to address the vulnerability of presenting a biometric sample through learning-based mitigation techniques. With the success of deep learning techniques in image classification, there is potential for similar accomplishments in spoofing detection and mitigation. This review delves into mitigation techniques for facial biometrics, specifically excluding methods designed for general image classification.

The publication introduces a novel feature extraction technique aimed at mitigating the impact of presentation attacks. Given the prevalence of deepfakes in media, this technique offers insights into the GAN approach commonly used. Furthermore, in combination with this technique, the generated feature extractors will shed light on the biometric features with higher discriminative capabilities, optimizing their dimensions and displacement. This work proceeds with a literature review of popular techniques for mitigating presentation attacks, followed by a presentation of the methodology, experiments, and results. Lastly, the authors discuss the findings and future directions.

Presentation attacks involve the presentation of fake human characteristics to the biometric capture subsystem, impersonating biometric recognition to gain illegal access. Various methods such as print photo attacks, 3-D masks, and image regeneration have been successfully used to access biometric systems. A 2D face system lacking anti-spoofing measures can be easily violated by presentation attacks, prompting suggestions for multimodal systems in scenarios with high probabilities of spoof attacks. However, despite their potential to improve performance, multimodal biometrics can be costly and can increase the system's vulnerability to intruders.

The paper additionally provides an overview of proposed tactics to address presentation attacks, including a novel deep learning approach to generate a synthetic (spoofing) dataset and feature extraction techniques for biometric recognition. The goal is to contribute empirical findings to enhance biometric recognition against presentation attacks using deep learning techniques. The proposed method involves applying GAFE (Gaussian-based feature extraction) on a simulation of a biometric identification system.

In summary, the study outlines a methodology using deep learning and GANs to address presentation attacks, as well as the utilization of GAFE to enhance feature extraction for biometric recognition. The proposed method is aimed at improving the performance of biometric systems against presentation attacks.
