The approach for automated theorem proving proposed in the paper, referred to as polynomial ring calculus, is an algebraic technique that operates on polynomials over finite fields. While applicable across various domains, including first-order logic, certain non-truth-functional logics, and modal logics, the method is particularly suitable for deterministic and non-deterministic many-valued logics. The paper aims to demonstrate the extension of this method to finite-valued non-deterministic semantics and explores its computational nature through the development of software capable of translating provability in deterministic and non-deterministic finite-valued logical systems into operations on polynomial rings.

Additionally, the paper introduces the use of hidden variables due to the non-truth-functional character of paraconsistent semantics. It also presents a polynomial version for the monadic fragment of first-order logic and discusses how any finite function can be expressed using polynomials over finite fields. The method of polynomials is highlighted as a heuristic device with the potential to uncover new logical systems or properties of existing ones. Furthermore, the concept of non-deterministic truth-values is explored, offering a broader framework beyond ordinary finite matrices and ordinary finite-valued semantics.

The paper also emphasizes the application of polynomial versions to logics with binary non-truth-functional semantics and discusses the differences in polynomials over different fields. The method is shown to provide a correct and complete structure for three-valued and non-deterministic logical systems in terms of polynomials.

Moreover, the paper delves into the broader implications of non-deterministic semantics, explaining how it preserves certain advantages of logics with ordinary finite-valued semantics while being applicable to a wider array of logics. The concept of nmatrices is introduced as a means of providing decision procedures for logics not characterizable by finite matrices. Finally, the aforementioned method is connected to relational semantics and the paper concludes by outlining the potential for future research in this area.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the Polca software, which automates the translation of sentences from various logics into polynomials over finite fields, simplifying the process of handling polynomials for proving theorems in these systems.
