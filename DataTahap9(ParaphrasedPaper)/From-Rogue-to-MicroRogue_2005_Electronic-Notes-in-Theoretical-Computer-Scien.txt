The paper discusses the use of checkers and standard automata-manipulating algorithms for lexer and parser generation, highlighting the concise code output in comparison to implementations in standard languages. The importance of code concision is emphasized due to its relevance in minimizing the trusted computing base for security applications. 

The paper then presents the implementation of a simpler rewriting system, called microrogue, to demonstrate how rogue can be concisely implemented. Microrogue resembles traditional term rewriting but applies rules only at the top level of terms, with ordered and dynamically enabled/disabled rules. The paper showcases how microrogue enables the concise implementation of a rogue interpreter in less than 40 lines of code, making development easier compared to industrial non-symbolic languages like C++. The move from rogue to microrogue is motivated by the observation that the operational semantics of the rewriting calculus contains clauses that are essentially simple rewriting rules, suggesting the use of a rewriting-based meta-language for implementation.

The rest of the paper is organized to describe rogue in Section 2, discuss the development of microrogue from rogue in Section 3, define microrogue in Section 4, and walk through the implementation of rogue in microrogue in Section 5.

The paper also provides examples of one-step evaluations of rules with variables, indicating successful and failed applications. It further explains the operational semantics of microrogue and how state is updated during evaluation, emphasizing the control of evaluation order and dynamically added rules. Additionally, the paper explores the implementation of a partial compiler for microrogue in C++, which has reduced the running time of interpreting rogue programs by around 20%.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the value of concise code and demonstrates the implementation and benefits of the microrogue rewriting system for the rogue language.
