The paper introduces a method for producing hollow micro/nano fibers using a bicomponent spinneret in electrospinning, and it discusses the impact of process parameters on the morphology of the fibers. The study shows that uniformly hollow polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers can be obtained when the inner solution feed rate is set at 0.08ml/h (for single hollow fibers) or 0.06ml/h (for double hollow fibers), with a 15kv voltage and 20cm receiving distance. The authors also mention that increasing the feed rate may cause double hollow fibers to merge and lead to cortex fractures, so it is important to control the feed rate when fabricating double or triplicate hollow fibers.

The authors describe that traditional spinnerets produce circular solid fibers with limited utility, and they highlight the development of co-axial electrospinning devices that can produce single and hollow micro/nano fibers.

In the experiments, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 (PVP) were used as materials. The morphology of the fibers was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that low voltage results in discontinuous fibers and beadlike structures, while high voltage is effective in decreasing fiber diameter, with 15kv identified as the optimal voltage. However, the authors caution that excessively high voltage can worsen fiber continuity and increase diameter distribution. They also mention that fiber diameter optimization can be achieved through afterdrawing.
