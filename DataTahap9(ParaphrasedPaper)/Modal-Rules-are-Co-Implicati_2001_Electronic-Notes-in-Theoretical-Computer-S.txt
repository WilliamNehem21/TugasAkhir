In this scholarly article, we aim to demonstrate the duality of algebras and coalgebras by establishing a dual of a specific theorem for coalgebras. We show that the concept dual to implication is that of a modal rule. The paper presents Theorem 4.1, which proves that a set of coalgebras is rule-definable if and only if it is closed under images of morphisms and disjoint unions. Furthermore, Theorem 5.2 extends this result to kripke frames, stating that a class of kripke frames is definable by rules of infinitary modal logic if and only if it is closed under images of p-morphisms and disjoint unions.
