To enhance accuracy, the author suggests the following areas for further exploration:  1. Utilizing the mean latitude as the projection latitude to minimize errors in conversion formulas. 2. Employing the average height as the designated height, rather than fixing on a specific value. 3. Employing more advanced GPS receivers. 4. Employing an optimal algorithm to improve the accuracy of conversion and area values, despite the difficulty in achieving this.

Novel methods based on GPS land area measurement have been developed for irregular measurement instruments. Experimental results demonstrate that these instruments are capable of promptly and effectively determining the land area of irregular shapes. Moreover, for specific area-related projects, these instruments hold significant application value and potential.
