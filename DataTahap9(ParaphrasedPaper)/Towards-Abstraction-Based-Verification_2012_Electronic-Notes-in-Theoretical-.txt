The shape calculus is a bio-inspired mathematical framework for describing the movement of 3D shapes in space. These shapes, when combined with behaviors, create 3D processes that can interact with each other. Due to the complex geometry of space, varied time-dependent behaviors, and non-deterministic nature, these 3D processes exhibit behaviors that are not easily analyzable. Currently, shape calculus models are used for simulation, model validation, and hypothesis testing in systems biology. In this paper, we propose a new approach to use the shape calculus for verifying untimed and unspatial safety properties of biological models. We introduce an abstract interpretation that focuses on the interactions among processes, yielding new composed processes and species, thus enabling the verification of more complex properties.

The shape calculus is a language designed to describe biological phenomena, primarily in 3D space, where entities have geometric shapes and dynamic behaviors. These entities can move, collide, and combine with each other to form new processes, leading to infinite behaviors. While the rich expressive power of the calculus is useful for modeling biological systems, it also makes traditional analysis techniques inapplicable. Currently, shape calculus models are used in a simulation environment called bioshape for model definition, simulation, validation, and hypothesis testing.

In a specific example involving the hexokinase process, the process evolves by binding with specific metabolites and undergoing a strong-split action. This demonstrates the complex behavior exhibited by 3D processes. By abstracting from space and velocity, instances of the same 3D process collapse into a unique abstract 3D process, with elements of the abstract domain represented as sets of abstract 3D processes.

Consideration of a glucose and ATP bond in a specific example reveals that in the concrete domain, the molecules cannot complete a reaction due to delays. However, in the abstract domain, the strong-split action can be executed, leading to the conclusion that glucose and ATP processes cannot interact directly with each other.
