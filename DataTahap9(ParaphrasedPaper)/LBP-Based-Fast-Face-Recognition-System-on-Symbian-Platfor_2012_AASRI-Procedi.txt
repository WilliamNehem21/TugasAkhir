This paper presents a detailed implementation of a fast face recognition system based on local binary pattern (LBP) for the Symbian platform. The system utilizes the Adaboost algorithm for face detection, and includes pre-processing steps such as eye location, geometric normalization, and illumination normalization. A rapid eye location method, named ER (eyeball search), is proposed and implemented during the face preprocessing stage. The improved LBP is then employed for recognition. Despite the limited computational capability of the Symbian platform, experimental results demonstrate good performance in both recognition rate and time. The system can process approximately 2.5 frames per second, achieving an average recognition rate of 87.78%.

In recent years, face recognition has seen widespread use across various domains, and many face recognition algorithms have exhibited promising performance. With the rapid proliferation of digital cameras in mobile devices, the application of face recognition on mobile phones has garnered increasing attention.

The LBP, originally designed for texture description, has shown promising results in texture classification. Ahonen proposed a face recognition method using LBP, wherein the face image is divided into non-overlapping blocks of the same size, and histograms of LBP codes are calculated for each block. These histograms are then concatenated into a global histogram to describe the face image, and a nearest-neighbor classifier is used for face recognition based on the chi-square distance.

The paper also discusses the application of hierarchical multiscale LBP for recognition, which involves dividing the image into blocks of the same size, calculating hierarchical multiscale LBP for each block, concatenating the results into one histogram for recognition, and using the chi-square distance for classification.

Overall, the paper provides a thorough overview of the implementation of an LBP-based fast face recognition system on the Symbian platform, covering various steps such as face detection, preprocessing, and recognition. It concludes with results demonstrating the system's processing speed and recognition accuracy.
