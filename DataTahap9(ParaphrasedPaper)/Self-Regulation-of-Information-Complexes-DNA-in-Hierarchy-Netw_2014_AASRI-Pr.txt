The usage of fluorescence techniques to visualize the oxidative activity of DNA in human and chicken cells has been explored in various studies. Experiments have demonstrated the visualization of three-dimensional DNA nanostructures within cells, revealing the fluorescence of both non-coding and coding regions of DNA across all chromosomes. The chaotic motion of cells in the bloodstream during measurements necessitates the use of fluorescence histograms to analyze the spatial images of fluorescing 3D DNA in large cell populations.

In reality, it is challenging to isolate and distinguish the individual contributions of non-coding and coding regions of DNA within the complex network of 46 chromosomes inside a cell. Detailed statistical analysis of 3D DNA fluorescence within neutrophils indicates that the correlations and topology of stochastic DNA networks exhibit non-Gaussian statistics, high density, a mixture of normal and abnormal fractal structures, and flexibility in self-regulation of information and entropy. Understanding the complexity of 3D DNA inside living cells surpasses the static representation of DNA fragments, gene networks, and biochemical schemes found in textbooks and standard genomic research. Despite unresolved mathematical and scientific challenges, there are discernible patterns and universal features in DNA networks that enable the classification of different types of correlations and information networks within cells.

The identification of new physical and mathematical patterns for 3D DNA information activity holds promise for enhancing self-regulation and medical diagnostics related to health and immunity. These patterns also play a crucial role in the defensive response and immunity in the case of local disorders such as internal diseases, infections, and traumas. They contribute to the reconstruction of fractals and complex information networks in all living cells within the body, thus facilitating self-regulation.
