With the widespread use of electronic communications in large-scale computer networks, the issue of malicious or unwanted behavior among participants has become a significant concern. In many cases, the parties involved are unfamiliar with each other and engage in temporary communication, particularly in sensitive or business-related interactions where precaution is essential to prevent fraud, identity theft, and other undesirable activities. Consequently, the concept of trust has become an important indicator for distinguishing benevolent from malevolent parties.

Our model is continuous in nature, as it accepts real values as input and assumes time to be continuous, resulting in a real number representing the trust metric. However, this does not mean that the model mandates continuous treatment over discrete treatment. Since computers operate as discrete machines, any implementations of the model will inherently be discrete, at least at the lowest level of abstraction. The model can also be easily translated into a discrete form, such as by replacing integrals with sums. Nevertheless, the presentation in this paper is conceptual and mathematical in nature, justifying the treatment of the model as continuous.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces fundamental concepts of the approach. Section 2.1 presents the report metric, which reflects feedback about the entity being tested as provided by observers. We then define the trust area using the report metric and introduce the concept of trust volume in Section 2.3, involving a height function. In Section 3, we present the aging of trust based on trust mass and density, which are introduced in 3.1. Section 4 discusses various constraints on the parameters and functions of the approach to ensure the model behaves as intended and highlights the soundness properties of the trust metric model. Finally, Section 5 serves as a summary of the paper content.

The report metric, a crucial quantity in this approach, represents the level of trust in the object under consideration as reported by one or more observer(s). It is a continuous and total function of time, denoted as rm(t) within the interval [0, tnow]. In the case of multiple observers, the metric is a function of individual report metrics, such as a mean value. The trust metric is calculated using a formula considering the individual report metrics, and its graphical interpretation yields an area bounded by the report metric function. Notably, negative intervals indicate a decrease in the total trust area, reflecting the degree of trust over the interval.

Introducing the trust volume as an extension of the trust area, involving a height function amplifying the trust base metric, allows different time periods to be assigned varying importance. Furthermore, the implications of the report metrics during crucial periods are given higher impact, enhancing the expressiveness of the concept of trust volume compared to trust area. The concept of aging is then incorporated into the model to adapt to the change in behavior of entities over time, utilizing the analog of radioactive decay from physics to achieve this effect. This involves introducing the notions of trust density and trust mass.

As the report metric provides input data to the model, the process of calculating this quantity is not detailed in this paper. However, the values of the trust metric from various observers can be combined using a combination function, a matter discussed in the following subsection and mentioned briefly in Section 2.1.
