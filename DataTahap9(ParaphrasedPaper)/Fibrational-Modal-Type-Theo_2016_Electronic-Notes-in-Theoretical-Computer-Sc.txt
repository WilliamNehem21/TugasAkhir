In the following section, we present a framework that is influenced by Prawitz's work and is guided by the categorical modeling of the Curry-Howard correspondence in the style of. Therefore, we conceptualize modal systems as being defined at the same level as their intuitionistic counterparts. Our initial motivation was to utilize the machinery pertaining to the reduction of the simply typed lambda-calculus.

We establish that weakening for both types of variables is permissible due to the typing rule for these variables. Contraction of both types of variables follows from the way contexts are combined additively. Additionally, the exchange is also permissible. Although rules for logical conjunctions and disjunctions could be included, we prefer to focus on the essential connectives: implication and modality.

The more intricate nature of contexts in DIML yields a more nuanced metatheory. Just as there are two rules for typing variables, there are also two substitution lemmas depending on the nature of the variable being substituted. Drawing from insights in the linear lambda-calculus, we require an appropriate double substitution lemma that accommodates both types of variables. Furthermore, disregarding the terms in the subsequent lemma, we obtain two forms of the cut rule that we can demonstrate are permissible in DIML.

We can also represent the DIML type theory via fibrations, rather than adjunctions. The conventional fibration modeling framework was originally developed for theories with dependent types. It is possible to utilize this framework for modeling theories without dependent types by imposing a stringent restriction, as discussed below.

After establishing a fibrational semantics for constructive modal type theory with all type constructors being simple types, we aim to incorporate modalities that themselves are dependent types over a system of dependent products. This constitutes the primary innovation of this paper. We are not aware of any other work that describes dependent modalities as the S4 necessity modalities we depict here.

However, the metatheory of dependent type theories is typically quite intricate. Notably, subject reduction becomes a significant theorem. Fortunately, we can employ the same methodology used to establish these theorems for standard dependent type theory. Similarly, we possess two types of substitution lemmas as before.

Incorporating rules for universes into the rules for dependent products, dependent sums, and identity types presents a substantial challenge. These three groups of rules are independent from each other and can be studied separately. The rules for a universe connect the rules from these three groups to each other, necessitating the coordination of their interpretations.

Based on the work presented, we observe a set of modal rules, a fifth category of rules, that appear to be independent from the other sets of rules as well. For a subset of these (the box-only S4 modal rules), in conjunction with dependent products, we can establish well-behaved type theories as well as well-behaved categorical semantics in terms of (split indexed) fibrations. It remains unclear whether this aids or hinders the homotopy type theory program.

We have described both non-dependent DIML and dependent DepDIML modal type theories for the operator corresponding to constructive necessity in logic. We have demonstrated that these type theories are well-behaved in terms of proof-theoretic properties: their reduction calculus satisfies subject reduction, is confluent and strongly normalizing, with modular proofs. We have provided fibrational models for both of these modal type theories, which we have proven to be sound and complete, utilizing established and reliable technology. In summary, this version of constructive necessity behaves exceptionally well, as evidenced by the fact that both the type-theoretical properties and the categorical semantics are modular and run parallel to each other. Moreover, explicit substitutions can be incorporated into both dependent and non-dependent versions of the type theory, alongside appropriate operational semantics, if desired. We leave it to future work to determine whether this modal type theory is beneficial for homotopy type theory.
