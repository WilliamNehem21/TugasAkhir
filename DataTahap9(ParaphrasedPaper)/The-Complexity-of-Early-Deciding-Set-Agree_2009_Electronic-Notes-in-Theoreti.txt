This paper seeks to present a compelling algorithm with the potential to challenge experts in the field of (algebraic) topology techniques. Specifically, we introduce an early deciding algorithm that addresses the set agreement problem, which has been a catalyst for research on the application of topology techniques to distributed computing. We posit that the algorithm is optimal and explore the necessity and difficulties associated with employing topology techniques to establish the lower bound.

Findings pertaining to the set agreement problem are thought-provoking, as they reveal an inherent trade-off between the quantity of processes in a system, the level of coordination achievable by these processes, and the permissible number of failures. Set agreement represents an extension of the extensively studied consensus problem, where each process is expected to propose a value and ultimately reach a decision on one of the initially proposed values, ensuring that every correct process eventually reaches a decision (similar to consensus). Unlike consensus, however, processes are not permitted to decide on more than k distinct values, hence the alternate term, k-set agreement.

Initially, algebraic topology techniques were employed to demonstrate the infeasibility of k-set agreement in an asynchronous model with the possibility of k processes crashing. Additionally, in the synchronous model prone to process crash, rigorous lower bounds for set agreement were derived in related work. The framework detailed in this paper draws upon the tools from algebraic topology introduced previously and facilitates the establishment of lower bounds in both the asynchronous and synchronous models.

Early deciding algorithms are those whose efficiency is contingent on the actual number of failures in a given run, as opposed to the total number of failures that can be tolerated. The conventional representation for the actual number of failures is denoted by f, while the total number of tolerated failures is denoted by t. In practice, failures occur infrequently, thus it is advantageous to devise algorithms that reach decisions sooner when fewer failures transpire. Notably, for uniform consensus, it has been shown that considering the actual number of failures results in a significant enhancement in efficiency. Charron-Bost and Schiper proposed a uniform consensus algorithm in which every process reaching a decision does so by round f+2 in any run with f failures. This bound has been confirmed to be optimal.

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported results for set agreement in the context of early deciding algorithms. In this paper, we present an early deciding set agreement algorithm and delve into the challenges associated with employing topology techniques to substantiate the optimality of the algorithm.

Furthermore, we establish a contradiction by introducing a simulation algorithm in the synchronous, message-passing model, detailed in a given reference, enabling processes to simulate, with the assistance of a hypothetically existing set agreement algorithm satisfying certain criteria, the execution of a wait-free 3 set agreement algorithm in an asynchronous, shared-memory model. Previously, it was proven that wait-free set agreement is unachievable in an asynchronous, shared-memory model, thus leading to the desired contradiction.
