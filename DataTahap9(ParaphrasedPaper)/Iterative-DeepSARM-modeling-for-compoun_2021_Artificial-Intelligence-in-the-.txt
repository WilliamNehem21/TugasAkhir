As far as we know, there is currently only one method that integrates the systematic evaluation of structural relationships between active compounds with SAR visualization and prospective compound design, and that is the SAR matrix (SARM) approach. SARM analysis suggests new analogues by systematically comparing core structures and substituents in related analogue series (ASS) and identifying unexplored core-substituent combinations across these series. The compound design component of SARM has been expanded through deep generative modeling, leading to DeepSARM, which utilizes additional information from selected targets and associated compound datasets to further expand the design space.

In this paper, we present the extension of DeepSARM for iterative compound optimization. Firstly, we introduce the SARM/DeepSARM framework and then provide details of the Iterative DeepSARM (IDeepSARM) approach. An exemplary compound design application is presented to illustrate the methodological characteristics of IDeepSARM and its design capabilities.

The DeepSARM model was developed to expand analogue design by incorporating information from compounds with activity against different targets related to the primary target of interest. For example, a DeepSARM model can be initially trained with compounds active against the target family to which the target of interest belongs, followed by fine-tuning of the model for the primary target. This approach increases the close-in analogue design capacity of the SARM method. The resulting SARMS can then be further expanded with novel key and value fragments, and additional SARMS entirely consisting of novel fragments and compounds can be obtained.

The models for key 2, value 2, and value 1 are trained using input-output pairs, and compounds with newly generated key fragments are added to the original SARM, further expanding the SARM. The number of SMILES tokens for a given fragment is considered, and a log-likelihood threshold can be applied to filter fragments to obtain compounds. The computational details for the further DeepSARM calculations are provided.

Each scaffold represents a minimal modified structure (MMS), and new value 1 and value 2 fragments are filtered for structural alerts before being used to construct a SARM variant with predefined dimensionality for each key 2. The resulting compounds are obtained during iterative fine-tuning. Results are presented for five iterations and color-coded by compound activity.

Iterative fine-tuning success relies on the reliability of compound activity predictions and log-likelihood scores. Preferably, comparable trends in the progression of activity and log-likelihood estimates should be observed during the optimization procedure.

In a specific compound design application, DeepSARM was pre-trained using compounds with activity against specific targets and fine-tuned with dual-target inhibitors. The design protocol was modified to pre-train with inhibitors of the human kinome, followed by fine-tuning with specific target inhibitors and IDeepSARM optimization. Although the ability to experimentally test preferred candidates is currently unavailable, this design effort illustrates the computational IDeepSARM approach.

Key 1/ value 1 and key 2/ value 2 pairs were divided into training and validation sets, and iterative fine-tuning was carried out over 10 iterations. For each iteration, 100 computed compounds with the highest predicted activity were selected as input.

The model of a candidate compound displayed similarities to a known compound, but also distinct differences. A hypothetical binding mode similar to an existing compound was observed, but with some differences.

In summary, the paper discusses the extension of the DeepSARM model for iterative compound optimization, provides details of the computational approach, and illustrates its application in a specific compound design effort.
