During the training process, a specific set of numerical values representing features of MCCs belonging to the MCCs category is utilized to update the weights and biases of the neurons in order to minimize the error of the output neuron. However, the ideal artificial neural network (ANN) structure is not predetermined and is contingent upon factors such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the activation function, the learning algorithm, and the training parameters. Various training algorithms are available to train the multilayer feedforward backpropagation (MLFFBP) ANN, and for the purposes of the current research, the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm is employed to characterize MCCs as either benign or malignant.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied, and the kernel function is utilized to transform a non-linear classification problem into a linear classification problem by mapping the input feature space to a higher dimensional feature. Subsequently, an optimal separating hyperplane is used to discern between the two classes in the two-class pattern classification problem.

Another metric utilized is Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, which is employed to evaluate the accuracy of a classifier in medical decision-making. ROC curves are plotted to measure the accuracy of the classifier. In the construction of the ROC curve, the x-axis represents 1-specificity, while the y-axis represents sensitivity. The curve is generated by plotting sensitivity against 1-specificity at various threshold settings. In this context, 1-specificity represents the false positive rate, while sensitivity represents the true positive rate.
