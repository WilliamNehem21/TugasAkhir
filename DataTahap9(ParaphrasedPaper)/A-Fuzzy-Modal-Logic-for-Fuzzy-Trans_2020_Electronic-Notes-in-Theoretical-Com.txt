For the past five decades, there has been active research in the field of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. Various formalisms such as fuzzy automata, fuzzy Markov processes, fuzzy Petri nets, fuzzy reactive frames, and fuzzy discrete event systems have been explored to model computational systems dealing with uncertainty and fuzzy sets. This paper will specifically focus on fuzzy transition systems or fuzzy labelled transition systems, which extend the concept of transition in Kripke semantics for modal logic.

Kripke semantics for modal logic involves graphs labeled with propositional symbols on each edge, and they are used to model a wide range of situations including network science, graph theory, epistemic logic, and reasoning about time, beliefs, and computational systems. However, there are scenarios where we cannot definitively determine the existence of a transition (edges in graphs); instead, we can only assign a degree of certainty to its existence. This leads to the concept of fuzzy state transitions.
