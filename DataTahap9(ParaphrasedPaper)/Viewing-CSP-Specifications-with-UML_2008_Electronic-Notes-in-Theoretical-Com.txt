The formalism CSP[15,7], for example, is a compelling approach for describing concurrent and dynamic aspects of computer systems. One of its key characteristics is its ability to serve as a notation for representing concurrent and communicating processes at various levels of abstraction. Additionally, it is feasible to verify refinements and traditional properties, such as deadlock and determinism, as well as domain-specific properties of CSP specifications using the FDR refinement checker. However, CSP lacks intuitive graphical visualization, which may make it challenging for non-specialists to understand and use. Consequently, it can be costly and error-prone to informally associate the dynamic behavior of CSP constructions with structural elements of the design phase, such as components and independent processes.

On the other hand, graphical modeling notations are commonly used to structure and visualize systems, but they often lack a solid formal foundation for reasoning about classic and domain-specific properties. Even semi-formal graphical notations like UML and ROOM do not provide a framework for proving refinements and classic and domain-specific properties. Some efforts have been made to give formal semantics to UML and some of its profiles [4,12], but these initiatives only cover a small subset of UML.

UML-RT[18,8], on the other hand, is an extension of UML that includes specific conceptual elements of ROOM and enables the modeling of architectures and dynamic relationships of real-time event-driven systems. The paper also presents a systematic strategy for translating CSP specifications into UML-RT models, including compositional rules and considerations for the mapping of data type declarations and the translation of CSP processes into capsules and protocols. The authors highlight the benefits and considerations of their translation strategy and the potential for future work in the field.
