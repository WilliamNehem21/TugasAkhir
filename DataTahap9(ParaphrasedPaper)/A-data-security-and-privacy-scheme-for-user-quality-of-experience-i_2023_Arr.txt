This academic paper addresses the issue of data security and privacy in a network, emphasizing the importance of securing information within the network to ensure a positive user experience. The paper proposes and evaluates a security scheme for a mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture, focusing on the MEC-based autonomous vehicular network (AVNet) utilizing software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), service function chaining (SFC), and network slicing (NS) technologies.

The paper begins by conducting a literature review on security and data privacy management for MEC infrastructures. It then presents the proposed solution for data security and privacy within the MEC architecture, followed by simulation results to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed security scheme. Additionally, the paper uses the Avispa tool for formal verification of the security scheme and compares it with existing schemes, highlighting the superior security provided by the proposed scheme.

The study aims to enhance the security of the MEC architecture and ensure user quality of experience (QoE) by establishing a secure scheme for data security and user privacy. The proposed scheme is analyzed for its properties, and the Avispa tool is employed to validate its security and data privacy effectiveness. Simulation results demonstrate the computational costs and performance of the proposed scheme, showing its superiority over existing schemes in terms of computational cost.

Overall, the paper recommends the adoption of the proposed security scheme for MEC infrastructures, emphasizing its realistic approach and the significant improvements it offers in terms of security, data privacy, and computational cost.
