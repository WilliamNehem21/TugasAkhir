This paper investigates the distinction between weak normalization (WN) and strong normalization (SN) within the context of first-order orthogonal rewriting systems. Utilizing the erasure lemma, the authors establish a pumping lemma to gain insights into exceptional terms, defined as terms that are WN but not SN. It is subsequently derived as a corollary that, in an orthogonal term rewriting system (TRS) that is WN, there are no cyclic reductions in finite reduction graphs. This finding serves as a crucial step towards the revelation that orthogonal TRSs with the WN property do not permit cyclic reductions at all.

The paper then delves into the concept of reduction graphs, specifically discussing the reduction graph g(t) of term t as a sub-TRS. Additionally, the family of t, denoted as f(t), is introduced as another sub-TRS wherein the set of terms encompasses t and all subterms of its reducts. The significance of regarding sub-TRSs, such as f(t) and g(t), as independent TRSs is highlighted, as it allows for the application of conventional concepts and theorems, such as the confluence of orthogonal TRSs.

The subsequent argumentation involves a proof by contradiction, assuming r as an orthogonal TRS, t as a term in r, and g(t) possessing an infinite reduction but not an infinite expansion. The contradiction is reached by supposing that t lacks a term without a normal form in its family, i.e., f(t) has the WN property. Consequently, it is established that t is an exceptional term in the orthogonal TRS, leading to the conclusion that t is the starting point of an infinite ladder, wherein all points in the ladder are reducts of t.

Moreover, the paper presents a proof that analyzes the scenario of a cyclic term, denoted as t, within TRS r. Assuming that t does not contain a term without a normal form in its family, i.e., f(t) is an orthogonal TRS with the WN property, it is deduced that f(t) must be acyclic, leading to a contradiction.
