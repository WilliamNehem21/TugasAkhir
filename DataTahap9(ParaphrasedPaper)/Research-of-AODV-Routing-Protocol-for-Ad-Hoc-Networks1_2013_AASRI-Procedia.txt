Furthermore, the routing protocol was significantly influenced by different network scenes. When the same routing protocols were evaluated in various simulated scenarios, their routing performance also exhibited substantial differences. Key factors affecting the ad hoc network scenes included the number of network nodes, changing speed, and movement speed of the network. Consequently, when comparing and analyzing different routing protocols, it is essential to consider the network scene.

Certain features in the ad hoc network pose challenges for routing technology, such as ad-hoc, multi-hop, and the variability of network structure. Therefore, the principal focus in designing ad hoc routing protocols is to address the issue of rapid node movement causing complex changes in network structure. Building upon a comparative analysis of the AODV routing protocol, this paper presented an enhanced B-AODV protocol, which improved routing discovery and local repair to establish new routes. The new protocol enhanced routing repair capacity and the success rate of packet delivery, reduced node-to-node delay, and decreased routing overload. Nevertheless, since network nodes do not solely have two-way links, optimizing the single link protocol remains a goal for future research.
