In recent years, Arabic natural language processing (NLP) has significantly lagged behind its English counterpart. However, recent advancements in NLP have narrowed this gap and shown promising results for various tasks in Arabic. One such complex task is short answer scoring, which has been extensively researched for English using machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. This paper introduces the first deep learning-based system for Arabic short answer scoring, aiming to provide a reliable tool to assist teachers in the Arab world in maximizing their teaching time for improved learning outcomes. The study empirically evaluates different techniques and proposes the best performing system, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a QWK score of 0.78, demonstrating the increasing power and robustness of recent Arabic NLP tools.

Automated grading systems have proven to be effective in reducing the resources and time required for grading exams, allowing teachers to focus on other important tasks that enhance the educational experience for their students. Considering the precision required in the grading process, extensive research has been undertaken to ensure the fairness and reliability of automated grading systems.

One notable gap in the field of Arabic language processing is in short answer scoring, where most existing systems are reference-based. The paper explores two approaches, finding that a response-based approach is likely to be more effective with a sufficient amount of human-rated answers, yet this remains unexplored in Arabic. The paper aims to address this gap by presenting a deep learning response-based system for Arabic short answer scoring, which was previously unexplored in the literature.

Challenges specific to the Arabic language, such as morphology, dialectal variations, and lexical ambiguities, are discussed, which make NLP tasks particularly challenging. Additionally, the paper touches on the influence of transformer language models like BERT in advancing the field of NLP, as well as discussing previous work on automated grading systems.

The paper discusses the preprocessing steps, evaluation metrics, and the dataset used for the experiments and provides an overview of the applied methodology. It reports the results of the experiments and provides a discussion before concluding with future directions for research.

The paper emphasizes the complexity of the Arabic language due to its morphological intricacies and dialectal variations, which present challenges for NLP tasks. It further discusses the limitations of traditional NLP methods and the potential of deep learning and transfer learning, particularly in the context of Arabic NLP.

The authors note that dialectal variations in the Arabic language pose a challenge for creating generalized NLP models, as each region has its own version of Arabic with unique rules and vocabulary. This diversity can affect the quality of Arabic datasets and must be taken into consideration when collecting data for NLP tasks.

The paper also discusses the impact of diacritics and the challenges they pose for automated NLP systems, as well as the limitations of pretrained word embeddings such as word2vec and GloVe. The usefulness of transformer-based language models and their applications in NLP tasks are highlighted.

The authors highlight the performance improvements observed with transformer-based language models, BERT and ELECTRA, and their superiority over traditional deep learning models. The paper also discusses the challenges and considerations in training these models, as well as the potential for further improvements through pretraining on domain-specific corpora.

In summary, the paper presents the development of a deep learning-based Arabic short answer scoring system, evaluates various models, and discusses the challenges and advancements in Arabic NLP, showcasing the potential of recent developments in the field.
