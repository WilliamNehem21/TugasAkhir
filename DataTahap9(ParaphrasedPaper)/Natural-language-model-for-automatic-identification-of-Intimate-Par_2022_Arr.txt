The annotated dataset exhibited a high imbalance in class distribution, with only around 11% of posts labeled as ipvreport. To address this, we developed a natural language processing model which effectively identifies ipv-reporting tweets automatically. Our model achieved F1-scores of 0.76 for the ipv-report class and 0.97 for the non-ipv-report class. We then conducted post-classification analyses to identify system errors and ensure that the model did not demonstrate biases in its decision-making, particularly with respect to race and gender. This automatic model could serve as a crucial component for a proactive social media-based intervention and support framework, while also facilitating population-level surveillance and large-scale cohort studies.

Research has shown that intimate partner violence (ipv) can result in various negative outcomes, including mental health issues and physical health problems such as injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, and memory loss. Female victims are at risk of experiencing adverse reproductive outcomes and economic burden due to ipv.

Traditionally, data related to ipv have been collected through surveys and medical/police reports, but these methods have become challenging during the Covid-19 pandemic. Social media websites (SMWs), such as Twitter and Reddit, have emerged as potential alternative sources for collecting ipv-related data online, given the reluctance of ipv victims to seek help through traditional means during the pandemic. SMWs may offer a secure platform for ipv victims to share their experiences and receive support. Leveraging SMWs could complement traditional resources and strengthen efforts to prevent ipv and support ipv victims.

This study aimed to develop an automated, social media-based system using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to detect and categorize ipv-related data on Twitter during the Covid-19 pandemic. The developed NLP pipeline and machine learning classifier could facilitate the surveillance of ipv self-reports on SMWs and enable proactive outreach to ipv victims for support and intervention.

The annotation process was conducted iteratively, and a dataset of 6,348 tweets was annotated for training and testing the NLP model. The study investigated different approaches for constructing an ipv classifier, including traditional machine learning algorithms and more advanced algorithms for text classification. The findings indicated that the ROBERTA classifier achieved the best performance and was comparable to human annotators, suggesting practical utility for collecting and analyzing ipv data at a larger population level.

While the system demonstrated good performance and fairness in decision-making, it exhibited misclassification of tweets containing implicit self-reports of ipv. Future work could focus on enriching the training data to address this issue and improve the classification of tweets with insufficient context.

The study highlighted the potential of SMWs as a platform for identifying and supporting ipv victims, while acknowledging the challenges associated with model development and performance improvement. The findings underscored the importance of leveraging social media analytics to address the public health problem of ipv and develop effective interventions and support mechanisms for victims. The study was designed and conducted by MAA, SK, YCY, YG, EW, SL, and AS, with contributions to experiments, data collection, analysis, evaluations, and manuscript writing.
