The levels of Bax protein were assessed using a monoclonal antibody specific to Bax that was immobilized on a plate, followed by the addition of streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The reaction was concluded by adding acid, and the optical density of the resulting color was measured at 450 nm.

Hesperidin, a major flavonoid found in the ethyl acetate fractions of both plants studied, has been shown to protect against CCl4-induced oxidative stress and subsequent liver dysfunction in rats, likely due to its antioxidant properties. Another study examined the effect of hesperidin on the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and prostate cancer cells. Pyrogallol, a major phenolic compound identified from V. faba, exhibited a modest effect against prostate cancer cells in a previous study by Chew et al. Catechol, another significant phenolic compound identified from P. sativum, demonstrated a notable effect on two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Additionally, q-hydroxy benzoic acid, a phenolic acid present in both P. sativum and V. faba, was previously shown to have strong cytotoxic activity against both colon (HCT116) and liver (HepG2) carcinoma cell lines, while pyrogallol showed potential anticancer activities against renal cell carcinoma cell lines with no observed activity against normal healthy cells.

This investigation demonstrates that both plant peels are rich in phenolics and flavonoids, which play crucial roles as antioxidants and potential anticancer agents. Our findings confirm that apigenin, isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of P. sativum, induces loss of cell viability in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and triggers mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis through activation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, and an imbalance between Bcl-2 and Bax expressions leading to mitochondria-mediated caspase pathways, including activation of caspase-7. These results highlight the potential benefits of utilizing plant waste and reevaluating their use as an effective remedy against various cancer diseases.
