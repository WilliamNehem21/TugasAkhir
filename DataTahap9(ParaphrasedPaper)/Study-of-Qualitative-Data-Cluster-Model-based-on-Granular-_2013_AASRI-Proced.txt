Granular computing theories from the field of computer science have been integrated into the statistical analysis of qualitative data, building upon traditional qualitative data analysis methods. This approach entails describing multidimensional qualitative data using information systems and developing a mathematical model for qualitative data clusters based on granular computing. Through application to extensive data sets, it has been demonstrated that this method shows promise in providing a new approach to analyzing large and intricate qualitative data.

From an information theory perspective, the size of granules can be quantified using information content, and the relationships between granules can represent the degree of dependence, similarity, or containment (Luo, 2007). Cluster analysis aims to identify the optimal subset and achieve the clustering of observed objects. According to this notion, the change in the importance level of a subset of clustered variables can be used to determine the conclusion of the clustering process. The proposed mathematical model for qualitative data clustering, based on granular computing, facilitates the classification of vast qualitative data and has been validated for its feasibility and superiority when applied to extensive data sets (Pu, 2002).

Utilizing an information system, qualitative data can be represented, and a mathematical model for qualitative data clustering, based on granular computing, has been introduced. Additionally, a new method for determining the best subset of cluster variables by analyzing variable subsets has been proposed. This approach not only accommodates clusters with a single significant classification structure, but also those with multiple important classification structures. Examples indicate that this model is highly effective for handling extensive data sets and offers a novel perspective on the analysis of vast and complex qualitative data.
