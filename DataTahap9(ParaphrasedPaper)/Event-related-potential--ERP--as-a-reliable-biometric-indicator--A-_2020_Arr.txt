Biometric systems are extensively utilized in high-security and financial institutions such as the military, banks, airports, security agencies, and prominent companies. These systems authenticate users based on their unique physiological characteristics, including fingerprint, palm print, face, ear shape, iris textures, speech signals, electrocardiogram fiducial points, electroencephalogram energy distribution, and DNA structure. However, these biometric systems have several limitations and can be compromised by impostors. For example, speech recognition systems can be deceived by a recorded tape, iris biometric systems can be fooled by wearing a lens, and face and ear-shape biometric systems can be compromised by an image or video tape. Although DNA verification is the most secure biometric system, its verification process is time-consuming and expensive.

It is important to note that the verification results are significantly higher over the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes in the eye-closed condition, while proper verification results are obtained over the anterior part in the eye-open state. Consequently, some studies have investigated verifying subjects using fewer EEG channels, such as only one on the occipital lobe. Riera et al. proposed an EEG-based authentication system using just two dry electrodes (FP1 and FP2) and achieved a verification rate of 98.10% over 51 registered subjects and 36 intruders. Another study by Das et al. focused on extracting spatio-temporal patterns from visual evoke potential (VEP), while Palaniappan recorded EEG signals during specific mental tasks and proposed a modified four-fold cross-validation procedure to demonstrate the system's robustness against impostors.

The features in this study include local binary pattern, AR coefficients, wavelet coefficients, eigen-vectors of principal component analysis, correlation value, spectral coherence, and phase difference. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 describes the collected dataset, section 3 explains the feature extraction process, section 4 discusses classifiers, and section 5 illustrates the experimental results and discussions.

The AR coefficients in this study are estimated using a method based on the summation of both forward and backward prediction errors, and the finite sample criterion is employed to select the best order of the AR model. In this study, the best order of the AR model is set to 8, resulting in 160 elicited features for 20 channels.

The paper introduces the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest classifiers. Although KNN is not a new method, it is still widely used, particularly for multi-class problems with multimodal class distributions, due to its simplicity, interpretability, and good performance. KNN is a lazy classifier in the recall phase and does not require a training phase. Additionally, the study shows the existence of exclusive information in the resting EEG of each subject, which is reflected in the exclusive connections in their brain systems. The EEG signals in the time domain exhibit non-grammatical behavior and resemble white or colored noise, yet they capture subject-dependent information. The power spectrum of the EEG signal, particularly in... (the remainder of the text is incomplete).
