The tourism industry, a major global sector, plays a vital role in the economic and social activities of many countries by creating job opportunities and business prospects. The industry has consistently experienced growth, with the number of tourist arrivals increasing from 528 million in 2005 to 1.19 billion in 2015, and is projected to surpass 1.8 billion by 2030. In 2017, the tourism industry directly contributed approximately $2.57 trillion to the global economy and created millions of jobs. Recognizing the potential benefits of the travel industry, there is a growing demand to make tourism destinations more attractive, both for lesser-known and established locations.

Developing and refining theories is a significant and challenging task with important implications. Theoretical frameworks contribute to the advancement of knowledge by providing structure and coherence to research questions, aiding in the understanding of relevant factors and their interrelationships, and offering guidance for practical applications. In the realm of smart tourism, there is a body of literature seeking to provide theoretical insights.

This literature review includes a discussion of various context-aware systems, such as the Madrid Live and HotCity recommender systems. These systems employ context-awareness to create personalized recommendations and enhance user experiences. Additionally, there is a focus on a user-centered service mechanism based on context awareness, which incorporates human input, sensor data, high data processing platforms, and cloud computing to adapt to tourist needs. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on the importance of considering relevant contextual factors in developing recommender systems to improve the accuracy of recommendations.

Several studies in the tourism business sector emphasize the potential of leveraging smart technologies to enhance tourism experiences and gain a competitive edge. For instance, research explores how smart mobile technologies can facilitate personalized experiences in the tourism and hospitality industry, while a case study examines a hotel's use of a unique platform to create tailored experiences for guests and employees.

Within the realm of augmented reality (AR), efforts are made to address usability concerns and deliver information effectively to users. A user-centered AR application named Toarist is developed to mitigate usability problems by employing iterative design processes. Additionally, research focuses on image-based localization methods, which have the potential to advance AR applications and real-time navigation systems in the smart tourism sector.

Cultural and natural heritage are significant components of the tourism sector, with cultural tourism serving as a catalyst for economic and social transformation and leading to the development of cultural-based regeneration policies in various regions.

The burgeoning research efforts in the smart tourism sector present numerous challenges that need to be addressed, including the evaluation of proposed systems and applications with real tourists and the integration of diverse devices and data sources. Moreover, the rapidly evolving technological landscape and changing user behaviors necessitate ongoing consideration to ensure the success and sustainability of smart tourism systems.
