Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in various types of dynamic epistemic logics that aim to model the transmission of information and its impact on knowledge within multi-agent systems. However, this interest has been largely driven by practical and semantic considerations, and as a result, there has been limited development in the area of proof theory for dynamic epistemic logics.

While classic epistemic logic has been influential in philosophy and computer science, recent years have emphasized the importance of examining the dynamics of knowledgeâ€”the ways in which the knowledge of different agents changes as a system evolves. One approach to introducing dynamics into epistemic logic is through combining it with either temporal logic or some form of dynamic logic of actions. The latter approach, which has led to the emergence of dynamic epistemic logic (DEL), has primarily been motivated by practical applications and has predominantly focused on semantic considerations. The complexity of determining the validity of DEL statements is currently unknown.

When considering arbitrary DEL formulas, one challenge is determining how to measure the size of the action modalities. The finer structure of the action modality is required for validity checking, which can potentially lead to high complexity. However, using an alternative measure of action modality size may make it possible to determine validity with lower complexity.

Furthermore, while adding the global modality to the underlying epistemic logic results in an exponential increase in complexity, this does not necessarily escalate the worst-case complexity due to the translation. This holds true even when the underlying logic is S5. However, when aiming to model beliefs using the KD45 logic, a problem arises because the frame properties defined by the axioms of KD45 are not preserved under the operation of taking submodels, making it impossible to achieve completeness when beliefs are always interpreted as KD45.

Moreover, public announcements represent just one form of epistemic action. To effectively handle a broader range of epistemic actions in a unified manner, the concept of action models was introduced by Baltag, Moss, and Solecki. The idea behind epistemic action models is that agents may not be certain about which action is taking place and that each action has a precondition that must be satisfied for it to occur. Epistemic actions can be represented by Kripke structures in which each state corresponds to an event or action, and instead of a complete valuation, each event is assigned a language formula as a precondition.
