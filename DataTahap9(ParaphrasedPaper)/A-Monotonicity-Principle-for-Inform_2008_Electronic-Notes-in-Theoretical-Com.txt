Besides their application in information theory, the concepts of channel and capacity have demonstrated substantial utility in the realm of security. It has been established that in numerous scenarios, systems or protocols can be effectively conceptualized as channels, and the capacity of these channels can be considered as an indicator of the security assurances provided by the system. Techniques from information theory have been deployed across a wide range of security domains, including information flow, quantum cryptography, anonymity, and trust.

However, a significant limitation of capacity lies in its complexity. Despite its straightforward definition, there is no analytical formula that universally yields the capacity of a discrete channel. In general, it can only be approximated using numerical algorithms such as the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm. Moreover, even in simple cases where an analytical formula does exist, such as for binary channels with only two inputs and outputs, it remains intricate and challenging to apply in practice. For instance, in many instances, the prediction of a channel's performance necessitates accounting for the variability of its noise matrix with several parameters dependent on random environmental factors that arise during transmission. In such scenarios, determining the capacity of the channel becomes infeasible, yet it is still desirable to establish bounds on it or compare the performance of different channel classes. The resultant formulae make this goal exceedingly formidable.

Hence, it is natural to seek tools that enable high-level reasoning about capacity. Algebraic information theory, developed in recent research, provides such tools for binary channels. This work investigates the interrelation of order, algebra, and topology, and considers a domain of binary channels, demonstrating that capacity is Scott-continuous, offering a means to compare channels. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that capacity serves as a measurement within this domain.

As an exemplar, a lower bound on the capacity of a concealed channel in quantum key distribution amidst noise is derived. Previously, a bound was known only for cases where the noise solely stemmed from eavesdropping, resulting in a noise matrix with a simple symmetric form. We establish a fundamental theoretical limit of 1 h(1/4) 0.18 for situations involving arbitrary noise caused by any combination of eavesdropping and/or environmental factors. Additionally, our findings indicate the optimal means of interrupting this covert communication, elucidating the most effective approach.

Intuitively, the Euclidean distance det stands as a canonical upper bound on capacity, and our aim is now to demonstrate this. First, det is determined by its value on the nonnegative channels set, preserves multiplication, convex sum, and identity as a function on this set. Only two such functions exist:

Previously, we examined partial orders on binary channels, each offering a distinct way of interrelating a pair of channels to one another. Subsequently, we explored relations between fundamental monotone mappings on binary channels at a higher level of abstraction. However, these partial orders are not merely partial orders, and the monotone mappings are not merely monotone. In each case, additional mathematical structure is present, leading to a new relation between capacity and distance, which is topological.

In this section, we will explore several of the intriguing implications of the results in this paper within the context of communication. Initially, the basic protocol for quantum key distribution is reviewed. As this paper is intended to be comprehensible to individuals without prior knowledge of quantum mechanics, only minimal background information necessary for understanding quantum key distribution is provided. The concepts utilized are straightforward.

Like all systems, a quantum system possesses a state. The state of a quantum system is represented by a unit vector in a vector space with extensive structure, known as a Hilbert space. This state of a quantum system is also referred to as a ket. Two examples of kets are 0 and 1, and it is beneficial to consider these specific kets as quantum realizations of classical bits 0 and 1. Each denotes a legitimate state of a quantum system, and the polarization (state) of a photon is one instance of a quantum system for which kets are needed to describe its state.
