The development of a secure brain-computer interface (BCI) system relies heavily on the recognition of emotions. A potential security system could be designed to detect emotions that cannot be forcefully controlled, such as fear during a robbery, and use this information to prevent actions like cash dispensing from an ATM. Emotion recognition also holds potential for effective control of devices, such as computers and assistive applications, and has diverse applications including music therapy, safe driving, and artificial intelligence.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analytical technique that utilizes linear transformation to reduce data dimensionality, extract important information from large datasets, and analyze variable structures. In the context of this study, PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of EEG signals. Given the poor spatial resolution of EEG signals, utilizing PCA helps alleviate the burden of considering all channels for feature extraction by identifying maximum variation from the input higher dimensions. By applying PCA to nine channels and extracting the first principal component, the study reduced the number of EEG channels of interest and transformed all signals to five signals of interest for each set of the input EEG signal, resulting in five sets of data instead of the original 62.
