This academic paper discusses the utilization of game theory techniques for analyzing ad-hoc routing protocols, which is considered to be a novel application of such methods. The paper describes the application of game theory to the analysis of routing protocols, emphasizing the challenges and limitations encountered. The paper also discusses how routing protocols can be abstractly modeled at various levels and explains the use of game theory to analyze and compare routing techniques in terms of performance characteristics.

The paper emphasizes the use of simulation tools such as Opnet Modeller, NS-2, and Glomosim for analyzing routing protocols but notes that these tools may produce inconsistent results compared to field trials. The authors address the issue of analyzing low-fidelity models of routing protocols and explain why they chose not to use model-checking for this purpose. They introduce the concept of modeling routing protocols as games and highlight the use of a cost function in the analysis, particularly in determining the minimax value and outcomes.

The paper discusses the players and moves within the game of modeling routing protocols, detailing how the set-of-routers player and the network player interact within the game. It explains how the cost function is used to represent the conflicting objectives of the two players and provides insights into the decision-making involved in modeling routing protocols as games.

The authors describe the mapping of routing protocols to a minimax game and the modeling decisions made in this process. They further explain the tool used to model different routing techniques as a minimax game and report the results of experiments conducted with link state routing, reverse path forwarding (RPF), and distance vector routing.

The paper also discusses the limitations of the approach, such as the assumption of perfect information, optimal scheduling of routers, and the finite number of nodes that can be modeled. Despite these limitations, the authors argue that game theory provides a rigorous and scalable approach for the analysis of ad-hoc routing protocols. They conclude by emphasizing the potential of game theory in understanding the performance bounds of routing protocols and its advantages over model-checkers.
