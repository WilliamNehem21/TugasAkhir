The utilization of smart electricity applications and the acquisition of electric energy data have become integral components of China's smart grid development. The application of smart electricity relies on a physical electricity data acquisition system, serving as an interactive link between power providers and consumers.

The testing section includes three module testing positions, each for the concentrator carrier module, three-phase meter carrier module, and single-phase meter or collector carrier module. To accurately reflect the power characteristics of the measured carrier module, the system requires high-speed and high-precision sampling of voltage and current signals, as they can be viewed as continuous signals denoted as f(t).

The measurement section is controlled by a microcontroller, which performs real-time measurement of current and voltage. This is a critical component of the measurement apparatus. The microcontroller chip CS5550, along with ADR431 and an analog switch 74HC4052, facilitates real-time acquisition of current and voltage.

The CS5550 Cirrus Logic chip contains two analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and a highly integrated serial interface. One ADC interface of CS5550 is connected to the output of 74HC4052 for measuring carrier module current, while another interface measures carrier module voltage through a divider resistance means connected to the power supply of the carrier module. The CS5550's serial interface is linked to the microcontroller's Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

For communication protocols, the system utilizes the UART to simulate the communication protocol of the three-phase ammeter carrier module and the collector acquisition communication protocol. The UART also interacts with the PC for instruction interaction, controlling the measurement and data reading.

The MCU's measuring device operates on the uC/OS-II system, a real-time kernel-based operating system with high portability and performance tailored for microprocessors and controllers.

The PC interaction tasks involve serial initialization and data collection, using interrupt mechanisms to process received data packets. The PC interaction task conducts CRC verification, decodes command words, and sends appropriate responses back to the PC.

The simulation tasks involve the concentrator sending data to the concentrator carrier module, triggering the carrier module into transmit state to measure power characteristics. The collector and meter simulation tasks employ similar methods to achieve simulation.
