Contemporary medical diagnosis heavily relies on biomedical and clinical data, with machine learning algorithms demonstrating significant effectiveness in extracting information from this data to aid physicians in decision-making. Consequently, various machine learning-based approaches have been developed to tackle this challenge, differing in their efficacy and computational requirements. A specific focus has been placed on non-communicable diseases due to their prevalence and life-threatening characteristics. The diagnosis of diseases such as diabetes and breast cancer can be viewed as a binary classification problem. This study introduces a novel machine learning algorithm, referred to as geometrical driven diagnosis (GDD), aimed at diagnosing diabetes and breast cancer with an accuracy of up to 99.96% and 95.8%, respectively.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, with an estimated 415 million individuals worldwide affected by this condition, and an additional 193 million undiagnosed cases. Early detection of diabetes, coupled with appropriate treatment, can effectively mitigate the detrimental impact of the disease on health.

The experiments conducted in this study demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to recent algorithms in the field. The conclusion of the proposed approach and the corresponding experiments are presented in Section 5, while Section 6 discusses the limitations of this work and potential directions for future research.

Furthermore, the dataset is processed to balance the positive and negative classes, with the positive class data being duplicated as needed. Subsequently, each subset is divided into training and testing sets, with 70% and 30% allocated to training and testing, respectively. The training datasets are clustered using...
