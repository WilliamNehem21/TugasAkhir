The 3D information necessary for creating properly fitting artificial hips can be obtained by analyzing healthy hip joints. This paper introduces a method for accurately extracting 3D data from CT images of the proximal femur. The method involves using adaptive windows based on neighboring CT slices to narrow down the search area, employing a 2D contour characteristic points matching method to correct contours, utilizing quasi-circular contours of the femur head to adjust primary contours, and employing a projecting method based on distance transform to locate key points of the hip joint. Experimentation with this method demonstrated its effectiveness in accurately extracting 3D data from CT series images of the proximal femur.

The hip joint is composed of the femur head, neck, and backbone. The femur head, located between the femur and pelvic bone, is circular in appearance and surrounded by muscles. The femur neck, which connects the femur head and backbone, appears smaller and tubular in shape. Extracting the contour of the hip is essential for obtaining 3D data, as it allows for the accurate fitting of artificial hips to the biological and physical characteristics of the hip structure.

However, the segmentation of bones can be challenging due to the irregular physiological bone structure, fuzzy contour lines caused by the conjunction of the femur head and acetabular bone, low contrast, and noise. Existing segmentation methods, such as no-seed region segmentation and non-parameter level set method, have limitations in effectively capturing the contours of the hip bones. Therefore, an improved solution is needed to address these challenges and enhance the automation level of the segmentation process.
