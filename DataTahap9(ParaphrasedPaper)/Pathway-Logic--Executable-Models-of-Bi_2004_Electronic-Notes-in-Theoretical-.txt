Research in biology and biomedicine has led to the production of large amounts of experimental data and associated analyses, creating a pressing need for new methods to integrate this information into theoretical models of cellular processes. This integration is essential for guiding hypothesis creation and testing. The study of mammalian signaling processes, which involve the molecular pathways responsible for detecting, converting, and internally transmitting information from the cellular environment to intracellular targets, would greatly benefit from the availability of predictive models. Although signaling pathways are complex, recent research has revealed fundamental concepts suggesting that they can be analyzed using computational methods.

For instance, most signaling pathways involve the hierarchical assembly of multi-protein complexes or modules that regulate the flow of information based on logical rules. Furthermore, these pathways are embedded in networks with various types of connections, such as stimulatory, inhibitory, and cooperative, to ensure that signals are interpreted appropriately in specific cells or tissues.

The Helix project at INRIA has developed the Genetic Network Analyzer (GNA) tool for modeling and simulating genetic regulatory networks. This tool enables the specification of models by providing upper and lower bounds for protein concentrations and reaction rates, and it computes a qualitative state transition graph to determine possible qualitative behaviors.

Simulations using in silico models based on kinetic measurements of signaling pathways are important for gaining a detailed understanding of signal transduction biochemistry. However, the development of such models is hindered by the difficulty in obtaining experimental data and the stochastic nature of cellular populations of signaling molecules. Additionally, new computational methods are required to address the complexity of simulating and analyzing these detailed models.

The Maude case study, along with other initial case studies applying formal modeling techniques to cellular pathways, is an initial step toward developing a new field of symbolic systems biology. This new field could provide biologists with powerful tools for generating novel inferences about relationships among biological entities, thereby enhancing our understanding of complex biological systems and expediting research to test hypotheses about their in vivo operation.

In this approach, rewrite rules are used to describe local changes that could occur in a modeled system. Rewriting logic allows for reasoning about possible complex changes based on the basic changes specified by the model, including concurrent changes in different parts of a compartment and multi-step changes. Under reasonable assumptions, rewrite theories can be executed in Maude to describe a biological signaling process over time according to a symbolic model and can be formally analyzed to reason about properties of the states reachable from an initial state.

The use of forward search allows for a breadth-first search of all paths through the transition graph from a given initial state, enabling the identification of all possible outcomes from that state. Additionally, meta-analysis facilitates reasoning about the models themselves, where essential features of models can be abstracted to form families of related models, allowing for exploration of different instantiations of sets of reactions and rules.

The paper provides a detailed description of a Maude model, named Biopathways (BP), of a major receptor-mediated pathway in mammalian cells centered around the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This model formalizes reaction data curated from the literature by expert biologists and currently includes more than 650 proteins and more than 500 rules describing possible reaction steps.

The paper also introduces various technical concepts and tools, such as operators for declaring constants, sorts, multisets, and modification sets, as well as rules for describing specific biological processes and the use of metadata for annotating rules with additional information.

Additionally, the paper discusses the potential outcomes and implications of the developed modeling and simulation techniques, laying the groundwork for a more comprehensive understanding of complex biological systems and the acceleration of research in this field.
