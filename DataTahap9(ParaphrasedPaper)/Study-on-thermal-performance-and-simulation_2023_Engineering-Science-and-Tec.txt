Presently, the majority of research on mechanical joints is centered on the performance of metal mechanical joints in traditional machine tools. For example, Shoukry investigated the contact stiffness of mechanical joints and formulated a corresponding mathematical model. He also discovered that mechanical joints exhibit a constant ratio of tangential to normal contact stiffness. Archenti examined the contribution of mechanical joint errors to the overall error of the machine and concluded that the accuracy of machine tools is significantly impacted by the mechanical joints. Zhao derived the elastic modulus and shear modulus of mechanical joints based on fractal contact theory. Chen explored the impact of friction on the contact stiffness of mechanical joints and developed a model that takes into account the effect of friction on contact stiffness. However, there has been limited research conducted on the performance of oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints.

This paper explores the thermal properties of oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints. A novel discrete analytical method for determining the actual contact ratio of oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints, considering contact pressure, was developed. The fluctuation pattern of the actual contact ratio with respect to preload and surface roughness is examined. A model for the thermal parameters of oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints is proposed. Theoretically, a virtual material simulation analysis method for oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints is established, and the accuracy of the theoretical model and simulation analysis method is validated through experiments and simulations. Using a specific type of BMC bed foundation as a case study, the impact of oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints on the thermal performance and thermal-mechanical coupling characteristics of the BMC bed foundation is investigated, providing evidence of the significant influence of the thermal properties and thermal-mechanical coupling characteristics of oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints.

The paper also investigates the reasons for changes in the thermal performance of oil medium steel-BMC mechanical joints. The actual solid contact ratio of the mechanical joints increases as the surface roughness decreases or the preload increases. As the actual solid contact ratio increases, the thermal properties of the mechanical joints tend to resemble those of the solid materials (BMC and steel). The thermal conductivity and density of the solid materials (steel and BMC) are much higher than that of the lubricating oil. Consequently, the relevant performance characteristics are affected, where EO represents the elastic modulus of the lubricating oil, VO stands for the volume of lubricating oil in the mechanical joints, DPO denotes the change in pressure on the lubricating oil, DVO represents the change in volume of lubricating oil after pressure, DF is the normal support force provided by the lubricating oil, and DD stands for the change in oil film thickness after compression of the mechanical joints.
