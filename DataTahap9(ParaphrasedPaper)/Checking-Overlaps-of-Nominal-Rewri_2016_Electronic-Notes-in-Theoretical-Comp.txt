This academic paper introduces nominal rewriting, which extends first-order rewriting by allowing for the specification of binding operators. The paper presents conditions for local confluence of closed nominal rewriting theories, based on the analysis of rule overlaps. It demonstrates that closed nominal rewriting rules with joinable proper critical pairs are locally confluent, and refines the concept of rule overlap to establish the confluence of the closed rewriting relation. These conditions are shown to be easy to verify using a nominal unification algorithm. The paper also discusses the notion of closed rules, which correspond to rules without free atoms, and provides criteria for local confluence and completion of closed rewriting systems. Additionally, the paper intends to formalize the presented results in the PVS library on term rewriting systems.
