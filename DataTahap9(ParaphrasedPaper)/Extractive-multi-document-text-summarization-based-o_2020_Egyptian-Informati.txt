The widespread availability of data undoubtedly improves human life, but it also creates challenges in accessing accurate information quickly. As a result, researchers are increasingly exploring automated text summarization technologies to achieve greater efficiencies through improved or new methods. Despite numerous studies in the field of document summarization, there is a persistent need for improvement and innovation. Automated document summarization, a significant subtopic of natural language processing, aims to present lengthy text documents in a condensed and understandable form.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 3 provides information on the general stages of the proposed summarization method, including textual graph, text preprocessing tool, and graph independent sets. Section 4 details the dataset, evaluation metrics, experimental results, and a comparison of the proposed model with state-of-the-art methods. Section 5 discusses and interprets the experimental results.

While most researchers have focused on extractive text summarization, some have effectively worked on abstractive summarization. For instance, abstractive multi-sentence summarization using the RNN structure has been explored, as well as other works in the field of abstractive summarization.

The ongoing challenge of finding maximum independent sets remains a difficult problem, and current methods have not yet reached an optimal solution. As a result, new approaches to this problem are being carefully pursued.

In this study, a graph-based generic, extractive, and multidocument summarization method is presented to extract appropriate summaries from given texts. The proposed method consists of three main stages: preprocessing, graphical representation of word commonalities, and sentence weighting using the eigenvector node centrality method. The success of the framework was extensively evaluated using several ROUGE performance metrics.

A text processing tool named "kush" was developed within the framework of the proposed model to address challenges in identifying connections and relationships between sentences. The tool utilizes a unique algorithm to accurately transfer relationships between word phrases and textual graphs.

The proposed method achieved high scores in the ROUGE evaluation, indicating its effectiveness in producing informative automated summaries. Experimental results using various datasets demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed method in comparison to existing approaches. The significant contributions of the proposed innovative method were evident throughout the experimental processes of the study.

Overall, the proposed summarization method showed promising results in producing comprehensive summaries, outperforming existing approaches in terms of recall, precision, and F-score values. The unique approach used to isolate independent nodes and create the summary, along with the experimental processes applied, demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method in generating meaningful and comprehensive summaries.
