The software named Cala enables the solution of 2D non-steady-state temperature field problems using the method of control volumes. The software facilitates the creation of computational geometry in both vertical and horizontal sections, with the results providing surface temperature distributions in peripheral panels that can be compared with thermographic images. Additionally, the obtained temperature field allows for the evaluation of thermal bridges in peripheral prefabricated panels, particularly at connection points, and enables the determination of the linear coefficient of thermal bridges through thermal flux analysis.

A prefabricated peripheral panel measuring 3550 x 1170 x 260 mm is constructed from reinforced concrete loadbearing parts with a thickness of 160 mm, insulated by a 50 mm layer of foam polystyrene and a 50 mm layer of surface-reinforced concrete. The connection of the peripheral panel is achieved by vertical and horizontal connections, which are sealed and embedded using microspore rubber and flexible asphalt sealant. The computational geometry model of the prefabricated peripheral panel was created using a squared computational web with 5 x 5 mm dimensions.

Thermal imaging measurements revealed the presence of significant thermal bridges in the reinforced concrete skeleton MS-OB, particularly at the horizontal and vertical connections of the peripheral prefabricated panels. This panel connection was then simulated as a steady two-dimensional thermal field using the Cala software, and the obtained surface temperatures were compared with the thermographic measurements.

The research was supported by grants from the state budget of the Czech Republic and the European Union's Operational Programme Research and Development for Innovations. Specifically, the financial support came from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports under grant no. FAST-J-12-1781 and as an activity of the Regional Centre for Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies (ADMAS) under project no. CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0097.
