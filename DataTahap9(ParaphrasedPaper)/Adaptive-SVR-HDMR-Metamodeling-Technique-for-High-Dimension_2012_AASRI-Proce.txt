The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical foundations, including Hierarchical Drift and Mutation Randomization (HDMR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Section 3 introduces the new adaptive SVR-HDMR method. In Section 4, this method is tested on two nonlinear problems, and Section 5 provides a summary of the findings.

HDMR offers a hierarchical, correlated function expansion of the response's mathematical structure, with its terms being independently evaluable. The key concept of HDMR is that functional correlations between statistically independent variables rapidly diminish from the perspective of the output/response (Chowdhury and Rao, 2009). This arises from the expectation that, for most well-defined physical systems, only lower-order correlations of the input variables significantly impact the overall response (Rabitz and Alis, 1999). HDMR can thus reduce the computational complexity of mapping relationships between input variables and the output/response of high-dimensional, complex systems.

The computation cost of Cut-HDMR is influenced by the highest order of the cut-HDMR expansion. While numerous metamodeling methods have been developed within the framework of Cut-HDMR, a complementary sampling method is still lacking. In this study, we utilize SVR to construct the component functions of HDMR.

In metamodeling processes, the characteristics and structures of the underlying function may be unknown, particularly for black-box problems. Traditional metamodeling methods often lack efficiency while maintaining satisfactory accuracy. The new SVR-HDMR method takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of HDMR and employs SVR to construct its component functions.

The paper introduces a new HDMR metamodel construction method that combines the hierarchical structure of HDMR with the explicitness of SVR. The SVR-HDMR metamodeling technique is able to automatically reveal an explicit expression of the underlying function and correlations among the input variables without requiring prior information about the underlying function. The accuracy of the constructed model is not affected by the choice of the cut-point. By inheriting HDMR's hierarchical structure and reusing sampled values, the proposed method substantially reduces computation costs while ensuring result accuracy. The adaptive SVR-HDMR method was successfully applied to the optimization design of the ZK5540 machine tool structure for Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Group. Future research will focus on developing appropriate sampling methods and exploring more engineering applications.
