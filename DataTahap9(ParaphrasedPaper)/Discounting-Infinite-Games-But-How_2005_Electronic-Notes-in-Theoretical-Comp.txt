The study reveals that the discounting method used in the research closely aligns with Shapley's original concepts. This finding suggests that the specific discounting method being employed imposes unnecessary constraints. The article argues that removing these constraints would result in a more comprehensive and refined theory, encompassing parity and mean payoff games as specific scenarios.

Additionally, the paper discusses the concept of uparity(p), which takes on values of either 0 or 1 based on the parity of the maximal one-day payoff visited infinitely often. While there are similarities between mean payoff and parity games, especially in deterministic scenarios, the exact relationship between these game types has remained ambiguous. This lack of clarity is partially attributed to the absence of suitable discounted parity games. One notable characteristic of mean payoff games is their potential approximation through discounted games. Therefore, without finding discounted equivalents for parity games, the parallels between parity and mean payoff games may be considered unnecessary.
