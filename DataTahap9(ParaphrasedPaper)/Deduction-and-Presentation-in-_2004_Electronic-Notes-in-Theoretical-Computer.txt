The paper discusses the capabilities of a rule-based system implemented in Mathematica for computing and visualizing proof objects, which are internal representations of deduction derivations conforming to a user-specified specification. Additionally, it presents the computed proof objects in a simplified natural-language style, derived from the proof presentation styles of Theorema. The system is designed to support symbolic and numeric computations efficiently and could serve as a useful programming tool for Theorema developers due to its integration with Mathematica.

The system includes a feature called 'prohibit' that, when given a list of symbols, ignores subexpressions with those symbols as the outermost symbol. The default value allows rewriting to be performed everywhere. Another feature, 'maxdepth', serves to prevent infinite computations by specifying the maximum depth of the partial derivation tree encoded in the proof object. Its default value is 10000 and can be adjusted as needed when the 'tracestyle' has a value other than "none".
