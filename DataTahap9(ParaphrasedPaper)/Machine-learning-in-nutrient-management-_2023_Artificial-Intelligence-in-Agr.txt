Agriculture serves as the primary source of food, income, and employment for rural populations in developing countries, particularly in Africa, and is expected to face increasing pressure due to population growth. Accurate diagnosis of crop nutritional status and nutrient requirements is essential for effective farm management, impacting both environmental sustainability and economic viability. This paper reviews machine learning-based algorithms developed over the past decade for estimating fertilizer requirements and nutrient status in agriculture. It identifies commonalities, discusses weaknesses, and proposes potential solutions and future perspectives.

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, involves computers learning to perform tasks automatically by analyzing existing data. It has been successfully applied across various fields, providing tools for soil quality monitoring and personalized recommendations based on experimental and field data. The review outlines common machine-learning algorithms, feature selection approaches, and performance metrics used in the reviewed work, as well as the most common features for nutrient management and fertilizer recommendation studies.

With advances in machine learning algorithms, even complex problems such as regression and classification can now be effectively addressed. Various machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Feature Extraction techniques have been used in agriculture to predict crop yields, fertilizer recommendations, and nutrient uptake. Furthermore, integrating machine learning with IoT data is leading to the development of AI systems for farm management, offering better recommendations and insights for decision-making and future actions.

However, challenges related to practical application of machine learning in nutrient management have been identified, with issues such as misleading publications due to improper expertise and limitations in data collection. The paper highlights the need for precise datasets and proper knowledge in both machine learning and soil and plant nutrient management to improve the accuracy of models. Despite these challenges, the paper anticipates a growing application of machine learning models in the field of agriculture, potentially leading to improved yield and sustainable agricultural practices.
