Depletion of fossil fuels and air pollution have led to a global environmental sustainability challenge, which is addressed through the utilization and optimization of renewable energy sources. In the realm of energy conservation, thermal storage plays a critical role.

In the context of power generation, the misalignment between energy demand and availability necessitates the use of thermal storage systems. Thermal energy can be stored in three main forms: sensible, latent, or thermochemical. The storage of heat in the form of latent heat can be effectively achieved through the use of phase change materials (PCMs), which possess high latent heat of fusion and can store and release heat through solidification and melting.

Latent heat thermal storage offers the advantage of storing a large amount of heat in a small volume, thereby providing high thermal storage density. Zalba et al. have extensively reviewed the classification of PCMs, which are generally categorized into organic (paraffinic and non-paraffinic) and inorganic (primarily hydrated salts). Organic materials have several advantages, such as congruent melting, non-corrosive behavior, high latent heat of fusion, a wide range of melting temperatures, chemical stability, and low toxicity. However, a common drawback of organic materials is their low thermal conductivity, which can lead to the formation of significant thermal gradients during transient heat transfer. Inorganic PCMs, on the other hand, offer a high storage capacity per unit volume, approximately twice that of organic compounds. However, their main drawback is their incongruent melting behavior.

The investigated thermal storage system comprises a shell and tube heat exchanger, in which heat exchange occurs between the heat transfer fluid within the tubes and the PCM within the shell. The PCM absorbs the heat transferred from the fluid through the wall, leading to the generation of a thermal gradient within the PCM, the slope of which decreases over time. The high thermal gradients are a result of the low thermal conductivity and large thermal inertia (high specific heat) of the PCM.
