This academic paper introduces a formal model for addressing the multicast routing problem in multicast networks. The proposed approach involves representing the network as a weighted and-or graph, where the weight on a connector corresponds to the cost of sending a packet on the corresponding network link. The soft constraint logic programming (SCLP) framework is utilized for specifying and solving related problems in a declarative programming environment. Specifically, the semantics of an SCLP program are employed to compute the best tree in the corresponding and-or graph, which can be utilized to determine the multicast distribution tree with minimum cost from a given source node to all destination nodes, taking into account multidimensional costs representing different quality of service metrics.

The paper extends previous research on shortest path problems and introduces an alternative approach using clauses closer to logic programming to represent trees instead of paths. The focus is on providing a solution to the problem of transmitting a data packet from one source to multiple receivers, with an emphasis on minimizing the traversal of the same link multiple times in the network.

Various algorithms and variants for multicast problem solving are discussed, including shortest-path tree (SPT), minimum spanning tree (MST), steiner tree (ST), constrained steiner tree (CST), and other miscellaneous trees. The complexities and features of these algorithms are explored, highlighting the differences between unicast and multicast QoS routing.

The paper also discusses the additional complexities involved in multicast QoS routing compared to unicast QoS routing, such as the need to support shared and heterogeneous reservation styles and global admission control of the distribution flow. Several multicast QoS routing algorithms and related problems are mentioned, focusing on aspects of stability, robustness, and scalability.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the concept of an and-tree as a special case of an and-or graph and emphasizes the multidimensional nature of costs in the context of finding the best distribution tree. The paper concludes by addressing the multi-criteria nature of the problem and the potential for obtaining multiple non-dominated trees with different incomparable costs.
