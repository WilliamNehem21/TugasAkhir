The e-cyanobacterium/e-photosynthesis 1 project has been launched with the goal of addressing domain-specific challenges and leveraging the benefits of repository and database synthesis. This initiative aims to establish complex relationships between models and ontological knowledge bases, various types of simulations and analyses, and the integration of models within specific domains.

An approach has been adopted to map biological models to a unified space of biological objects, inspired by the concept of a comprehensive modeling space (CMS) originally introduced for representing reduced models of oxygenic photosynthesis. CMS is designed to simplify model-building tasks by providing a clear and easily understandable notation for modelers and biologists. The internet is envisioned as a means to facilitate wide model sharing, provided that models are translated to a unified format with uniformly annotated components, making them usable in their original form, comparable to each other, and with wet-lab experiments.

The platform is currently being used to model processes related to the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 with the aim of creating a consortium-approved biochemical space that consolidates the current knowledge of cyanobacterial processes. Additionally, the platform provides an environment for modelers focusing on different aspects of cyanobacteria, serving as a preliminary step towards obtaining an integrated model of the selected organism.

It is worth noting that there are several tools available for simulation, management, development, annotation, sharing, and comparison of model simulations against experimental data. While tools such as biomodels.net, vcell, and jwsonline are related to CMS, each of these tools focuses on general dynamic (mathematical) models and does not support the implementation of a domain-specific view coupled with systematically organized biological background.

Annotations play a crucial role in understanding ODE models, and the lack of uniformity and completeness in annotations poses a contemporary challenge. Proper annotation is essential for placing models within a well-organized biological and biochemical context provided by existing ontologies such as KEGG, ChEBI, or Gene Ontology.

The representation of the complex biochemical space is not easy to understand, and to address this challenge, a separate module is proposed for graphical visualization of the biochemical space. This module specifies a process-based hierarchy of biochemical data and allows for graphical visualization that navigates through different levels of abstraction and biological structures.

The first applications of CMS are the websites e-photosynthesis.org and e-cyanobacterium.org 1, focusing on models of photosynthetic processes and cellular processes of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, respectively. While the former site presents a simplified version of the biochemical space targeting biological entities, the latter site implements all the features presented in the academic paper. The development of the biochemical space and visualization of cyanobacteria is currently ongoing in the Cyanonetwork Consortium 2.

Future goals include the development of an offline annotation tool to streamline the annotation process and an online model editor designed to support non-expert users. The platform is currently undergoing testing by the consortium focusing on modeling cyanobacteria, with the aim of establishing it as robust technology that can be easily adapted for other organism-specific modeling projects, which are highly relevant in systems biology.
