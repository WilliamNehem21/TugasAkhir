In recent years, there has been a growing trend of utilizing artificial intelligence methods in conjunction with numerical models to predict complex phenomena (Schmidhuber, 2015). These methods typically involve the use of machine learning algorithms that are trained using observed data in order to detect and predict new data. One commonly used algorithm is neural networks, which have been used in various fields, such as meteorology (Aoki, 2017), where convolutional neural networks have been employed.

This study proposes the use of a deep learning approach to forecast heavy rainfall events in real-time using weather radar data, a method referred to as nowcasting by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which involves short-term forecasts of up to 6 hours. These heavy rainfall events are known for their high spatio-temporal variability, making them challenging to predict using standard numerical models. Weather radars provide real-time data on convective rainfall, generating time series of images utilized by the machine learning algorithm, particularly a convolutional recurrent neural network utilizing long short-term memory (LSTM) units.

The study focuses on the city of Campinas in Southeastern Brazil and its surrounding areas, with weather radar data processed to create a time series of 2D images depicting precipitation rate. The machine learning algorithm, known as M5images, aims to predict rainfall rate values surpassing a specified threshold for the grid pixels. The study differs from previous approaches by utilizing only heavy and very heavy rainfall data for training the neural network and introducing a new correction factor to improve predictions.

Furthermore, the study proposes a correction scheme for rainfall forecasts to address underestimation issues observed during testing, enhancing the reliability of the forecasts. This correction scheme involves deriving a multiplicative correction factor from the first observed image and applying it to subsequent predictions for specific time intervals. The study was conducted using the R language with packages such as Keras, TensorFlow, raster, metrics, and mlmetrics.

The training and test sets consisted of 9 and 3 heavy rainfall events, respectively. For the training events, 95% of the images were utilized for training the neural network, with the remaining 5% allocated for validation to optimize hyperparameters. The study involved a total of 133 hours or 798 images sampled at 10-minute intervals for training and validation, comparing the predicted data for 10, 20, and 30-minute intervals to the observed data at a particular time. The study demonstrated that prediction performance decreased as the prediction time increased, suggesting the difficulty in predicting higher time intervals due to the low spatio-temporal correlation and high variability of rainfall events.

The forecast was generated by averaging the pixel values of the images, and different prediction models were obtained using techniques such as dropout and ensembles. Lastly, the study aimed to evaluate the performance of the M5images method for longer prediction times exceeding 30 minutes, which could be beneficial for early warning systems in the context of nowcasting.
