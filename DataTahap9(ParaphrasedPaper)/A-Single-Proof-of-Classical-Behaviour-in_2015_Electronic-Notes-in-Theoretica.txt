In physics, the authors have developed a method for formalizing principles in quantum mechanics, such as the principle of superposition, using paraconsistent approaches. It is common for scientific theories to contain inconsistencies, and even when present, successful theories are not discarded as long as they effectively predict results and describe phenomena.

The discovery of a robust negation in the cn hierarchy is intriguing because it allows for the reduction of a portion of these logics to classical logic. This means that a translation can be established, embedding classical logic into any logic within the cn system. While this idea has been mentioned in previous papers, the explicit proof has not been presented. In this paper, we offer an inductive proof regarding the relationship between strong negation and classical behavior within the cn systems, consisting of three lemmas and two theorems. This proof demonstrates that many properties in c1 can also hold in cn, with the exception of the obvious ones.
