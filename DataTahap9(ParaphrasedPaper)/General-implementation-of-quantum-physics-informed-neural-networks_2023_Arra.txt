Historically, quantum computing (QC) algorithms have been manually developed under the presumption that fault-tolerant quantum processors capable of consistently handling many qubits and quantum operations (referred to as quantum gates) exist. The basic unit of quantum information and computation, or qubit, is similar to a bit in traditional computers. Presently, quantum computers utilize a small number of qubits with noise and imperfection-prone quantum gates. A new design paradigm called Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is being specifically developed to incorporate processes for complex systems, often encoded in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) or other experimentally validated results. Time-dependent dynamics governing real processes play a primary role in modern machine learning (ML). Incorporating PDEs at the core of learning provides regularization and constraints on a range of valid solutions.

Additionally, integrating information constellations will lead to the refinement of algorithmic information and reduction of data convergence time towards a valid solution. Successful implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in mathematical physics have been demonstrated. These implementations leveraged deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The significant advantage lies in the realization that nonlinear problems can be addressed without linearizations or prior assumptions. Automatic differentiation is utilized to differentiate neural networks with respect to input data and model parameters to create PINNs. In this manner, PINNs respect symmetries, conservation laws, and invariances arising from the laws of physics that dictate given data structures, as prescribed by PDEs. This method provides the ability to address numerous problems in computational physics and related scientific fields.

Furthermore, to update parameters, one needs to design a Hamiltonian that suits a given problem, being mindful of the choice of quantum hardware platform to use. Superconducting qubits appear most promising for pseudo-arbitrary Hamiltonian shaping. Appropriate cost functions for parameter optimization need to be defined. The large scale of training instances makes efficient training and evaluation of DNNs impractical. Homogeneity in input size is a significant constraint of the proposed strategy. This paper introduces a mathematical model of Quantum PINNs as a new quantum class of universal function approximators and evaluates the model. Thus, this review should be viewed as an exploratory study proposing approaches to the use of QML algorithms in understanding fundamental particles.

Recent research has demonstrated the widespread use of PINNs in various scientific disciplines, with highly positive results. The paper discusses the potential of studying quantum data and the practical aspects of experimenting with QML. These challenges have placed QML in a difficult position. The efficacy of an ML algorithm is typically assessed using empirical benchmarks with fictitious datasets. This approach, with its rapid convergence to accurate solutions, will enable QML processes to address some of the most challenging data optimization issues. The study showcases how the proposed quantum-based PINNs may be applied in QML protocols using conventional information technology in a hybrid environment.
