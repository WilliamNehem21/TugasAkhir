Example 2.2 in this paper is extracted from the netfilter how-to 2, which presents a scenario where an internet user wants to configure their firewall to block incoming traffic from the external network to their local network. Normally, the internet connection interface is denoted as ppp0, and a straightforward approach to achieve this is by rejecting all new packets originating from this source. The example also includes additional rules that facilitate multiple local computers sharing the same external IP address by rewriting the header of outgoing packets to a single address.

The paper discusses the relationship between rewrite systems and the abstract reduction systems they generate. It highlights that while a rewrite system can be associated with a unique abstract reduction system, the reverse is not always true.

The paper explores various strategy languages for describing strategies, such as elan, stratego, tom, and maude. These languages aim to provide abstract means of expressing control over rule applications through high-level features like reflexivity and rewriting strategies.

In the domain of security policies, the paper focuses on specific strategies of interest, including universal(r), innermost(r), and ordered(r1,..., rk), which represents derivations where rules r1,..., rk are tried in a specific order on terms whose all strict subterms are irreducible.

The paper discusses the notion of normalization in the context of priority rewriting, and provides proof and examples to illustrate concepts like ip-normalized and innermost termination.

Moreover, the paper touches upon termination techniques in different kinds of rewriting, such as outermost rewriting, lazy rewriting, and priority rewriting.

Finally, the paper presents a specific scenario in the narrowing tree, providing a set of queries leading to the decision to accept with a given set of substitutions.
