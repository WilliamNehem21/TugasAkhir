The paper suggests that there is a direct correspondence between the plays of fr and the runs of r, while for the filiform case with tr, the correspondence is between plays and restricted runs. It is apparent that, in general, there are more strategies available in fr than there are states in r.

To derive three plays r, r', and r'' of fr, we analyze its restriction to all three components, where r represents an interleaving of r' and r'' with a possible extra move at the end. If an extra move exists in r, it is replicated as the response to t. Otherwise, if there is an additional move in either r' or r'', we copy that instead. It is important to note that this is feasible because we are aware that the appropriate move is accessible in fr, thus taking advantage of the unique characteristics of games in this form.
