This paper presents the metatheory for timed modal logic (TML), which is a modal logic used for analyzing timed transition systems (TTS). The paper addresses several longstanding open problems related to TML. Firstly, it proves that TML satisfies the Hennessy-Milner property and resolves an open question in the field. Secondly, it demonstrates that the set of validities in TML is not recursively enumerable.

In the realm of embedded and cyber-physical systems, extensive research has focused on developing quantitative modeling and specification formalisms for systems with guaranteed functional and non-functional properties. Timed transition systems and timed automata have been particularly useful in modeling real-time communication protocols and control programs for highly safety-critical embedded systems with strict timing constraints.

Additionally, the paper establishes that the satisfiability problem for TML is undecidable despite its restricted expressive power, similar to the known undecidability result for TCTL. It also shows that the set of TML-validities is non-recursively enumerable, implying that any complete proof system will generate a non-recursively enumerable set of provable formulas. This raises questions about whether TML can be axiomatized at all.

The paper introduces a set of axioms that characterize the concept of time in models such as TTS and timed automata, reflecting properties such as persistence, continuity, linearity, density of time, synchronization, and the uniformity of time measurement by clocks. These axioms are similar to those found in other modal logics, leading to further questions and research directions.

The paper does not address problems related to timed automata, model verification, model construction, or model checking. Its objective is to clarify the open problems of model theory for TML, while questions regarding timed automata semantics will be explored in future work.

The paper establishes the strong completeness of the proof system for TTS semantics through the construction of a canonical model. Unlike other modal logics, the canonical model for TTS is not constructed from maximal consistent sets due to the non-identification of states by maximal consistent sets and their potential satisfaction by non-bisimilar models under different interpretations. To address this complexity, the paper proposes a new method for constructing canonical models.

Furthermore, the paper introduces axioms (a5)-(a10) describing the nature of time in TTS, including linearity, persistence, unidirectionality, determinism, and continuity of time. Axiom (a11) ensures that all clocks measure the same time flow. The paper also presents a generalized construction method to address the complexity of constructing canonical models for TML, which is original to the best of the authors' knowledge.
