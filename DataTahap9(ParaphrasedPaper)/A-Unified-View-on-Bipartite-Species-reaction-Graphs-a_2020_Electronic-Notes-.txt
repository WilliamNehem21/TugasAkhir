In contrast to the expansion of the determinant from gi, the representation of labels of g as a sum of products leads to a clear correspondence between species-line-graphs and expansion terms. Terms exhibit the same partial derivatives when their species-line-graphs possess identical substrate-reaction edges. This observation inspires the identification of compatible line-graphs in g and the determination of their collective impact on the expansion based on their stoichiometric labels.

For instance, in example 6.3, l1 and l2 are the only non-trivially compatible species-line-graphs. The concept of compatibility offers a method to assess whether det(j) equals zero by summing over each distinct compatibility class of l(g). If all classes are either non-negative or non-positive, the sign of the determinant becomes independent of the state x.

The introduction of a new compatible species-line-graph by lc results in a positive contribution that compensates for the negative. However, there may be another species-line-graph in the same class, also with a negative contribution, which contains a different negative cycle leading to the same compensating species-line-graph. Therefore, the dominating factor is that the compensating species-line-graph must overshadow the sum of all such contributions. Subsequently, we provide conditions under which such a scenario arises and offer a straightforward sufficient condition to exclude it.
