Lemma 3.5 is valid only if the legality hypotheses are satisfied. The theorem that follows, which asserts that the basis in a derivation accumulates minimal information about the premises required for typing, is essential for constructing a model based on a type assignment system.

Proposition 5.6 states that for objects x and y in coh, i being the set of all potential isomorphisms between x and y, and t being the set of all potential iso-coherent bijective maps between |x| and |y|, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between i and t.
