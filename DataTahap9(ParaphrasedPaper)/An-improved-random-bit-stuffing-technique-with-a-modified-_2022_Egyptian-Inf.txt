The recent advancements in network applications and the internet have underscored the critical role of data and network security in the development of data communication systems. Cryptography, as a powerful tool for ensuring data and network security, has become increasingly important. In the realm of cryptography, the randomization of encrypted data is essential for bolstering security and increasing the computational complexity of cryptographic algorithms. This research contributes encryption algorithms designed to enhance confidentiality and integrity, based on two key algorithms. Specifically, the research includes the RSA algorithm with a key length of 1024 bits, along with an enhanced bit insertion algorithm, to bolster the security of RSA against various attacks.

Over time, classical RSA has become susceptible to security threats despite increases in key lengths, which can be attributed to advancements in computing technology and hacking methods. To address these vulnerabilities, the study aims to enhance the security of RSA without resorting to increasing key lengths. The research introduces a modified RSA approach, termed RBMRSA, which incorporates a random bit-insertion algorithm to elevate the security strength of the RSA cryptosystem without necessitating an increase in key length. The proposed bit-insertion technique aims to address the weaknesses of classical RSA, resulting in a more complex ciphertext structure that resists decryption, thereby enhancing reliability and efficiency. The study also leverages the Fermat Little Theorem to evaluate the primality of the prime numbers required for key generation, as strong prime numbers are crucial for RSA security.

The study presents a framework that offers dual security for the RSA cryptosystem, and also introduces an enhanced scheme for the RSA cryptosystem that utilizes four large prime numbers, increasing computational and space complexity. Moreover, a parallel technique involving a new data structure is proposed to expedite the execution of the RSA cryptosystem. However, it is noted that this parallel technique does not address the security aspect of RSA.

Additionally, the research outlines the initial steps in the encryption process, involving the generation of public and secret keys. It is established that RBMRSA is resilient against known plaintext attacks, which are a vulnerability of conventional RSA.

A key metric for evaluating encryption algorithms is the avalanche effect, which measures the variation in ciphertext resulting from a slight change in plaintext. In this context, the research tests the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm by assessing the extent of change in ciphertext due to a minimal alteration in plaintext. Furthermore, the time complexity of the RBMRSA technique is found to be higher than that of classical RSA, predominantly due to increased execution time. The study also compares classical RSA with RBMRSA using mathematical proofs to evaluate security.

The development of RBMRSA as a new security approach to messaging is implemented using the Java programming language. The complexity measure of the algorithm aids in assessing its performance, revealing higher computational complexity and execution time for RBMRSA compared to RSA. Additionally, RBMRSA demonstrates a greater sensitivity to changes in plaintext, with an avalanche effect of 46% compared to 0.20% for RSA, indicating a higher security level. These findings highlight the tradeoff between security and execution time in encryption algorithms.
