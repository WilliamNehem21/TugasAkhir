In this paper, the authors discuss how a focused proof with assigned polarities for atoms can be transformed into another focused proof with the polarities of the atoms changed. This transformation allows for converting a proof obtained using one proof system into a proof using another system. Specifically, the authors introduce a procedure, involving the introduction of cuts, for transforming a focused proof where an atom is assigned positive polarity into another focused proof where the same atom is assigned negative polarity, and vice versa, within the intuitionistic focused system LJF restricted to Harrop formulas. They also demonstrate how to eliminate these cuts, revealing an interesting result: the process of eliminating a cut on a positive atom results in a proof with one smaller cut, whereas in the negative case, the number of introduced cuts grows exponentially. The paper concludes by showing how to use maximal multi-focusing to identify proofs in LJF, establishing a one-to-one translation between maximal proofs in LJF and proofs in the natural deduction system for intuitionistic logic NJ, restricted to Harrop formulas.

The authors note that positive connectives do not have invertible right rules, while negative connectives have invertible right introduction rules. They also explain that the polarity of a non-atomic formula is determined by the polarity of its outermost connective. Remarkably, atomic formulas can be arbitrarily assigned as positive or negative without impacting the completeness of the focusing discipline.

The paper highlights that the process of eliminating a cut on a positive atom results in a proof with one smaller cut, whereas in the negative case, the number of introduced cuts grows exponentially. The authors attribute this difference in the cut-elimination algorithm to the distinct evaluation strategies according to the Curry-Howard isomorphism, where cut-elimination corresponds to computation in a functional programming setting. They express their intention to further investigate this relationship in the future.

The authors also observe that chosen atoms can be considered negative or positive, and a formula is considered positive if its main connective is positive or if it is a positive atom, and negative if its main connective is negative or if it is a negative atom.

Additionally, the authors note that the transformations between proof systems may not preserve the size of a proof, and the size may increase exponentially. However, they argue that while this is relevant in some contexts, such as proof carrying code, it may not be as significant when unifying the library of results obtained with different proof systems.

Finally, the paper discusses a corresponding relationship between maximal proofs in MLJFH restricted to positive atoms and proofs in MLJFH restricted to negative atoms, which also establishes a one-to-one correspondence between MLJFH restricted to positive atoms and proofs in NJ restricted to Harrop formulas. The authors introduce a multi-focused system, MLJF, for the focused intuitionistic system LJF, and demonstrate how to use the notion of maximal proofs to identify proofs in intuitionistic logic. These results have also been established for the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic and for classical logic.
