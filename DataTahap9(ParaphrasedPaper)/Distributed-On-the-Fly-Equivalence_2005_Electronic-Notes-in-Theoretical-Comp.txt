The worker sends back the ack(stamp) message to the coordinator (lines 106-110). If a worker is currently working when it receives an ack(stamp) message, it disregards it. In this event, an act message from the worker must eventually reach the coordinator. Ultimately, the coordinator determines global termination upon receiving p ack(stamp) messages (i.e., nb ack= p, lines 162-178), and can then inform all workers of this termination detection by broadcasting the message "trm status=stop" (lines 129-135).
