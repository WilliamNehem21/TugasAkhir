Haloxylon Bunge plants are shrubs or small trees that thrive in sandy environments and belong to the flowering plant family Amaranthaceae (formerly Chenopodiaceae). There have been around 13 reported species of Haloxylon worldwide, with two species, H. persicum (white saxoul) and H. ammodendron (saxoul), found in the deserts of northwest China. These species are highly regarded for their ability to stabilize sand, mitigate wind erosion, and conserve water in desert ecosystems. In China, both species coexist, with H. persicum primarily growing on the tops of sand dunes and H. ammodendron being more widely distributed across various types of desert environments.

Genetic analyses using RAPD and ISSR markers have shown a high level of genetic diversity within and among natural populations of H. ammodendron in Xinjiang, China. Similarly, studies based on DNA ISSR markers have revealed genetic diversity and gene flow within and among populations of both H. ammodendron and H. persicum in the same region. Additionally, the ecological relationship between vegetation characteristics and pollen from H. ammodendron in the surface soil of the Junggar desert basin in Xinjiang was explored using the ITS1 region of nrdna. Furthermore, an analysis using ISSR primers showed no genetic differences between individual plants of H. ammodendron that were parasitized or non-parasitized by the desert plant Cistanche deserticola in the Alxa desert.

When comparing genetic markers, it was found that the transferability of SSR markers from other related genera to genus Haloxylon was relatively low, suggesting a significant genetic divergence between them. For example, the transferability of SSR markers from tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) to seven grass species was nearly 92%, whereas the transferability of SSR markers from other related genera to genus Haloxylon was only about 1.8%.

Overall, these findings shed light on the genetic diversity and ecological relationships of Haloxylon species, emphasizing their importance in desert ecosystems and highlighting the genetic divergence between Haloxylon and other related plant genera.
