When analyzing and designing concurrent systems, assuming fairness among processes can be beneficial. In action systems, a process is represented by a set of atomic actions, and typically these actions are combined using nondeterministic choice, which models minimal progress among processes rather than fairness. This paper introduces an operator for fair choice among a set of actions and presents a refinement rule for action systems with fair choice, demonstrating its application in the development of the alternating bit protocol. The novelty lies in the algebraic style used to define the fair choice operator and conduct formal reasoning, avoiding the need for operational understanding of fairness.

In contrast, the minimal progress assumption only ensures that either one makes progress. Fairness, on the other hand, expresses that each processor is working when two continuously enabled actions are executed on different processors, without quantifying the relative speed. Fairness also implies that each possible behavior of the environment, such as successful and failed transmission over a medium, is equally likely, without quantifying the probability. Fairness has become a common assumption in the analysis and development of concurrent systems, and programming theories involving fairness have been well developed.

This research focuses on the stepwise refinement of action systems with fair choice, defining an operator for fair choice among actions and representing an action system as a loop with a body composed of fair choice. The strong and weak iteration constructs are utilized for defining loops and fair choice, resulting in an algebraic treatment of fairness without the need for operational reasoning in terms of traces of executions. A theorem for the data refinement of action systems with fair choice is derived and applied to the development of the alternating bit protocol.

The paper discusses properties related to concrete and abstract senders and receivers when they are ready to transmit or receive, and presents a concrete invariant expressing expectations regarding the sender and receiver. The refinement is also described, highlighting the conditions and differences compared to previous work. Furthermore, potential implications of strong fairness and the challenges in dealing with an associative binary fair choice operator are addressed.

Overall, this paper contributes to the formal treatment of fairness and provides insights into the development of concurrent systems with fair choice. Furthermore, it opens up avenues for future research on addressing challenges related to fairness and binary fair choice operators.
