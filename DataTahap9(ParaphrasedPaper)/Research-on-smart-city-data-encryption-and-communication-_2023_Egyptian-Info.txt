In order to enhance the capability for processing data communication in the context of smart city development and to protect against potential coordinated attacks from internal communication participants, we conducted an investigation into the application of various technologies such as functional encryption, blockchain, and differential privacy. Our aim was to address issues related to privacy disclosure, collusion attacks, single point failures, and other challenges within the federated learning process. Furthermore, we integrated edge computing and asynchronous communication into the traditional federated learning framework to improve model communication efficiency without compromising accuracy. Our research findings revealed that the accuracy of the FE-BDP algorithm can be maintained at over 95% for an extended period, regardless of the number of users, demonstrating its robust stability. Additionally, the loss value of the FE-LDP model was significantly lower than that of other models, consistently stabilizing below 0.05. The data aggregation time of blockchain encryption technology was less than 1.0s, and the edge-asynchronous communication framework demonstrated effective data communication in various urban settings, with a maximum accuracy rate of 93.87% and the lowest communication cost of 1315.29s. These results indicate that the security encryption fusion technology effectively safeguards user data privacy, while the edge-asynchronous communication framework significantly improves communication efficiency, thereby holding considerable value for advancing smart city development.

Previously, personal and enterprise data stored in internet big data have raised concerns over data security. Traditional data encryption and communication techniques have been insufficient for effectively managing large-scale urban data, leading to the occurrence of data leaks. To address these challenges, a federated learning (FL) framework has been proposed to tackle privacy preservation issues and utilize multi-party data without compromising customer information. However, as urban data dimensions continue to expand, the encryption complexity of urban data increases, rendering traditional FL ineffective in efficiently preserving customer data. To address these limitations, we introduced differential privacy preservation technology within the FL framework to achieve smart city data encryption. The integration of blockchain technology was used to mitigate privacy data leakage issues caused by failures, and an edge asynchronous framework was implemented to facilitate effective data transmission and improve data communication productivity.

In the traditional FL algorithm, we replaced the traditional FL algorithm with a sparse differential gradient in order to reduce the communication and encryption costs of parameter transmission. We also introduced an incentive mechanism to aid in achieving a balance between accuracy and privacy preservation. Moreover, we implemented a strategy on the border server to control the number of customers participating in training and parameter upload, and introduced asynchronous communication mode between the cloud centrum server and the border server to improve convergence and communication efficiency.

In conclusion, our study proposed a data encryption technique under the FL framework that utilizes functional encryption and differential privacy preservation technology to prevent customer data leaks. Furthermore, the introduction of an edge asynchronous framework significantly improved communication productivity. Our findings demonstrated the feasibility of achieving data privacy preservation and improving communication productivity through the integration of these technologies. However, our study did not account for the ongoing growth of city data, thus in future research, we plan to develop an updated data encryption and communication productivity improvement technique to accommodate the evolving city data dimension.
