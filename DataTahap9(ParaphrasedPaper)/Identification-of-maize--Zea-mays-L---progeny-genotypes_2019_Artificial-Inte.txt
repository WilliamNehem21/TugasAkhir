This academic paper discusses a model for computing the posterior probability of a progeny's class label, based on the prior probability of the class label and the conditional probabilities of the attributes. The model is described as being discriminative, in contrast to generative logistic regression. The study also examines the performance of the model using accuracy and AUC value metrics. The paper then delves into the development of a population with specific traits through selection procedures, and discusses the homogeneity and prediction quality of different groups within the population. Additionally, it references prior research findings on the impact of selection on traits and the genetic control of maize leaf width.
