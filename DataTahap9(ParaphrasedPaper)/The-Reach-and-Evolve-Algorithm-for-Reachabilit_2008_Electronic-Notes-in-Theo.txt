This paper introduces a novel algorithm designed for the rigorous analysis of the reachability of nonlinear dynamical systems. Initially presented in the context of discrete time dynamical systems, the algorithm is then extended to continuous time dynamical systems driven by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where it is referred to as the "reach and evolve" algorithm. The approach is based on interval analysis and the rigorous discretization of space and time, and the paper demonstrates promising numerical experiments.

The paper presents a high-level algorithm for computing a rigorous enclosure of the reachable set for dynamical systems defined by arbitrary nonlinear continuous functions. In continuous time, the algorithm is referred to as the "reach and evolve" algorithm (R&E) due to its computation of reachability steps and evolution steps for the system. The algorithms are grounded in interval analysis, with the paper introducing this concept in section 2 and presenting the R&E algorithm and some of its properties in section 3. The paper concludes with the presentation of promising experiments in section 4.

To maintain the validity of interpretations when representing numbers using finite precision, an outer rounding method is employed. This method is commonly implemented in interval libraries to ensure the accuracy of computations.

The paper also includes a simple interval integrator based on a first-order Taylor expansion with a rigorous bound of the remainder, presented in the appendix. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a finite set of boxes representing the discretization of space, which necessitates careful consideration of computational costs.

The algorithm for systems in discrete time, referred to as the "discrete-time reach-evolve" algorithm, is introduced to address the zero-order errors introduced by the basic reachability algorithm. The paper discusses the computational expenses associated with evolving over the same part of state space and the potential complexity of the algorithm being proportional to the chosen parameter 'm.'

The paper touches upon the universe as a box and its relationship with the set of boxes 'b' used in the algorithm, as well as the post-processing required to reduce the number of boxes in the enclosure of the bounded reachable set.

Furthermore, the paper briefly compares the presented reach and evolve algorithm with the HSolver, which is dedicated to safety analysis for nonlinear hybrid systems. The limitations of the HSolver for reachability analysis of ODE-driven dynamical systems are highlighted, paving the way for the proposed algorithm.

The paper discusses the challenges of dealing with infinite time horizons within purely numerical algorithms and introduces the concept of "bounded reachable set," which enables the rigorous handling of infinite time horizons through the reach and evolve algorithm. The paper also suggests future work involving higher order Taylor expansions and the extension of the reach and evolve algorithm to hybrid systems.

Finally, the paper acknowledges the limitations of the crude enclosure process and discusses the initial step size chosen for the experiments.
