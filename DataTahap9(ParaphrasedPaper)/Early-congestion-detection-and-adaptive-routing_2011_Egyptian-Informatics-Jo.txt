Ad hoc mobile networks consist of mobile nodes that communicate through a wireless medium without a fixed backbone infrastructure. In these networks, congestion can occur at intermediate nodes as data packets travel from the source to the destination, resulting in high packet loss and long delays, thus degrading network performance. This paper introduces a novel approach called EDAPR (Early Congestion Detection and Adaptive Routing) for MANETs, which aims to mitigate congestion-related issues. EDAPR constructs a list of non-congested neighbor nodes (NHNs) and identifies routes through these nodes to the destination. The nodes on the primary path periodically assess their queue status, and using an early congestion detection technique, a node can identify potential congestion and notify NHNs. NHNs then proactively find alternate paths to the destination using an adaptive routing mechanism. The paper evaluates the performance of EDAPR compared to existing routing schemes using the NS-2 simulator and demonstrates significant improvements in reducing delay, routing overhead, and increasing packet delivery ratio without substantial additional cost.

Wireless technology enables users to access information and services from anywhere, and ad-hoc networks, such as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), facilitate communication among mobile users through wireless links. Congestion control is a crucial requirement for ad hoc networks to limit delay and buffer overflow resulting from network congestion and to improve overall performance. While congestion control in wired networks is typically implemented at the transport layer, the dynamic and mobile nature of ad hoc networks, which leads to significant packet loss, high delay, and low throughput, requires a different approach. Additionally, routing protocols, such as AODV and DSR, play a vital role in MANETs, and the paper discusses the challenges associated with maintaining consistent and up-to-date routing information in such networks.

The paper's focus is on addressing congestion as a primary cause of packet loss in MANETs. It emphasizes the need to integrate congestion control with adaptive routing protocols and explores the possibility of addressing congestion at the media access control (MAC) or network layer. The authors identify previous work that has proposed early congestion detection and control routing techniques and aim to build upon these concepts to develop the EDAPR routing protocol for MANETs. Their simulation results show that EDAPR achieves a higher packet delivery rate, reduced control packets, and decreased end-to-end delay compared to existing protocols.

The paper also highlights the importance of early congestion detection, which involves monitoring various metrics, such as packet discard percentage and average queue length, to proactively identify congestion at nodes. EDAPR is presented as a complete design with an in-depth evaluation, illustrating its ability to reduce network congestion and find non-congested paths between the source and destination in MANETs.

In the simulation setup, the authors used the IEEE 802.11 DCF in the MAC layer and a 2-ray ground reflection model for channel propagation. They also specified the buffer capacities at the MAC and network layers, the routing protocols used (EDAPR, EDAODV, and EDCSCAODV), the type and volume of data flow, the maximum node speed, and the simulation time.
