In general, frost refers to the formation of ice crystals on exposed surfaces, which can occur through the freezing of dew or the phase change from vapor to ice. The literature provides several definitions of the phenomenon. The study area covers the entire South America and part of the adjacent oceans, which includes regions with complex terrain. Operational forecasts with a spatial resolution of 15 km and 50 vertical levels were used for the study, with initial and lateral boundary conditions derived from the global forecast system (GFS). The ETA model was utilized to provide prognostic meteorological variables for training, evaluating, and testing the neural network.

The fourth stage of the study involved back propagation, wherein the network training took place through interactive adjustments of the weights based on the total error (mean squared error). This error was propagated back through the network, starting from the output layer, passing through the hidden layers to the input. The back propagation algorithm aimed to minimize the quadratic errors from the gradient descent calculation during the iterative process. A total of 504 experiments were conducted, using default hyperparameters for each optimizer: Adam with a learning rate and decay of 0.001 and 0.9, respectively, and SGD with a learning rate and momentum of 0.010 and 0.0, respectively.

The results were discussed in terms of determining the best artificial neural network (ANN) topology and hyperparameters for the two optimizers (Adam and SGD). The performance of the perceptron networks, along with the predictions of the ETA model, was evaluated. The inclusion of ETA in the evaluations aimed to assess how much the resulting ANNs could improve the performance of the regional model in predicting frost events.

Different studies may yield varied conclusions based on datasets, methodologies, and specific contexts. For instance, a study by Fuentes et al. (2018) on frost prediction with an MLP neural network found that increasing the number of neurons in the network improved performance. This suggests that in their specific dataset and context, a more complex approach with more neurons might be necessary for effective frost prediction. This disparity in results underscores the significance of ongoing research and careful consideration of specific conditions in which neural networks are applied. There may be nuances in neural network behavior that depend on data characteristics and prediction objectives. While this study favored a simpler approach, Fuentes et al.'s study highlights the need for flexibility in neural network design.

Overall, the study demonstrates that ANNs have the potential to mitigate the bias present in the ETA model, a finding also echoed in studies by Guarnieri et al. (2006), who used predictions generated by the ETA model as input for an MLP-type ANN to predict solar radiation. The study also highlighted that while ANNs provided higher values than ETA in terms of probability of detection (POD), the model showed a slight drop in the probability of detecting the event with an increase in forecast lead time. Additionally, the study demonstrated that ANNs managed to maintain low values of false alarm rate (FAR) despite increasing the POD values, indicating a potential improvement over ETA.
