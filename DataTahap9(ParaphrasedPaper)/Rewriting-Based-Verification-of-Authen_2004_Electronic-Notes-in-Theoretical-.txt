This paper presents a method for formally analyzing security protocols using rewriting. The approach involves modeling a security protocol as an observational transition system, which is represented in the cafeobj language. Proof scores demonstrating the safety properties of the protocol are then written in cafeobj and executed by the cafeobj system. The subsequent sections of the paper cover the overview of cafeobj, the modeling of observational transition systems, a description of the NSPK protocol, the modeling of the protocol in cafeobj, a partial proof of the protocol's safety property, related work, and conclusion.

The NSPK protocol, proposed by Needham and Schroeder in 1978, is an authentication protocol using public-key cryptosystems. Lowe identified a serious attack on the protocol 17 years later, leading to the proposal of a corrected version called the NSLPK protocol in the paper. The paper also introduces a model of the NSLPK protocol as an observational transition system, treating one of the participants as an intruder following the assumptions of the Dolev-Yao model. The specific actions and conditions of the intruder within the system are detailed, including its abilities to engage in illegal actions and record nonce values.
