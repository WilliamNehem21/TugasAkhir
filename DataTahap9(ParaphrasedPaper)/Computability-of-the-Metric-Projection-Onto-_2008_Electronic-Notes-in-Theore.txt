In this paper, the focus is on addressing closed and compact subsets of normed and metric spaces. The set of all closed subsets of a given metric space x is denoted as a(x), and the set of all compact subsets of x is denoted as k(x). The paper utilizes the representations for closed and compact subsets of metric spaces introduced and studied by Brattka and Presser. 

The paper discusses the relationship between the norm of a normed space x and the properties of its subsets. Specifically, it explores the concept of strict convexity in the norm of x. It is noted that the norm of a normed space x is strictly convex if and only if every nonempty closed convex subset of x is a set of uniqueness (reference [8], theorem 5.1.18). Moreover, if every nonempty closed convex subset of a normed space x is a set of existence, then x is reflexive. Additionally, the paper establishes that a normed space x is reflexive and has a strictly convex norm if and only if every nonempty closed convex subset is a Chebyshev set. The conclusion drawn is that every nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space x is a Chebyshev set, meaning that the metric projection onto it is a total and single-valued function.
