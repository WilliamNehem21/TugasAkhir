The method has been widely utilized for developing verification algorithms for various models, including petri nets, timed petri nets, broadcast protocols, and cache coherence protocols, since its initial application to lossy channel systems (refer to, for example, [8,10,11,12]).

The manipulation of upward closed sets can be transformed into operations that handle words, enabling us to avoid the use of complex tools like regular languages in performing reachability analysis. Consequently, this approach is more practical and efficient compared to automata-based methods such as regular model checking (see, for instance, [14,7,9]).

In this section, we introduce an abstraction that produces an over-approximation of the transition system. The abstract transition system is monotonic, allowing manipulation of upward closed sets. Specifically, we demonstrate that local and existential transitions are monotonic and do not require approximation; therefore, we only present an over-approximation for universal transitions.

During a broadcast transition, an initiator process triggers an arbitrary number of processes to change states simultaneously. In binary communication, two processes engage in a rendezvous and change states simultaneously.
