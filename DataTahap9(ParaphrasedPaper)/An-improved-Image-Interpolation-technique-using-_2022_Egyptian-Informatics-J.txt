To simplify the regression methods mentioned above, a new error-based interpolation method is proposed in this paper. This method utilizes the error between two sampling points in the edge-direction to interpolate missing pixels. However, this method alone cannot produce sharpened up-scaled images. To address this limitation, gradient details of a low-resolution image are incorporated during upscaling. Previous methods have also utilized gradient features of neighboring pixels and adjacent pixel slopes for proper reconstruction of high-resolution images. Other methods, such as reconstruction-based and graph-based interpolation, have been proposed to preserve detailed information and produce high-quality interpolated images. However, these methods fall short in restoring high-frequency degradation that occurs during interpolation. To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed in this paper, which emphasizes preserving edge and texture details to achieve higher image quality in interpolation.

Image interpolation involves determining unknown pixel values using known pixels on a grid. This process typically uses the weighted average of neighboring pixels to predict missing pixel values, leading to errors and artifacts such as blurring, ringing, and blocking in the interpolated image. To address these issues, a new interpolation method is needed to restore edge and texture details in high-resolution images while avoiding artifacts.

Blurring occurs during interpolation due to incorrect pixel value estimation at unknown locations. To mitigate this issue, the unsharp mask concept is applied prior to up-sampling, resulting in less blurring after upscaling. Additionally, a low-pass or smoothed version of the image is obtained using Gaussian filtering, denoted as GF, and is then applied over the low-resolution image using a Gaussian mask.

In the field of computer science, the "cuckoo search" concept is introduced, where each "nest" represents a solution and a "cuckoo egg" represents a new solution. The goal is to use new and potentially better solutions to replace suboptimal solutions in the nests, based on three fundamental rules.

The proposed interpolation method's performance is evaluated objectively using metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), and FSIM (Feature Structural Index Measurement). Different upscaling factors, such as 2 and 4, are used to assess the scheme's performance. PSNR, which measures the signal power relative to the noise power, is utilized to evaluate the successful restoration of the signal. Additionally, a reference to a relevant academic paper on single image super-resolution is provided for further context.
