The use of event-based communication in large-scale business information systems offers several advantages over synchronous communication methods like remote procedure calls (RPC), including high scalability, extendability, and asynchronous nature. Asynchronous communication allows components to send and forget messages, enabling them to continue execution without waiting for a response. The loose coupling of components achieved by the mediating middleware system also enhances system extensibility by facilitating the addition, removal, or substitution of components.

While performance modeling and prediction techniques for component-based systems can support architects in evaluating system architecture and design alternatives, existing general-purpose performance meta-models have limited support for modeling event-based communication. Additionally, specialized performance prediction techniques for event-based systems primarily focus on routing events rather than modeling interactions and message flows between communicating components. Our approach addresses this gap by enabling architecture-level modeling of event-based communication combined with platform-aware performance predictions, as detailed in our previous work.

To incorporate platform-specific aspects of event-based communication into the prediction model, we consider the Palladio Component Model (PCM) as a representative mature meta-model for component-based software architectures. PCM, initially lacking support for modeling event-based communication, can be enhanced to enable performance predictions through our approach. The introduced method facilitates the modeling of event-based communication at the architecture level while supporting existing prediction techniques such as simulation, LQNS, or QPNS, thereby providing flexibility to evaluate different design alternatives.

In our approach, a separate middleware repository is integrated into the final model, allowing for the analysis of different middleware systems' influence by selecting an alternative middleware repository. This enables the modeling of event-based communication at the architecture level using introduced metamodel elements while supporting all existing prediction techniques, enhancing the flexibility and modeling capabilities of the system.
