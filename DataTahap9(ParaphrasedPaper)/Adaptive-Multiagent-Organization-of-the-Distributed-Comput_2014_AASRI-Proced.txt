The primary challenge of utilizing personal computing resources in distributed computing systems is the potential variability of their parameters, such as processing power and network bandwidth, due to actions taken by their owners, such as running applications or downloading files. Additionally, the presence of diverse computing resources owned by different individuals within a single distributed computing system complicates the effective allocation of tasks.

An example of an initiative addressing this challenge is the SETI@home project, which leverages volunteers' computing resources to analyze signals from radio telescopes in search of extraterrestrial intelligence. However, it has been observed that SETI@home is limited in its ability to utilize personal computing resources as it focuses on tasks that are easily decomposable into non-coherent segments, thus simplifying load balancing and tolerating fluctuating characteristics of individual computing resources. Consequently, systems like SETI@home have restricted applicability, underscoring the need for the development of new methods and algorithms to enable the use of personal computing resources in distributed computing systems.

Taking the aforementioned considerations into account, the proposed approach allows agents within distributed computing systems to form communities to collaboratively address coherent tasks as they arise. The composition of these agent communities is contingent on their current performance, enabling them to adapt the computing process to the dynamic variations of computing resource parameters.

The primary objective of this research is to empirically validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, as well as to assess the relative loss of processor time on personal computing resources resulting from the decentralization of computing tasks. To achieve this, several series of experiments were conducted with varying parameters of computing resources and computer networks. These experiments utilized real tasks encountered at Southern Federal University.
