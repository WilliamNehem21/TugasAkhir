Zeno-behavior typically arises from the use of modeling abstractions to simplify the modeling of hybrid systems. For example, a bouncing ball can be represented using a simple model where the dynamics of the ball's bounce on the surface are abstracted as discrete events. However, in such a simplified model, an infinite number of bounces can occur in a finite amount of time, leading to zeno-behavior.

The study explores the indiscrete and discrete topologies in more detail and finds that for labeled transition systems with the indiscrete topology, (bi-)simulation and topological (bi-)simulation coincide under certain conditions. Similarly, for the discrete topology, the notions coincide when the state spaces are finite. The proofs for these findings are omitted.

When comparing different systems, sets of initial states i1 and i2 are often given. In such cases, we say that m1 is simulated by m2 if every initial state in i1 is simulated by an initial state in i2. The discussion in this article does not consider initial states.

The previous section demonstrates that the topological notions of simulation and bisimulation are stronger than their non-topological counterparts. An interesting question arises concerning whether there are topologies for which the notions coincide, which the study investigates for both the indiscrete and discrete topologies.

The study also shows that the assumption that the state spaces are structured by means of the discrete topology is not sufficient to conclude that the topological and non-topological notions coincide. Additionally, it reveals that for labeled transition systems with a finite state space and an arbitrary topology, the non-topological and topological notions do not coincide.

In another work, a reformulation of topological (bi-)simulation is presented that deals with higher-order accumulation points. This differs from the research presented in this paper, which replaces the concept of a run over natural numbers with the concept of a hybrid run over ordinal numbers.

The type of labeled transition systems considered in this paper is limited. In the broader literature, labeled transition systems not only have a transition relation but also employ one or more predicates on the state space to indicate, for example, initial and final states. Future research may address how to handle predicates on labeled transition systems in general.

In a separate study, bisimulation is characterized using a specific (Alexandroff) topology as continuity of the transition relation. The author demonstrates that the Alexandroff topology fits normal bisimulation. In contrast, the present work adapts the notion of bisimulation to account for the topological structure of the state space.
