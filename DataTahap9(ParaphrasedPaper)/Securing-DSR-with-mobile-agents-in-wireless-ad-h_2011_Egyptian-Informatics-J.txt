An ad hoc wireless network is a collection of wireless nodes that communicate with each other without a predefined infrastructure, forwarding packets to reach nodes that are not in direct radio transmission range. Securing ad hoc networks is particularly challenging due to their decentralized nature. The dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol is commonly used in wireless ad hoc networks, and mobile agent technology has potential applications in various network fields. In this paper, we aim to implement DSR using mobile agents to enhance the security of this type of wireless network. We use a hybrid encryption technique involving symmetric key encryption and public key encryption to improve performance, with symmetric keys used for encrypting routing data for authentication and authorization, and public keys used for exchanging symmetric keys between nodes. Our findings suggest that DSR can be secured using mobile agents without compromising performance.

Section 2 provides an overview of how DSR operates, while Section 3 offers a brief explanation of mobile agents. Section 4 outlines a new protocol that integrates mobile agents with DSR for securing ad hoc networks, and Section 5 presents a comparison between the new protocol and DSR. The paper concludes with Section 6, which addresses future work.

DSR comprises route discovery and route maintenance components, utilizing source routing, where the originating node includes in the packet header the nodes through which it should pass. Further details about route maintenance and route discovery are discussed in subsequent subsections.

To support our research, we developed a simulator similar to ns2, as the current release of ns-2 does not support mobile agents, which are essential for our protocol. We compared the results from our simulator with those from ns2 to validate our findings. Additionally, we enhanced DSR by incorporating mobile agents in the development of a new protocol to secure DSR.
