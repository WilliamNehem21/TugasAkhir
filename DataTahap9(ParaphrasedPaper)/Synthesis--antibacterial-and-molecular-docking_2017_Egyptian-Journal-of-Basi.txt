Novel analogs of benzimidazole fused heterocyclic compounds, including triazinane and oxadiazinanes, were prepared using classical amino methylation with various aryl N,N'-unsymmetrical thioureas. The antibacterial activity of these compounds was evaluated using the zone of inhibition by the well diffusion method against selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, demonstrating significant efficacy. Furthermore, molecular docking studies were conducted to assess the interaction of the synthesized molecules with two proteins, topoisomerase II (PDB ID: 1JIJ) and DNA gyrase subunit B (PDB ID: 1KZN), revealing high inhibition constants and binding energies consistent with their antibacterial activity.

Organic compounds with N-heterocyclic ring systems have been known to exhibit diverse biological activities by binding effectively to enzyme receptor sites. In the current global context, numerous new heterocyclic compounds, whether derived from natural sources or synthesized in laboratories, are introduced to the scientific literature annually. Many of these compounds have garnered attention from researchers due to their biological, therapeutic, and industrial potential.

1,3,5-Triazinane-4-thiones and 1,3,5-triazinane-2-ones have received limited attention in the literature despite their potential antimicrobial activity and significance as intermediates for the synthesis of biocidal and enantio-differentiating coupling reagents, such as tyrosine derivatives. The heterocyclic structural unit holds a prominent position among pharmaceutically important synthetic and natural materials, displaying potent antiproliferative effects. Consequently, 1,3,5-triazinane derivatives incorporating thiourea units hold promise across various fields.

The melting points of the synthesized compounds were determined using open capillary tubes, and reaction progress was monitored using TLC plates. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 300 MHz instrument in DMSO/CDCl3 with TMS as the internal standard, and chemical shifts (Î´) were expressed in ppm. IR spectra were obtained using a Perkin Elmer BX Series FT-IR, and elemental analysis was carried out using a PerkinElmer 240 CHN analyzer (Scheme 1).
