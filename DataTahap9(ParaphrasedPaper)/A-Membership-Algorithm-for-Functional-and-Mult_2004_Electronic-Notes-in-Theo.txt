Over the years, there has been a growing recognition of the necessity to store data in non-relational structures. This has led to the introduction of various new data models, such as semantic data models, nested relational models, object-oriented models, and object-relational models. This paper addresses the challenge of unifying these diverse data models through an abstract approach based on nested attributes and subtyping. The approach draws inspiration from the success of relational dependency theory and aims to extend these achievements to complex object types.

The paper formally demonstrates that the proposed algorithm works accurately and within polynomial time. It also highlights the natural fit of the algebraic approach based on nested attributes within the context of complex object databases. The nesting of attributes can be readily extended to sets, multisets, unions, references, and other types, thereby offering a potential unifying framework for the foundation of dependency theory in advanced data models.

The paper introduces a data model based on nested attributes and subtyping, aiming to provide a unified basis for the examination of complex object types such as records and lists. It emphasizes the significance of derivations not using the Brouwerian-complement rule, particularly in the context of relational dependency theory, pointing to the possibility of deciding in polynomial time whether a given functional dependency or multivalued dependency can be derived without using the complementation rule.

The paper outlines potential future research directions, including the exploration of richer type systems incorporating sets, multisets, unions, and references, with a focus on rational trees. It also discusses the implications of finite set types on functional dependencies and multivalued dependencies, highlighting the need for more sophisticated inference rules in their presence.
