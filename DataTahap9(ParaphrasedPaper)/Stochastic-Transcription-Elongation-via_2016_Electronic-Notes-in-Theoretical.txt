This article explores the effectiveness of stochastic rule-based modeling in capturing complex molecular interactions that occur in multiple stages. Biochemical interactions are characterized by stochastic fluctuations, nonpoisson time dynamics, and decay of specific biological events due to their non-uniformity and varying rates. The study focuses on modeling transcription, a molecular multi-step interaction, as it involves a small proportion of molecules participating in cellular reactions during the first phase of gene expression. Therefore, a rule-based stochastic approach is preferred over the deterministic mass action laws for modeling transcription. This approach directly depicts the stochastic and discrete nature of chemical reactions in transcriptional elongation, where the primary agents are the base pairs within a gene and nucleoside triphosphates that join the transcript via RNA polymerase. The author also applies nucleotide-based modeling to multiple branching processes in RNA interference.

Elongation, which involves the addition of a nucleotide to the 3' end of the nascent RNA, is catalyzed by the active site of RNA polymerase (RNAP). Following polymerization, the transcription elongation complex (TEC) promptly enters the pre-translocation state, moving forward along the DNA template until the active site is appropriately positioned for the next nucleotide addition.

Transcriptional pausing, which disrupts the forward polymerization of the RNA transcript, is primarily caused by backtrack, where the active site of RNAP moves backward along the DNA template and RNA transcript without depolymerizing the transcript. The forward-track movement, also known as hyper-translocation, extends the RNA chain towards the 5' end of the template DNA. In the pre-translocation state, the line connecting the nucleotide (N) and the pre-elongated nucleotide (N-OH) signifies a phosphate bond between the R and L sites of N and N-OH, indicating that the R site of N is not bound.
