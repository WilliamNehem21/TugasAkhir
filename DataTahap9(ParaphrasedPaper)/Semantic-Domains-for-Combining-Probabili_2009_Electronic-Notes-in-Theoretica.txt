This academic paper presents models based on domain theory that support both probabilistic and nondeterministic choice in a programming language. The ad hoc semantics developed for a simple imperative language with these operators over a discrete state space using domain-theoretic tools is extended to general continuous domains. The new models incorporate recent results on the extended probabilistic powerdomain and its applicability to infinite discrete spaces. The paper also introduces terminological changes for powerdomains and outlines the focus on continuous d-cones, their properties, and their applications to probabilistic features in programming languages.

The paper discusses the introduction of hoare, smyth, and plotkin style constructions for continuous d-cones, as well as their relations to topological spaces. It further explores the characterization of continuous d-cones and their dual cones, and the properties of valuations and measures within this context. Additionally, the paper presents results on the relation between continuous valuations and classical measures in the context of the spaces under consideration. The paper also investigates the properties of lower semicontinuous functions and the dual d-cone, as well as the extension of continuous valuations to Borel measures.

In the realm of continuous d-cones, the paper presents results on the preservation of the way below relation between simple valuations and the way-below relation on the continuous d-cone. Furthermore, the paper identifies the conditions under which the dual cone of a continuous d-cone is continuous. The paper also explores specific characterizations of continuous d-cones that yield a continuous dual cone.

Moreover, the paper discusses the topological characterization of the convex powerdomain for lawson-compact continuous domains and presents modifications to this characterization to accommodate d-cones. The paper further introduces and examines the properties of biconvex powercones and their construction in the context of continuous d-cones. The denotation of non-deterministic choice is also explored in the paper within the framework of powercones.

Overall, the paper spans a wide range of topics related to domain theory and its application to probabilistic and nondeterministic features in programming languages, providing theoretical foundations and practical implications.
