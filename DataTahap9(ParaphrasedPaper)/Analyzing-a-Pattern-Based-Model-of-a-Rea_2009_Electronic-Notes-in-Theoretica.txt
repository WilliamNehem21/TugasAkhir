In this section, we provide a brief overview of the save component modeling language, which forms part of a larger framework known as saveccm. The saveccm language comprises a graphical syntax and associated formal semantics. Due to space constraints, we can only present a concise informal summary of saveccm in this section. For a comprehensive understanding of the language, we direct the reader to the complete description elsewhere.

The execution of a PFSM begins in the special control state "start." At any given state, an outgoing transition can only be executed if its associated guard evaluates to true, in which case the transition is considered enabled. If multiple outgoing transitions are enabled, one of them can be executed non-deterministically. A filled circle represents the start control state, while a semi-filled circle represents the exit control state.

In the run-to-completion (RTC) execution model, a component executes in indivisible steps without interruption from any concurrent activity. The main advantages of the RTC semantics are simplicity and the guaranteed absence of deadlocks. Additionally, this model has the potential to eliminate unnecessary interleavings, thus expediting formal verification and bringing the model closer to implementation. The RTC pattern is commonly utilized in high-level behavioral modeling languages such as statecharts and their variants. In statecharts, events are handled in an RTC manner, along with possibly compound transitions (i.e., paths of adjacent arrows).

Execution history is a fundamental feature of behavior modeling techniques. The history mechanism of a behavior remembers the most recently visited state during execution before exiting, and this state can be re-entered when the execution restarts. In hierarchical state-machine modeling within statecharts, an inner state can be exited and re-entered directly using the history mechanism. A similar approach is adopted in Charon, a formal modeling framework for hybrid systems.

The pattern is implemented as a TA by using an integer variable "h," which is updated along each edge connecting any states other than the start and exit states with the corresponding location identifier. Special edges connect the start state to each state of interest while appropriately testing the variable "h." In addition, exit edges connect each state of interest to the exit control state. The variable "h" can be re-initialized appropriately when entering a specified final location.

For embedded and real-time systems, it is often important to specify and analyze the best or worst execution time of components. The variation in execution time also leads to non-deterministic timing, jitter, and varying end-to-end timing, which are crucial phenomena to analyze and master at design time. In the following section, we introduce a pattern for specifying the best and worst execution times of components.

In this pattern, we assume that the total accumulated execution time of a component falls within an interval defined by the shortest and longest possible execution times as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. Consequently, the component will produce output (data and trigger) at some point within this interval. We also assume that the component is annotated with an interval specifying the lower and upper bounds on the execution time. To implement this pattern, we introduce a dedicated clock, referred to as "exec," which measures the time since the component was triggered. This clock is reset on the edge outgoing from the "start" location. Additionally, we introduce a location called "delay" and an edge from "delay" to the exit location. The "delay" location is annotated with an invariant over "exec" corresponding to the upper bound of the execution interval, while the exit edge is decorated with a guard corresponding to the lower execution bound.

Drilling and testing are crucial operations in the production cell, as the primary objective is to drill verified products that pass through the cell. All slots of the rotary disc may be occupied simultaneously, and products are processed in parallel. Once a cycle completes, indicating that all positions have completed their functionality, the rotary disc rotates 90 degrees to position the products for the next phase of processing. Since the rotation is triggered by non-deterministic signals from tools, there is no fixed period between rotations of the slots.

The tester, a sensor called "stesterdown," measures the hole within 2 time units since the start of the test process. When triggered, the component checks the status of the slot at position 2. If it is empty, the component does nothing; otherwise, it measures the hole drilled in the product and updates the status based on its assessment.

The "testtool" functions similarly to the drill, moving down upon command from an actuator until a sensor is activated, and then moving up again upon command from a different actuator until the corresponding sensor is activated. The disc is also modeled with two states, "wait" and "turning." The transition from "wait" to "turning," initiated by the actuator "arotate," clears the sensor value "scompleted" and resets a clock to ensure the transition back to the "wait" state within "turn time" units, provided that the sensor value "scompleted" is also set.

The "Statemate" toolkit is an early working environment for the development of complex reactive systems. Modularity in system development is provided through different views such as structure, functionality, and behavior. Our approach for specifying the behavior of components (modules in Statemate) is similar to statecharts, the behavioral language of Statemate. Although not hierarchical, our FSM notation for component behaviors, combined with the patterns proposed in this paper, shares similarities with statechart features such as run-to-completion and execution history.
