An investigation of bug databases indicates that certain software components are more prone to failures than others, but identifying universally shared characteristics of failure-prone components is challenging. By examining the Eclipse bug and version databases, we have linked failures to specific Eclipse components and created a dataset that outlines the defect density of each component. This dataset may aid in identifying characteristics that can predict a component's likelihood of having defects.

Our analysis has revealed that the best predictor for defect density is the problem domain. This conclusion is based on the observation that certain problem domains are more susceptible to failures than others. For example, in the Eclipse code base, working on compiler internals is more challenging and error-prone compared to developing user interfaces, irrespective of the developer, programming language, or code complexity.

In general, software defects related to the use of other components often arise from violating the constraints of these components. For instance, the internal data structures of a compiler, such as the abstract syntax tree, have numerous constraints that reflect the syntactic and semantic properties of the programming language.

Determining implicit constraints involves analyzing components to identify valid usages and evaluating the normal usages of their users. Identifying suitable abstractions to differentiate between valid and invalid, as well as normal and abnormal, usages is necessary. Furthermore, finding appropriate measures to determine which constraints are easily violated and which are not, and assessing whether these measures effectively predict the defect-proneness of a module, is essential.
