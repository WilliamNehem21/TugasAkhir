Endophytes have been investigated for a wide range of uses due to their ability to produce extracellular enzymes. These enzymes play a role in obtaining nutrients from their host, breaking down food substances, and triggering defense mechanisms against pathogens. There is a crucial demand for the discovery and application of new enzymes with strong stability for industrial purposes. This study aims to investigate the variety of endophytic fungal communities and their capacity to generate extracellular enzymes in specific plants.
