Usage control expands upon access control by addressing data handling post-release, including future distribution and policy evolution upon redistribution. We propose a role-based redistribution model for usage control that encompasses strengthening both rights and duties. This model introduces orderings for events and parameter values, showing how both rights and duties can be strengthened through the traditional abstraction of trace inclusion. In this context, we consider events in the Z language, defining basic types for event names, parameter names, and parameter values.

When considering rights in usage control, it is initially assumed that a subject can only strengthen policies upon redistributing a data item. We focus on rights for now, akin to access control, and consider duties separately. We argue that, in formal terms, rights can only be decreased upon redistribution; the set of traces that satisfy the original policy must become smaller, or the formula representing the new policy must imply the old policy.

For instance, considering an event named "play" with a parameter for video quality, where video quality ranges from 0 to 100, we provide an example event and corresponding policy. We then discuss the asymmetry in restricting rights, pointing out that decreasing rights can also mean increasing the lower bound, restricting consumer freedom. Furthermore, we outline different roles and their associated permissions to play, back up, edit, and redistribute a movie.

We also acknowledge related work on delegation policies and models, noting that while other authors have discussed delegation problems in distributed systems, they have focused more on outlining issues rather than providing general solutions. Notably, existing solutions tend to be highly application-specific.
