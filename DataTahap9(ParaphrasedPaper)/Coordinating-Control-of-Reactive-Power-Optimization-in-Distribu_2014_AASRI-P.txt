The future of the power industry lies in distributed generation, with wind energy emerging as the predominant clean and renewable energy source. The integration of distributed wind turbines (WT) into the grid as decentralized power supplies has resulted in notable effects on the distribution of power flow, voltage levels, and transmission losses within the system.
