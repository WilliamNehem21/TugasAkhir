Circular-arc graphs are a broader category than interval graphs. One notable distinction between the two is that interval graphs have a linear number of maximal cliques relative to the number of vertices, while circular-arc graphs may have an exponential number of maximal cliques. This difference may explain why certain problems are more challenging for circular-arc graphs compared to interval graphs. For example, vertex-coloring is a polynomial problem for interval graphs, but becomes NP-hard for circular-arc graphs.

It is essential to include condition (ii) in Definition 2.2 to avoid potential conflicts in edge-colorings that could arise from the pullbacks f1,..., ft. Furthermore, the definition assumes that the sets of the partition {e1,..., et} are disjoint, but it does not assume disjointness among the domains of the functions in f, which represent sets of vertices rather than edges. Therefore, a single vertex u can be proven (ii). If only one set i from {yab, yac, ybc} contains vertices of maximum degree in g, then it is certain that i /= ybc due to the assumption on the cardinality of xa. If i = yab, then the semi-core of g forms an indifference graph, as the order yb, ybc, yab, yac, ya constitutes an indifference order. The case i=yac follows suit.
