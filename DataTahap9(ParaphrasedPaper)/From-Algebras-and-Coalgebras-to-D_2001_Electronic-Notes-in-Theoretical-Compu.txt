The academic paper notes that the binary methods, commonly discussed in theoretical computer science literature on object-oriented programming, are involved in example 3.9. While some properties of coalgebras do not hold for all dialgebras, they do hold for all dialgebras lacking binary methods. This observation is significant in the context of coalgebraic specification, which has been utilized as the foundation for the experimental specification language CCSL. The paper introduces the notion of dialgebraic specification and emphasizes that the closure properties of coalgebras are noteworthy, particularly in relation to invariants and bisimulations. It also raises the question of whether there are analogous properties of algebras that do not hold for arbitrary dialgebras, expressing the idea that careful analysis of the dual properties of algebras might reveal such distinctions. The paper highlights the intricate relationship between algebras and coalgebras and hints at potential dual properties of algebras that have not been encountered in the context of arbitrary dialgebras.
