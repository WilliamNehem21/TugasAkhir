Each transportation network comprises distinct lines tailored for specific modes of transport, such as the rail grid in a metro system, which is composed of a finite series of discrete waypoints linked by tracks. These tracks signify the potential for vehicle movement between waypoints, without any additional characteristics such as length, curvature, or slope. Consequently, each pair of waypoints can be connected by a maximum of two tracks, one in each direction, while simultaneously accommodating at most one vehicle at a particular waypoint. Conflicting vehicle movements may arise when multiple vehicles attempt to access the same waypoint simultaneously.

The transport grid for the orbital line of a people mover is illustrated, depicting the various routes a vehicle can take between waypoints using tracks. Conflicts could arise if two vehicles attempt to access the same waypoint at the same time. In such cases, vehicles taking tracks with lower integer numbers are given priority.

The station features two GPS and three corridors, with one entrance area accommodating up to 50 passengers and a platform accommodating up to 200 passengers. Passengers at the entrance area can transfer to the platform via a connecting corridor. The interpretation of the remaining corridors relies on the station's context and its interface specification with transportation grids.

This paper has presented a continuous-time stochastic hybrid automaton model and its discrete time approximation for predicting passenger loads in multimodal transportation networks. All passengers are grouped into specific trip profiles that guide continuous passenger flows, while vehicles are either parked or engaged in missions with predetermined travel times between consecutive waypoints. Uncertainty is introduced into the model through initial passenger loads at stations and the estimation of passengers initiating trips.
