There is a global increase in the demand for entrepreneurship training due to the inability of governments to provide jobs for everyone, leading people to seek ways to create their own jobs and wealth. As a result, entrepreneurship education has become essential to address rising unemployment and poverty, prompting educational institutions and governments to emphasize problem-solving skills and critical thinking in their curriculum. Technology, including online learning tools, is considered crucial in promoting entrepreneurship education.

In 1998, Japan enacted a program to encourage students to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors while in school. This paper aims to predict the adaptability of students in online entrepreneurship courses and recommend ways to enhance their adaptation. It reviews previous research in online education and uses educational datasets to propose a stacking ensemble learning approach for prediction. Several studies are referenced to support the development and evaluation of predictive models for e-learning performance.

The paper also discusses the handling of missing data through imputation techniques and emphasizes the importance of selecting representative donors to minimize bias in the imputed values. Furthermore, it addresses the detection and treatment of outliers to ensure robust and reliable adaptability predictions.

The study examines various factors influencing adaptability in online entrepreneurship education, such as learning behaviors, self-efficacy, and motivation, and proposes the use of Bayesian networks to analyze their interactions. Additionally, it discusses the use of ensemble models, such as stacking, to improve the generalization and robustness of adaptability forecasts for online entrepreneurship students.

The results of the study indicate that while students were generally satisfied with the course, those in a classroom setting felt they performed better than those in the online course. The discrepancy is attributed in part to the educational techniques used in the online course. The study suggests that the use of technology in entrepreneurship education should be further explored, with future work focusing on the development of a mobile platform to support startups.

Overall, the paper underscores the importance of entrepreneurship education and technology in addressing global employment challenges and highlights the need for further research in this field.
