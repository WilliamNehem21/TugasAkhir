Over the past two decades, self-driving cars have become increasingly significant in research, with the expectation that they will replace human drivers in various tasks. The development of autonomous vehicles has been a key focus in automotive research due to the growing traffic issues worldwide. The aim is to improve road safety and driving comfort by relieving drivers of partial or complete control, which is expected to reduce collisions and enhance safety.

Passive methods for measuring distance rely on receiving information about an object's position, often using cameras and computer vision techniques. Two types of passive systems exist: mono vision systems and stereo vision systems. The latter utilizes stereoscopic ranging techniques to calculate distance, employing two cameras to create a depth effect and compute distance accurately using disparities between objects.

A study by Salman et al. presented a distance estimation method based on stereoscopic measurement. When multiple objects are present, it is necessary to define the location of the same object in both images before measuring their distances. This requires object detection and stereo matching algorithms, which can be time-consuming. However, the main idea presented in the paper is to detect vehicles using a single camera and then match them with the same vehicles captured by the other camera, streamlining the process.

The paper introduces a real-time distance measurement method for self-driven systems using stereo cameras, which are two cameras mounted horizontally and displaced vertically. The method involves vehicle detection, hypothesis generation, hypothesis verification, and distance measurement using geometric angles. Despite its relative simplicity, the method accurately measures distance, as evidenced by a comparison with other methods from the literature. The proposed method has potential applications in various systems, including computing safety distances between vehicles, measuring vehicle speed, and determining object distances with different detection algorithms.
