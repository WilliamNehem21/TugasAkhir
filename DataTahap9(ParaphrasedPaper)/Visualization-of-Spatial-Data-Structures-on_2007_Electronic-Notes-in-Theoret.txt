Spatial data structures are utilized for handling location data, and their visualization presents unique challenges compared to visualizing one-dimensional data. The visualization of such structures can be depicted using various visual metaphors, which can be classified into different levels of abstraction based on the purpose of the visualization. This paper proposes a categorization of data structure visualization into four levels of abstraction and demonstrates how these abstractions can be incorporated into the visualization of spatial data structures.

Spatial data structures store spatial data, which refers to the positioning of entities in any space. They are widely used in computer science domains such as geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, computer graphics, and virtual reality. While these structures are based on conventional non-spatial data structures like arrays, lists, and trees, their complexity arises from the multidimensionality of the data. The lack of a comprehensive textbook on this topic has led to challenges in algorithm development for spatial data structures.

Spatial data and algorithms play a crucial role in geoinformatics, where information technology is applied to cartography and geosciences. Graphics, such as maps and diagrams, are commonly employed for visualization in this field. The visualization of spatial data structures, particularly in the context of algorithm visualization (AV), is extensively utilized for educational purposes, leading to the development of numerous systems for teaching.

The paper introduces different levels of abstraction for visualizing data structures, and explores their application in visualizing spatial data structures. It also discusses the use of these visualizations for teaching spatial data algorithms. The visualization perspective encompasses basic structure, data structure, and application levels of abstraction, each with its distinctive attributes and purposes in visualizing the underlying data.

In software visualization, illustrating the organization of related data items, whether abstract or not, is a key focus. Basic structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs, serve as building blocks for creating different data structures. These structures can be visualized using canonical views defined in terms of basic structures. Alternate visualizations are particularly useful for multidimensional data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships among different data points.

At the application level of abstraction, visual metaphors are used to represent relevant data items, catering to specific applications that utilize graphics for data illustration. Visual techniques and tools developed for software visualization can be leveraged in other disciplines, such as geoinformatics, where underlying data structures and their visual counterparts share fundamental similarities.

The visualization model from the previous sections is applied to spatial data algorithms, with a specific focus on a common geoinformatics problem, map overlay. Different visualization techniques at varying levels of abstraction are explored to illustrate how spatial data algorithms can be visualized effectively. Application level visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the problem and are particularly useful for specialists in geoscience and cartographic fields, although they may omit specific details of the data structures used.

In conclusion, the paper highlights the challenges and potential solutions for visualizing spatial data structures and algorithms, showcasing the importance of incorporating different levels of abstraction in the visualization process to effectively convey the complexities of multidimensional data. Furthermore, it underscores the relevance of visualization techniques in teaching and applied domains such as geoinformatics.
