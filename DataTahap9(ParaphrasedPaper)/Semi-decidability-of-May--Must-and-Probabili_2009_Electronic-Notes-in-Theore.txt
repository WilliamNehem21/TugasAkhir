In this academic paper, the authors demonstrate that in a broad setting that encompasses higher-types, the terms "may", "must", and probabilistic testing are semi-decidable. It is noteworthy that the semi-decidability of "must" testing is surprising given its mathematical definition, which involves universally quantifying over an infinite set of potential outcomes of a non-deterministic program. The other two types of testing involve existential quantification and integration. The study also takes initial steps towards establishing the semi-decidability of similar tests in the simultaneous presence of non-deterministic and probabilistic choice.

The paper examines a non-deterministic higher-type language resembling PCF, incorporating angelic, demonic, and probabilistic choice. Types in this language are closed under finite products, function spaces, and certain powertype constructors, interpreted as powerdomain monads capturing various forms of non-determinism. Choices can only be made at powertypes, and each powertype has distinct operational interpretations of choice.

The authors demonstrate that the concepts of "may", "must", and probabilistic testing are semi-decidable for this language, reasoning that given a semi-decidable property U, one can semi-decide whether a non-deterministic program (i) has some outcome satisfying U, (ii) has all outcomes satisfying U, and (iii) has all outcomes satisfying U with a probability greater than a given threshold. The proofs draw on recent findings on exhaustible sets in higher-type computation and earlier results on the exact computability and definability of integrals in PCF-like languages.

Furthermore, the study explores initial steps toward establishing the semi-decidability of similar tests under the simultaneous presence of probabilistic and non-deterministic choice. While semi-decision procedures for this scenario are developed, their correctness remains a conjecture and their scope is open.

The paper sets out a language with a type system that explicitly distinguishes between deterministic and various forms of non-deterministic types. Terms of deterministic type produce only one outcome, including the possibility of divergence, while terms of non-deterministic type may produce one or more runs, potentially a continuum of runs, each of which may yield a single outcome, including the possibility of divergence. The ground types are deterministic, and the product and function-type constructions preserve determinism.

The authors reduce the tasks of "may", "must", and probabilistic testing in MMP to quantification and integration in PCF+S+I. Ultimately, the quantifications and integrations are reduced to quantifications and uniform integrations over the Cantor space. The study offers motivations for this reduction, anticipating the denotational semantics detailed later in the paper.

The paper discusses translating the scheduler into two schedulers and passing each one to a different subcomputation. Although the monad laws for the translations fail in the target language, they hold modulo the appropriate notion of testing. The strength is translated in a similar, mechanical manner.

For the Hoare powerdomain, the abstract description given in one section aligns with the concrete one detailed in another section. However, for the Smyth, Plotkin, and probabilistic powerdomains, the two descriptions align only for continuous domains. The study notes that not all continuous domains are closed under function spaces and the Plotkin powerdomain, and there is no known Cartesian closed category of continuous domains closed under the probabilistic powerdomain. Consequently, not all types of the language are expected to have continuous interpretations unless further progress is made in domain theory.

The authors point out that these and similar issues led to the proposal of an alternative form of domain theory called topological domain theory, which aims to overcome obstacles in semantics. While the paper plans to explore the potential use of topological domain theory to address these problems, it currently establishes very general, albeit partial, results using classical domain theory.

The paper includes a proof that the ground types are continuous Scott domains, which are rsfp domains. Plotkin has demonstrated that the category rsfp is Cartesian closed and closed under the Plotkin powerdomain. Scott has shown that the continuous Scott domains are densely injective spaces, and the densely injective spaces form an exponential ideal. Schalk has shown that the continuous dcpos are closed under the Hoare and Smyth powerdomains, and it is immediate that they are bounded complete. Jones has demonstrated that the continuous domains are closed under the probabilistic powerdomain.

The study also discusses powerdomains that simultaneously account for probability and non-determinism, following the ideas of previous work. A notable difference is that the reference considered in this paper deals with non-negative real-valued valuations rather than unit-interval valued valuations with a total mass of 1. The correctness of the semi-decision procedures discussed in the paper would require a theory based on the latter.
