The paper discusses research topics that have gained attention in the past two decades in the field of mathematical optimization of multiple objective functions. It outlines advancements in algorithm development and the specific sub-fields, providing selected references for further reading. The survey also covers publicly available solvers and approaches for new problem classes such as non-convex and mixed integer problems, as well as the handling of uncertainties by robust approaches and their relation to set optimization. Additionally, it discusses the increasing interest in numerical methods that do not use scalarization techniques.

Multiobjective optimization, the optimization of multiple objectives simultaneously, has been an active area of research since the early works of Edgeworth and Pareto. The field has seen substantial development and numerous valuable books on more specific topics in vector optimization have been published. The paper also highlights the progress in evolutionary approaches and the significance of recent Dagstuhl meetings that bring together experts from multicriteria decision making, multiobjective optimization, and evolutionary algorithms.

The survey delves into the discussion of non-convex problems, the use of solvers freely available for specific classes of problems, and the increasing interest in numerical methods without scalarizations. The paper also touches on decision space search algorithms and developments in the field of bilevel optimization problems, robust optimization, and uncertainty handling.
