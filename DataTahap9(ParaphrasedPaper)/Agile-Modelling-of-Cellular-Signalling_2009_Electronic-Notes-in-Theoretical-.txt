Simplified as it may seem, this cascade system already produces approximately 600 different species, which would be laborious to specify using traditional reaction-based methods, and even more challenging to modify. The key advantage of the approach we propose is to avoid the exponential increase in complexity associated with traditional methods. Another more intricate example that illustrates this point can be found in the reference cited.

In the Kappa system, the representation of a system involves a collection of agents and rules. An agent encompasses a set of sites, which can have internal states, commonly used to indicate processes such as phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications, and can also bind to other sites to represent complex formation. Rules define conditions for agent association, dissociation, or modification, as well as agent deletion or creation. This idealized system allows for modeling a significant portion of the interactions involved in cellular signaling.

In the textual notation used here, internal states are denoted as subscripts (e.g., u for unphosphorylated and p for phosphorylated) attached to the sites, while bonds are depicted as shared superscripts across agents to indicate the two endpoints of a link. A double arrow represents a reversible rule. The left-hand side of a rule specifies the condition that triggers the rule, while the right-hand side specifies changes to the agents mentioned on the left. For example, the second reaction indicates that when the kinase is bound to its target at x, this site may become phosphorylated.

How does a rule-based approach compare in terms of flexibility? As previously mentioned, the model we have considered generates around 600 species (methods to count the number of reachable complexes have been developed in the cited reference). A differential model, if required to account for all combinations, would be quite large because such models only account for reactions between structure-less entities. Therefore, a variation like the one we performed would likely be very tedious, and in fact, quickly impractical for larger examples. On the other hand, if the model did not consider all possibilities, it would be even more difficult to modify, as it would be uncertain if what was significant before the variation remains so afterward, necessitating further guesswork. Notations based on process algebra record the behavior of each agent within the agent itself (hence referred to as process-centric), which also makes the type of variation described above less straightforward, and the tedium of enumerating internal states remains a challenge.
