Boolean networks are discrete dynamical systems commonly used for modeling biological regulatory networks. However, analyzing the dynamics of these networks is difficult due to the exponential growth of the state space with the number of components. To tackle this challenge, a common approach is to infer information about the network dynamics from its interaction graph, which contains only n vertices. This paper focuses on the influence of positive and negative feedback in this context.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the main definitions, Section 3 discusses the major results extracting dynamical properties from the interaction graph, and Section 4 discusses state-of-the-art approaches and other static analysis techniques for Boolean networks.

The concept of interaction graphs is inherent to Boolean networks, representing qualitative interactions between components as a directed graph with [n] as the vertex set. Positive and negative interactions are considered, where an arc from j to i indicates that the evolution of the ith component depends on the evolution of the jth one.

It is shown that by considering attractors, information about the dynamical properties of the network can be derived. The paper also presents a theorem demonstrating that the removal of certain components does not significantly affect the dynamical properties of the network.

While this paper specifically focuses on Boolean networks and global interaction graphs, it is noted that the presented analysis can be extended to other biological regulatory network modeling frameworks. However, the extension to discrete networks is challenging and may require constraints on logical expressions. Additionally, the paper highlights the need for innovative static analysis techniques for quantifying dynamical properties within hybrid models that incorporate time or stochastic features.
