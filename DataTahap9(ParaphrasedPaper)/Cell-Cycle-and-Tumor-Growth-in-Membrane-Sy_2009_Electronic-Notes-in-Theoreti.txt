In the field of membrane systems, which are also known as P systems, it is common to represent a biological membrane using a pair of square brackets, as in the notation [ u ]v, where u and v are multisets over a specific alphabet v that are associated with the topological sides of the membrane. The membrane is marked by u and v, with v referred to as the external marking and u as the internal marking, collectively termed as markings of the membrane. The elements of the alphabet v are referred to as proteins or objects, and an object is considered free if it is not attached to the sides of a membrane.

In applying rules to membranes, if the membrane is marked by multisets containing u and v on the appropriate sides and region i contains an object a, then the rule is applicable to the membrane i in the first case. In the second case, the rule is applicable to membrane i if it is marked by multisets containing u and v, and is contained in a region or environment that contains an object a. If the rule is applicable, the objects defined by u, v, and a can be assigned to the rule for execution. When a rule is applicable to a marked membrane, and the objects a, u, and v are assigned to the rule, the rule is executed, leading to the removal of object a from the surrounding region and its addition to region i.

Additionally, evolution rules involving objects, but not membranes, are considered to model biochemical reactions within cell compartments. However, the inclusion of membrane-evolution rules and peripheral proteins in membrane systems may lead to higher complexity algorithms from a computational perspective, which is not the focus of this paper and is left as a research topic. Furthermore, the proposed membrane evolution rules can be seen as a generalization of the protein rules used in previous studies, and similar rules have been included in stochastic simulators. 

Furthermore, this paper discusses the translation of a biological pathway into a formalism, which has been subsequently simulated in a stochastic manner. The results of the simulation are then described.

The paper also touches on the role of estrogens in cell cycle progression and tumor development, mediated by estrogen receptors found in various body tissues. Receptors, proteins located on cell membranes or within cells, are involved in binding to specific molecules and initiating cellular responses. Pathway cross-talk, the interconnectedness of biological pathways, is emphasized as a critical aspect in modeling biological processes.
