Pramanik (2016) highlighted the need for rapid and high-yield agricultural production due to population pressure on agricultural land and strong demand for food. However, challenges such as excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, inadequate irrigation infrastructure, insufficient transportation systems, depleted soil fertility, soil erosion, and other factors have led to a rapid decline in agricultural production (de la Rosa & Sobral, 2008).

A significant amount of research has been conducted on site suitability studies using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and machine learning (ML) techniques for various purposes, such as agriculture, land management, crop suitability analysis, water conservation, and crime risk mapping (Zaredar & Jafari, 2010; Rojas & Loubier, 2017; Pal & Sarkar, 2018; Srdjevic & Medeiros, 2007; Wheeler & Steenbeek, 2021).

In a recent study, Pramanik (2016) utilized the fuzzy complex proportional assessment (FCOPRAS), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and machine learning algorithms including random forest and multilayer perceptron to assess soil potential for agriculture. The study also employed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and accuracy techniques to evaluate the efficacy of the applied models and algorithms. AHP was used to calculate the weight of the alternatives for each variable, and the opinions of three experts were taken into consideration during the FCOPRAS. The weighted linear combination method (WLCM) was used to aggregate the performing variables (Malczewski & Boroushaki, 2008; Murayam & Bunruamkaew, 2011).

Moreover, geographic information system (GIS) and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) were acknowledged as valuable tools for studying site suitability and preparing land use maps to plan and manage agricultural land use (Adeniyi, 1993; Shearer & Xiang, 2009). GIS facilitates the storage, processing, and analysis of complex raw data at various levels.

The study also emphasized the importance of physical soil parameters, such as soil porosity, soil moisture, and hydraulic conductivity, in evaluating soil quality and land use management. These parameters are crucial for determining crop health, as they contribute to the supply of rainfall and soil nutrients.

The paper further discussed the multilayer perceptron algorithm as a fundamental feedforward neural network, highlighting its bidirectional nature and the role of hidden layers in propagating inputs forward and weights backward (Breiman, 2001). Additionally, it described the structure of a multilayer perceptron, featuring an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, with all layers connecting neurons for signal processing.
