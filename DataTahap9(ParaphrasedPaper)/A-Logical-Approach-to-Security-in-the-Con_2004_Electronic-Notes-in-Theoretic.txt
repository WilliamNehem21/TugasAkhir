This academic paper discusses the development of a new logic system to analyze security properties in the context of ambient calculus. The new logic is designed to be more expressive than ambient logic, utilizing a single modality to handle mobility and dynamic hierarchies of locations while also incorporating a temporal logic for expressing computational properties. The paper explains the use of labeled syntax trees as possible worlds in a Kripke structure for a propositional branching temporal logic, with the accessibility relation being generated by reduction of ambient calculus considered as reduction between syntax trees.

The paper also introduces an algebra of labeled syntax trees, extending the compositional operations of ambient calculus from syntax trees to labeled syntax trees. These labeled syntax trees are used as states in the new logic, and the paper discusses the choice of initial state depending on the purpose of the analysis.

Furthermore, the paper defines the concept of valid and satisfiable state and path formulas in the context of the developed logic. The main goal of the paper is to demonstrate the advantages of using this new logic to analyze security problems expressed in ambient calculus. It mentions that the paper does not present specific algorithms for computing the accessibility relation, as these can be found elsewhere, but it outlines the general idea behind the implementation.

In addition, the paper discusses an algorithm for analyzing the spatial arrangement of processes to determine if it allows reduction, and it addresses the issue of consuming forbidden capabilities. It also examines the interaction of a firewall with agents that know passwords, highlighting the limitations of existing models in accurately representing this scenario.
