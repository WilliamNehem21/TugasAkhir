The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to create parametric surrogate models from parametrized finite element model simulation results. The first major step involves creating a unified nodal data structure from a heterogeneous set of finite element simulations by utilizing re-sampling and the coherent point drift method for node registration. The second major step focuses on training a parametric surrogate model to predict initial coordinates using a fully-connected feed-forward neural network. Two different recurrent neural network modeling approaches are then presented and compared for predicting various field quantities with different levels of complexity and non-linearity.

For the first modeling approach, a node-by-node prediction method is employed, where each structural node's time series is independently predicted using a compact long-short term memory (LSTM) model. The initial coordinates of each node are used as additional input features for this approach. In the second modeling approach, an all-at-once prediction method is used, where the time series of all structural nodes are predicted simultaneously by training an LSTM model on a reduced output space obtained through principal component analysis (PCA).

Creating a large set of simulation results in a graphical post-processor is cumbersome and time-consuming for engineers, and technical solutions need to fulfill multiple criteria, making it difficult to express the underlying engineering optimization problem in terms of a cost function in advance. Therefore, a parametrized solution of the simulation series is sought to allow for quick decision making and real-time manual assessment of the structural response based on feature parameter values.

The paper also discusses the use of dimensionality reduction techniques for creating surrogate models, particularly focusing on the implementation of linear dimensionality reduction methods such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) or principal component analysis (PCA) in conjunction with interpolation methods for fluid dynamics.

Furthermore, the paper reviews various methods for learning the time evolution of physical structures, including the use of structure-preserving neural networks (SPNN), sparse auto-encoders for model reduction, and convolutional neural network autoencoder (CNN-AE) in conjunction with LSTM models for predicting the time-series response of structures.

The paper then compares the two modeling approaches for time-series prediction, evaluates their accuracy, predictability, model training time, and model evaluation time, and discusses the results in comparison to finite element simulation data used for training.

In conclusion, the paper highlights the limitations of the all-at-once approach and the importance of using initial coordinates as input features for achieving network generalization. It also provides insights into the challenges and potential improvements for the modeling approaches discussed.

Finally, the paper includes a brief description of the coherent point drift (CPD) method, which is used for elastic point set registration to transform source point clouds to target point clouds while preserving the underlying topological structure.
