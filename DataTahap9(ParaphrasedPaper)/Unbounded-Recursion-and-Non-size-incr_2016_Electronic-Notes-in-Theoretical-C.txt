Type systems for polynomial time functions that do not increase in size have been thoroughly researched. These systems provide an alternative to predictive recursion by prohibiting not only recursive definitions that lead to exponential growth, but also natural algorithms that compute non-size-increasing functions.

The strict inclusion on the left is due to sbs0 and sbs1 not being regressive. By employing the encoding technique of regressive machines introduced in [9, section 6], it can be demonstrated that r(p) equals s(p). However, it appears unlikely that this technique can be used to show that r(sbs0, sbs1) equals s(sbs0, sbs1). Future work could explore this question and investigate function algebras for regressive and non-size-increasing functions in well-known complexity classes.
