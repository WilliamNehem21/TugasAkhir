This academic paper introduces a novel needle drive model for jacquard knitting machines, which utilizes magnetic suspended needles. The proposed model integrates the principles of electromagnets and permanent magnets to achieve a hybrid suspension system. By analyzing the motion trajectory of the needles through theoretical analysis and simulation, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of implementing specific motion trajectories using magnetic levitation (maglev) drive needles. This model presents an alternative approach to the conventional mechanical multi-stage transmission in knitting machines. The discussion delves into the intricate details of the maglev drive needle knitting principle and establishes through simulation and theoretical models that it offers higher efficiency, a simpler structure, and programmability. Additionally, the paper outlines the fundamental theories of the electromagnetic and permanent magnet models, paving the way for further research into experimental drive needle programs and associated parameters.

The paper also highlights the significance of magnetic suspension technology as a modern method characterized by contactless operation, absence of friction and wear between components, leading to prolonged device lifespan and improved operational conditions. This technology has found widespread applications in various fields such as transportation, mechanical engineering, and aerospace.
