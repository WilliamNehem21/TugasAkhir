Resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) utilize RAM to process large volumes of data, enabling their actions and transformations to leverage cache memory for reduced computational costs and faster computations. Cordova and Moh have introduced a new algorithm, RDD-DBSCAN, which addresses the limitations of using MapReduce with DBSCAN by allowing for parallel and distributed processing using RDDs. They implemented RDD-DBSCAN using Apache Spark, which is considered an implementation of RDDs.

In another study, elevation information was added to a 2D road network in North Jutland, Denmark, comprising 434,874 instances and four attributes. A synthetic dataset of one million entries, two features, three centers, and a cluster standard deviation of 0.4 was used in a second experiment. The third experiment utilized a synthetic dataset of one million entries, 25 features, three centers, and a cluster standard deviation of 0.4.
