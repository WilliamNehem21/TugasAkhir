Aiming to alleviate the challenges faced by pregnant women during routine hospital visits, a novel system for monitoring uterine contraction pressure at home has been created. This system is comprised of a unit for collecting uterine contraction pressure signals, a wireless transmission unit, and a PDA module. It is designed using an MCU chip, DSPIC33FJ128MC706, and employs a load cell sensor, FSL1500N2C, manufactured by Honeywell, to acquire the uterine contraction pressure signal. This signal can then be wirelessly transmitted to a PDA via Bluetooth for real-time analysis and diagnosis, thus effectively preventing premature birth or abortion.

Timely detection of uterine contractions, which are integral to both premature delivery and abortion, holds significant importance for early diagnosis. Advances in wireless transmission and communication technologies in recent years have greatly accelerated the progress of medical instrument signal transmission and processing.
