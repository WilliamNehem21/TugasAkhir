The academic paper describes a process for extracting relationships between source code and documentation, using information retrieval (IR) techniques. It starts by explaining how latent semantic indexing (LSI) is used to convert documents and source code into term-document matrices to represent their underlying meaning and compute similarity. It then discusses ways to improve the current recovery model based on the special characteristics of source code and documentation, and compares its approach with previous work through experiments. The paper also delves into the vector space model for text retrieval and the low-rank approximation of term-document matrices provided by LSI, as well as the application of probabilistic models and LSI in recovering traceability links. Additionally, it outlines a process for extracting identifiers from source code, preprocessing documentation and source code for information retrieval, and the iterative refining process based on the hierarchical structure of documentation.

The paper concludes by discussing the experiments conducted, including the results obtained by applying a threshold value method to filter result lists and the assignment of different weights to comments. Furthermore, it touches on the challenges of using a similarity thesaurus, the need for more attention to the preprocessing step, and the potential for future work to improve the precision of retrieving traceability links by exploiting more characteristics of documentation and source code in software engineering, and conducting experiments on larger open-source projects.
