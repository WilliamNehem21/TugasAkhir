This study introduces a new parallel sparse approximate inverse (SPAI) preconditioning algorithm, referred to as HybridSPAI, that leverages MPI and CUDA for efficient processing on multi-GPUs. HybridSPAI optimizes a static SPAI preconditioning algorithm and extends it to multiple GPUs to handle large-scale matrices. The key contributions of this work are twofold: first, it presents a general parallel framework for optimizing the static SPAI preconditioner using MPI and CUDA, and second, it establishes a decision tree to select the optimal kernel for each component of the preconditioner. Experimental results demonstrate that HybridSPAI is effective, outperforming popular preconditioning algorithms in two public libraries as well as a recent parallel SPAI preconditioning algorithm.

The algorithm exploits parallelism to simultaneously obtain many subsets of j and i. Additionally, parallelism is utilized within each thread group. For the kernel responsible for finding j, the threads within each warp (thread group) perform parallel reads of one column of the matrix M and store the results to shared memory using atomic operations. For the kernel responsible for finding i, a decision tree is established to select the optimal approach. The experimental results highlight the notable performance and effectiveness of HybridSPAI.
