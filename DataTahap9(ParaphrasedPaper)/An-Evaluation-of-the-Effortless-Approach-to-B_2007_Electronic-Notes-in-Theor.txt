Naps et al. define the engagement level in algorithm construction through two methods: direct generation and hand construction. Our approach incorporates elements of both methods. First, the environment automatically generates visualizations of different execution stages, employing direct generation.

The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows: Section two outlines the evaluation, including details on participants, variables, methodology, and procedures. Section three presents the evaluation results, and section four discusses these results. Finally, in section five, the paper covers conclusions and future work.

Participants were randomly assigned to either the viewers group (VG) or the builders group (BG). Both groups were asked about their prior knowledge of the algorithm, with only one student possessing such knowledge. As a result, both groups can be considered part of the same population, allowing for comparison of their respective results.

The evaluation was conducted in two sessions: a training session where students were introduced to the IDE and an experimental session where their knowledge of the algorithm was assessed. Ten and thirteen students participated in the training and experimental sessions, respectively. The training session lasted for two hours, during which the instructor demonstrated the tool and students used it to create animations. A questionnaire was also administered to gather the students' initial impressions of the tool.

The experimental session, also lasting two hours, took place two weeks after the training session. Students were informed of the evaluation, and participation was voluntary. The VG (n=7) and BG (n=6) were formed randomly, and it was verified that all students in the BG had attended the previous training session. Both groups were provided with materials to study the algorithm, including a textual description. Significant differences were found in the understanding and application levels between the two groups, with the BG exhibiting a 16% learning improvement in the understanding level and a 60% improvement in the application level.
