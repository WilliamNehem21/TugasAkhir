The academic paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a small case study on an object-oriented component architecture, serving as an explicit example of the advanced generic architecture framework introduced in Section 3. Section 4 defines the semantics of connector architectures, with the main result demonstrating the existence and uniqueness of architecture semantics based on compatibility of component composition within the extended framework allowing overlapping connector interfaces. In Section 5, the instantiation of the generic framework to UML diagrams, which is the concrete framework for the case study in Section 2, is presented. The paper concludes in Section 6 with a brief discussion of related work and an outlook to future research.

In the upcoming section, a small case study on the management of metadata using an object-oriented connector-component architecture based on UML will be modeled. This architecture framework for UML is an instantiation of the generic framework for architectures presented in Sections 3 and 4, and will be described in more detail in Section 5.

The system's objective is to exchange data of various topic maps via the HTTP protocol, allowing for data sharing in both server-based and peer-to-peer fashion using the standardized XML transfer syntax for topic maps.

The architecture packages in this abstract view correspond to the architecture graphs of the generic framework in Section 3. The components, namely ontology, server, and manager, represent the three main areas of requirements and are connected via the connectors srvsrc between the server and the data model in ontology, and manont between the manager and the domain ontology in ontology. A UML class diagram is used to declare two methods that will be utilized by the server component. Additionally, a <<transform>> dependency is established, and the renamed model is included in expdatamodel. The concept of overlapping connector interfaces is then extended to entire architectures of components and connectors.

The paper then goes on to discuss the architecture graph, and considers the special case of binary connectors and components with two export interfaces each.

The subsequent section demonstrates the application of the abstract connector framework to UML diagrams. It presents a concrete graphical representation of UML diagrams, emphasizing that the instantiation can only be provided on an intuitive level at this stage. Future work aims to handle the corresponding meta-model instances as formal abstract syntax and deal with syntactical dependencies between different diagrams, providing a much more detailed definition of connector architectures for UML diagrams.

Finally, the paper proposes to consider other UML techniques, such as UML profiles, especially with regard to including ontologies as class hierarchies within an ontology profile and utilizing profiles for platform-specific implementation models.
