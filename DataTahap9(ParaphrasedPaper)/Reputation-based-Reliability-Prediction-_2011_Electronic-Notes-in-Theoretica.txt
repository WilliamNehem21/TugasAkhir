Today, the idea of service oriented architectures offers a method for creating integrated solutions using existing services. This involves combining services from different providers through advanced orchestration and choreography techniques. While this approach allows for increased flexibility at a lower cost, there is a potential risk associated with using third-party services, as their performance might not match the claims made by their providers. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the expected reliability of service compositions based on ratings provided by previous service users. Each service is associated with a reputation, and the analysis calculates the overall reliability of a service composition based on the reputations of its constituent services. Our proposed approach involves translating statechart models of service compositions into input for a probabilistic model checker (Prism) using state-of-the-art model transformations techniques. This approach has been implemented as an Eclipse plug-in and is fully compliant with UML.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the formalisms used for modeling and analysis, Section 3 presents the transformation between the design and analysis models, Section 4 discusses the tool support for the proposed approach, Section 5 provides an overview of related work, and Section 6 concludes the paper and suggests directions for future work.

A model consists of one or more UML state machines containing parallel composed statecharts representing services. Each statechart is described by its states and transitions, which can be triggered by internal, receiving, or sending events. The modeling notation chosen in this work is familiar to most software architects, but it is not fully supported by existing formal analysis techniques, including model checking. Therefore, to analyze a choreography using model checking, its model must be transformed into the corresponding analysis model in an accepted format. The Prism modeling language, based on the reactive modules formalism, allows the system to be described as a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC), continuous time Markov chain (CTMC), or Markov decision process (MDP). Modules that represent different interacting processes within the model can be composed together in a process-algebraic expression. The Eclipse platform, with its flexible plug-in based architecture, was chosen as the development and application platform for this approach.

In this paper, we have proposed a technique for calculating the expected reliability of service choreographies based on the reputations of individual services. Our approach involves transforming metamodel instances of UML state machines into Markov decision processes, which can be used as input to Prism for determining the expected reliability. This approach is implemented using state-of-the-art model transformation techniques and is compliant with UML.
