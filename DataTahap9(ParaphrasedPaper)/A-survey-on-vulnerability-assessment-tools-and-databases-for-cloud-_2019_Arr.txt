Cloud computing represents a new and transformative computing paradigm that has fundamentally changed how applications are designed and made available. It advocates for the use of computational and networked resources on demand to support application provisioning, effectively outsourcing resource management to cloud providers with the aim of reducing operational and management costs.

The success of cloud computing has led to higher levels of abstraction through the provision of additional service types beyond infrastructure. Platform services are now offered to simplify the creation and management of execution environments within the leased resources, and the scope of these services has been extended to facilitate cloud application design and development.

Virtualization also has implications for security, as physical hosts are shared by users in the form of virtual machines (VMs), raising concerns about malicious users gaining access to data or taking control over all VMs by attacking the hypervisor. Additionally, as applications are distributed over public clouds, networked attacks can be carried out, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information during transmission or application overload due to denial-of-service attacks.

Security services in the context of cloud computing can take different forms. These services may be reactive, aiming to detect and address attacks, or preventive, seeking to mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. The focus of this article is on vulnerability scanning tools and databases, which are not widely used in practice despite their potential to enhance cloud application security. The article aims to provide guidance to practitioners in selecting the right vulnerability scanning tools and databases for their applications, addressing challenges that have not been thoroughly explored in existing research.

The article evaluates vulnerability scanning tools against a criteria-based framework, with a focus on trade-offs between scanning accuracy and time. The evaluation is based on a comprehensive search for tools using relevant keywords and academic data sources. The study also assesses the coverage and capabilities of vulnerability databases, drawing on a set of evaluation criteria to compare and contrast different databases.

The evaluation results highlight the importance of modular and extensible tools that can be tailored to specific application needs, as well as the need for improved support for different operating systems and architectures. The study also emphasizes the potential for semantic technology in vulnerability databases and the value of community engagement in tool development and maintenance.

The article concludes by calling for a more coordinated and integrated approach to vulnerability scanning, including the use of multiple tools to cover different aspects of application security and the adoption of proactive measures to address security vulnerabilities. It suggests that advancements in vulnerability scanning tools and practices can significantly enhance the security of cloud applications and contribute to the overall advancement of the field.
