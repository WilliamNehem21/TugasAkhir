The ability to observe a process is described using a language of prefixes, which is represented by a copointed endofunctor within the same category of presheaves. This endofunctor is known as the behavior functor. Transition systems are coalgebras for this behavior functor, and coalgebraic bisimulations define bisimulations.

Researchers in the field of concurrency were drawn to this subject due to their interest in exploring a more abstract approach. The increasing prevalence of various process algebras and their associated bisimulations has made this an area of growing interest, and it is anticipated that other concurrency theorists will find this work relevant. In conclusion, there are compelling theoretical and practical justifications for advancing open bisimulation within the higher order functorial operational semantics framework that has been presented.

The open bisimulation relation's distinction index records information; after the initial two bound outputs z(w) and z(y), it is only necessary to verify that p~{(x,y)} q, thereby eliminating all substitutions that equate x and y. For additional examples and motivation, please refer to sources such as [16,15].

Open bisimulation is not only closed under transitions, but also under renamings that must be injective on the names that have been removed. Therefore, each stage should not only consist of a set of free variables, but also include a relation indicating when names cannot be renamed to be the same. Consequently, our presheaves will be over specific subcategories of rel, rather than sets. In the case of open bisimulation, this subcategory is the category of distinction relations, which is defined later in the paper.

The structure demonstrated in Lemma 3.2 extends to the structure of the category of d-presheaves as follows. Notably, the limitation to finite distinction relations means that there are no issues related to size when discussing the category of dpresheaves. Rather than creating new symbols for the extended structure, the same symbols will be used, and the reader will be provided with enough information to discern the category being referred to.

Another practical avenue for further research is that of hd-automata. Hd-automata aim to provide an operational model of history-dependent calculi by enhancing the states of automata with pertinent information (such as the free names of processes) and establishing the relationship between local information in different states. These automata can be viewed as concrete implementations of the more abstract framework described in previous research. By automatically distilling a concrete, minimized representation of a process as a history-dependent automaton, there is potential for applications in model checking and verification.
