Our research presents several key distinctions from the aforementioned papers. Firstly, unlike many of the models discussed above that focus exclusively on shortages of products from suppliers, our approach takes into consideration both shortages and surpluses caused by varying yields. Additionally, in line with Dada et al. (2007), we acknowledge that a buyer will only purchase up to the quantity they have ordered from a supplier, regardless of any oversupply resulting from higher yields.

In the context of spot market transactions, Fafchamps and Hill (2005) discovered that the likelihood of a farmer selling produce to the market decreases as the distance to the market increases, while the likelihood of selling at the farm gate increases. Similarly, Aayog (2017) highlights the benefits of direct procurement from farmers in India, emphasizing the positive impact on both farmers and buyers in terms of obtaining better prices and circumventing intermediaries.

Furthermore, although we utilize a normal distribution for supply yields due to its widespread use in operations management literature, our model is flexible and able to account for any probability distribution for supply yields.
