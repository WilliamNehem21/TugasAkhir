This paper introduces a novel method for computing the IMDCT (Inverse Modified Discrete Cosine Transform) that involves a decomposition algorithm to convert long transforms into shorter transforms. By applying this algorithm recursively, computational cycles can be reduced. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves a lower estimated number of computational cycles for a 512-point IMDCT compared to previous reports. The methodology for the decomposition algorithm and its implications for computational efficiency are discussed in detail in this paper's subsequent sections.
