The study of immersive technology in education is rapidly expanding and has the potential to be a valuable tool for educating future healthcare professionals. Despite the growing literature in this area, there is a lack of validated instruments to investigate the effects of immersive technologies. To address this gap, the study applied cognitive interviewing to a new measure of user experience of immersive technology for healthcare education. This measure includes five domains: immersion, intrinsic motivation, cognitive load, system usability, and debrief. The study involved nine participants who were allocated to augmented reality and virtual reality educational activities, and the researchers conducted semi-structured cognitive interviews using verbal probing and think-aloud techniques.

The results of the study indicated high content validity index scores for the new measure and revealed relationships between the different domains through qualitative analysis. Additionally, the study found high clarity of understanding among the participants completing the measure, supporting its potential use in future research as part of an ongoing validation process.

The study also discussed the potential pedagogical benefits of immersive technology in healthcare education, highlighting the impact on procedural skills, experiential learning, and cognitive frameworks. Furthermore, an online-modified Delphi process was used to gather stakeholder views on the domains that should be measured when evaluating immersive technology in healthcare education.

The study also emphasized the importance of validity in the design, evaluation, and pre-testing of the new measure, as well as the various techniques used in the cognitive interviewing process. The study concluded that the new measure is the first multidomain instrument that can assess user immersion, perceived learning, and usability of immersive technology in healthcare education.

The study acknowledged several limitations in the cognitive interviewing methodology and emphasized the need for further research to assess the instrument's value in evaluating technology use in healthcare education. Finally, the study highlighted the importance of protecting participant identity and obtaining informed consent for the research.

In summary, the study provided valuable insights into the development and evaluation of a new measure for assessing the user experience of immersive technology in healthcare education, while also identifying areas for further research and improvement.
