We extend the typed pi-calculus by introducing a group creation operation, where a group is defined as a type for channels. Creating new groups prevents specific communications in advance, thus mitigating the unintended or intentional disclosure of confidential information. We modify a concept of secrecy proposed by Abadi and demonstrate the preservation of secrecy property. When implemented in the ambient calculus, the same concept of group creation can facilitate the establishment and protection of shared secrets among mobile agents.
