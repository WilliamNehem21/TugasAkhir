When the occurrences of variables within expressions are linear and the products have factors with different variables, the expressions are termed multilinear. We prove that multilinear expressions are either constant or do not possess a local minimum or maximum. Consequently, the interval of multilinear expressions can be accurately calculated by examining their values at the boundaries of the involved variables. We then introduce a method for interval analysis of generic expressions, which transforms them into multilinear expressions and computes the interval of the latter.

We review the mathematical background and define multilinear expressions, demonstrating our findings in section 2. The algorithm for the interval analysis of multilinear expressions and the examination of its computational complexity are presented in section 3. In section 4, we investigate the extension of our technique to generic expressions. Finally, our conclusions are outlined in section 5.

A polynomial function is a function defined by a polynomial. For example, the function f from real numbers to real numbers, defined by f(x) = 5x^3 + 2x + 7, is a polynomial function with one argument. Polynomial functions with multiple arguments can be defined using polynomials in multiple variables, such as f(x, y) = xy^2 + 2xy + y + 1.

Let id(e) be the set of identifiers in expression e. It is clear that an expression e represents a polynomial in the variables from id(e), making it a function from n to real numbers, where n is the cardinality of id(e). An expression is considered multilinear if the corresponding polynomial is multilinear.

In order to transform e into an expression that is linear in x, we may need, in the worst-case scenario, d/2 iterations of lines 4-10. These iterations introduce d/2 fresh variables, and a similar process is carried out for every other nonlinear variable. In the worst case, the iterations are n(d/2).
