The transportation problem (TP) involves minimizing the total cost of transporting products from a source to a destination while meeting supply and demand constraints. The objective of TP is to find an optimal solution that achieves minimal total cost. It was originally developed as a linear programming problem by Hitchcock. TP has practical applications in personal assignment, task allocation, flow shop scheduling, and vehicle routing.

Finding an initial basic feasible solution (IBFS) is essential for solving TP optimally. The result of IBFS can closely approximate the values of the optimal solution and reduce the number of iterations required to find the optimal solution. This study focuses on finding IBFS to minimize the total cost of the transportation problem.

The VAM method is widely recognized as the best initial basic feasible solution and has been extensively studied and modified by various researchers. This paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 present the mathematical formulation of the transportation problem and the total opportunity cost matrix. Section 4 summarizes existing methods, Section 5 describes TOCM-MT, and Section 6 provides numerical examples. Section 7 discusses the experimental results, and Section 8 presents the conclusions and future research directions.

IBFS is the starting solution for the transportation problem, and in some cases, it leads to the optimal solution. This paper will discuss three existing methods for finding IBFS.

Numerical examples used in the experiment were obtained from various journals and randomly generated. TOCM-MT, TDM1, and JHM were successfully implemented in the C++ programming language and applied to 31 numerical examples. TORA software was used for the VAM and optimal solution methods. The experimental results showed that TOCM-MT achieved 77.42% accuracy with 24 optimal solutions out of 31 numerical examples, while VAM, JHM, and TDM1 obtained accuracy levels of 32.26%, 70.96%, and 45.16% respectively.
