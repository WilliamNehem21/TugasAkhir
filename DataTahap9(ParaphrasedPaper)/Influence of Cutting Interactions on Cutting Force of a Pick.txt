In mechanized continuous mining, the proper selection of machines and operational parameters relies heavily on estimating drum reactive torque and forces, which are directly influenced by the forces acting on the individual picks of the drum. Furthermore, the optimization of pick design necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the forces acting on the picks. Therefore, the accurate prediction of forces acting on a pick during mining production is critical.

In the context of rock cutting, a pick experiences three orthogonal forces: cutting force (also known as drag force), normal force, and sideway force (also referred to as lateral force). This study specifically focuses on the cutting force, which has been a primary focus in existing literature. Researchers prioritize the cutting force due to its significant impact on the formation and removal of rock chips, directly influencing specific energy. Numerous research endeavors have aimed to calculate or predict the cutting force of a pick, resulting in the development of various cutting force models, including theoretical, empirical, semi-empirical, and numerical models. These models, while diverse in form and consideration of factors, have been developed based on different pick types (e.g., radial and point-attack), with the depth of cut (DOC) consistently identified as a significant variable. For instance, researchers such as Evans and Goktan have indicated that cutting force is proportional to the square of DOC, whereas Yilmaz et al. revealed a linear relationship between cutting force and DOC. Liu et al. demonstrated, based on laboratory experiments, that cutting force exhibits an exponential relationship with DOC.
