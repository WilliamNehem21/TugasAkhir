The multi-objective immune system algorithm (MISA) is considered to be one of the earliest proposals of multi-objective artificial immune systems (MOAIS) in the academic literature. Initially, the algorithm closely adhered to the principles of clonal selection, but subsequent versions sacrificed some biological metaphors to enhance its performance. The population is represented using randomly initialized binary strings, and the algorithm does not explicitly use a scalar index to determine solution avidity. Instead, rules are established for selecting the set of antibodies to be cloned, with a ranking scheme that prioritizes feasible and non-dominated individuals, followed by infeasible non-dominated individuals, and lastly, infeasible and dominated individuals. A memory set, referred to as the secondary population, is updated with non-dominated feasible individuals. Due to the limited size of this repository, an adaptive grid is implemented to ensure a uniform distribution of non-dominated solutions. 

A general methodology for solving multi-objective nonlinear programming (MONP) problems involves relating the concept of Pareto-optimal solutions to a familiar concept. One common strategy is to characterize Pareto-optimal solutions in terms of optimal solutions of appropriate nonlinear programming problems (NLPPs) using the weighted aggregation (WA) technique, which can transform multi-objective programming problems (MOPs) into NLPPs.

Multi-objective optimization runs employ different weighting vectors (W) to identify a set of points on the Pareto front. While this method is straightforward, it has drawbacks related to the selection of weighting and addressing non-convex solution spaces. However, focusing on convex MOP problems can mitigate these weaknesses.

In the study, a novel approach leverages neural networks to determine the maximum and minimum values and utilizes this information to initialize the population with at least feasible antibodies, thereby enabling MISA to identify more accurate and faster Pareto-optimal solutions. The approach incorporates an affinity measure to govern the amount of mutation applied to the antibodies, defined in terms of nondominance and feasibility. This affinity measure, in conjunction with the secondary population, is employed to distribute non-dominated solutions uniformly.
