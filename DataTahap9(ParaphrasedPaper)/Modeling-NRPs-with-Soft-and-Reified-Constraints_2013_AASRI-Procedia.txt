Nurse rostering has been a subject of extensive research since the 1970s, initially focusing on using mathematical programming methods to address the problem. However, starting in the 1990s, metaheuristic approaches have become increasingly prominent in rostering research, incorporating techniques such as tabu search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, variable neighborhood search, and electromagnetic metaheuristics. Constraint programming has also played a significant role in nurse rostering, particularly in the context of complete search, with several examples of its application. Nevertheless, existing work has primarily concentrated on efficiently solving well-known instances, with limited attention devoted to real-life nurse rostering cases.

This paper seeks to contribute to the study of nurse rostering in mid-sized Chilean healthcare facilities by examining three clinics and four hospitals with similar characteristics (e.g., size, organization, and nurse count). The problem is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) involving both soft and hard constraints, and it is solved using constraint programming (CP) algorithms with the Jacop solver. We anticipate that this research will enhance the understanding of practical nurse rostering challenges and provide valuable insights for future nurse rostering researchers.

The healthcare centers in Chile employ a unique scheduling system known as the "fourth shift" system, which deviates from the conventional 8-hour shift pattern commonly found in hospitals and research literature. In this system, two 12-hour shifts (day and night) are implemented: "d" for day shift (from 08:00 to 20:00) and "n" for night shift (from 20:00 to 8:00 the following day).

Soft constraints are utilized to represent nurse preferences, such as those expressed by senior nurses regarding their scheduling. Since existing CP solvers do not inherently support soft constraints, we represent the soft constraints using reified constraints, where a reified constraint (ck, bk) assigns the value 1 (true) to the variable bk if the constraint ck is satisfied, and 0 (false) otherwise. The objective is to maximize the summation of bk variables, taking into account the nurses' preferences. For example, if we consider three preferences: nurse 5 prefers not to have day 1 off, nurses 2 and 4 prefer to start with a day shift, and nurse 11 prefers to have the third weekend of the cycle off, they can be modeled as reified constraints and included in the objective function.

The paper demonstrates how the model handles the unusual shift pattern and nurse preferences using soft constraints represented by reified constraints and an objective function to maximize the satisfaction of preferences. The approach is implemented in the Jacop solver, generating automatic rosters in approximately 20 minutes for 40 nurses. Furthermore, it suggests that this model could be extended to larger healthcare facilities and more complex soft constraints, with potential research avenues to explore including metaheuristics and autonomous search techniques.
