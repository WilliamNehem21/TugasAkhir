In various scenarios, transformations based on signature morphisms are often too inflexible to be practical, particularly in the context of software reuse. The advent of new computing paradigms requires more adaptable approaches to validating specifications, as discussed in this paper. Sections 3 and 4 lay the groundwork for formulating refinement by interpretation in a general setting, while also presenting examples and additional properties of this refinement concept. Section 5 concludes the paper and highlights certain issues that warrant further exploration.

Definition 3.1 characterizes a translation as a multi-function that maps a formula to a set of formulas, which is what makes translations valuable for establishing relationships between specifications and provides the primary flexibility in the proposed approach. Conversely, a signature morphism maps a formula to just another formula.

Feitosa and Ottaviano extensively studied the special case of functional translation with k= l= 1, i.e., between sentential languages, where the interpretations were referred to as conservative translation. Based on their work, a sufficient condition for a translation to be considered an interpretation is established, which is practical in application.

Numerous unanswered questions remain, such as the delineation between refinement via signature morphism and refinement via interpretation within the framework introduced in this paper. While it may seem intuitive to regard refinement via signature morphism as refinement via interpretation, it is not straightforward due to the implicit variable translation introduced by signature morphisms. This necessitates parameterizing the logic of our framework with the variables used to generate its formulas in order to accommodate the classical refinement procedure.
