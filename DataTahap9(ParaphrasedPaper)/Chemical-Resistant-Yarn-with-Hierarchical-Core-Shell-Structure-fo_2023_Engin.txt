The shapes of the stretched high-count stretch textiles (HCSTs) were examined with optical microscopy using the RH2000 model manufactured by Hirox in Japan. The changes in contact angle resulting from the stretching process of the HCSTs were recorded using the SL200KS goniometer from Kino Industry Co., Ltd. in the USA. The tensile properties of the prepared samples were evaluated using the Instron 5943 universal material testing system from Instron in the USA. Changes in relative resistance were measured with the Keysight 34470A digital multimeter. Air permeability of the various textiles was tested using the G571 air permeability tester from Standard International Group (HK) Limited in China, with a testing area and pressure of 20 cm^2 and 200 Pa, respectively, in accordance with GB/T 5453.
