The rapid advancements in wireless and mobile networks have brought about significant changes in communication systems. The increasing demand for high-speed wireless internet access, voice, and multimedia applications has led to the widespread growth of the internet. This surge in demand has popularized technologies such as 3GPP, LTE, 3GPP2, and IEEE 802.16, which offer broadband data rates to wireless users.

The paper is structured as follows: Section two discusses the quality of service in WiMAX, while section three covers the existing studies in the literature. These studies are categorized to provide a comprehensive understanding of scheduling issues from different perspectives. Following this, an analysis of the studies and their implications is provided, along with potential directions for future research. It is important to note that while the authors have attempted to explore a wide range of studies, the paper should not be considered exhaustive in its coverage.

WiMAX operates in two modes: point to multipoint (PMP) mode and mesh mode. In PMP mode, communication occurs between multiple subscriber stations (SS) and a base station (BS), while in mesh mode, SS can communicate with one another, effectively acting as individual BS. Scheduling in mesh mode may be centralized, where the mesh BS controls all the SSs, or distributed, where transmissions in the two-hop neighborhood are coordinated to avoid collisions. This study predominantly focuses on the PMP mode, with scheduling approaches categorized as follows:

1. The deficit round-robin (DRR) scheduler proposed by Shreedhar et al. associates a fixed quantum and a deficit counter with each flow/queue. This approach provides fairness for variable length packets. However, it has limitations, particularly in calculating the size of the head-of-queue packet for uplink traffic.

2. Maode Ma et al. proposed a three-tier scheduling framework, where tier 1 scheduling occurs at the BS, tier 2 scheduler determines time slots for connections within each service class, and tier 3 scheduler is located at the SS.

3. Triantafyllopoulou et al. introduced a cross-layer mechanism that communicates with the application layer to optimize scheduling. While it benefits quality of service and system capacity, it introduces complexity at the BS.

4. Jin-yup Hwang et al. categorized traffic models into real time and non-real time traffic, implementing adaptive traffic allocation scheduling schemes based on traffic type and maximum allowed delay time.

5. Ruangchaijatupon et al. aimed to impart fairness to the adaptive scheduling scheme using priority queuing and deficit queuing techniques.

6. Fathi et al. proposed a joint scheduling and channel allocation control method, utilizing weighted fair queuing in its initial stage for traffic class allocation.

Beyond these specific scheduling strategies, the paper highlights the need to explore the application of soft computing and optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks to address the scheduling problem. Furthermore, it emphasizes the significance of studying the impact of different routing schemes on scheduling algorithms, the integration of pricing considerations into scheduling techniques, and the potential of artificial intelligence techniques in scheduling within the context of WiMAX.

In conclusion, while numerous scheduling methods have been explored, there remain areas that require further investigation and improvement. This includes the application of soft computing and optimization techniques, integration of pricing considerations, and continued exploration of the potential of artificial intelligence techniques in scheduling. The ongoing popularity of WiMAX in developing countries suggests that scheduling and bandwidth allocation schemes are critical to supporting quality of service and ensuring WiMAX performance.
