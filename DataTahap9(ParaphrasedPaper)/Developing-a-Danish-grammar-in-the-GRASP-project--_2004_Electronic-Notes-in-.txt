The paper introduces a new approach to grammar that incorporates standard generalizations about dependency relations in combination with constraints on topology and extraction. Specifically, the paper presents a hierarchy of construction types that encompass constituent order patterns commonly observed in Scandinavian languages. It also distinguishes different types of extracted phrases, providing the basis for explaining topicalized constructions and various relative clause types. The constraint system described in the paper also accommodates multiple gap examples.

The paper challenges the notion that field schemata are essential for explaining the topology observed in languages with non-English-like topological properties, such as German, Swedish, and Danish. Instead, it proposes a construction-based account of Danish topology and its relation to clause types. This account is based on a hierarchy of constructions incorporating dimensions of headedness and clausality, which allows for a straightforward explanation of the relationship between topological properties and different clause types.

The paper introduces the concept of marking values and explains how they change throughout a construction. It also discusses the role of attributes such as bco and bcomark in constraining the basic constituent order. Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of extraction and presents a typology of Danish clause types, including topicalized clauses and relative clauses.

The paper concludes by presenting the potential for further research, such as extending the coverage to include imperatives, conditionals, and wh-interrogatives, as well as studying the issue of extraction in presentational relative clauses and setting up a typology of this construction for Danish. The paper emphasizes the ongoing nature of this research and aims to provide a solid foundation for future applications.
