The detection of pedestrians has a wide range of potential applications in fields such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and robotics, and has been an ongoing area of interest in computer vision. In recent years, significant progress has been made in pedestrian detection technology due to advancements in deep learning and the availability of large pedestrian datasets. However, the performance of the most advanced pedestrian detection methods still lags behind human capabilities, especially in scenarios involving occlusion and scale changes, which significantly impact detection accuracy. Consequently, there is ongoing research to address these challenges. This paper provides an overview of the research progress in pedestrian detection from 2019 to 2022, focusing on various methods and approaches aimed at improving detection accuracy and speed.

One prominent challenge in pedestrian detection is the diverse range of postures and appearances that pedestrians present, such as stationary, standing, squatting, bending, or walking. Additionally, variations in clothing colors and styles further complicate the detection task. Designing a detection method that remains robust in the face of these variations has emerged as a significant challenge in pedestrian detection.

Environmental factors such as adverse weather conditions and low-light settings also pose challenges for pedestrian detection. Rain, snow, fog, and other phenomena reduce image clarity, leading to blurred pedestrian contours and reduced visibility, negatively impacting detection accuracy. Similarly, low-light conditions and the use of infrared images further exacerbate the difficulty of accurately detecting pedestrians.

Occlusion, both within the pedestrian class and involving other objects, presents another major challenge in pedestrian detection. Intra-class occlusion between pedestrians introduces interference and may lead to false detections, while inter-class occlusion, where pedestrians are obstructed by other objects, results in incomplete pedestrian structural information, potentially leading to missed detections.

The scale of pedestrians, varying distances from the camera, further compounds the detection challenge. Pedestrians at different scales present different spatial challenges, with smaller-scale pedestrians often having less distinguishable features and lower resolution, leading to potential missed detections.

Real-time detection is a critical requirement for applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent monitoring. While the development of deep learning has improved detection accuracy, it has also introduced computational complexities that hinder real-time detection. Addressing this trade-off between accuracy and speed remains an ongoing challenge in pedestrian detection research.

In response to these challenges, researchers have proposed various detection methods to enhance pedestrian detection accuracy and speed. These methods have evolved from the use of hand-crafted features to more robust deep features, leveraging advancements in deep learning technologies.

In addition to methodological advances, researchers have also focused on developing and utilizing pedestrian datasets and evaluation metrics. Various strategies for addressing occlusion and scale issues have been explored, including the use of multi-scale detection, attention mechanisms, and context-aware feature learning.

Furthermore, a variety of algorithms and models have been developed to handle occluded pedestrian features, such as attention-guided models, feature fusion, and improved feature extraction networks. These approaches aim to improve the robustness of pedestrian detection in the presence of occlusion and scale variations.

Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and advancements in pedestrian detection, highlighting the ongoing efforts to improve detection accuracy and speed in various real-world scenarios.
