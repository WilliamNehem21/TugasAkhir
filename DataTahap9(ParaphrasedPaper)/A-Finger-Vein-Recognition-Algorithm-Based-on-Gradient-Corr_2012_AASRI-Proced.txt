The experiments demonstrate a high level of accuracy, indicating that the algorithm is capable of distinguishing genuine finger vein images from non-finger vein images, such as those of pencils. A total of 588 images, including those from 40 different fingers, were used to create the vein library, with some fingers being captured up to 70 times.
