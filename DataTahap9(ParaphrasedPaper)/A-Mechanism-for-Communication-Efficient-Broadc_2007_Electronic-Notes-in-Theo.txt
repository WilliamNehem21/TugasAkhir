This paper addresses the challenge of securely distributing content in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), where a single source disseminates data to a dynamically changing group of authorized receivers, all of which are mobile nodes forming a multihop ad hoc wireless network. To ensure the secrecy of the data, the source encrypts all messages using a broadcast encryption scheme at the application layer, guaranteeing that only the authorized subset can recover the content.

The work by gkmpan offers efficient mechanisms for group rekeying in ad hoc wireless networks, using probabilistic key pre-deployment. Nodes are pre-loaded with a subset of keys out of a larger pool, and these keys are utilized by neighboring nodes to establish secure channels. When addition or revocation events occur, a group manager generates an intermediate key and distributes it through the network to facilitate updates. This approach is particularly suitable for managing rekeying in MANETs, as it allows partitioned nodes to recover missed updates through local interactions, with minimal reliance on the key manager.

Despite the merits of gkmpan, the approach introduced in this paper offers novel and advantageous features. Notably, the reliability mechanism in our work is separate from the secure content distribution mechanism, enabling us to utilize the resources of non-authorized group members and allowing partitioned nodes to recover missed messages with certainty. In contrast, gkmpan only provides a probabilistic guarantee for recovery and requires all connected nodes to erase the intermediate key after updating compromised keys, rendering rekeying impossible for partitioned nodes rejoining the network after a missed rekey message.

Additionally, the paper makes certain assumptions regarding the network and security environment, considering both authorized and nonauthorized nodes in the MANET, as well as the potential compromise of authorized receivers. The reliance on a multicast routing protocol for efficient message delivery and an understanding of node capabilities, including limited communication and computational capabilities but ample storage, are also assumed.

To mitigate issues stemming from network partitions or lossy links, key updates are delivered using a reliable message delivery mechanism. This makes use of stateful broadcast encryption schemes, minimizing communication costs in highly dynamic mobile ad hoc wireless networks.

The study utilizes a modified random way-point mobility model, addressing concerns related to the standard model's validity. In particular, nodes select their speeds within a certain range to achieve a more consistent mobility pattern, and mobility is generated before the simulation starts to stabilize node distribution and average speed.

Experiments conducted showcase that during disconnection, the number of connected nodes remains high, indicating that a rejoining node should be able to recover multiple symbols from each encounter. As a result, the recovery time for multiple messages is expected to be similar to that of a single message, as discussed in section 5.
