The harmony memory (HM), harmony memory consideration rate (HMCR), pitch adjusting rate (PAR), and number of improvisations (NI) serve as the stopping criterion in the context of an optimization problem. HM functions as a memory repository storing solution vectors, akin to the genetic pool in genetic algorithms (GAs).

Evolutionary algorithms like harmony search (HS), genetic algorithms (GAs), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are stochastic population-based search techniques, meaning there is no assurance of consistently reaching the optimal solution. To ascertain whether HS can better approximate the global optimal solution, a comparison was conducted using statistical analysis on an optimization problem. This assessment involved 30 sample data points of total least-squares error for HS, GA, and PSO, with fixed times for data analysis.
