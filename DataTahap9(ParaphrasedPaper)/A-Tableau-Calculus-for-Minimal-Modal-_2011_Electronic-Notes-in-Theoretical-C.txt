The generation of models and minimal models is valuable for analyzing faults, verifying systems, and validating data models. While there are established approaches for minimizing models in classical propositional and first-order logic, the study of minimal model generation for non-classical logic has been relatively limited. In this paper, we introduce a minimal model generation calculus for multi-modal logic k(m) and its extensions with axioms t and b. Our calculus offers a method to generate all and only minimal modal Herbrand models, with each model being generated exactly once. An innovative aspect of our calculus is the inclusion of a non-standard complement splitting rule tailored for minimal model generation, which has been shown through experiments to reduce the search space.

The existing approaches to model minimization in classical logic can be categorized into three groups: those focused on minimizing the domain of interpretation, those targeting specific predicates, and those aiming to minimize all predicates. While minimal model generation has garnered attention in modal logics with non-monotonic semantics, it has received less study in modal logics and related description logics. We show that the common modal logics can be translated into first-order logic, and our minimal modal Herbrand model is derived from this translation. We also demonstrate the minimal model soundness and completeness of our approach.

While there are similarities between some of the rules, the 3mg calculus and the puhr calculus do not directly correspond to each other, as a step in one may be simulated by one or more steps in the other. We establish the minimal model soundness and completeness of the 3mg calculus by proving that the two calculi are approximations of each other via a novel translation of modal formulae to first-order clause form. Our new translation also facilitates the reduction of the search space in the application of the puhr approach to clauses obtained by the standard translation.

One potential extension of our approach involves incorporating lazy clausification through appropriate extension rules. While this extension would not improve the theoretical worst-case complexity of the calculus, it could offer practical benefits in a future implementation. The calculus presented in this paper does not utilize lazy clausification, as this decision simplifies the proof of its soundness and completeness through its connection with the puhr approach, which is a purely clausal approach.
