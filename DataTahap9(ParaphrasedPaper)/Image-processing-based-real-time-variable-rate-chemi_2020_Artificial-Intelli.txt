An explicit map of desired characteristics is utilized to regulate the application rate, whereas in the case of a sensor-based approach, data on desired properties is collected in real-time using sensors and the application rate is adjusted based on the processed information. The choice between these approaches largely depends on the nature and objectives of a specific site-specific farming task. Generally, the map-based approach is preferred for properties that remain relatively stable over a long period or change slowly, such as organic matter and soil texture, while the sensor-based approach is favored for rapidly changing soil properties and crop characteristics.

However, for variable-rate chemical spraying to control plant diseases, the map-based approach is not practical, as diseases spread rapidly across the entire field. This makes the accuracy of sample data and derived disease maps time-sensitive, as the disease distribution may have changed by the time the map is prepared. Additionally, these maps are not readily available for timely disease control decisions due to the time-consuming process of conventional visual disease estimation methods. Furthermore, the accuracy of the map-based variable-rate spraying system is affected by the precision of positioning devices, which is not an issue with the sensor-based approach. In the sensor-based approach, there are no additional labor costs.

Based on the reviewed literature, it is evident that an image processing technique, in conjunction with necessary electronic hardware and spraying systems, could be effectively utilized for variable-rate spraying of agrochemicals in diseased crops. Consequently, the aim of this study was to develop a real-time variable-rate chemical spraying system based on an image processing technique to ensure precise use of input chemicals based on the severity level of plant disease. To achieve this goal, the study set out the following specific objectives: (1) to develop an image processing algorithm for real-time estimation of plant disease severity level, and (2) to develop a variable-rate spraying system for accurate application of agrochemicals based on plant disease severity.

In this study, a chromatic aberration-based color image segmentation algorithm was developed for detecting diseased areas in paddy crops. The proposed algorithm consisted of three steps: extraction and analysis of color components, selection of a characteristic operator, and thresholding segmentation.

Disease severity is defined as the proportion of the diseased region to the total area of a sampling unit (leaf or plant surface), expressed as a percentage. By employing the image processing approach, the disease severity of paddy leaves was determined by the ratio of total pixels in the diseased region.

During the prototype operation, both spraying nozzles were left open throughout the spraying operation. However, in the variable-rate application mode, the nozzles were controlled by the activation of cameras and other functions, with their opening or closing determined by the actuation of solenoid valves, based on the severity level of plant disease. Before each test, the storage tank was filled to a specific mark, and the amount of chemical used was measured by refilling the tank to that mark.

The distance between the image capturing point and the spraying nozzles was 250 mm, and the total time lag between image acquisition and spraying was approximately 800 ms. This limited the maximum operational speed to 0.9 km/h. Therefore, the speed of operation in both modes was maintained at about 0.9 km/h.
