Complex mathematical models are often used to describe physical systems, with quantum physics in particular being based on intricate mathematical frameworks. The quest to distill fundamental concepts from these structures and to analyze specific quantum phenomena has a long history, dating back to the work of Birkhoff and von Neumann. Present-day efforts in this direction sometimes result in the development of simplified models.

It should be noted that there are various interpretations of test spaces in the scholarly literature. While we have considered them as a relational version of rays, other researchers view them as an abstraction of bases. This interpretation can also be linked through comprehension, but this discussion is best left for another occasion.

Dagger autonomous categories arguably provide a more semantically rich structure than dagger compact categories. They encompass not only the abstract composition and duality operations used to construct quantum systems and operations, which align with the global operations of the dagger compact structure, but also the complementarity relations modeled in quantum logic and presented as local structure in dagger compact categories. The concept of dagger autonomy emerges when complementarity is regarded as an integral aspect of the global structure of quantum computation.

Nevertheless, a more comprehensive or nuanced understanding does not necessarily lead to superior insights. One of the distinguishing features of the dagger compact structure is the convenience of performing calculations using a string diagram language. Is there an equally convenient extension of this language that accommodates the dagger autonomous structure? The usefulness of such an extension may hinge on the existence of such a language.
