The impact of GABA on human health has attracted significant attention in the field of food technology, leading to the availability of numerous GABA-containing food products such as germinated brown rice, chocolate, wine, and others in the market. Plants and their natural products have been utilized for centuries to combat various diseases and disorders, with recent ethnobotanical studies demonstrating the potential of medicinal plants and their active compounds for treating central nervous system-related ailments.
 
For the computational analysis in this study, the Schrödinger Suite's Maestro v10.2 was used, integrating various tools such as Prime for homology modeling, LigPrep for ligand preparation, Sitemap for binding site validation, grid generation for defining the target site, and Glide XP for docking purposes. CentOS Linux served as the operating system for these computational examinations.
 
The Sitemap tool was employed to validate the binding sites, identifying potential active binding sites and selecting one based on site scores and size of the site area for further investigation. Following the selection, the chosen site was used for grid generation, with parameters generated for grid box shape and values.
 
Additionally, the 32 ligand molecules’ 2D structures were converted to 3D using LigPrep, and optimized potentials for liquid simulations 2005 (OPLS2005) force field was utilized for geometry optimization. A subsequent analysis was carried out using the QuikProp tool in Maestro v10.2, assessing the ligand molecules based on parameters such as hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, blood-brain barrier, and central nervous system, as per Katsila et al.
 
Subsequently, structural validation was performed using a Ramachandran plot to assess the accuracy and reliability of residues between the template and target, revealing the occurrence of residues in various regions, with the majority in the favor region. Furthermore, a validated binding site was taken for grid generation to establish the possible binding site in the target.
 
The binding contact analysis displayed the interactions occurring between the ligand and the target protein, with the hydrogen bond side chain and back chain, as well as pi-pi stacking contacts, being illustrated. Moreover, the study indicated that curcumin demonstrated a valuable docking score and notable binding contacts with specific residues. Previous computational studies also supported the effectiveness of curcumin in various applications, including its potential for the prevention and treatment of health-related issues.
