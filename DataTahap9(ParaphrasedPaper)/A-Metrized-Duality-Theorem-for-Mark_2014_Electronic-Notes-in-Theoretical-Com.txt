We introduce a quantitative framework for both Markov processes and Aumann algebras and establish an expanded version of the representation theorem for metrized Markov processes compared to metrized Aumann algebras. This theorem demonstrates that given an arbitrary metrized Markov process, we can extend the Aumann algebra constructed in the previous section to form a metrized Aumann algebra that retains the pseudometric, and vice versa. In essence, the natural isomorphisms within the duality result in isometries.

The significance of this study lies in providing a more rigorous foundation for quantitative reasoning about Markov processes. While metric analogues of bisimulation have existed for over a decade, their impact has been limited. This is partly due to the lack of a clear understanding of completeness in metric reasoning and approximate reasoning in general, in contrast to ordinary logical reasoning. The standard Stone-type duality theorem captures the notion of completeness, and we hope that our work will facilitate a similar comprehension of approximate reasoning principles. There is still much work to be done, however. In a previous paper, we initiated an exploration into the relationship between logic and metrics on Markov processes, and the findings of this study may potentially strengthen and deepen these initial results.
