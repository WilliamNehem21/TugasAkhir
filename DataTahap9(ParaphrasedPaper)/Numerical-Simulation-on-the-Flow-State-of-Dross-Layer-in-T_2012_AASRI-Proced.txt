The flow state of the top dross layer in the tundish not only affects the oxidation of the molten steel, but also impacts the floating and adsorption of inclusions as well as the entrainment of steel to micro-inclusions. This study used the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to numerically simulate the influence of flow control on the stability of the dross layer and the likelihood of dross entrainment during the charging and normal casting processes in the tundish. The findings showed that an improved structural model can effectively stabilize the dross layer and reduce the risk of entrainment, thereby playing a crucial role in enhancing the cleanliness of the molten steel.

Surface defects on steel sheets have been linked to the entrainment of protecting dross in the tundish, indicating a need to improve the purity of steel and optimize the inclusion floating process. Previous research has also explored the effects of various tundish parameters on the fluctuation of molten steel and changes in the free surface and velocity field, contributing to a better understanding of the flow states of molten steel and protecting dross.

The VOF method, developed by Hirt & Nichols, was used in this study to simulate the state of the top dross layer and the flow of molten steel in the tundish during charging and continuous casting processes, with the aim of investigating the distribution and flow state at the interface. Additionally, the study provides valuable insights for the construction of tundish for the production of high purity steel.

To obtain accurate numerical results, the Gambit software was used for modeling and meshing, and the model scale was set at 1:1. The tundish dimensions and boundary conditions were carefully defined to ensure the fidelity of the simulations. Furthermore, two structural models of the tundish were created for analysis, showing that the flow control design significantly affects the stability of the dross layer and the probability of inclusions entrainment.

In Model 1, turbulence and pulse were generated in the vertical direction due to the control flow of the retaining wall and dam, which had a detrimental impact on the dross layer and the adsorption of floating inclusions. On the other hand, Model 2, which altered the conventional diversion and induced a rotational motion in the horizontal direction, facilitated the separation of inclusions while maintaining the stability of the dross layer. This alternative model was found to be significant for the production of high purity steel.
