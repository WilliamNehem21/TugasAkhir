The rise of digital cities is attributed to the advancements in internet and computer technologies. Digital cities primarily function as information service providers for urban residents, with a key aspect being the provision of public travel route information. In a typical mid-sized city, there are around one hundred public travel routes and one thousand stations. Consequently, city residents face the challenge of selecting suitable travel routes to optimize their travel time.

City traffic conditions exhibit regular fluctuations over time, for instance, during rush hours on working days, traffic congestion is common on main city roads. Therefore, when designing travel route systems, it is essential to consider the regularity of traffic fluctuations in order to offer convenient and time-efficient travel route solutions.

The bus route and station information in the city's public transport system serves as the data source for the public traffic transfer system. A public traffic transfer algorithm is used to generate all potential transfer solutions between two stations based on their start and destination points. These solutions are then sorted based on time or distance.

The actual public traffic routes are significantly influenced by the traffic conditions of city roads. As a result, people typically seek to avoid road sections with poor traffic conditions when choosing travel routes. Hence, the public traffic transfer algorithm should be able to predict the traffic status of bus transfer route at a specified time. This paper proposes achieving traffic status prediction through the data mining of historical traffic status data.

Each bus route in the city is uniquely identified by a number, which varies depending on the route direction. The route relation matrix categorizes the relation of bus routes into two types: intersections existing and intersections not existing. This matrix also indicates whether two routes can be reached via a certain number of transfers and records the number of transfer solutions between two routes using different intermediate routes. Actual bus routes may have multiple intersections.

The paper presents a necessary condition formula for changing from one route to another via a third route, although it acknowledges that this condition alone is not sufficient to guarantee a feasible transfer solution. Additional conditions such as the location of the start and target stations, as well as the position of the route intersection, also play a crucial role in determining the feasibility of the transfer solution. Furthermore, since routes have specific directions, a transfer solution may only be feasible for certain stations on the route.

To recommend the optimal transfer solution, it is necessary to understand the considerations of travelers when selecting travel routes. Based on a survey conducted in Hefei city in 2002, the top considerations for travelers when choosing public traffic routes are the minimum number of transfers (38.24%), minimum travel time (32.53%), shortest distance (20.51%), and minimum travel expense (8.71%).

The major considerations for travelers when selecting travel routes are the number of transfers and travel time, according to the aforementioned survey. The route transfer algorithm ensures that solutions with fewer transfers are obtained earlier than those with more transfers, thereby securing the optimal transfer solution in terms of transfer times.

Alternatively, the second consideration for travelers is travel time. As the travel time of a transfer solution is easily affected by road traffic conditions, the best method to save travel time is to select a transfer route that avoids road sections with poor traffic conditions.

The paper proposes reorganizing and analyzing the historical data of city traffic status and using data mining of the traffic history data to predict the traffic status of certain areas in the city. This prediction is used as a reference when selecting bus transfer solutions.

A data cube is used to model and analyze the data in the database from a multi-dimensional perspective. When evaluating transfer solutions, the most pertinent traffic information data is the traffic status of specific road sections at particular times. Therefore, a data cube is constructed in accordance with specific rules to facilitate this analysis.

By predicting the traffic status of road sections included in transfer solutions, it becomes possible to avoid road sections with high likelihood of congestion when selecting travel routes. This guidance aids travelers in selecting suitable bus travel routes for their journeys. For example, if two transfer solutions, A and B, are acquired through the route transfer algorithm, analyzing the road sections contained in these solutions through the data cube may reveal that solution B offers better traffic conditions than solution A at that specific time, thus leading to the recommendation of solution B to the traveler.

Route relation matrix M is used to describe the relationship between routes in the public traffic system. By performing matrix calculations, the transfer relations between bus routes can be determined, and the bus transfer algorithm outlined in this paper can be used to generate all feasible transfer solutions between two stations.
