The use of structural operational semantics (SOS) has been wide-ranging and diverse, with the transition system specification (TSS) offering a formalization of SOS that establishes a rigorous syntactic and semantic framework. The concept of TSS has provided the foundation for the development of meta-theories surrounding SOS, as evidenced by theories regarding congruence rule formats. From a purely theoretical standpoint, there is no inherent restriction on the use of existential quantification in the premises, and it is logical to explore the meta-theory of an SOS framework that allows for universal quantification over variables. Moreover, practical instances of operational semantics demonstrate the use of universal quantification in SOS rules.

It could be argued that universal quantification in certain examples can be addressed through a semantics-preserving transformation, where universally quantified variables/terms are replaced with all their possible instantiations. However, such a transformation may not always be desirable. In a broader framework, universal quantification can be seen as representing an (often infinite) number of existentially quantified premises and/or rules. Nevertheless, imposing restrictions on the framework, such as adhering to a specific congruence rule format, could alter the rules and extend the specification beyond the intended framework.

This paper takes a step towards expanding the SOS meta-theory to encompass universal quantification. The syntax of SOS rules is slightly extended to incorporate universal quantification and the use of disjunction in the premises of a rule. The semantics of such SOS rules are defined accordingly. A notable contribution of this paper is the proposal of a congruence rule format for strong bisimilarity that supports these new features, which, to the authors' knowledge, is not currently available. However, the authors acknowledge that while they are introducing universal quantification at a basic level, this suffices for their current applications.

The authors also delve into the question of making the implicit existential quantification in rules explicit, and consider whether the existentially bound variables are bound outside or inside the universal quantification. Additionally, they discuss the syntactic constraints associated with the untyft format, emphasizing the impact of dropping these constraints on the congruence meta-result. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results achieved, future research goals, and points of inspiration for the introduction of universal quantification.

In summary, this paper aims to expand the SOS meta-theory to encompass universal quantification, introduces a rule format supporting such features, and outlines potential areas for future exploration, including the introduction of a framework supporting full first-order logic and the relaxation of the well-foundedness assumption in congruence meta-results.
