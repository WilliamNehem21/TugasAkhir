In this academic paper, we will briefly discuss the reasons for undertaking the current study. We aim to utilize the standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) to incorporate formal methods into the software development process. Our focus is on addressing the challenges involved in extracting specifications into process calculi from potentially excessive or incomplete information within the UML description. The ultimate objective is to create a design environment where users can solely interact with UML to conduct formal analysis of their applications.

In our work, we plan to extract information about branching points from state diagrams, which depict the behavior of individual objects. We will confine a state diagram to a set of transitions that represent communications and refer to it as a restricted state diagram. We will identify a branching point in a restricted state diagram if a given state has outgoing transitions corresponding to more than one set of branching messages. Additionally, we will define the skeleton of a state diagram as a restriction of a restricted state diagram to a set of transitions that belong to a specific branching point.
