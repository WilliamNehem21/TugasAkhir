Reynolds associates each category with a property. However, each category is not associated with just one property, but with multiple properties, each corresponding to a different color. These multiple properties are crucial for interpreting parametricity when it is nested, as using a single property leads to inconsistencies. Moreover, these properties can be defined in logic: the type "a@i" specifies that "a" satisfies the parametricity property associated with type "a" for color "i." For each term "a" and color "i," the term "a(i0)" denotes the erasure of "i" in "a," defined by induction (definition 2.2) and can be understood as a realization of "a."

Another distinguishing characteristic of proposals for parametricity is the type of model underlying the semantics. Krishnaswami and Dreyer propose a model based on q-per. Atkey et al. propose a model based on reflexive graphs. The model we employ is based on cubes (functions from subsets of colors). In Bernardy and Moulin, the cubes were concretized as syntax in an underlying calculus, while in our work, we refine a presheaf structure.

We have introduced a new type theory with internalized parametricity. Our model construction has allowed us to demonstrate the consistency of the system. The remaining component needed to build a type-checker is a decision algorithm for the conversion relation. This checker could serve as a basic proof assistant for a type theory with parametricity.
