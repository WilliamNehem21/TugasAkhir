The authors propose a method for creating a "b-coloring" of a graph G by ensuring that in any coloring, all color classes contain at least one "b-vertex." They then define the b-chromatic number of a graph G as the largest natural number k for which G can be b-colored with k colors. They also demonstrate that determining the b-chromatic number for a graph is an NP-complete problem. 

Based on these findings, they suggest examining the b-continuity of graphs with large girth. They show that regular graphs with a girth of at least 6 and no cycles of length 7 are b-continuous, and later, they extend this to all graphs with girth at least 10. In this paper, they refine this result to encompass graphs with girth at least 8.

It is expected that Theorem 1.2 contains a non-constructive component. The subsequent sections of the paper cover basic definitions and results, present proofs, and provide additional commentary on the proof while posing open questions for further study.
