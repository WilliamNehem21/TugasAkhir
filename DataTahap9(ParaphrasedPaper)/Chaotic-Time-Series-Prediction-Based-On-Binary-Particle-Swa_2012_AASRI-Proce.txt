The phase space reconstruction theory has found application in numerous research areas for predicting chaotic time series. The local linear model is commonly employed in chaos prediction due to its versatility and computational efficiency. The parameters of the local linear prediction model, such as embedding dimension and time delay, can differ from those used in phase space reconstruction. The binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is utilized to select optimal parameters for the local linear prediction model due to its robust search capability. The primary goal is to enhance the predictive accuracy of the local linear model. This paper presents the application of the local linear one-step and multi-step predictive models to chaotic time series, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulation results.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the local linear prediction model, BPSO, and adaptive weighted fusion algorithm. Section 3 illustrates the new local linear prediction model, while Section 4 presents simulation and results. Discussion is provided in Section 5, and the conclusion is given in Section 6.

Traditionally, the parameters of the local linear model align with those of phase space reconstruction in conventional predictive methods. It has been suggested that assigning different values to these parameters can improve predictive outcomes. The authors propose estimating the optimal value for one parameter while the other is held constant by minimizing the standard prediction error. While this method does improve predictive accuracy, it is noted that there is always a corresponding value for one parameter when the other is fixed, and thus the obtained value may not be optimal in theory. This paper addresses this issue by utilizing BPSO to simultaneously evaluate both parameters.

To further improve predictive accuracy, alternative methods such as the adaptive weighted fusion algorithm can be employed to fuse the obtained data. This algorithm automatically allocates weighted factors based on adaptive criteria and combines the outputs from the local one-step and multi-step prediction models, theoretically minimizing predictive error and enhancing accuracy.
