Ad hoc wireless networks are networks in which nodes can communicate with each other without relying on a centralized infrastructure. These networks have numerous civil and military applications, such as providing communication support in battlefield and search and rescue operations, as well as monitoring and tracking objects. One major challenge in ad hoc networks is to minimize energy consumption, as nodes are often powered by batteries and may not have the option of replacing them during operation. Therefore, there is significant interest in developing alternative strategies to enhance and optimize energy usage in wireless networks to prolong network lifetime. These strategies can be broadly categorized into techniques that enable nodes to switch between active and idle modes and techniques that allow nodes to adjust their transmission power.

In contrast to traditional multiple-hop wireless networks, where intermediate nodes collaborate to relay data packets from a source node to the destination, cooperative communication (CC) is a physical layer technique that enables single antenna devices to capitalize on the benefits of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by leveraging spatial diversity. Recent research has explored CC in conjunction with topology control techniques to decrease energy consumption, improve network connectivity, and enhance network lifetime. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no investigation into using CC to augment connectivity to a sink in ad hoc wireless networks.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of related works on topology control and cooperative communication. Section 3 describes the communication and network models and formulates the primary problem addressed in this work. Section 4 details the CoopSink protocol, and Section 5 showcases simulation results comparing the proposed scheme with other similar and prominent strategies. Finally, Section 6 concludes the work.

The paper also discusses various optimized solutions for the basic algorithm and introduces a beacon-based protocol for topology maintenance. A localized minimum spanning tree (LMST) algorithm is proposed to construct the final topology with a maximum node degree of 6. Comprehensive surveys on this topic can be found in prior works.

Cooperative communication (CC) is a technique that enables single antenna devices to utilize features of MIMO systems. It involves transmitting independent copies of the original signal from a set of nodes, facilitating the reduction of the fading effect caused by multipath propagation. This model assumes that each wireless node transmits data and acts as a cooperative agent, relaying data from other users. While some works have examined the use of topology control and CC to enhance network coverage in ad hoc networks, there has been limited exploration of CC-links to improve connectivity to a sink node in wireless ad hoc networks.

Section 3 of the paper describes the CC model and the corresponding network model used in the study and formalizes the primary problem addressed. The model is similar to those used in prior works.

The authors proposed metrics to evaluate the performance of the CoopSink protocol, including measures for connectivity improvements, energy consumption, route quality, and average number of CC edges in the resulting topology. The paper presents comparative results demonstrating that CoopSink outperformed other proposals in terms of route efficiency and connectivity to the sink, thereby demonstrating its ability to utilize CC links more efficiently.

Overall, the paper introduces the CoopSink protocol, outlines its model, and provides simulation results to demonstrate its effectiveness compared to other strategies.
