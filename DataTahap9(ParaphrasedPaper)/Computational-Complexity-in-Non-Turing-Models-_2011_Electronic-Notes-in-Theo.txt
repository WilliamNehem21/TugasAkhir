Similarly to conventional algorithms, the system has a practical limitation on the size of numbers it can factorize. However, unlike traditional algorithms, the system does not experience an increase in calculation time as the input number approaches this limit. It is important to note that this limit is not imposed by traditional complexity theory considerations such as run-time or memory space, but rather by the increasing precision required by the user of the system.

We recommend the consideration of a wider range of resources, including not only traditional algorithmic measures such as time and space, but also physical measures such as precision. This perspective is discussed in section 3.1.

To improve these limitations, it is beneficial to explore as broad a range as possible of solution methods for a given problem. However, in practice, each set of solutions considered is likely to be derived from a single model of computation, often that of the Turing machine. This restriction arises due to the inherent challenge in meaningfully comparing the complexity of instances from different computation models.
