The self-noise level of a sonar platform area is closely associated with the performance of the sonar. Decreasing the self-noise level not only enhances the sonar's detection signal capacity but also increases its operational range. Predicting the self-noise level can provide a quantitative estimate, and predicting the effects of different noise sources on self-noise can assist in determining measures to control self-noise and its quantitative technical indicators.
