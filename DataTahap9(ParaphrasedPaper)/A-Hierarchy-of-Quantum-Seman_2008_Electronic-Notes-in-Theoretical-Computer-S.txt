Several approaches have been proposed for defining the semantics of quantum programs in different domains [1,4,12,16]. Abramsky has introduced a semantics based on probabilistic power domains, while Selinger's approach associates a completely positive map with each program. In this paper, we focus on introducing a semantical domain based on admissible transformations, specifically multisets of linear operators.

Regarding the formalism for representing quantum states and evolutions, it is found that at least two formalisms are suitable for representing quantum states: pure states (i.e., vectors in a Hilbert space) and mixed states (i.e., density matrices). Additionally, for representing quantum evolutions, at least three options are available: superoperators acting on density matrices, probabilistic functions acting on pure states, and admissible transformations.

An outline of the proof is as follows. Induction is used on the command c. The proof is straightforward for the commands skip, composition, and the unitary transformations h, t, and cnot. In the case of if, the main components of the proof are identified as coming from 3.11, illustrating that [ex2]]a=[[ex3]]a. To demonstrate the practicality of the admissible semantics, it is noted in the definition that the presence of a while loop in a command c implies that the admissible semantics of c is an infinite multiset, where each linear operator of the admissible transformation represents a computational path.
