The paper discusses the use of RFID tags as a replacement for barcodes, highlighting their advantages such as global uniqueness, contactless operation, and resistance to environmental factors. However, it also addresses issues related to data security and privacy. The proposed RFID system consists of three main components: desynchronization resilience, mutual authentication, and security against various attacks such as eavesdropping, replay attacks, tag cloning, tag tracing, and user privacy violation. The paper introduces a protocol that uses shared secrets and information to ensure consistency between the tag and the backend server, preventing desynchronization attacks. It also provides mechanisms for secret updates, tag delegation, and tag ownership transfer.

The protocol involves steps such as the tag computing its current ID and transmitting it to the reader, which forwards it to the server for authentication. The paper emphasizes the security features of the proposed protocol, such as protection against eavesdropping, replay attacks, tag cloning, and indistinguishability. It also discusses the scheme's message size and storage cost, comparing it to other schemes proposed in related literature. Overall, the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of message size and storage cost, making it a promising solution for RFID security and privacy concerns.
