Using the same approach, it has been demonstrated that the set of differences of computably enumerable real numbers (d.c.e. reals) and the set of computably approximable real numbers (c.a. reals) constitute real closed fields. The d.c.e. result was also established almost simultaneously and independently by ng.

However, the aforementioned result is essentially meaningless if w.c.l.l. functions do not exist. Nonetheless, it has been shown that they do exist. This can be deduced by considering a useful theorem from real analysis: if f is differentiable on an open set e, then f is locally Lipschitz on e.
