This paper introduces a thermomagnetic motor that operates based on a thermal-magnetic coupled dynamic model, utilizing a ferromagnetic material near its curie point. The motor is characterized by its thermal and magnetic properties, and an analytical expression for the generated torque linking magnetic, thermal, and geometrical parameters is provided. A machine design based on this theory is proposed, and its performance is numerically simulated and experimentally verified using a rotor made of gadolinium. The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a thermomagnetic motor that can continuously rotate and possesses practical mechanical features, potentially serving as a source of electrical energy when coupled with an electric generator.

The driving force in the thermomagnetic motor is generated by a thermally induced permeability difference within the rotor. By heating one side of the rotor, a local modification of permeability in the soft magnetic material compared to the cooler area can create a driving force when the rotor is placed in a magnetic field. This force can be further enhanced if the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the rotor exceeds the Curie's temperature of the magnetic material. Traditional ferromagnetic materials with high Curie's temperatures have limitations in this context, resulting in poor motor performance. To address this, the paper presents a design that maximizes the thermal coupling between the rotor and heat sources to achieve continuous torque generation.

The rotor structure is designed with multiple tubes installed along a circumference to maximize heat exchange and contain the ferromagnetic material undergoing the phase transition. Experimental testing includes measurements of standstill torque versus heat flow and acceleration curves, demonstrating the practical viability of the rotating Curie motor with improved mechanical characteristics. The paper includes a mathematical model for motor design, explanations of the dq theory of the Curie motor, and demonstrates the significant role of temperature difference in torque generation, governed by thermal conduction and advection within the rotor. Finally, the experimental validation of the proposed theory is presented.
