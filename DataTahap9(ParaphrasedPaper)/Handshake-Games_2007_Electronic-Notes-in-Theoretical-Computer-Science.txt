This paper introduces a game model for semantical analysis of handshake circuits, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing circuit composition in an associative manner. It establishes a compact-closed category of handshake games and strategies, and extends its analysis to the language tangram by defining semantics for the language through denotations in the model.

In the game model, players and opponents take turns to play moves, with turn alternation imposed only on the threads of play due to the concurrent framework. Quiescent plays represent finite points where a player may stop to wait for the opponent to move, while passive plays represent moments where the player has no choice but to wait. The concepts of reorder-closedness and receptivity are inherited from handshake circuits literature but are also found in the game semantics community.

The paper emphasizes the importance of positionality, a property of concurrent strategies based on the relation of homotopy between plays, and the conditions necessary for determinism. It discusses the preservation of determinism by composition and the possibility of an opponent forcing a deterministic strategy to follow a specific course, highlighting the need for strategies to contain specific infinite plays.

The paper also delves into the compact-closedness of the model, enabling the modeling of internal loops within circuits and the potential for a more refined characterization of the category. It suggests leveraging models of the geometry of interaction for structural comparisons and proposes a categorical approach as a feasible way to contain larger classes of asynchronous circuits.
