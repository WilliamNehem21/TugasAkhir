The article can be interpreted as presenting a suggested approach for utilizing the information in an IFC file for navigation purposes. This approach involves extending the IFCOWL ontology to match user actions with different room types, and it achieves these objectives within a reasonable processing time.

The World Wide Web contains a vast amount of information encoded using HTML, which is primarily intended for displaying information in web browsers rather than organizing it meaningfully. The semantic web concept aims to encode information in a way that is understandable to humans and computer systems, leading to the development of increasingly complex forms of knowledge expression for true semantic interoperability.

Several works in the literature discuss issues with the conversion from IFC to OWL, particularly regarding differences in how structures are represented in each format. Despite these challenges, various conversions are available, as the transition from IFC to OWL is not uniform, with each author adapting the conversion to specific user needs.

Notably, the article discusses the development of the IFCOWL ontology, building on previous work to propose a method for generating the ifcwod ontology to enhance the linking of IFC data in the semantic web field. The authors also propose improvements to the IFCOWL ontology by including new classes that explain relationships between existing classes, particularly those between IFC object occurrences, object types, and predefined property sets.

The paper further describes the system implementation process, emphasizing the use of IFCOWL to support indoor navigation techniques. It highlights the potential for extracting information from IFC files to support various applications, such as determining evacuation routes and robot navigation. The proposed method aims to improve the representation of the navigation environment by including geometrical data, high-level qualitative information, and relationships with other objects.

The authors also discuss their strategy for simplifying the management of the ontology and detail how they convert RDF lists to well-known text (WKT) in the Ifc2rdf translator runtime. Additionally, they explain the use of data properties to indicate the global position of instances and the inclusion of characteristic elements of different room types within the ontology.

In conclusion, the paper presents an approach based on the IFCOWL ontology to support indoor navigation, proposing various extensions and modifications to enhance its functionality for processing navigation destinations and deducing room locations.
