Although the one-way quantum computing model has been acknowledged as a crucial theoretical framework since its inception, it has only recently seen some of its measurement patterns realized in laboratory settings. Before extending these implementations to larger examples on physical substrates, several important questions must be addressed. Of particular interest in this discussion is the efficient implementation of the feedforward mechanism, which allows measurement angles to depend on the outcomes of previous measurements. It has been demonstrated that a variant of the original one-way model, involving only Pauli measurements, is approximately universal. Consequently, in executing a specific pattern, the feedforward mechanism only needs to contend with a choice between two options.

The first condition ensures that the exponent for computing a correction can be determined from the existing outcomes by the time it needs to be carried out. The second condition prevents qubits from being reused. Although reusing qubits could reduce the number of physical qubits required, it disrupts the standardization property and necessitates re-entanglement, which hinders the initial entanglement process. Therefore, reusing qubits is considered an optional optimization that is not accounted for in the pattern language. Additionally, this condition ensures that each qubit undergoes at most one measurement, allowing for the sensible notation of "si" to represent the outcome of the measurement performed on qubit i. Finally, the third condition guarantees that by the time all measurements are completed, the output qubits are no longer entangled with the rest, allowing them to be effectively read out of the computation space.
