The authors of the academic paper discussed the significance of ensuring consistency and completeness in specifications, particularly in the context of embedded systems. Completeness was defined as the presence of a response for every possible class of inputs, while consistency was defined as the absence of contradictory behavior, including unintentional non-determinism. Traditionally, these properties were verified manually, but with evolving specifications, automatic verification is beneficial in easing and expediting the analysis process. The proposed approach in the paper involves translating specifications into propositional logic formulas and using a generally available solver to automate the verification of completeness and consistency, demonstrating a language-agnostic solution.

The paper also compared its approach to existing mapping techniques between abstract state machine (ASM) languages and finite state machines, highlighting differences that enable a more concise state space generation. Additionally, the paper mentioned the relevance of SAT solvers in various automated analyses, despite their NP-complete nature, and discussed the similarities with model checkers in terms of benefits and drawbacks.

The authors also introduced the concept of rule applications in the environment and discussed the timed abstract state machine (TASM) language as an extension of ASM for real-time systems, emphasizing the inclusion of nonfunctional properties in the TASM language, such as time and resource consumption. They provided a formal definition of completeness in the TASM world and detailed how it can be expressed as a SAT problem for automatic verification. Similarly, they defined consistency and its application to TASM specifications, presenting a SAT problem for its automatic verification as well.

Furthermore, the paper discussed the types and constructs included in the TASM language, as well as the translation process from TASM to SAT, particularly focusing on the conversion of integer variables to user-defined types for ease of Boolean formula conversion.

In conclusion, the paper proposed a language-agnostic approach for automatic verification of completeness and consistency in specifications, leveraging SAT solvers. It also addressed the potential scalability and optimization challenges of the translation process and its feasibility for real-time system specifications.
