This paper presents a novel approach to concurrent semantics that separates concurrency from nondeterminism, allowing for the description of deterministic concurrent behavior in recursive processes that access consumable resources. It is based on the use of real and complex multi-pomsets as algebraic domains and introduces a process language with deterministic quantitative process operators, including renaming, hiding, restriction, serial and parallel compositions, and recursion. The paper also introduces a deterministic structural operational machine that yields linear and complex operational semantics, and a compositional denotational semantics using a functional domain over environments of complex multi-pomsets. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated by proving that the denotational semantics is fully abstract with respect to both linear and complex operational semantics.

Prior work in truly concurrent semantic approaches with operational and denotational programming semantics was limited, with notable contributions by Diekert & Gastin, Gastin & Teodosiu, and Gastin & Mislove, who developed denotational models based on pomsets advocated by Pratt. This work, building on the concept of processes interacting with resources, is particularly relevant in the field of computer science.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background on partial orders, Section 3 introduces the domains of real and complex multi-pomsets, Section 4 presents the process language and defines consumption semantics, Section 5 describes the deterministic structural operational machine producing linear and complex operational semantics, Section 6 outlines the compositional denotational semantics, and Section 7 presents the main results regarding congruence and full abstraction of the denotational semantics with respect to both linear and complex operational semantics.

The paper also discusses the representation of actions consuming resources, where the multiplicity attached to an action measures the time consumed or produced. It offers examples from computer science and workflow management to illustrate this concept. Additionally, it provides a generalization of the parallel composition construct to model data-parallel programs running on PRAMs.

Finally, the paper addresses the intentional omission of the non-deterministic choice operator and proposes alternative ways of handling choice, such as using power-domains over complex multi-pomsets, or enriching real multi-pomsets with a relation on events expressing conflict of choices.
