The concept of edge computing represents a paradigm shift that can enhance the quality of service and the efficiency of resource utilization within network systems. Originating from distributed computing, edge computing leverages the hardware resources of devices located in close proximity to user terminals to deliver high-quality services with minimal latency. Similar to cloud computing, edge computing provides services to users over the network, but it differs in that it is decentralized, thereby eliminating the need for a centralized server to manage and provide the services. Consequently, the client-oriented nature of service provision in edge computing results in higher, more reliable, and secure service quality compared to cloud computing. Given its clear advantages, edge computing is well-suited for various network-based scenarios, including the internet of things, wireless sensor networks, smart cities, and more.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the preliminary concepts used in the design of the proposed scheme, while Section 3 introduces the system model and design objectives. Section 4 outlines the specifics of the proposed scheme, and Section 5 provides an evaluation encompassing security and performance analyses. Finally, the findings of this study are summarized in Section 6.

Layer 2 of the proposed scheme involves the service provider, which comprises the edge devices in edge computing. These devices, located in proximity to the internet of things (IoT) within the network, operate using 5G communication networks, leading to improved service response speed and information transmission quality. Unlike cloud computing, the resource center in edge computing is closer to terminals, allowing distributed devices to deliver high-quality services with minimal latency. The storage resources, computing capabilities, and edge services of edge devices are managed using the concept of software-definition, thus ensuring flexibility in service and resource provision. However, the inherent nature of edge devices as both honest and curious to stored data necessitates periodic integrity checks and audits to safeguard against potential data tampering or deletion.

Layer 3, the server/controller layer, is centered around the Edge Service Controller (ESC), which functions as the management and control center for scheduling resources in edge computing and facilitating collaboration among devices, storage, computing capabilities, and services. Additionally, the ESC serves as the Key Generation Center (KGC) and oversees the distributed data integrity auditing in edge computing, standing as a fully trusted entity capable of generating and computing parameters and keys according to the proposed scheme algorithms.

Detailed descriptions of the proposed scheme are presented in this section, beginning with a high-level overview of the auditing process. This is followed by an in-depth exploration of key generation, data tag generation, data auditing challenges, storage proof generation, and data integrity auditing phases.

The proposed scheme incorporates data auditing challenges, with the ESC tasked with periodically auditing the data blocks stored in edge devices to enhance data storage security. The auditing results of stored data serve as a critical factor in evaluating the reputation of edge devices in data storage.
