The publication discusses the development of a tool named the augmented redex trail (ART) that provides a detailed trace of computations in the lazy functional language Haskell. This trace is designed to support program comprehension and debugging by offering various ways to visualize and analyze the computation process. The structure of the ART is inspired by graph rewriting implementations of functional languages and is formally described in the paper. The authors emphasize the importance of obtaining detailed information about the internal workings of a computation, noting that it is essential not only for debugging but also for other purposes such as checking program consistency, reverse-engineering, and learning to program.

The Haskell Tracer (HAT) integrates different methods to generate a unified trace, the ART, during program execution. The paper describes the process of transforming a Haskell program into a new program that generates the ART when executed. The authors acknowledge the complexity of the ART due to the inherent complexity of the Haskell language and the involvement of two programs (the original and the transformed one) in its formation. They also discuss the properties and practical applications of the ART, as well as its potential for locating faults in computations.

The authors also explore the use of term graph rewriting to provide operational semantics for functional programs. They discuss the advantages of using graphs to represent computations, highlighting the importance of sharing common subterms for space efficiency and a close resemblance to real implementations of functional languages. They also address the challenges associated with graph representation and provide reasoning for the non-deterministic nature of their rewriting process.

The paper outlines the properties and limitations of the ART, concluding that it can be highly effective in supporting program comprehension and fault localization in functional programs. The authors express their intention to further explore essential properties of various views based on the ART and to prove the correctness of different methods for analyzing computations.
