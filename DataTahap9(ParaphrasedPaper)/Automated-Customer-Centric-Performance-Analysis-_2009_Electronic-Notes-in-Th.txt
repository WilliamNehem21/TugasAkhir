Petri nets were initially created as a visual formalism for delineating concurrency and synchronization in distributed systems and are often referred to as place-transition nets in their simplest form. Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs) build upon place-transition nets by integrating timing information.

Colored Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (CGSPNs) expand upon GSPNs by assigning colors to tokens. Consequently, the marking of a place consists of a multiset containing varying quantities of tokens of each color. Transitions possess different firing modes that are activated based on the colors of the tokens in their input places and modify the multisets of tokens in their input and output places upon firing.

When assessing the readiness of transitions and determining the locations where tokens will be removed and placed during transitions, tagged tokens must only be carried along tagged arcs. Normal tokens, on the other hand, can be transported by both tagged and normal arcs. Tagged tokens are considered as normal tokens when evaluating whether a transition is enabled in a particular marking.

A performance tree query is depicted as a tree structure comprising nodes and connecting arcs. Nodes perform two roles: operation nodes represent performance-related functions, such as the computation of a passage time density, while value nodes serve as the inputs to these functions, such as a set of states, an action, or simply numerical or boolean constants.
