Zeng et al. introduced a novel search algorithm that utilizes an improved asymmetric scalar-product preserving encryption technique and encrypted inverted index technology to enable location-based service (LBS) queries over encrypted data in a cloud environment. This approach allows users to define both geographical parameters and search keywords. Upon completing a search, the cloud service returns point of interest (POI) records that match the specified area and keywords. In a similar vein, Yang et al. presented a privacy-preserving scheme for k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries in a road network setting, leveraging Voronoi diagrams, 2-hop tag index, and cryptographic primitives to simultaneously safeguard the privacy of spatial data and KNN queries, while also enabling verification of query results.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the system model and design objectives, Section 3 provides some background information, Section 4 details the construction of the proposed scheme, Section 5 delves into the security analysis, and Section 6 offers a performance evaluation. Finally, Section 7 presents the paper's conclusion.

In order to ensure the confidentiality of LBS data, all LBS data is initially encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud. Additionally, the Location-Based Service Provider (LSP) offers registration services for LBS users. Upon successful registration, the LSP transmits an authentication certificate and key to the user via a secure communication channel.
