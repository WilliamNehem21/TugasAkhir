This academic paper investigates the potential use of digital imaging techniques and machine learning models to predict microfossils extracted from rock samples, as an alternative to the traditional method of identifying them individually under a microscope. The manual nature of these processes, including labeling, is time-consuming, especially given the large quantities and diverse morphological structures of microfossils. The study proposes a transfer learning framework based on a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model and various pre-trained deep learning models to predict the genus and species of microfossils in the Globotruncanita and Globotruncana genera.

The research aims to provide more efficient and robust predictions for microfossil images captured with low-cost light microscopy. The study evaluates different performance metrics and demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves high prediction scores, with accuracy exceeding 99% and an area under the curve (AUC) score exceeding 0.99 for genus-level prediction, and accuracy exceeding 81% and AUC score exceeding 0.89 for species-level prediction.

The paper focuses on the identification of six microfossils belonging to the Globotruncana and Globotruncanita genera, which are challenging to classify due to their similar morphological structures. The study utilizes various deep learning models and a custom CNN architecture to classify these microfossils, and it extends the dataset by adding three new species of the Globotruncanita genus. The main goal is to reduce the manual efforts required by paleontologists and provide accurate predictions for microfossils using low-cost imaging technology.

The paper discusses the challenges associated with limited datasets, hand-crafted feature engineering, and the need for deep learning models to accurately predict microfossils at the species and genus level, particularly for the Globotruncanita and Globotruncana genera.

The study highlights the potential of deep learning methods and transfer learning for microfossil identification, contrasting them with conventional methods and hybrid approaches. It also discusses the limitations of feature extraction with traditional machine learning techniques and the application of deep learning in the field of paleontology.

The paper emphasizes the importance of continuous evidence of evolutionary changes in planktonic foraminifers and the role of morphological features in identifying species and establishing phylogenetic relationships.

In addition, the paper provides a detailed description of the deep learning models used, such as VGG16, ResNet, and InceptionV3, and their application in microfossil identification. It also discusses model complexity, training procedures, and model performance evaluation.

Overall, the paper contributes to the potential use of digital imaging and machine learning techniques in paleontological research, specifically in the identification of microfossils, and outlines the challenges and future directions in this field.
