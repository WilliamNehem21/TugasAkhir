This paper provides an overview of recent developments in real-time Maude, which extends the Maude rewriting logic tool to enable the formal specification and analysis of object-based real-time systems. It highlights the ease and versatility of specification and supports a range of analysis methods, such as symbolic simulation, unbounded and time-bounded reachability analysis, and LTL model checking. Real-time Maude is particularly useful for specifying and analyzing systems with unbounded features that cannot be modeled by current timed/hybrid automaton-based tools. The paper addresses the trade-off between expressiveness and generality of modeling formalism and the availability of decidable and complete analysis methods, particularly in the context of real-time systems. It also presents two case studies illustrating the application of real-time Maude in modeling wireless sensor network algorithms and scheduling algorithms. The paper discusses the challenges and complexities involved in modeling and analyzing time-dependent behavior in wireless sensor networks, and it explains how real-time Maude can be applied to model and reason about such behavior. The paper also highlights the advantages and limitations of real-time Maude, demonstrating its expressive power and generality as well as the challenges associated with achieving completeness in its analyses.
