The paper discusses using trial and error learning to improve rewards, which eliminates the need for pre-determined traffic profiles and addresses challenges in utility maximization. However, it notes that this approach often performs poorly in large state-action spaces, known as the curse of dimensionality. The paper proposes that combining deep neural networks (DNNs) with this approach can help address the challenge by tackling feature extraction and optimal policy search issues, especially in multi-domain and joint multi-dimensional contexts. The study further explores the role of Bayesian methods in reinforcement learning (RL), introduces a Bayesian RL algorithm, and examines its theoretical and empirical properties. It also provides an overview of RL and deep RL methods and their application in economics. Additionally, the paper delves into inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL), which learn from non-numerical rewards.

The paper emphasizes the increasing interest in deep RL applications in wireless networks, particularly in cognitive, autonomous, intelligent 5G networks and beyond. It reviews AI and machine learning (ML) applications in the design and operation of 5G and beyond networks, and outlines various research publications from 2009 to 2018. Furthermore, the paper presents comprehensive tutorials on RL and deep RL and provides an overview of 5G network slicing, its technical requirements, and relevant 3GPP standardization efforts. It also compiles useful resources specific to RL and deep RL frameworks. In addition, the paper contrasts with existing studies, as it focuses on the research connections between deep RL and 5G network slicing, particularly on its application in key network slicing functionalities essential to infrastructure providers (InPs) and slice tenants.

The paper reviews major RL and deep RL platforms for developing and training agents, along with recent advances in deep RL research and technologies. It emphasizes the potential use of deep RL in wireless communication domains while also introducing various resources and open-source management platforms. The paper also delves into the reinforcement learning process, including the loop involving state and rewards, and discusses the types of environments suitable for RL.

It outlines the use of dynamic programming methods in scenarios where the system model is available, highlights significant developments in deep RL, and discusses the potential benefits of employing deep Q-learning (DQL) in resource allocation in network slicing applications. Moreover, it highlights research efforts that aim to understand and improve the performance of DQL. The paper underscores the significant impact of deep RL in enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of 5G and beyond mobile networks.

The paper provides historical background on wireless communication, emphasizing the revolutionary impact of wireless technologies starting from 1G to 5G networks. It discusses the architecture of 5G systems, the advent of network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN), and the impact of these technologies on network deployment and scalability. In addition, it covers the development of network slicing, NFV, and virtualization technologies, including hypervisor and container-based virtualization.

The paper explores the role of virtual network functions (VNFs) in NFV and the evolution of network virtualization from virtual machines to containerization. It outlines the use of hypervisors to support multiple VMs and explains the orchestration and management of containers in cloud-native network architectures. Moreover, it details the procedures and challenges related to multi-domain network slicing and resource management across various administrative domains.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the application of AI and ML techniques, such as deep RL, in addressing the challenges of resource management and network slicing in 5G and beyond networks. It emphasizes the need for efficient resource allocation, traffic forecasting, and prediction methods in slice lifecycle management and advocates for the application of AI/ML to overcome the limitations of traditional statistical models. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for accelerating deep multi-agent RL research to address the complex and dynamic nature of 5G and beyond network environments.
