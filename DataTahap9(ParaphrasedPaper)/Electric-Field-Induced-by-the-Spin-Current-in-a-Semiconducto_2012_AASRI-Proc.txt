This research paper examines the spin current and the spin-current-induced electric field in a dresselhaus nanowire (quantum wire) by analyzing the electron wave-functions and defining the spin current. The study calculates the linear and angular spin current densities and their induced electric fields. The results show that two nonzero linear spin current density elements exhibit peaks at the center of the nanowire, with their strengths being influenced by the number of propagation modes and the dresselhaus constant. Additionally, the spin-current-induced electric field can be observed for the dresselhaus quantum wire, providing a means of detecting spin current.
