This article serves as an initial effort to effectively reconstruct the theory of Walsh-Fourier series. While Walsh-Fourier series and Haar wavelets have become important tools in digital processing, it appears that researchers like Haar, Rademacher, Walsh, and Fine had already explored these topics in the mid-twentieth century out of mathematical interest. The theory of Walsh-Fourier series is approached similarly to that of Fourier series, but it involves replacing trigonometric functions with Walsh functions.

Theorem 2.14 states that a bounded function f is Riemann integrable if and only if the Lebesgue measure of the set containing all e-discontinuous points is zero. In this scenario, f is also Lebesgue integrable, and both integrals yield the same value.
