This study presents a domain-theoretic interpretation of a probabilistic process algebra, offering a simple calculus for finite-state processes that incorporate both nondeterministic and probabilistic choices. The denotational model utilizes the probabilistic powerdomain of Jones and Plotkin, supplemented with a geometrically convex variant of the Plotkin powerdomain. An operational model is introduced to define transition rules, enabling processes to transit to probability distributions across states. The research demonstrates a complete abstraction result, indicating that two processes possess the same denotation if and only if they are considered probabilistically bisimilar. Furthermore, the study establishes the soundness and completeness of the expected laws for probability and nondeterminism in relation to the denotational model.

By using the probabilistic powerdomain to represent probabilistic choice and a geometrically convex variant of the Plotkin powerdomain to model nondeterministic choice, this paper presents a domain-theoretic semantics for a probabilistic process algebra. In addition, an operational semantics is provided for the process algebra, and the research shows that the domain model is fully abstract with respect to probabilistic bisimilarity. The study focuses on finitestate processes, limiting the process algebra to include prefixing, probabilistic choice, nondeterministic choice, and recursion. The completeness proof is conducted through the domain model, as it proves to be more convenient than the operational model.

The paper discusses a probabilistic transition of process p to involve a b-action with probability 1/2 or an a-action with the same probability, leading back to p in either case. This addresses the right branch of process q. Additionally, due to the continuous semantics, it is inferred that p can do an action a with probability 1 and then return to p. This fulfills the left branch of q, indicating that p can perform any action that q can.

The domain-theoretic semantics for probabilistic agents corresponds to a form of probabilistic bisimulation. While definitions of bisimulation for agents with both probabilistic and nondeterministic choices have been proposed previously, this study's definition considers divergence in the operational semantics.
