The initial denotational semantics for a quantum programming language known as qfc was conceptualized by the first author. This semantics was constructed compositionally within a category of superoperators, which are specialized completely positive maps. However, the language lacked a crucial feature present in functional programming languages, specifically the concept of higher-order functions.

To address this deficiency, a typed lambda calculus for quantum computation was introduced in a subsequent work. This language shares similarities with qfc, as it incorporates both quantum and classical data types alongside classical control features, but it also includes lambda abstractions and function closures. The issue of determining the duplicability of data was resolved through a syntactic approach, achieved by devising a type system that distinguishes duplicable and non-duplicable types. While the quantum lambda calculus possesses reduction semantics, no denotational semantics have been established for it thus far.

This paper focuses on examining the restriction of the quantum lambda calculus to the purely linear case, wherein every value, classical and quantum, must be employed exactly once. The linear quantum lambda calculus differs from its nonlinear counterpart in that it is less dependent on the order of term evaluations. A denotational semantics for this language is presented within a category of completely positive maps, and it is demonstrated to be fully abstract in relation to the operational semantics.

Additionally, an operational semantics for a lambda calculus for quantum computation with classical control has been defined previously. In this work, the purely linear fragment of the language is investigated by adapting the definitions and results from this earlier paper to the linear setting.

Several unresolved questions remain. Firstly, the precise image of the denotational semantics needs to be characterized as a subset of the completely positive maps. It would also be valuable to explore the categorical semantics of the linear language. Finally, there is interest in incorporating weakening and duplication into the language and determining a denotational semantics for the full quantum lambda calculus.
