The definition of well-typed terms is established. However, the constructive implication of this definition is not immediately evident, especially when using constructive type theory itself as the meta-language. One complication arises from the requirement that all functions in the theory must be total, resulting in the need to encode partial functions as total functions, with formal implications. Another example is the treatment of inductive-recursive definitions necessary for certain model constructions and normalization proofs. Despite their constructive validity, most authors rely on their interpretation in set theory, which also carries formal repercussions.

Dependent types are significant. It is noteworthy that Agda does not mandate the user to exclusively define well-founded data types and terminating functions, although termination and well-foundedness checkers may be available in the future. Currently, it is the user's responsibility to ensure adherence to specific logical disciplines and to provide explanations and justifications for those disciplines.

Working within monomorphic type theory can be cumbersome due to the manipulation of large expressions. Therefore, Agda permits the suppression of certain arguments when their inference from the context is possible, classifying them as implicit arguments. For instance, when the function "id" receives a second argument "a," Agda attempts to infer the first argument "a," which is the type of "a." The user can designate the first argument of "id" as an implicit argument by enclosing it in braces.

The type-theoretic definition of a category and of the category "fam," as well as the definition of a functor and a terminal object, is outlined. Additionally, the structure of context comprehension is expressible type-theoretically. These aspects contribute to the definition of "cwf" within type theory, i.e., the notion of internal "cwf," although detailed presentation is not feasible here.

Categories with finite limits can be characterized as categories with terminal objects and pullbacks, as a category with terminal objects and pullbacks encompasses all finite limits. From a type-theoretic perspective, a pullback is a function that, given three objects and two arrows, constructs an object, two arrows, proofs of commutativity of the square, and a proof of the universal property. This formalization is presented in Agda.

It is essential to note that this inductive definition deviates from the standard schema of mutual inductive definitions in constructive type theory. Nonetheless, we contend that it constitutes a constructively meaningful definition. As part of our investigation, we aim to extend the schema in the references to encompass and provide set-theoretic semantics for this inductive definition.
