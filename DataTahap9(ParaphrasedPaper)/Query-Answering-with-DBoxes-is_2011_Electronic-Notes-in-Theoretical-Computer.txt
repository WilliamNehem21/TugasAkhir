Description logics are commonly used in knowledge representation and are the logical basis of the OWL 2 web ontology language. These logics are often used to store information about an application domain in a knowledge base, which can then be queried. Traditionally, a knowledge base in description logics consists of two components: a TBox, which represents intensional knowledge, and an ABox, which represents extensional knowledge about individuals. Querying the knowledge base is typically done using conjunctive queries, which are derived from database theory.

A notable distinction between ABoxes and database instances can be confusing for developers familiar with relational database management systems. To address this issue, DBoxes have been introduced as an alternative way to represent extensional knowledge in description logics. The semantics of DBoxes are similar to database instances, where the absence of information is interpreted as negative information. This makes DBoxes closely related to nominals from hybrid logics, providing a connection between hybrid logics, description logics, and databases.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of basic concepts in description logics and conjunctive queries. Section 3 introduces DBoxes as an alternative method for representing extensional knowledge, along with the notion of query entailment with DBoxes. Section 4 presents the main findings regarding the data complexity of query entailment in DL-LiteF with DBoxes. Finally, in Section 5, the paper discusses the relationship between query entailment in ALCFIO and query entailment in ALCFI with DBoxes.

The semantics of a DBox ensures uniqueness for individual names and specifies the extensions of concepts and roles. The paper also addresses the data complexity of query entailment in DL-LiteF with DBoxes, which is significant in database complexity analysis. The complexity of query entailment in DL-LiteF with DBoxes is compared to that in expressive description logics such as SHIQ, SHOI, and SHOQ. Additionally, the paper offers new insights into the complex problem of conjunctive query entailment in ALCFIO and its extensions.

Overall, the paper delves into the complexity of query entailment in description logics with a focus on DBoxes, shedding light on their relationship with expressive logics such as ALCFIO and ALCFI.
