In recent years, research studies [6-8] have primarily focused on examining the spray angle itself, as well as the coefficients of discharge and the spray cone angle. Both experimental and numerical research have yielded valuable results in this area. However, progress in investigating the impact of spray angle on spray cooling has been slow, particularly in the context of metal press quenching. Analyzing the effects of spray angle on heat transfer presents significant challenges, and direct numerical simulation is considered the most effective approach for theoretical investigation.

This paper aims to conduct numerical investigations into the influence of spray angle on the spray cooling of extruded aluminum alloy plates in order to identify an optimal range of spray angle values that can enhance cooling performance. The study will utilize the commercial finite volume method (FVM) code Fluent to calculate the temperature distribution within the cooled aluminum plate. Additionally, the corresponding stress distribution will be determined using the MSC.Marc software.

It is assumed that the aluminum plate maintains a uniform temperature distribution upon exiting the extruding machine. Consequently, the initial temperature distribution of the plate is set to be uniform, with a temperature value of 793 K. The material properties correspond to those of 6061 aluminum alloy.
