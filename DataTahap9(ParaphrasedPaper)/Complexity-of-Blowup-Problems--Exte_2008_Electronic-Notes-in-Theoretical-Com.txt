Consequently, if the position of the particle at time tk is u(tk) = (x, yk), then the position at time tk+ 1 is u(tk+ 1) = (x, yk + y2). As a result, the particle requires one unit of time to travel from yk to yk + y2. Because there are an infinite number of such intervals, the particle cannot approach infinity in a finite amount of time. Therefore, there is no exponential growth for the initial value (x, 0).
