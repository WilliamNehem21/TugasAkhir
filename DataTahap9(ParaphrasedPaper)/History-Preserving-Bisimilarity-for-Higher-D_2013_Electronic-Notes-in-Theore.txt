This paper demonstrates that history-preserving bisimilarity for higher-dimensional automata can be straightforwardly characterized in terms of higher-dimensional transitions, making it decidable for finite higher-dimensional automata. The authors utilize the open-maps framework of Joyal, Nielsen, and Winskel within the category of unfoldings of precubical sets to arrive at this characterization.

The concept of bisimulation, and its associated semantic model of transition systems, typically assumes that concurrency of actions is equivalent to non-deterministic interleaving. However, for certain applications, the distinction between these two is essential, leading to the development of non-interleaving or truly concurrent models such as petri nets, event structures, and asynchronous transition systems.

In this work, the authors provide a geometric interpretation of history-preserving bisimilarity for higher-dimensional automata using the open-maps approach introduced by Joyal, Nielsen, and Winskel, as well as results from a previous paper by one of the authors. Through this interpretation, they establish that history-preserving bisimilarity for higher-dimensional automata can be characterized directly in terms of the (higher-dimensional) transitions of the automata, rather than in terms of runs as is the case for petri nets.

The paper also discusses the formalisms of asynchronous transition systems and transition systems with independence, which only consider binary independence relations. An unlabeled higher-dimensional automaton is essentially a pointed precubical set, whereas for labeled automata, one can transition to an arrow category, as will be demonstrated in Section 6.

Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a one-dimensional higher-dimensional automaton corresponds to a transition system, and that the category of transition systems is isomorphic to the full subcategory of higher-dimensional automata spanned by the one-dimensional objects. Additionally, they establish that the category of asynchronous transition systems is isomorphic to the full subcategory of higher-dimensional automata consisting of (at most) two-dimensional objects.

The authors also propose a categorical framework for parallel composition of higher-dimensional automata, and introduce a notion of bisimilarity in the subsequent section. They review the history-preserving bisimilarity for higher-dimensional automata and prove that the history-preserving bisimilarity and the bisimilarity of a defined concept are equivalent.

Finally, the paper raises the question of whether hereditary history-preserving bisimilarity can be integrated into their framework. Given its back-tracking nature, simple unfoldings of higher-dimensional automata may not be suitable, and one should perhaps consider some form of back-unfoldings of forward-unfoldings instead. However, the authors note that, due to the undecidability result of a previous study, it seems unlikely that a characterization as straightforward as the one obtained for history-preserving bisimilarity can be achieved.
