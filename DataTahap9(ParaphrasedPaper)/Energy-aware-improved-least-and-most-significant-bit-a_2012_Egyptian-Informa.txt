Section 3 provides an overview of current approaches, while Section 4 introduces a new algorithm called the Least and Most Significant Bit Arbitration Algorithm. The simulation setup is outlined in Section 5, and Section 6 details the use of the M/G/1 queuing model to validate the accuracy of the simulation results. Section 7 presents the results of simulation experiments conducted on both existing algorithms and the proposed algorithm, and Section 8 concludes the paper.

Researchers Ryu et al. combined the QT algorithm with a slotted random back-off mechanism and also proposed an enhanced HQT algorithm that utilizes the slotted back-off with the AQS algorithm. Additionally, Shin et al. introduced two algorithms that incorporate a combination of QT and framed Aloha protocols: the Framed Query Tree Algorithm and Query Tree Aloha Algorithm.

The algorithm is based on a slotted Aloha CDMA technique alongside tag set partitioning, which involves partitioning tags into groups based on different power levels received from the RFID reader's continuous wave form. However, the implementation of SPSC raises system bandwidth and complexity costs.

In the proposed algorithm, the RFID reader initiates a reading cycle by notifying tags in the region. Tags backscatter their ID bit by bit, and the reader builds the initial tag response query based on the responses. The algorithm looks for a common prefix pattern and informs the tags if a prefix match is found, thus saving energy and identification time. The pseudo code for the Least and Most Significant Bit Arbitration Algorithm is presented.

Considering that the reader emits waves until all tags are identified, specific values are assigned, and the value c*(k) depends on the retrial rate from the orbit.

LAMSBA has helped save energy during scanning by 58.68% compared to AQS, and it has also allowed the reader to spend 556.01 milli joules, less than AQS spent.

The introduction of the Improved Least and Most Significant Bit Algorithm (LAMSBA) is considered a better alternative to minimize the number of idle responses experienced by RFID systems. In conventional query tree-based algorithms, tags respond from left to right or right to left, whereas in LAMSBA, tags respond to collided bits from both directions simultaneously, significantly improving the tag identification process. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that the generation of idle responses is minimized, which typically causes increases in identification delay and energy consumption. For the identification of 1000 tags, the number of collisions incurred is found to be 945, total bits transmitted is 3,073,812 bits, and the total energy spent is 2612.26 milli joules. The total time spent on identification is 17.09 seconds, representing a 74.20% increase in identification efficiency compared to the existing AQS algorithm.
