Accurately predicting long-term time series data (TSD) is a significant research challenge across diverse fields. In particular, the multi-step prediction of financial TSD, which are highly volatile, presents a major obstacle in TSD mining. Existing linear traditional models, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH), struggle to simultaneously maintain high prediction accuracy and preserve the data trend across the forecast horizon. Non-linear models, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), prioritize prediction accuracy at the expense of preserving data trend. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a linear hybrid model that aims to maintain prediction accuracy while also preserving data trend. The proposed model incorporates a quantitative reasoning analysis to justify its accuracy and utilizes a moving-average (MA) filter-based preprocessing, as well as partitioning and interpolation (PI) techniques.

Engle's introduction of the ARCH model in 1982 marked a significant development in forecasting highly volatile TSD. This was followed by the introduction of the generalized ARCH model, or GARCH model, by Bollerslev, Engle, and Nelson in 1994. Various extensions of the GARCH model have been explored in the literature. Additionally, a linear GARCH(1,1) model was applied to the Swiss Market Index, demonstrating its effectiveness in parameterizing daily returns. Furthermore, GARCH models have been used to forecast hourly prices in deregulated electricity markets, and these results outperformed the ARIMA model when volatility and price spikes were present. However, GARCH models may not be suitable for certain distributions, in which case a student-t distribution can be assumed.

The proposed model offers several advantages, including its suitability for long-term prediction, preservation of data dynamics, and high prediction accuracy, surpassing that of popular ANN models. In contrast to ANN models, which prioritize overall prediction accuracy and sacrifice data dynamics, the proposed model is shown to effectively account for the nature of the given time series data. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates superiority over ARIMA, GARCH, and wavelet ARIMA models by accounting for the characteristics of the time series data at every stage.

However, the proposed model has limitations. For instance, the number of partitions (p) is determined based on trial and error, and improving the model by estimating p for a given dataset will increase complexity. Additionally, the proposed model does not consider covariates and is shown to work well for univariate data. If covariates were to be considered, it is expected that prediction accuracy would further improve, albeit at the cost of increased complexity and tuning of additional model parameters.

In two cases involving the prediction of the number of trades data of Tata Steel, the proposed model outperformed other models in terms of prediction accuracy and preservation of data trend, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.
