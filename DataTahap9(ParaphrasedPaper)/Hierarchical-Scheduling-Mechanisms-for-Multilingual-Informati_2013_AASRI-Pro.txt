Cloud computing delivers information resources to users via the internet, and these resources, available in multiple languages, are distributed across web pages and databases. Managing the scheduling of these diverse multilingual resources in cloud computing presents a complex challenge due to their heterogeneous and uneven nature. This paper introduces a four-tier architecture for scheduling multilingual information resources in cloud computing, comprising the user accessing tier, technology supporting tier, resource scheduling tier, and resources tier. Additionally, a three-layer scheduling model is proposed, featuring home managers, local scheduling agents, and a global scheduling agent. This model not only emphasizes the autonomy of private cloud resources and user convenience for task submission and supervision but also alleviates the burden on the global scheduling agent. An illustrative example demonstrates that the proposed scheduling model enhances the performance of multilingual information resource scheduling in cloud computing.

Although research attention has been increasing on multilingual information retrieval and management issues, the scheduling of multilingual information resources in cloud computing has not received sufficient focus. To address this gap, this paper presents a four-tier architecture and a two-layer model for scheduling multilingual information resources in cloud computing.

The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the four-tier architecture for multilingual information resource scheduling in cloud computing, Section 3 introduces a three-layer model for the same, Section 4 provides an example illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model, and Section 5 presents the conclusions.

The user accessing tier serves as the interface for users to access information from the cloud data center using various devices such as PCs connected via wired networks or mobile terminals like mobile phones and PDAs using wireless networks.

The resources tier encompasses physical resources (e.g., computing, storage, and network resources) and information resources (e.g., corpus, knowledge base, original information base) necessary for the overall system operation.

The technology supporting tier includes information integration in the resource scheduling tier, as well as corpus and knowledge base in the resource tier, contributing to the three-layer scheduling model for multilingual information resources in cloud computing. This model enhances the autonomy of private cloud resources, user convenience, and reduces the load on the global scheduling agent. The example provided demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed scheduling model in improving the performance of multilingual information resource scheduling in cloud computing. We intend to further explore effective scheduling algorithms for multilingual information resources in cloud computing.
