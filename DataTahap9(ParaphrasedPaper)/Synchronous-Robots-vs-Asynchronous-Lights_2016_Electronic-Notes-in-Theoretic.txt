We present two distinct tasks and demonstrate that while one task can be solved in the fully synchronous model on graphs but not in the asynchronous lights-enhanced model, the opposite is true for the other task. This suggests that the fully synchronous model and the asynchronous lights-enhanced model are not comparable on graphs, which poses challenging directions for understanding the distinctive features that make these models so different.

We also consider various modeling assumptions that can impact the computational power of robots. For instance, robots may have unique identities, meaning each robot is associated with a different identifier for use during the compute phase. Conversely, robots without identifiers are considered anonymous. Additionally, robots may possess a finite but persistent memory device whose content is preserved from one cycle to the next, in which case they are referred to as "oblivious" robots. On the other hand, robots without persistent memory device start each cycle without information about past events.

Within this research domain, a wide range of problems and tasks have been explored, including gathering in specific locations (the gathering problem), forming desired geometric patterns (the pattern formation problem), and exploring unknown areas (the exploration problem). Various settings have been examined as well, such as robots moving on a Euclidean plane or a given input graph, with or without the ability to communicate. Furthermore, the presence of an objective function to be optimized, associated with the problem, has been investigated. For example, optimization of the minimum number of robots, the minimum number of steps for all robots, or the minimization of the maximum number of steps performed by a single robot to achieve a certain goal has been studied.

Our work draws inspiration from the paper by Das et al., which focused on comparing the computational capabilities of robots operating in the LCM model and moving in the Euclidean plane, under different levels of synchronization, with those of both luminous robots and partially oblivious robots. Specifically, the authors provided a series of results that demonstrate relationships of dominance between classic models and their variations, considering the capability to use lights, snapshots, or a combination of both.

Regarding the relationships of dominance, denoted by a direct arrow between two models (A and B), it indicates that every problem solvable in A is also solvable in B. Moreover, the triple bar symbol (|||) indicates that every problem solvable in A is also solvable in B, and vice versa. In particular, the authors showed that in anonymous graphs, the unique identification of nodes in G is crucial for the feasibility of the problem, as the adversary can make concurrent movements of two robots occupying the same node, preventing them from reaching different destinations.

Furthermore, our input consists of two robots, named R1 and R2, and a graph G, which is a path P of a minimum of six nodes. The two robots are positioned at distinct nodes of P, neither being the endpoints of P nor neighboring the endpoints of P. Let d represent the initial distance (i.e., number of edges) between the two robots.

Subsequently, R1 deduces that R2 has already moved, and thus it is now its turn to move. The movement to be executed is determined based on the current lights of R2. Specifically, if L2 is red, R1 must move one edge away from R2, as R2 has already completed its movement. Therefore, it is waiting for R1. If d represents the distance between the two robots before they both moved, then the final placement of the two robots in the current step is defined as d + 2. Since they each contribute one edge, when only one robot moves, the current distance dj is dj = d + 1. Thus, by moving one edge, the two robots will reach a distance of d + 2. Similarly, if L2 is blue, R1 must move one edge closer to R2.
