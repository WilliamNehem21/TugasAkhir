This paper introduces a new approach to object recognition using a combination of local descriptors, which includes the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) methods. The approach is applied to images of large animals found in Slovakia, such as wolves, foxes, brown bears, deer, and wild boars. The study also demonstrates the potential applicability of this hybrid method in other areas of image classification and feature extraction, showing positive effects on object recognition.

The training process involves creating a classification model from a collection of images for each class, and extracting low-level features using methods like SIFT, SURF, OpponentSURF, and OpponentSIFT. These features are then used to build the classification model.

During the testing phase, input images with specific objects are classified using a classifier that has been trained on similar data. Visual descriptors, which capture the local appearance of objects, play a key role in the classification process, and are calculated using neighboring pixels. The descriptors need to be discriminative and invariant to noise, illumination changes, and viewpoints, consisting of a detector and a descriptor.

The paper also discusses key point detection using methods such as SIFT, SURF, and hybrid approaches like SUSIFT (SURF-SIFT) and SISURF (SIFT-SURF). Classification models are created using a combination of bag of keypoints and support vector machine (SVM) methods.

The SVM classifier is a supervised learning method used to separate training data in a higher dimensional space using a kernel function and finding an optimal hyperplane with a maximum margin between data of two different classes. The paper employs the radial basis function (RBF) kernel for the SVM classifier.

Various combinations of detectors, descriptors, and matchers were implemented using the OpenCV library, with the clustering process utilizing different numbers of descriptors per class. The experiments showed that the SISURF detector, OpponentSIFT descriptor, and brute force matcher with 15,000 descriptors per class achieved the highest classification success rate of 86%.

Furthermore, the paper compares and tests two hybrid key point detectors and shows that the SISURF detector achieved promising results, outperforming other standard detectors in some runs, whereas the SUSIFT detector achieved a lower success rate of around 50% only.
