This study focuses on a type of attack known as malicious packet dropping, where a node intentionally drops a packet rather than forwarding it, leading to a significant decrease in network throughput. The paper presents the implementation of a host-based misuse detection system using game theory approaches to detect and mitigate the impact of malicious nodes on the network.

The paper analyzes vulnerabilities and specific attacks, such as malicious packet dropping, against the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. A solution utilizing neighbor monitoring technique and game theory is proposed to detect and respond to attacks on AODV. The proposed method uses game theoretical analysis to provide optimal strategies for intrusion detection systems based on anomalies.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) based on game theory. Section 3 describes the proposed intrusion detection system using game theory. Section 4 presents the results and discussion of the proposed work, and Section 5 provides conclusions and suggestions for future improvements.

Several extensions to the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) algorithm, such as Watchdog and Path Rater, are proposed by Marti et al. to identify misbehaving nodes and select paths for packet delivery. Buchegger et al. introduce the Confidant protocol and various enhancements to monitor node behavior and manage trust in route selection. Furthermore, Sen presents a comprehensive survey on security and privacy-related challenges in wireless mesh networks, while Das et al. propose a game-theoretic model to identify selfish nodes in MANETs.

Taheri et al. and Wang et al. present approaches using game theory to detect and mitigate malicious nodes in MANETs, while Janusz et al. discuss algorithms and defense mechanisms for improving cybersecurity in MANETs. Additionally, Subba et al. propose a framework for identifying malicious nodes using lightweight neural networks and specification rules, along with a reputation update and expulsion mechanism based on Shapley value and Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG). These approaches aim to improve cooperation among monitoring nodes and achieve higher detection rates against various attacks.
