The paper discusses the incidence and mortality rates of leukemia in the United States and India, with a focus on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It highlights the regional and subtype variations of leukemia and emphasizes the need for early detection and accurate classification of leukemia for improved survival rates. The paper presents a review of various AI-based methods for leukemia detection, including the use of CNN, SVM, and other machine learning techniques. The study introduces a novel Bayesian-optimized CNN method for identifying ALL in microscopic smeared images, achieving a maximum accuracy of 100%. Additionally, it explores the use of deep learning models such as VIT-CNN, and attention-based CNN for improved ALL identification. The study also discusses the use of different feature extraction and selection methods such as PCA, LDA, and SVC, as well as nature-inspired algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) for classifying leukemia cells. The proposed model demonstrates promising accuracy, but the authors recognize the need for further real-life application and optimization of the model for small IoT devices and smartphones. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of AI-based techniques for leukemia detection and emphasizes their potential impact on improving leukemia classification and diagnosis.
