The paper introduces lambdawhich is an extension of first-order lambda calculus, aiming to unify two approaches of non-cloning in quantum lambda-calculi. One approach prohibits the duplication of variables, while the other treats all lambda-terms as algebraic linear functions. The type system of lambdaintroduces a constructor "s" where a type "a" is seen as the base of a vector space, and "s(a)" represents its span. Initially, the paper provides a semantics interpretation where superposed types are viewed as vector spaces while non-superposed types are seen as their basis. However, in this work, the paper presents a categorical semantics of lambda-, revealing that "s" is interpreted as the composition of two functors in an adjunction relation between the category of sets and the category of vector spaces over c. The right adjoint is a forgetful functor "u," which remains hidden in the language and is pivotal in computational reasoning.

This work also goes beyond to offer a categorical interpretation of lambda, where "s" is a functor of an adjunction between the category set and the category vec. Specifically, when "s" is evaluated, it yields formal finite linear combinations of elements of a set with complex numbers as coefficients. The other functor of the adjunction, "u," allows us to disregard the vectorial structure.

The paper's model is notable for its expressiveness in describing the explicit interaction between the quantum and classical universes by providing a monoidal adjunction. Delving into more technical aspects, the paper discusses the construction of a mathematical semantic model of lambda based on a monoidal adjunction with additional conditions, highlighting the dependence on the properties of the categories of sets and vector spaces. The authors indicate that their categorical approach is abstract in nature, with the concrete model serving as a foundation for a more generalized formulation. Future research, according to the authors, will explore the semantics from a higher level by recasting the concrete model in terms of monoidal categories with certain axiomatic properties. Additionally, the paper aims to address the categorical relationship between the notion of amplitude and probability in the context of the abstract semantics in future work.
