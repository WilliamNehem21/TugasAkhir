The actions that a system might automatically take depend on various factors, such as the presence of a mobile device, its characteristics, and the occupants in the space. For instance, the Match system is designed to offer assisted living for individuals with special needs. When a potential problem is identified, the system performs different actions based on the specific context. If a caregiver is in the same room as the individual, the system remains inactive. If the caregiver is in the same house but not in the room, they are notified either through sound or a message on their mobile device, depending on the ambient conditions where they are located. If the caregiver is not in the same house, the surveillance center for the sheltered housing is notified.

A category of ubiquitous systems forms the basis for the proposed quantitative analysis of user-related characteristics. These systems aim to improve buildings by providing information for those within the environment and are applicable to various domains. Two examples are utilized to demonstrate commonalities: a guidance system and a system to aid out-patients in a hospital.

Given that multiple individuals may be in a specific space concurrently, more than one direction is displayed, along with its associated destination, allowing visitors to choose the relevant direction. Collective behaviors are considered, and it is assumed that a space has a specific capacity. Upon reaching a space with a display, there are four potential scenarios.

The second example is designed to assist out-patients at a hospital. When a patient arrives for an appointment, the ubiquitous system aims to provide information and guidance to ensure that patients are (1) kept informed about waiting times and (2) directed to the next stage of their patient journey when necessary. Patients may have mobile devices, in which case relevant information is sent directly to their device, or they are issued a sensor/visitor card if they do not have suitable mobile devices. In the latter scenario, public displays are updated with the patient's number and information about wait times or guidance on where to go next. A simple system might categorize patients into four types, offering different actions based on their type. Patients without a mobile device are rescheduled, and if time permits, a wellness check is offered.

Both examples share common characteristics, involving individuals reaching destinations. In one case, the system determines the route based on the visitor's destination, while in the other, it depends on the patient type. In both cases, individuals respond to the information by taking action that alters their context in some manner.

All these factors are likely to influence the satisfaction or anxiety levels of users in these environments. User experiences may also depend on external factors and user expectations, as well as other processes that cannot be modeled within the design. Recognizing and integrating factors relating the system design to these external influences is essential for making progress. While some factors are more familiar in terms of usability, others are more novel from a human-computer interaction perspective.

Implicit interaction in the guidance system can be modeled by focusing on individual or collective behavior within the system. A model is only valuable if it informs design choices and enables comparison between options, potentially reducing downstream costs. This analysis should be presented in a way that is meaningful to those concerned with human factors and visualizes the design represented by the model.

It is feasible to combine a functional model capturing key design assumptions with techniques for analyzing stochastic behavior. This aids the constructive use of results in subsequent design iterations. While not described in detail, the proposed model is based on a qualitative model that captured more functional details.

Questions and challenges pertain to the type of analysis that can be conducted using this model and whether these techniques are relevant to the properties discussed. For this specific example, adjusted design parameters include the design of the display, such as determining the number of slots it should contain at the same time and ensuring it is visible to multiple individuals. Exploration of different paths and their impact on system congestion supports the design process.

These examples provide a preliminary indication of the role that stochastic model checking can play. The analysis can explore environmental characteristics relevant to user experience. This analysis, using a more abstract model, serves a similar role to qualitative model checking, but in this case, the same model can be used to verify collective behavior.
