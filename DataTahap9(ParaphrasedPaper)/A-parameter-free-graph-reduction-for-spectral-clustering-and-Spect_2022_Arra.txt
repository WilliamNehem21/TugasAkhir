The detection of clusters with non-convex geometric shapes has been an extensively explored topic in the field of pattern recognition. Solutions to this problem can be broadly categorized into kernel-based and graph-based methods. While kernel-based methods aim to map points into a separable space, graph-based methods involve reducing the graph and subsequently partitioning it. However, the creation of a memory-efficient graph introduces challenges related to the numerous parameters associated with the graph construction process, such as determining the number of reduced vertices and the elimination of edges, all of which require careful tuning.

A number of clustering methods have been developed to address the challenge of detecting non-convex clusters, particularly by abandoning the assumption that a cluster has a single mean and instead relying on pairwise similarities to identify clusters. One approach within the domain of graph-based clustering involves graph reduction and partitioning, with this paper's proposed method falling under the category of graph construction methods.

Moreover, an integration of a graph filtering method with the recently proposed spectral clustering using deep neural networks (SpectralNet) is depicted. SpectralNet leverages siamese nets to learn affinities between data points and requires the user to label positive and negative pairs, although an unsupervised pairing method is also available.
