The equation u(t) = w(t)x describes a scenario where the solution at time t, denoted as u(t), is the result of the semigroup w(t) acting on the initial value x. If one is able to calculate the semigroup w(t) based on the operator a, then it becomes possible to compute the solution of equation (2). This paper primarily focuses on identifying the necessary information about a required to compute w(t) and vice versa.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of fundamental definitions and facts concerning c0 semigroups of bounded linear operators in Banach spaces. Section 3 introduces the computational model and pertinent definitions. In Section 4, we illustrate how to determine a uniformly continuous semigroup from its bounded linear infinitesimal generator, as well as the reverse computation.
