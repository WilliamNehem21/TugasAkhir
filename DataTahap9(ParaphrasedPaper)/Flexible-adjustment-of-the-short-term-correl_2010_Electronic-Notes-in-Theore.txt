In this study, we analyze and compare different traffic models. Section 5 details the application of the Whittle estimator to verify the increased flexibility of the new models in accommodating the autocorrelation function observed in empirical VBR traces. Finally, we provide concluding remarks and suggestions for future research in Section 6.
