This paper serves as a concise introduction to a specific theory. Following an initial discussion of basic definitions, it summarizes key findings from nearly a century of research in the field, acknowledging that while numerous significant results exist, many open problems still persist. The structure of the paper is organized in the following manner: it begins with an introduction, followed by a survey of basic definitions and motivating examples in section 2. Section 3 presents examples of typical research objects, along with selected results and open problems. The fourth section delves into the explanation of the Galois connection pol-inv, and the final section explores the connection between clones and Lawvere theories.

The research goals are modest, involving an investigation into specific segments or characteristics of these lattices. This body of work, spanning several decades, is extensively documented in various monographs. The aim of this section is to provide the reader with an overview of this research by addressing what are considered typical questions, some of which have been resolved and others that remain open.

The paper emphasizes the limited understanding of the lattice structure of clones, and explores questions regarding the cardinality of specific intervals within the lattice. Notably, it highlights the significance of near-unanimity operations within the context of clones, showcasing their special properties and role in duality theory.

The paper introduces the concept of the Galois connection pol-inv, illustrating its fundamental role in clone theory and tracing its historical development. The concept of preservation is discussed, and it is noted that the galois closed classes of pol-inv precisely correspond to the locally closed clones of operations and relations, respectively.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of a finite base set in which the galois closed classes are precisely the clones of operations and relations. It demonstrates how, in the case of a finite set, the definition of a clone can be simplified, and alludes to the elegant description of maximal clones through the use of the galois connection. This method, exemplified by Ivo Rosenberg's work, is noted for providing not only the desired result but also a refined characterization of the maximal clones.
