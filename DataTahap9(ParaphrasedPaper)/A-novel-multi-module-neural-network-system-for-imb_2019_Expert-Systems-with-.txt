This paper introduces a novel multi-module neural network system called MMNNS, which aims to address the imbalance problem in electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeats classification. The system is comprised of four submodules: preprocessing, imbalance problem processing, feature extraction, and classification. The imbalance problem processing module introduces three methods – BLMS, CTFM, and 2PT – to address the imbalance issue from different perspectives of resampling, data feature, and algorithm, respectively. MMNNS is trained on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and compared with state-of-the-art methods using standard criteria on three datasets, demonstrating its superiority in improving the detection of heartbeats and addressing imbalance in ECG heartbeats classification.

A conventional cardiac classification system typically includes four steps: ECG signal preprocessing, heartbeat segmentation, feature extraction, and learning/classification. The proposed MMNNS system consists of four submodules, with the imbalance problem processing module being the central part. This module introduces three methods (BLMS, CTFM, and 2PT) to overcome the adverse effects of imbalanced data distribution, representing a novel attempt to combine these three modules to address the imbalance problem.

The evaluation of the MMNNS system includes extensive experiments on three datasets using seven classification assessment metrics and two statistical measures. Additionally, the training is performed using both intra-patient and inter-patient data division schemes.

In recent years, deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), have been increasingly applied to ECG analysis due to their success in other fields like image recognition and natural language processing. However, existing methods often fail to account for the adverse effects of the imbalance problem in training data.

To overcome the imbalance problem, the paper proposes a structure that combines data and algorithm level approaches. It introduces BLMS to linearly synthesize virtual samples around the minority class, CTFM to integrate feature extraction and selection, and 2PT for two-phase training. These techniques aim to address the imbalance problem from different perspectives and enhance the performance of the model.

The authors also discuss the importance of performance measures in assessing the effectiveness of the model, mentioning that accuracy, a commonly used metric, can favor the majority class and lead to misleading assessments. They introduce metrics like precision, specificity, sensitivity, g-mean, and f-measure, which can offer a more comprehensive evaluation, particularly in the presence of skewed training data.

Moreover, the paper discusses the implications of imbalance in neural networks and the efforts to address it, including the proposal of novel loss functions and the design of cost-sensitive deep neural networks. Techniques such as data augmentation and feature extraction are also considered to mitigate the effects of imbalance in training data.

The authors emphasize the need to consider the characteristics of ECG data when addressing the imbalance problem, highlighting the importance of feature extraction algorithms that are specifically designed to adapt to imbalanced training data.

Overall, the paper introduces a systematic approach to addressing the imbalance problem in ECG heartbeats classification, proposing a novel multi-module neural network system and evaluating its performance using standard criteria and comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it highlights the importance of considering various techniques, such as resampling, feature extraction, and training methods, to effectively address the imbalance problem and improve the classification of ECG heartbeats.
