4-dimethylamino-benzaldehyde (0.01 mol; 1.5 g) was dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol along with 1 ml of glacial acetic acid. The ligand was precipitated during reflux for 3 hours and then separated by filtration. The resulting precipitate was recrystallized from absolute ethyl alcohol and dried in a vacuum desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride to ensure purity. The purity of the compounds was assessed using thin-layer chromatography (see scheme 1).

The cluster calculations were performed using the dmol3 program in the materials studio package [21,22]. Geometry optimization simulations of the isolated solid compounds were conducted using density functional theory (DFT) via the Gaussian 09 program package. The double numeric basis (DNP) sets were used, which are of the same class as the 6-31G Gaussian basis sets and are more precise. The rpbe functional, based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), was considered the most suitable exchange-correlation functional. Geometric optimization was carried out without imposing any restrictions.

For complexation, the isolated solids were treated with double-distilled water and the cell was shaken vigorously for 2 minutes. Subsequently, 2 ml of a surfactant solution with a known concentration was added, and the cell was inverted upside down 25 times by hand. The mixture was left to stand for 5 minutes to allow for complete flotation. The concentration of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions remaining in the mother liquor was analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The floatability (F%) of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions was calculated using the following relation:
