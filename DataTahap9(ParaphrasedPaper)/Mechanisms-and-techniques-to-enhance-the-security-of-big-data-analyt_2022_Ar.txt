The modern landscape of data analytics frameworks often operates within dynamic and uncertain environments, posing significant challenges in ensuring security. In networked environments, the risks to valuable and sensitive data are heightened. Understanding and integrating various dimensions of security is essential for the design of more secure systems with effective policies. This paper focuses on enhancing the security of a high-performance big data analytic framework through the introduction of security mechanisms and techniques. The goal is to systematically design a secure data analytic framework capable of providing guaranteed security to its users, by storing various data formats in a MongoDB database for further analysis of the TTU Exposome Project data. To address this, four main security areas, including database security (server with LXCs), network security, web application security, and physical security, are explored to protect the data and enable unimpaired access to authenticated researchers.

The initial section of the paper discusses the background and related work, followed by presenting the methodology of security mechanism implementations, focusing on authentication, authorization, privacy-preserving data handling, and encryption. The subsequent presentation of results elaborates on these security measures in detail. The paper concludes with an assessment of the current system's effectiveness and provides suggestions for future improvements, such as incorporating blockchain-based security and considering the impact of human behavior on system security.

In the specific context of the stored data in the MongoDB database server within Singularity Linux containers, the paper introduces a security model that employs various mechanisms to ensure secure transmission, including authentication, authorization, and encryption. It also proposes and implements a mechanism for privacy-preserving data extractions, transmissions, and loadings by transforming the actual data format into numerical data representation.

The paper highlights the importance of authorization mechanisms in providing control over database resources and operations for verified users, considering that MongoDB does not enable access control by default. It outlines the database policy and access control implementation, emphasizing the principle of granting minimal authority to users based on their roles.

The paper discusses the research by Daniel Huluka et al., which identifies root causes of session management and broken authentication vulnerabilities and emphasizes the significance of considering different perspectives during security protocol implementation. It also introduces the development of Autopag, a solution designed to address out-of-bound vulnerabilities and facilitate efficient decision-making in accessing sensitive patient information.

Another research by Chakravorty, Wlodarczyk, and Rong is discussed, focusing on developing a data analytics framework for smart homes to maintain security and privacy of sensor data. The use of heuristic-based k-anonymization algorithms and re-identification of data processing results is highlighted as a means of protecting data privacy throughout the data lifecycle.

The paper emphasizes the multidimensional nature of security and advocates for using stochastic modeling techniques, attack graphs, and complementary metrics for a comprehensive evaluation of network security. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing common vulnerabilities, such as weak authentication, lack of authorization policies, absence of encryption mechanisms, and insufficient data privacy measures, and proposes a generic security model to fulfill the security requirements of container-based virtual applications.

The paper also describes the use of specific tools and mechanisms, such as Mongoose, Express.js, and bcrypt, for managing relationships between data, executing JavaScript code, and protecting password information within a database.

The paper touches upon the principle of adding different privilege levels to different types of users through access control roles and emphasizes the shared responsibility of technical experts and users in ensuring the overall security of a software system.

The authors of the paper, Akalanka Mailewa Dissanayaka, Susan Mengel, Lisa Gittner, and Hafiz Khan, are introduced, providing their credentials and research interests. Dr. Susan Mengel's extensive experience and strategic leadership roles in transdisciplinary projects are highlighted, along with her contributions in various academic and leadership capacities.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive exploration of security measures and mechanisms in the context of data analytics frameworks. It discusses various research studies and emphasizes the multifaceted nature of security, advocating for a holistic approach to addressing vulnerabilities and ensuring secure data management and access.
