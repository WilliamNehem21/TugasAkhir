Recently, D. viscosa has been found to exhibit antiviral and antimicrobial activities, as well as having spasmolytic and hypotensive properties. The leaves of this plant were reported to contain bioactive elements with properties resembling those of local anesthetic, smooth muscle relaxant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-ulcerogenic agents. Despite the lack of literature on the medicinal properties of this plant, it is now commercially cultivated worldwide, including in the Sultanate of Oman, due to its medical importance. As a result, it is important to investigate the biological activities of D. viscosa, which is abundant in Oman, particularly in Al Jabal al Akhdar and Al Hamra.

For the current study, different crude extracts were prepared from the leaves of the Omani D. viscosa species, and antioxidant compounds were isolated and characterized from the crude extract with the highest antioxidant activity. The leaves of the D. viscosa plant were collected from Al-Hamra in September 2016 and identified at the Biological Science Division of the University of Nizwa, Oman. The collected leaves were then cleaned, the healthy ones separated from the stems, and dried under shade for 7 days.

The highest antioxidant hexane extract (1.20 g) and ethyl acetate crude extract (1.50 g) were chosen for the separation of antioxidant compounds using column chromatography with different organic solvents as a mobile phase. The isolated fractions from the column chromatography were combined based on similar thin-layer chromatography (TLC) patterns, resulting in multiple fractions. These fractions were then evaporated, and the isolated compounds were further purified using preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC) to yield pure compounds. The structures of these purified compounds were elucidated using mass spectrometry (MS) and 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques.

Medicinal plants are of great interest to scientists worldwide for their potential biological activities. Crude plant extracts contain numerous chemical compounds responsible for these activities, and the bioactivities of the extracts depend on their bioactive constituents. The selected medicinal plant species exhibited various biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticandidal, antidiabetic, antifungal, and antidiarrheal activities, and have been traditionally used for the treatment of various ailments.

The study also involved the crystallization of isolated compounds to obtain pure substances, with each compound being identified through MS and various NMR techniques. One of these compounds, identified as compound 2, had a molecular weight of 442 and a corresponding molecular formula of C29H50O2, with specific spectral characteristics observed in the 1H NMR spectrum.
