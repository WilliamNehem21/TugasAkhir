The primary obstacle to the industrial application of laser dressing technology for profile grinding wheels is the low profiling efficiency. In this paper, we introduced a trajectory planning method for deep-cutting laser profiling, established a theoretical model of the energy distribution of the Gaussian laser beam on the surface of the profile grinding wheel, and systematically examined the impact of this method on enhancing the profiling efficiency of superabrasive profile grinding wheels. Through comparative experiments, we confirmed that the trajectory planning method can effectively enhance the profiling efficiency of V-shaped grinding wheels. We also observed that smaller tip angles result in greater efficiency improvements. Additionally, we found that changes in grain size affect the method of grain removal, influencing profiling efficiency without significantly impacting profiling accuracy. The trajectory planning method also substantially improved the profiling efficiency of convex/concave arc-shaped grinding wheels, with greater improvements observed for larger arc radii or chord-to-diameter ratios. Moreover, we discovered variations in profiling and material removal efficiencies among grinding wheels of the same size but with differing arc radii or chord-to-diameter ratios, necessitating the selection of distinct process strategies during laser profiling to achieve a comprehensive balance between efficiency, accuracy, and quality.

Numerous methods have been developed by scholars to address this issue, with the most common being mechanical and electrical dressing methods. However, these methods have inherent disadvantages and limitations. For instance, the traditional mechanical method suffers from rapid tool wear, difficult compensation, high dust concentration, and challenges in dressing concave surface grinding wheels. Moreover, nonconductive non-metallic bonds and various grains pose further challenges. To address these issues, we proposed a scanning trajectory planning method to enhance the efficiency of deep-cutting laser profiling for superabrasive profile grinding wheels. 

A critical aspect of trajectory planning involves determining the grinding wheel material removal threshold, a task conventionally performed through laser ablation experiments. However, this method is time-consuming and less accurate. Alternatively, during the laser dressing process, the plasma emission spectrum can be utilized to determine the removal threshold of grain or bond by observing the characteristic spectral line and its intensity with a spectrometer. We utilized a database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to identify characteristic spectral lines of grains and bonds and conducted experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory planning method.

Our experiments demonstrated that the trajectory planning method significantly improved the profiling efficiency and material removal rate while reducing profiling time. Financial support for this research was provided by several organizations.
