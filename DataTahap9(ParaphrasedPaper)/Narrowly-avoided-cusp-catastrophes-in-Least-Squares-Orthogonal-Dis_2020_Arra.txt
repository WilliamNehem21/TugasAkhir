This academic paper discusses the optimization process with the objective of identifying critical points where the objective function equals zero. The speed of convergence towards the optimal solution will be determined by the second-order response matrix, denoted as m. Furthermore, the nature of the solution, whether it is a local minimum or a saddle point, will be ascertained by the eigenvalues of matrix m, which reflect the curvature of the objective function in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector. To facilitate the theoretical possibility of solution crossings, a submanifold is defined by setting the determinant of the matrix m+ to zero. The conditions for such crossings are then derived, with the function h(u) being calculated for this purpose. The method of steepest descent is used to approximate intermediate points between two critical points, involving the calculation of a preliminary estimate of a by linearly interpolating between a saddle point and a local minimum, followed by multiple iterations of the steepest descent method.
