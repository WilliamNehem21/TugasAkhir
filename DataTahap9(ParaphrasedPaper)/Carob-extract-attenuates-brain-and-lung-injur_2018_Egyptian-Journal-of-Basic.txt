Waterpipe smoking, also known as shisha or narghile, is a popular method of tobacco consumption worldwide, particularly among young people. It contributes to more than 5 million deaths annually. Although many individuals perceive waterpipe smoking as less harmful than smoking cigarettes, occasional use of waterpipe tobacco can lead to tissue inflammation.

Chronic tobacco smoking is linked to cognitive inflexibility, impaired intellectual abilities, mood disturbances, and issues with learning, memory processing speed, and working memory. Moreover, chronic smoking can lead to overall brain atrophy, abnormal decline in reasoning, and structural and biochemical abnormalities in specific regions of the brain, increasing the risk of various neurodegenerative diseases.

In this study, carob pods were obtained from Egyptian herbal markets in Cairo, Egypt, and processed to obtain aqueous extract. Rats were orally administered the carob extract daily at a specified dosage. The rats were divided into protective and therapeutic groups, which were exposed to waterpipe smoke and subsequently received carob aqueous extract in different sequences.

The study used various analytical techniques to measure the levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT) activity, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and hydroxyproline content in the pulmonary tissue of the rats. The results indicated increased cough and biological abnormalities in the lungs of waterpipe smokers compared to non-smokers, and suggested potential involvement of neurotransmitters such as 5-HT and DA in the central cough complex.

The study also found that exposure to waterpipe smoke increased DA content, which may be associated with an increase in its synthesis from l-dopa. Additionally, long-term nicotine use may lead to tolerance and dependence, potentially contributing to nonsignificant changes in DA content at the end of the experiment. Furthermore, the study suggested potential medicinal uses of carob, including its role in reducing DA synthesis to inhibit the cough reflex and its antidepressant effects.

The results also indicated that exposure to waterpipe smoke and the administration of amiodarone, a model for pulmonary toxicity, led to increased lung MPO activity and hydroxyproline content, indicating oxidative damage and lung tissue injury. The study proposed that the antioxidant effects of carob may ameliorate these effects, supporting its potential use as a preventative agent against such diseases.

The findings implicated excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage induced by waterpipe smoke and amiodarone, which can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. The study also highlighted the potential of carob to mitigate oxidative stress and its rich nutritional value, suggesting its use as an ingredient in healthy food products.

In conclusion, the study emphasized the detrimental effects of waterpipe smoking on the brain and lungs, similar to those caused by amiodarone, and underscored the potential protective role of carob aqueous extract due to its antioxidant effects. It called for increased awareness of the risks associated with waterpipe smoking and suggested regulatory measures to control smoking in open areas. Additionally, it highlighted the potential dietary benefits of carob powder.
