The academic paper discusses the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for cattle identification. These algorithms automatically extract high-level features from the dataset and learn from them, but selecting the right algorithms, tuning parameters, and choosing features pose challenges for achieving better prediction accuracy. The paper focuses on conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on research studies related to cattle identification using ML and DL approaches. The authors outlined seven research questions (RQs) for the SLR and described the search process and selection criteria used to identify relevant studies. A total of 731 articles were retrieved, and inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select studies for the review.

The selected articles were then thoroughly read, and the necessary data elements were extracted and organized into a spreadsheet based on different data elements such as research goals, datasets, features used, model type, location, publishing year, performance evaluation metrics, and challenges. The study found that features like body coat pattern and face are unique for identifying individual cattle, and ML and DL methods have gained popularity for automating cattle identification. SVM and YOLO were identified as widely used algorithms for cattle identification, along with the challenges of feature extraction and dataset availability.

The paper also highlighted the challenges and opportunities in cattle identification using ML and DL approaches. It emphasized the need for benchmark datasets, efficient feature selection methods, and addressing complexities in model architecture to improve cattle identification systems. Additionally, the study discussed the challenge of implementing cattle identification models in real farm environments and the limitations of using static image-based approaches.

The authors noted limitations in the study, including potential omissions of relevant articles due to database selection and the possibility of missing data during the extraction process. Despite these limitations, the study concluded that automated and real-time cattle identification systems will be crucial for future livestock farm management. The findings aim to guide future researchers in the development of automatic cattle identification systems.
