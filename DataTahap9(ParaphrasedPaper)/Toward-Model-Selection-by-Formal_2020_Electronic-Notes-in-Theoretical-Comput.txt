In this research study, we tackle the issue of choosing a model from a set of potential models within the field of dynamical systems. Rather than relying on time series data, our selection process is based on the behavior of models as specified in temporal logic, offering more comprehensive constraints on system dynamics. In addition to selecting a model, we introduce the concept of model ordering, which aims to establish an ordered structure among the models. We propose and apply various ordering relations to compare models based on property specification. To address this setting formally and globally, we leverage model checking and parameter synthesis methods. We assess the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several qualitative models of regulatory networks.

In conclusion, model ordering is a versatile approach that can be applied to various model formalisms, specification formats, and analysis frameworks. We believe this method can streamline the model inference process and provide a dependable means of evaluating models across different formalisms. We are interested in expanding the applicability of this approach and ensuring its reproducibility.

Throughout this study, we assume that each parameterization is represented as a valuation of model parameters, with each parameter identified using a parameter index. These indices, denoted using Roman numerals, provide a unique identification for each parameter across all models considered. For example, in Section 3.1, we analyze three models with three parameters indexed as i, ii, and iii. In this case, the first model contains only parameters i and iii, the second model contains parameters i and ii, and the third model contains parameters ii and iii.
