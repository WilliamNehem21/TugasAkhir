The aero-engine undergoes significant changes in state parameters and operational conditions throughout its flight envelope, requiring the controller to effectively handle parameter perturbations, disturbances, and external condition variations. This paper presents the design and utilization of a neural network sliding mode variable structure decoupling controller based on model reference adaptive control for the aero-engine. The controller incorporates a radial basis function (RBF) neural network to generate the sliding mode control output and utilizes a sliding mode switching function as the input to the neural network. The weights of the RBF network are adaptively adjusted based on the error between the reference model output and the actual output. Simulation results demonstrate that the Model Reference Adaptive Neural Sliding Mode Controller (MRANSMC) effectively mitigates chattering phenomena, exhibits strong decoupling capabilities, and demonstrates robust control performance in the presence of disturbances and parameter perturbations throughout the entire flight envelope.

This paper introduces a combined approach of neural network and sliding mode control based on Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) theory to regulate the aero-engine. The sliding mode control system consists of reachable and sliding stages, with the latter exhibiting robustness to parameter perturbations and external interference. The proposed neural network sliding mode control scheme enables the system to initiate and maintain the sliding mode, eliminating the need for the reachable stage. Additionally, the neural network compensates for the sliding mode switch control by introducing neuron control, enabling automatic convergence of the deviated state trajectory to the sliding surface in the presence of disturbances or parameter perturbations. The controller not only ensures robustness in the face of perturbations and external disturbances but also reduces or eliminates chattering phenomena.

In the design of the variable structure sliding mode control system, the reference model must fulfill two conditions: reflecting the desired control performance index and satisfying the tracking model match condition. The paper addresses the coupling effect posed by the double variable control system by identifying an appropriate reference model that aligns with the desired performance index through state feedback decoupling and pole assignment for the engine model.

Furthermore, the Model Reference Adaptive Neural Sliding Mode Controller demonstrates excellent decoupling capabilities for the low-pressure rotor and turbine rear total temperature of the engine. Even in the presence of disturbances and parameter perturbations, the control system's response curve remains relatively unchanged. The system achieves positive results at nominal and non-nominal points within the entire flight envelope, indicating strong anti-jamming capacity, robustness, and accurate static and dynamic control performance. The controller enhances the robustness of the control system, mitigates chattering in sliding-mode control, and improves tracking convergence.
