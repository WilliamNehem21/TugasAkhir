A new algorithm, which combines a modified histogram and mean shift, has been proposed to address challenges in tracking small targets in infrared imaging against complex backgrounds. The algorithm utilizes a lower-dimensional weighted histogram and determines the similarity measure using the Bhattacharyya coefficient. The target is then located using mean shift. Additionally, particle filtering is incorporated to enhance the accuracy and stability of the modified mean shift algorithm for obtaining optimal position estimates. Experimental results demonstrate that the modified algorithm can reduce tracking point fluctuations to less than 2 pixels in the test case.
