The arrangement of a monad serves as a strategy for managing the necessity of combining simpler programs into more complex ones. It is worth noting that the carrier of a coalgebra is commonly perceived as a collection of internal states within the model of computation being studied. In line with E. Moggi's concept, this paper adopts a different viewpoint, considering the carrier as a set of data.

The formal exploration of invariant properties of computations has been ongoing for a long time and has significantly influenced the progress of computer science. This paper focuses on the invariants of computations described by monadic coalgebras. Invariants of arbitrary coalgebras were introduced in previous works as subsets of the carrier that are closed with respect to the coalgebraic structure. Building on the research presented, we propose a new concept: invariant co-relations.

As seen in Section 4, invariant co-relations do not necessarily uniquely characterize the coalgebra, and they may fail to do so in certain irregular cases. We aim to identify specific well-behaved representatives and demonstrate that every coalgebra can be reduced to one of them. In our case, the well-behaved representatives are idempotent coalgebras.
