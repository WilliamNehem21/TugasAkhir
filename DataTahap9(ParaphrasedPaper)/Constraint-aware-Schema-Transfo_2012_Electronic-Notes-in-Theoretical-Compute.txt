The transformation of data schemas occurs within the realm of software evolution, refactoring, and cross-paradigm data mappings. When constraints are present in the original schema, they must be converted into constraints in the target schema. Additionally, when high-level data types are refined to lower-level structures, new constraints must be introduced in the target schema to maintain semantic integrity.

We present an algebraic approach to schema transformation that preserves constraints from the source to the target schema and introduces new constraints as necessary. Our approach is based on refinement theory and point-free program transformation, treating data refinements as rewrite rules on types with point-free predicates as constraints. At each rewrite step, the predicate on the reduct is computed from the predicate on the redex. An additional rewrite system on point-free functions normalizes the predicates along rewrite chains.

Constraints not only dictate the conformance of data schemas but also influence the validity of data queries and update functions. Schema definitions typically comprise a structural description augmented with constraints that impose additional semantic restrictions, such as referential integrity constraints in SQL and XSD schemas, operator precedences in grammars, and datatype invariants in VDM specifications.

Data schema transformations manifest in various contexts, including software maintenance, programming language evolution, and data mappings between programming paradigms. We have previously addressed the transformation of schemas, coupled data instances, and queries, employing data refinement theory and point-free program transformation. This formalization extends to the migration of data processors, encompassing structure-shy queries and update functions, and has been applied to various specifications and databases.

The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the problem of constraint-aware schema transformation and provide a motivating example. Section 3 offers background on refinement theory and point-free program calculation, while Section 4 presents theoretical support for constraint representation and rewriting. In Section 5, we detail how this theory can be operationalized using strongly-typed rewriting systems implemented in the functional programming language Haskell. We then demonstrate the application of our rewriting system to schema-aware hierarchical-relational mapping in Section 6, discuss related work in Section 7, and conclude in Section 8.

For instance, in XML schema, constraints such as uniqueness and referential integrity are defined using identity constraints, and constraints on the values can be expressed through general queries using XPath.

In summary, the paper introduces an approach to constraint-aware schema transformation based on refinement theory and point-free program transformation. It provides formalizations of constraints, their propagation and introduction during schema transformation, and demonstrates the operationalization of these theories in a rewriting system implemented in Haskell. Our approach aims to address the complexities involved in schema transformation and data mappings, spanning various contexts and scenarios.
