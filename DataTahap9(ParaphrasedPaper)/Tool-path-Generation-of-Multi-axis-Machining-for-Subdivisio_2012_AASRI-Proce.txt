The paper introduces a new algorithm for generating multi-axis NC tool paths for subdivision surfaces. The algorithm consists of two main steps: model building and tool path generation. In the model building step, the algorithm computes the deformation vector associated with the curvature and slope of the cutter location surface in order to obtain the deformed surface. The tool path generation step involves adopting the slicing procedure to obtain the CL points and using the inversely converted method. The algorithm is tested with actual machining examples, which demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing error in scallop height for subdivision surfaces and improving shape and quality. The method is also found to have scalable and robust computational complexity.

In the context of free-form surface design and manufacturing, existing CAD/CAM systems often use parametric surfaces like B-spline, Bezier, and NURBS representations, which may not be ideal for calculating gouge-free tool paths due to the non-smoothness of the surfaces, especially in complex multi-patch models. To address this issue, splicing and trimming are required.

Subdivision schemes have gained popularity in geometric modeling due to their ability to use simple patches to represent multi-surfaces and their integration of parametric surfaces and polygon mesh. Subdivision surfaces have become a preferred choice for unified design and manufacturing models, as evidenced by previous studies focused on 3-axis machining of subdivision surfaces. The paper chooses the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface due to its advantages in representing symmetric objects using quadrilaterals compared to triangular meshes. Research has shown that subdivision surfaces can be applied to CAM, and there is also discussion of an algorithm for tool path generation based on loop subdivision.
