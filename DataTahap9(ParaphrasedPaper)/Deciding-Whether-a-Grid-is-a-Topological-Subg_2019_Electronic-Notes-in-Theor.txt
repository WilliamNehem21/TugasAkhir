In other words, Theorem 1.1 states that it is NP-hard to find the largest topological grid minors in planar graphs with a maximum degree of 6. The proof of this theorem involves a new reduction, outlined in Section 1.4, from the NP-complete planar monotone 3-SAT problem.

The operation of adding a left arrow in a given face involves replacing the edge {(i, j), (i, j+1)} with a path {(i, j), s1, s2, (i, j+1)}, where s1 and s2 are new vertices, and adding the edges {(i+1, j), s1} and {(i+1, j+1), s2}. Similarly, definitions and operations for right arrow, up arrow, and bottom arrow are provided.

The construction of the positive bifurcation gadget involves introducing a new vertex s3, an edge {s2, s3}, and a new edge connecting s1 to the common vertex of the edges at the bottom and right of the face f1. The faces f1 and f0 are referred to as bifurcation faces, with f0 also known as the right connection face of the positive bifurcation gadget. Additional details regarding the positive bifurcation gadget are also provided.
