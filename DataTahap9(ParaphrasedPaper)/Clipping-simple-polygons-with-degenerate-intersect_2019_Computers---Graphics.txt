In q, the following vertex along this component, i1, is designated as an exit, the vertex after that, i2, as an entry, and so on. Similarly, for the second component of p, its initial vertex p6 is determined to be situated outside q, and therefore, i5 is labeled as an entry and i6 as an exit, and so on. In the case of q, it is established that q1 is positioned outside p, and accordingly, i2 is marked as an entry, and i7 as an exit, and so forth.
