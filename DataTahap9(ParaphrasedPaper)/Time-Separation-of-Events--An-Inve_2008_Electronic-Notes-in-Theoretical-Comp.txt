The problem of determining the time separation between events i and j, denoted as the direct problem, has been extensively studied in the literature. Even in the case of acyclic timing constraint graphs, the direct problem is known to be NP-complete. As a result, several researchers have proposed polynomial-time approximating algorithms to provide upper approximations of the maximal separation time. In contrast, this paper focuses on the inverse problem, which seeks to determine intervals for the component delays such that the time separation between i and j is guaranteed to not exceed a specified bound. The paper presents a polynomial-time method to solve this inverse problem, ensuring the exact maximal time within a possibly restricted domain of component delays. Notably, this approach differs from previous work, in which researchers have replaced certain bound values with parameters and computed the exact solution space using exponential-time procedures such as Fourier-Motzkin elimination or presburger-based procedures, or through techniques of abstract interpretation or parametric reachability analysis.

It is important to note that the unsatisfiability of the system described in the paper is exponential in the number of events due to the presence of min and max constraints. The general problem is NP-complete, which results in the loss of the polynomial-time complexity result of the basic method. However, the paper demonstrates the practical usefulness of this approach, despite the exponential complexity, for relaxing certain bounds associated with component delays while preserving the global separation time from event i to event j.
