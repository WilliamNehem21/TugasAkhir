Barbanera et al. extended intersection type systems by incorporating union types, motivated by the natural occurrence of union types in denotational semantics and their ability to provide more detailed type information for certain terms. However, despite the advantages of union types, it was observed that they do not enable the typing of more terms than what is achievable with intersection types alone. Specifically, the combined system of intersection and union types fully characterizes all strongly normalizing terms.

It is important to note that the introduction of intersection types on the left or the right is not a logical inference. Therefore, the type inferences involving intersection and union types are completely independent of the concept of the stoup, or the active formula. While the typing system incorporating both intersection and union types is reasonable, Barbanera et al. have pointed out that union types present technical challenges, such as issues with subject reduction. In particular, the system described above encounters difficulties in proving the substitution lemma.
