A cem protocol is designed to ensure fairness by providing non-repudiable evidence. At the end of a fair protocol run, both parties should receive all evidence or no party should receive any evidence. A trusted third party (TTP) can be used to oversee the process and maintain undeniable records of submission and delivery. However, the involvement of a TTP can create bottlenecks when handling a large number of cem services.

Our protocol comprises three sub-protocols: exchange, abort, and recover. The exchange sub-protocol is used by communicating parties to send an email and exchange irrefutable evidence, while the other sub-protocols are initiated by a party to involve the TTP in resolving any issues. Each use of the protocol is referred to as a protocol round, and a series of protocol rounds following an initial phase form a protocol session between a unique pair of communication parties.

Designing the behavior of the TTP requires careful modeling to ensure its objectivity and prevent collusion with protocol participants. We have constructed a model for the TTP that adheres to these principles.

Formal verification is crucial for security protocols due to the gravity of security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we leverage model checking technology to automatically verify whether a given model of cem protocols meets specified requirements. Relevant literature on the formal verification of cem protocols includes the works of Kremer et al., Cederquist et al., and Abadi and Blanchet.
