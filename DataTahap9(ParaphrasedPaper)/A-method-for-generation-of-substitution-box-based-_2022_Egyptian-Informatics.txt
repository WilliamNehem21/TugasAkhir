The use of a random selection approach has been proposed as a method for generating AES-like S-box structures, with chaos-based random selection designs being particularly popular. This study aims to enhance the nonlinearity value of S-box structures produced through random selection from an entropy source, and a post-processing technique is introduced to achieve this improvement.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the second section explains the working logic of the proposed method, the third section presents analysis results for three distinct scenarios, the fourth section provides a practical application of the obtained outputs, and the final section discusses the results and presents potential future studies.

The approach proposed in this study offers a simpler and quicker structure compared to optimization algorithms, aiming to elevate the nonlinearity criterion without compromising simplicity and speed. To achieve this, a combination of row, column, and both S-box structures is suggested. It has recently been demonstrated that altering the positions of S-box cells can enhance performance metrics, and the post-processing technique recommended in this study is further enhanced through DES S-box structures. In the previously proposed method, a new S-box structure is derived from each original S-box structure using the post-processing technique. This work has an advantage over the misuse of cryptographic algorithms.

The security of modern encryption algorithms is constantly under threat due to advances in cryptanalysis and technological developments. Although these algorithms are mathematically secure, application attacks have exposed potential weaknesses, particularly in cryptographic components such as S-box structures.

The proposed method has been found to significantly improve the performance of S-box structures with below-average characteristics. It has been demonstrated that modified S-box structures can be obtained from the original structure in three different scenarios, leading to notable improvements in design criteria: 81.25% in row transformations, 91.6% in column transformations, and 75% in row-column transformations. These results highlight the effectiveness of mixing columns and suggest that random selection-based approaches can be further enhanced by utilizing different techniques and methods in future studies.
