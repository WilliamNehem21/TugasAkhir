This paper details the development of a GIS server system application using ArcGIS technology to aid in biodiversity observation studies. The effectiveness of the system was investigated using a survey database of China. The paper concludes that the developed server application is highly valuable for creating, sharing, and utilizing biodiversity information.

The research underscores the significance of biodiversity observation in Asia, where severe biodiversity loss is observed. A network of biodiversity observation has been established in Asia, engaging scientists, citizens, and public sectors in collaborative efforts across sites in China, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Japan. The objective of the research is to enhance internal workflows at field observations and facilitate quicker sharing of updated biodiversity observation data through the development of a GIS-based server system database. The paper discusses research problems, outlines plans for seamless data integration, details the development of the GIS server system application, and presents a case study to verify its effectiveness.

The paper highlights the challenges in integrating biodiversity observations, particularly in managing complex GIS datasets with varied data types and volumes, as well as addressing data modeling issues. Additionally, it emphasizes the difficulty in handling large remote sensing data and the need to develop GIS image server technology to improve data access performance. The paper also stresses the importance of enabling easy access and analysis of GIS data for scientists and citizens who may not have technical expertise in GIS.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes the development of integrated high-performance dynamic data-sharing applications, incorporating GIS server, image server, and engine technologies. It suggests that this integration will enable efficient knowledge sharing and improve the overall quality of biodiversity data and information. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the advantages of sharing GIS resources through a GIS server, particularly in providing access to geographic information of biodiversity data on the web and facilitating custom applications.

The paper also details the development of two types of server applications â€“ a web service application created with ArcGIS server manager and a server integrated application for use within research groups. The developed GIS server application is validated through a case study involving field observation data in the East Tiaoxi River Basin of China, showing its efficiency in integrating and sharing observation field data. However, the paper notes limitations in displaying spatial relationship information due to the complex data structure of biodiversity information.

In summary, the paper emphasizes the importance of developing advanced GIS server applications to support biodiversity observation studies and highlights the challenges and potential solutions associated with sharing and integrating biodiversity information.
