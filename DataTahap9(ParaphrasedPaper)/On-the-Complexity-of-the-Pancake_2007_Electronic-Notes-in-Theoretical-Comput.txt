This paper investigates the computational complexity of a problem known as the pancake problem, which involves finding a line that bisects two given sets in the two-dimensional plane simultaneously. The paper explores the complexity of bisecting a set in a given direction, as well as the complexity of bisecting two linearly separable sets. The results indicate that the complexity of bisecting a nice polynomial-time approximable set at a given direction can be characterized by the counting class #P. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the complexity of bisecting two linearly separable nice polynomial-time approximable sets can also be characterized by the counting class #P. Furthermore, it is discovered that without certain conditions, such as thickness and linear separability, the computation of the bisector becomes arbitrarily difficult, even if it is unique.

The paper begins by defining the pancake problem as the task of finding a line that simultaneously bisects two given regions, and discusses its computational complexity. It is noted that this problem has been extensively studied for specific cases, such as when the sets are polygons or composed of a finite number of points. The paper then presents an overview of the basic computational model and the exact definition of the discrete complexity classes related to real functions.

The authors demonstrate that the complexity of computing the bisector at a given angle of a p-approximable bounded set with a positive thickness around the bisector falls between the complexity classes P#P and P#P1. They highlight that it is still an open question in discrete complexity theory whether P#P is equal to P#P1.

The paper also connects the pancake theorem with the intermediate value theorem and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, showing how these mathematical principles relate to the pancake problem in the two-dimensional plane. It is established that the complexity of computing the common bisector of two p-approximable sets becomes arbitrarily hard in general, even when certain conditions are met. However, if the two sets are linearly separable, the complexity of the problem can be characterized by the counting classes #P and #P1.
