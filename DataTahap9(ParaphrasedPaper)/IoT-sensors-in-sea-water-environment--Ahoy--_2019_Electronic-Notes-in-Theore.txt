This academic paper investigates the potential use of IoT sensors to measure various parameters of sea water, with a focus on their educational applications for promoting a deeper understanding of aquatic environments as natural resources and encouraging environmentally friendly behaviors. The paper discusses the limited exploration of sea-water sensing through IoT due to deployment challenges, as well as the need to develop appropriate scenarios for understanding aquatic parameters in STEM education. A hands-on IoT sensing trial conducted in the Aegean Sea is reported as a means to gain real data sets for devising realistic educational scenarios and to guide further research in the area of IoT water sensing for STEM education.

The paper also highlights the growing challenges to ocean ecosystems and marine resources and the increasing need for a well-trained ocean science workforce to support the expanding ocean economy. It argues for the integration of scientific understanding of aquatic resources into educational activities, starting at the school level, to nurture students' interest and provide them with technology-rich experiences that enhance their knowledge and skills in this field.

Additionally, the paper outlines the structure of the rest of the document, including sections on base work in water quality monitoring and its use in education, the parameters requiring monitoring to assess water quality, the design and capabilities of an IoT device used in the experiment, the execution of the experiment and the collected data, lessons learned, and potential educational applications derived from the work.

The paper also provides examples of existing practices in water-quality measurement, such as the use of underwater sensors to relay data for analysis and monitoring of pollution in urban water resources, as well as a description of an improvised device for remote water measurement using IoT technology.

Furthermore, the paper highlights the concerns related to using inexpensive IoT sensors for aquatic environments in educational settings, emphasizing the need for accurate and reliable measurements and the importance of addressing issues related to sensor robustness and accuracy in the design and implementation of IoT sensor systems for education.

Finally, the paper discusses the importance of measuring water temperature, conductivity (related to salinity), and turbidity, and provides details on the design of the sensor unit used in the experiments, based on the open-source Arduino platform, which was selected for its established electronics prototyping capabilities and its alignment with the principles of the Arduino community.
