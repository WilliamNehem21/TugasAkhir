In this section, we outline various numerical characteristics that indicate the quantity of different ranks. We note that numerous findings and methodologies can be reformulated solely using binary trees possessing specific attributes. It is evident that any type of size n can be interpreted as a binary tree with n leaves. More sophisticated type counting can be referenced in the works of Moczurad, Tyszkiewicz, and Zaionc. Furthermore, additional sources for type counting include Kostrzycka and Zaionc.
