The Petri Net Baukasten is segmented into three different perspectives: the application developer view, the expert view, and the tool developer view, interconnected through a common base. The common base, detailed in [4, 17], encompasses a classification of Petri nets and related concepts detached from their application, formalization, and tool support. These Petri net concepts are represented in the specific views, focusing on their application within a particular domain, their formalization within the Petri net theory, and their implementation as Petri net tools.

It is essential to note that the Petri Net Baukasten exists at a conceptual level only. The specifics of the individual views, the common base contents, and the manner in which these relationships are established are not pertinent at the conceptual level. Therefore, in order to apply the Petri Net Baukasten in practice, it must be implemented, which can be achieved in multiple ways. An implementation of the Petri Net Baukasten determines its contents and technical support. The initial realization, documented in [citation needed], offers a limited amount of data at a low technical level, lacking interactive access and user-specific interfaces. Cooperation among users is necessary for enriching the database and maintaining the conceptual structure of the Petri Net Baukasten.

The primary goal of the Petri Net Baukasten is to support various users of Petri nets within specific application domains, such as production automation, control systems, and workflow management. A Petri net type involves a semi-formal description of its characteristics, using Petri net concepts related to basic components and available operations, and is linked to the Petri net classification in the common base.

The academic paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the Petri Net Baukasten and the second installment, while Sections 3, 4, and 5 detail its constituents including the user interface, services, and database. In Section 6, a corresponding software architecture for the Petri Net Baukasten is proposed, followed by a user scenario outlining the advantages of the second installment in Section 7.

The Petri Net Baukasten comprises user interfaces corresponding to different user groups, namely application developers, experts, and tool developers. Each user interface offers a distinct set of services tailored to the specific needs of the respective user group, ensuring a more user-friendly experience. Additionally, the common user interface facilitates the selection of the desired user group and their corresponding interface.

The paper describes the various constituents of the Petri Net Baukasten, including user interfaces, services, and database components. It outlines the purpose and functionalities of each component and emphasizes the importance of dynamic utilization to accommodate evolving user needs and improve the overall user experience.
