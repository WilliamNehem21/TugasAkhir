In human societies, genetic diseases pose a significant threat due to the transfer of genetic traits across generations, which can result in unhealthy offspring and have detrimental effects on societal contributions. These diseases arise from mutations in DNA, caused by complex interactions between genes and environmental factors. This study aims to identify gene-gene and gene-environment interactions contributing to genetic diseases. It proposes a methodology utilizing filter and wrapper feature selection methods, specifically employing the relief algorithm for gene-environment interactions and a genetic algorithm for gene-gene interactions, along with a decision tree algorithm for generating conditional rules. The methodology's performance was evaluated using various classifier models on four benchmark databases, demonstrating superior classification accuracy and outperforming an apriori algorithm in identifying gene-gene interactions.

Machine learning approaches have been employed to address the challenges of understanding mutagenic changes, focusing on gene subset selection related to gene-environment interactions. Techniques such as the artificial bee colony approach, recursive memetic algorithm, bimodal unsupervised dimension reduction algorithm, and markov blanket-embedded genetic algorithm have been proposed for this purpose. Additionally, a combination of teaching learning-based optimization and simulated annealing algorithm with support vector machine has been utilized to identify informative gene subsets for cancer detection.

A method for data discretization considering the distribution of gene values and utilizing a k-means algorithm for partitioning gene values into clusters has been discussed. The study also introduces a measure for gene weight and a subset of genes interacting with the environment to achieve the highest classification accuracy.

The study's proposed methodology involves preprocessing databases to eliminate outliers and missing data, followed by data discretization. Performance evaluation involves partitioning the discretized databases into independent training and testing datasets, using 5-fold cross-validation for measuring predictive accuracy. The study emphasizes the importance of larger genetic databases to improve the accuracy of identifying gene interactions associated with genetic diseases.

In conclusion, the study presents a methodology for identifying gene interactions contributing to genetic diseases, showcasing its performance across different databases and calling for the availability of larger genetic databases to further understand genetic disease causes.
