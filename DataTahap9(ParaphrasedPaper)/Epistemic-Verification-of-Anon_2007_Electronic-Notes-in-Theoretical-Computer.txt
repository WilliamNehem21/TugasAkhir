Anonymity is not a property that can be directly verified using traditional model checkers because it is not trace-based. However, by employing epistemic logic to model protocols, anonymity can be expressed as a verifiable epistemic formula. We suggest employing dynamic epistemic logic to model security protocols and their properties, particularly anonymity properties. We have developed tool support for the verification of such properties, which leverages existing automata-based verification tools. To demonstrate this approach, we analyzed an anonymous broadcast protocol and an electronic voting protocol. We also compared the advantages and disadvantages of process-based and epistemic-based verification methods in general.

Epistemic updates can be understood as communication acts that alter epistemic models. A key advancement in epistemic logic was the proposal to view epistemic updates as a form of Kripke models, with the distinction that the worlds do not contain a valuation but a precondition formula. In our work, we formally defined this concept.

Translating the informal description of protocol steps into action models when modeling security protocols can be a challenging and subjective task, as it is with any modeling approach. However, compared to other logical modeling methods, action models have the advantage of being separate from the updates they are intended to determine. Their role is solely to accurately represent the communication act and any uncertainties related to that act.

The "foo" protocol, devised by Fujioka, Okamota, and Ohta, is a complex voting scheme that ensures the anonymity of voters in the presence of potential collusion among administrators, collectors, and external parties. In summary, the protocol involves a series of interactions with the administrator, utilizing a symmetric key, a nonce, and a unique property of the digital signing scheme to produce a signed covered vote. The voter then anonymously sends the signed covered vote to the collector, who subsequently publishes it. Following verification that her covered vote is included in the published list, the voter anonymously sends the symmetric key and covered vote to the collector, who can then open it and add it to the clear votes list, to be publicly revealed after all votes are cast.

We presented a tool-supported framework for epistemic verification, based on recent developments in dynamic epistemic logic. Central to this framework are the action models, which provide a concise and elegant representation of communication primitives, and the update product operation, which enables the mechanical execution of epistemic updates, thereby aligning the epistemic specification with a behavioral specification. Our work demonstrated that traditional verification toolsets can be leveraged to verify nontraditional and challenging properties such as anonymity, as evidenced by our analysis of two example protocols guaranteeing anonymity.
