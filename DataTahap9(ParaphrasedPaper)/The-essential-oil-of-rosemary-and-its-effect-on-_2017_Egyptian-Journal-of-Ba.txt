Selecting specific combinations of essential oils can help to elucidate their previously assumed biological activity. While rosemary essential oil has been used in aromatherapy for a long time, its effects on the human body, especially the nervous system, have not been thoroughly researched. In a study involving 20 healthy volunteers who inhaled rosemary essential oil, subjective feelings of the participants and objective indicators of the autonomic nervous system were assessed. The study also included electroencephalogram measurements. The results indicated a significant increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate after aromatherapy, with the volunteers reporting feeling more refreshed. The EEG analysis suggested stimulating effects of rosemary essential oil on brain wave activity.

Furthermore, venous blood samples were taken to determine the concentration of 1,8-cineole in the serum. The results showed a positive association between the concentration of 1,8-cineole absorbed into the bloodstream and the effectiveness of the tasks performed. The essential oil was also found to improve the speed and accuracy of task performance. However, its effect on mood was not particularly noticeable.

The research employed various statistical tests, including the Shapiro-Wilk test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney test, chi-square test, and the student t-test. Descriptive statistics were also calculated, and the database was formed in Microsoft Excel while the calculations were performed using the Statistica 6.1 program.

Notably, the effects of essential oils on human behavior can yield unexpected results. For instance, lavender essential oil was shown to increase a person's trust in others when sprayed in their presence, whereas inhaling peppermint essential oil made people less trusting. Such studies are crucial due to their potential impact on consumer behavior, negotiations, and decision-making processes.

Although fragmentary research on the relationship between essential oils and human behavior exists in the global literature, this area remains understudied in the population of Ukraine. The results obtained from the study help to fill the gap in knowledge regarding the effects of essential oils on human short-term memory and contribute to the exploration of potential interventions for short-term image and numerical memory. Furthermore, tests involving the effect of rosemary essential oil on the cognitive features of students showed statistically significant differences in short-term memory between the study participants and the control group. These findings contribute to the existing understanding of the effects of essential oils on human cognitive functions.
