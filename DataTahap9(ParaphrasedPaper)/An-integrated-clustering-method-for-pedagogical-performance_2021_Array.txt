Achieving high-quality education is the ultimate aspiration for students, educational institutions, and nations worldwide, as stated by Pumilia and Meusburger. The United Nations recognizes that good quality education is fundamental to sustainable development, which in turn leads to improved living standards, innovation, and creativity. In the age of abundant data generation, this presents both challenges and opportunities. In academic environments, where a diverse student population engages with various modules at different levels, the resulting data attributes are significant sources of big data that are highly interconnected.

The type, quantity, and rate of change of this data are routine considerations for researchers. This paper seeks to encourage educators and researchers to collaborate in exploring and analyzing these factors in interdisciplinary contexts. The aim is to contribute to the work of the Center for Higher Education Data and Statistics (CHEDS), which collects crucial educational data for the Ministry of Education (MOE). CHEDS uses evidence-based decision-making to influence higher education policies and planning at both institutional and national levels, thereby empowering the education sector to enhance its strengths and rankings in the competitive world of higher education. The resulting reports and analyses will aid in improving student learning experiences and curriculum designs.

The paper also discusses using merged clusters as exemplars to maximize the average similarity levels. Through repeated sampling and validation, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the influential factors in cluster formation. The mechanics of propagated clustering are further described using Algorithm 1. This work is further elaborated in the study by Mwitondi, Munyakazi, and Gatsheni on the amenability of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to big data modeling, presented at the International Workshop on Data Science in 2018.
