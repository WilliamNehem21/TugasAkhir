The paper discusses biochemical pathways as networks of interactions among biological entities such as proteins, DNA, RNA, and other molecules within cells. These interactions involve various processes like binding and unbinding of molecular species, protein synthesis and degradation, conformational changes, and movement of molecules between compartments. The challenge addressed in this paper is to identify the biological entities involved in a given pathway.

The proposed approach introduces a modular verification method for efficiently verifying pathway properties by applying model checking to an abstraction of the pathway semantics. This abstraction focuses on the behavior of a subset of the involved biological entities and introduces the concept of molecular components as counterparts to biological entities in the pathway model. Complexes representing interactions between multiple biological entities are replaced by different molecular species, allowing for the identification of individual molecular components.

An algorithm is presented for transforming pathways into their corresponding normal forms with specified molecular components. The identification of molecular components enables syntactic transformations to simplify the visualization of pathways and the generation of formal descriptions using automata or process algebra. The approach also allows for the application of formal methods such as model checking and bisimulation to analyze and compare pathway behaviors.

The algorithm may require human intervention in cases of ambiguities, but it aims to minimize the need for manual intervention. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through its application to the EGF signaling pathway, where molecular components are successfully inferred from the pathway reactions without requiring human intervention.

The paper also discusses the notation for modeling biochemical pathways and addresses the issue of distinguishing different subspecies of the same components in pathway reactions. The proposed algorithm is applied to a computational model of the EGF signaling pathway, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying molecular components and generating a component interaction graph to clarify the pathway structure.

Future work aims to adapt the approach for quantitative aspects of pathways, such as reaction kinetics and spatial distribution of molecules, to enable the translation of pathways into stochastic and spatial formalisms. This adaptation is necessary to preserve the rates of occurrence of reactions and ensure the accurate representation of quantitative aspects in pathway models.
