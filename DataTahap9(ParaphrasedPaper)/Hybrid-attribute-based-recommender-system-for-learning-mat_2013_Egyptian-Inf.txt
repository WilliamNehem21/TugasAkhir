Alternatively, we may categorize learning materials based on two distinct sets of attributes: explicit attributes, which are readily known such as subject and publisher, and implicit (latent) attributes, which can be inferred from historical ratings of learners. While explicit attributes can be extracted by experts, implicit attributes are latent and can be discerned from historical ratings of learners. Research has explored the combination of user or item attributes with historical ratings to enhance recommendation accuracy. Robin reviewed several hybrid recommender methods aimed at amalgamating explicit features and historical rating data to achieve improved prediction accuracy. The experiment results suggest that both features and historical ratings contribute significantly to estimating the prediction function for recommendation.

To enhance the quality and accuracy of recommendations and mitigate challenges in existing recommender algorithms, such as sparsity in learning environments, this paper proposes a unified model that integrates the explicit and implicit attributes of learners and materials. The model comprises two modules. The implicit attribute-based module employs genetic algorithms to derive implicit attributes of learners from historical ratings, represented as weight vectors. Meanwhile, the explicit attribute-based module introduces a preference matrix (PM) to model learner interests based on the explicit attributes of learning materials in a multidimensional space. The primary contribution of this study lies in enhancing the quality of recommendations.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses previous works related to e-learning material recommender systems, while Section 3 presents the overall system framework and details the proposed mechanism. The experimental section applies the proposed algorithm to a dataset to evaluate and analyze its performance. Finally, the conclusion section provides concluding remarks.

Recommender systems have found practical applications in real e-commerce platforms like Amazon and CDNow, where they are employed to recommend products and services to online shoppers. Several research system prototypes, such as Syskill, Webert, FAB, and GroupLens, have also been developed. While many recommendation systems exist in various domains, such as movies, music, news, commerce, and medicine, their implementation in the education sector remains relatively limited. The emergence of e-learning has propelled learning material recommendation as a novel topic in the realm of recommendation systems.

Most recommendation systems are designed based on either content-based filtering or collaborative filtering. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, with content-based approaches directly utilizing product information and collaborative filtering approaches leveraging user rating information. Furthermore, researchers have proposed various algorithms, some of which draw from the advancements in data mining. Several recommendation algorithms, such as user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, cluster-based collaborative filtering, dimension reduction-based collaborative filtering, horting graph-theoretic collaborative filtering, and Bayesian network-based recommendation, have been put forth. The subsequent section delves into researches centered on recommender systems in the e-learning domain, categorized into four distinct groups.

Hybrid recommendation strategies, which leverage the strengths of multiple recommendation systems, are anticipated to yield superior results compared to individual strategies. Many hybrids work by combining different input data sources or recommendation strategies. For instance, Liang et al. implemented a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to offer personalized recommendations for a courseware selection module, while Liu and Shih designed a material recommendation system based on association.

The rating of a user for an item reflects the overall rating value across different attribute values of the product. Consequently, two users with similar overall rating values for a specific item may place varying emphasis on its attributes. Therefore, to achieve effective personalization in e-learning recommender systems, it is crucial to consider the diverse attributes of materials.

Accordingly, we can leverage prediction models built based on observed or explicit attributes, in conjunction with latent or implicit attributes, to enhance the recommendation process and improve prediction accuracy. In this study, explicit attributes were modeled using PM, while a genetic algorithm was utilized to establish the relationship between the overall rating and the underlying implicit attribute weight vector for each learner. Specifically, given the ratings data of a learner, the genetic algorithm computes their preference model in terms of implicit attribute weights.

Herein, the decimal number "x" represents the binary code for each attribute weight, leading to the formation of two matrices of attribute weights: WU for user attributes and WI for item attributes, serving as the optimization targets. The initial solution could involve random values obtained through an offline process. New individuals produced in each iteration are evaluated using a fitness function based on the sum of fitness in a population, with individuals exhibiting lower fitness (indicative of higher prediction accuracy) having a greater probability of selection. The universal sampling method has proven effective in selecting individuals for the reproduction of the next population, thereby improving the algorithm's efficiency.

The mutation operator, employed to explore unvisited points in the search space and prevent premature convergence caused by dominant individuals, facilitates random changes in one or more elements of the string. It operates under a small probability, known as the mutation rate, by randomly selecting elements of an individual and altering their values to yield a new individual, thereby preserving population diversity.

The preference model of learner li is defined as a matrix with m rows, where m represents the number of material attributes. Each cell in this matrix is defined as a four-tuple (ka, nh, rr, level), where "ka" denotes the keyword of the "level-th" attribute accessed by learner li, and "level" represents the row number for this tuple.

To offer recommendations, the paper presents two methods: explicit attribute-based collaborative filtering (EAB-CF) and implicit attribute-based collaborative filtering (IAB-CF). These methods are then combined for the final recommendation, employing a linear combination of EAB-CF and IAB-CF. The proposed algorithm's performance is evaluated using the real-world MACE1 dataset. This dataset provides a rich source of digital information about architecture and has been utilized by various researchers to evaluate decision support accuracy. The precision and recall metrics, measuring exactness and completeness, are employed to evaluate the recommender system's performance.

The genetic algorithm only retains the best 5% of individuals from each generation to form the next generation (referred to as elitist selection). The algorithm terminates when an individual with a fitness value lower than a constant c is present.

In addition, three other parameters - number of neighborhoods, weighting coefficient in the combination of two types of similarity in EBA-CF (beta), and, EAB-CF and IAB-CF (alpha) - are adjusted to enhance recommendation accuracy. Previous experiments have shown that EBA-CF for b=0.35 yields the best prediction accuracy.

One of the pivotal applications of recommendation systems in e-learning is the personalized recommendation of learning materials. Nonetheless, the massive repository of learning materials, coupled with their numerous attributes, presents challenges such as sparsity when employing existing recommendation algorithms. To address these challenges and offer effective recommendations for learners, this paper introduces a novel personalized recommender system that integrates explicit and implicit attributes in a unified model. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional approaches, thus enhancing the quality of recommendations and mitigating the sparsity problem through the incorporation of genetic algorithms and a multidimensional information model.
