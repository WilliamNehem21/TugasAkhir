This academic paper introduces an enhanced version of the Markov clustering protocol, which aims to improve the communication efficiency and energy consumption of wireless sensor networks. The proposed protocol, called weighted Markov clustering-based routing (WMCL-BCRP), focuses on selecting cluster-heads and sensors to extend the network's lifetime in scenarios with non-uniform sensor distribution. This is achieved through adaptive cluster-head selection based on sensor residual energy and distribution density, as well as the use of weighted sensors to minimize redundant data transmissions in dense regions and conserve energy.

The authors compare the performance of WMCL-BCRP with its unweighted ancestor (MCL-BCRP) and several widely used clustering routing protocols such as LEACH, PEGASIS, TEEN, and HEED. Simulations conducted on 100 random wireless sensor networks demonstrate that WMCL-BCRP significantly outperforms the other protocols in terms of network lifetime, average sensor lifetime, energy dissipation, and number of expired sensors per round. However, WMCL-BCRP exhibits a relatively earlier first sensor expiry compared to TEEN, attributable to its selection of queried sensors with low weight factors in regions with weak batteries.

The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of WMCL-BCRP in enhancing network lifetime and reducing energy consumption, suggesting its applicability to other domains in future research.
