A semi-natural polymeric blend composed of chitosan/polycaprolactone (Ch/PCL) and containing gradient concentrations of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) as dopants was synthesized using the hot injection method in this study. The synthesized samples with varying CdSe QDs concentrations were analyzed using X-ray diffraction and FTIR absorption spectroscopy. The experimental FTIR data showed that the characteristic vibrational band was maintained with slight variations in intensity and position as the dopant concentration increased. XRD patterns indicated the amorphous nature of the virgin blend and samples with a small amount of QDs, while samples with higher CdSe QDs concentrations (0.008 and 0.016 wt%) exhibited the appearance of crystalline bands corresponding to the (1 1 1) reflection plane, in agreement with JCPDS Card No. 19-0191. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the morphology of the synthesized biocomposites was significantly affected by the addition of CdSe QDs.

The use of biological cells as alternative fluorescent probes has gained popularity in various applications such as biological imaging, biosensing, intracellular detection and targeting, solar cells, quantum computing, transistors, LEDs, and diode lasers. Density functional theory (DFT) is a computational quantum mechanical method commonly used in physical science and material science to study the electronic structure of many-body systems, including particles and atoms.

This research aimed to establish a standard method for characterizing a novel semi-natural polymeric blend containing gradient concentrations of CdSe QDs. FTIR, DFT, and XRD were employed to validate the reaction mechanisms between the organic matrix and the inorganic dopant. Additionally, antimicrobial tests were conducted to assess the effect of CdSe QDs on various gram-positive, gram-negative, and fungal microorganisms.

The antimicrobial activity of the CdSe QDs-doped polymer blend was tested against different bacteria and fungi. Results showed no significant antibacterial activity at 0.008 wt% CdSe QDs, except for moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Among the microorganisms tested, Bacillus subtilis exhibited the highest susceptibility, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible to CdSe QDs. Increased CdSe QDs concentration led to a notable reduction in antibacterial activity, possibly due to increased particle size. The differences in inhibition zone sizes between CdSe QDs synthesized at different concentrations may be attributed to variations in nanoparticle diffusion tendencies in cells, resulting in different levels of reactive oxygen species production.

In summary, the synthesized biocomposites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, FTIR absorption spectroscopy, and DFT. The addition of CdSe QDs markedly influenced the morphology of the biocomposites. Antibacterial tests showed varying inhibition zones related to the increasing concentration of CdSe QDs and the specific bacterial strains under investigation. Furthermore, the activity index percentage was evaluated to assess the antimicrobial effects of the CdSe QDs-doped polymer blend.
