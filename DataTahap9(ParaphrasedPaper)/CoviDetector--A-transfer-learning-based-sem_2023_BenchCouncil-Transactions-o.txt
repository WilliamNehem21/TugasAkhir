The COVID-19 virus, believed to have originated in December 2019, has resulted in 6.9 million deaths as of July 02, 2023. When infected individuals cough or sneeze, viral droplets can remain airborne for up to three hours. This respiratory infection poses a threat to overall health.

Amid the global spread of COVID-19, researchers and data scientists have started using deep learning techniques for automated virus detection in humans. Ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have rapidly improved computer-aided diagnostics in various medical domains, leading to more accurate diagnoses of diseases like cancer through automatic image analysis using deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN). As such, these models hold promise for improving the use of chest X-ray (CXR) images in COVID-19 diagnosis.

CXR images of COVID-19-affected lungs show reduced porosity and visibility due to the presence of dense mucus. Although numerous machine and deep learning-based algorithms and diagnostic tools have shown potential, they still lack high performance in terms of precision and error rates. Therefore, the medical community and society as a whole would benefit from the adoption of effective deep learning-based diagnostic tools.

In this study, a machine learning system called COVIDetector was developed to use transfer learning and the InceptionV3 deep learning model for early COVID-19 identification and diagnosis from chest X-rays. Additionally, this system is deployed as an android backend, with a user interface designed using the React Native framework, enabling the input and prediction of image results.

COVIDetector is an android application aimed at providing medical professionals and consumers with an easy means to screen for COVID-19. The proposed app facilitates prompt classification of CXRs uploaded by patients, enabling doctors to take immediate action without waiting for reports. COVIDetector accurately determines whether a person is COVID-19 positive or negative based solely on a CXR image. This information can be used by doctors to make decisions promptly, benefiting both individuals and the community.

Various studies have utilized different deep learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis, with varying degrees of accuracy. For instance, the RESNET101 CNN model achieved up to 71.9% accuracy, while the use of VGG16 and VGG19 models resulted in higher accuracies of approximately 99.3%. Similarly, other studies reported accuracies ranging from 85.20% to 98.72%, demonstrating the potential of deep learning models in COVID-19 diagnosis.

Moreover, the integration of deep learning algorithms with the Internet of Things (IoT) allows for the implementation of smart X-ray-based COVID-19 detection on embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Additionally, the integration of chatGPT and IoT technologies can further enhance and expedite patient care, contributing to technological advancements that can improve lives for future generations.
