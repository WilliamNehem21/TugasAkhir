The effectiveness of a logic is determined by the connectives available in its language. As previously mentioned, discussing paracompleteness requires a specific type of negation and disjunction. In addition to these, we will introduce a suitable conjunction and implication to complete the language. In Definition 2.3, we outline the conditions that these connectives must satisfy in order to be considered as conjunction, disjunction, and implication.
