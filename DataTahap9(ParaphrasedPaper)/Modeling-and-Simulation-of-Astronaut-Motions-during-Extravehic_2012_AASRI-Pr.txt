The concept of extravehicular activities (EVA) is approached from the perspective of complex system theory in this academic paper. It describes the application of a complex system model to the astronaut in a space suit with a backpack, and outlines the development of a coupled forward-inverse dynamics model to dynamically calculate the motions of all subsystems and the entire system without the need for additional variables for solving multi-result problems. Additionally, a sensor-actor model is constructed to analyze the torque on the joints generated by the space suit, expanding the analytical space from two dimensions to three. The paper concludes with the presentation of application examples of constrained operations to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the method.

The paper also emphasizes the necessity of EVAs for activities such as spaceflight accident rescue, but acknowledges the challenges and expenses associated with these tasks, which must be completed within limited time, workspace, and energy in a microgravity environment. It highlights the specialized training required for astronauts wearing space suits and emphasizes the importance of designing tasks and conducting preparations based on studies of suited astronauts' motions in microgravity. Given the inherent limitations of physical microgravity simulators, the paper advocates for the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) as an effective method for studying EVAs, as it can compensate for differences between space operations and ground operations.

The paper then discusses a novel M&S method for modeling the motions of astronauts during EVAs, followed by the introduction of some applications related to space station mission preparations to demonstrate the practical use of the method. The paper concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future work.
