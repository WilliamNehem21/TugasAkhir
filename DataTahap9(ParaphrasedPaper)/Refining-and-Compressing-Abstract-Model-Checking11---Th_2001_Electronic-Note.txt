The utilization of temporal logic (e.g., for verifying security properties of protocols) has been widely acknowledged. However, it is a well-established fact that verifying a temporal logic formula against a model, particularly the identification of all system states that satisfy the formula, is generally a challenging task. It is important to note that while this problem is decidable for both CTL* and the simpler case of CTL when dealing with finite states, it becomes significantly complex for CTL* and poses a PSPACE complete challenge. Model checking is typically employed for programs consisting of multiple concurrent processes, where the state space representing the entire program behavior may grow exponentially with the number of processes, leading to the state explosion problem. Additionally, the substantial complexity involved in verifying temporal formulae against a model, particularly for CTL*, presents limiting factors that need to be addressed for practical use of this technique.

Temporal logic is well-suited for capturing the time-varying behavior of reactive systems, including universal properties (properties that must hold across all program executions) and existential properties (properties that must hold across some executions), as well as safety properties (ensuring that nothing undesirable occurs) and liveness properties (ensuring that something desirable eventually happens).

Consider Example 4.6: by abstracting 'c' with 'signv' from the example in Section 3, we obtain model 'a.' Conversely, when considering Example 5.6, it is evident that the model computed with 'sign' is less precise than 'a' since the 'z' element is not join-irreducible.

The importance of compression in relation to disjunction is based on Theorem 4.5. In this scenario, it is pertinent to inquire whether it is feasible to minimize the disjunctive information in domains in such a way that the abstract model is minimal with respect to this information. Subsequently, we will explore the concept of least disjunctive bases as introduced in [source].

It is worth noting that if the cells to be sorted by the linear sorting array algorithm are denoted as 'n,' the number of abstract states is 2n+1, whereas the number of concrete states is either infinite or 2rn, considering a range 'r' of integer numbers (e.g., r â‰¤ 2maxint).
