Data fields offer a versatile and widely applicable framework for organized data collections. Data Field Haskell, a specific variant of Haskell, serves as an example of how data fields can be implemented. It is particularly well-suited for generic programming involving collections, with a specific focus on multidimensional structures. In this paper, we provide an overview of the data field model and its theoretical foundation, followed by a description of Data Field Haskell and its practical implementation.
