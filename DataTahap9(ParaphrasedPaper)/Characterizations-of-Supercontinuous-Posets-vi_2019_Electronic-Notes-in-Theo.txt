This paper introduces the notions of scott s-sets, weakly local s-compactness, and s-bases of partially ordered sets (posets). It also provides characterizations of supercontinuous and superalgebraic posets using these concepts. Furthermore, a new concept of the s-essential topology on posets is introduced to offer a topological interpretation of s-bases, and properties and characterizations of s-bases via the s-essential topology are investigated. The main results include the characterization of supercontinuous posets using the separation of different points, and the embedding of continuous posets into continuous domains via the scott topology.

A poset is directed if every finite subset of it has an upper bound, and it is a directed complete partially ordered set (dcpo) if every directed subset has a supremum. Complete lattices, on the other hand, are posets in which every subset has a supremum. It is noted that distributive lattices need not be continuous in general. The paper also introduces the concept of scott s-sets of posets, and it is shown that they play a role in characterizing supercontinuous posets similar to that of scott open sets in characterizing continuous posets.
