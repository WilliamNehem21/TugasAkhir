The trust management framework (TMF) utilizes trustworthiness to guide control decisions, such as taking action against a component in the case of non-compliance, re-estimating quality attributes and re-evaluating compliance in response to decreased stability, and re-instantiating a component in a different mode of operation or controlled environment due to reduced benignity.

Trust management has garnered attention in computer science research, particularly in the realms of distributed access control and reputation network management. Evaluating trustworthiness bears similarities to the task of selecting a reliable web service, where users prefer services expected to uphold their agreements outlined in service level agreements (SLAs). For instance, a web service's trust value can be determined based on user reports processed by a trusted registry over time.

A trustworthiness profile model (TP) comprises a set of modes, like the quality profile, representing different judgmental modalities in various contexts. Each mode encompasses observed quality attributes (QAs) filled in by the TMF and collected over time. The values of benignity and stability, critical for TMF decision-making, are calculated using subjective logic operators.

The Trust Evaluation Framework (TEF) has been implemented in OCaml and interfaced with a RoboCop component written in C. A validation phase is underway to assess the TMF's applicability in healthcare, entertainment, and communication domains.
