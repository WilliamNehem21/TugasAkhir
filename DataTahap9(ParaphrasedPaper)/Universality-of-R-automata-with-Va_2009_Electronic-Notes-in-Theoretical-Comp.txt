r-automata are a type of finite state machines that have been enhanced with counters, which can be incremented or reset to zero as transitions occur. The universality question seeks to determine if there exists a constant, d, such that all words can be accepted by a run where no counter exceeds d. It has been demonstrated that this question is decidable. This paper introduces a new operation to r-automata, specifically the ability to copy the value of a counter into another counter. The paper's result involves a reduction of the universality problem for r-automata with value copying to the universality of r-automata, thereby establishing the problem as decidable. The reduction involves replacing copy operations with non-deterministic resets and a mechanism to ensure a bounded number of replacements between each pair of counter resets.

Finite state machines typically function as word acceptors, with the acceptance condition based on the state reached at the end. In terms of word acceptance, the events that occur during the run are irrelevant as long as the process concludes in an accepting state. It is possible to introduce a concept of cost into finite automata by assigning a price to each transition, with the cost of a run being the sum of the costs of the transitions. The cost of a word is then the minimum cost among all accepting runs for that word. This concept can be incorporated into the automata model by introducing counters that accumulate the cost during runs.

Questions about these automata revolve around the existence of bounds on the costs (i.e., counter values). The limitedness problem seeks to determine whether there exists a bound such that all accepted words are accepted by a run where no counter exceeds this bound. The universality problem is a specific instance of the limitedness problem, inquiring whether there is a bound such that all words are accepted by a run where no counter exceeds this bound. It has been shown that this problem is decidable for r-automata using the factorization forest theorem. This paper establishes the decidability of the universality problem for r-automata with value copying by reducing it to the universality problem of r-automata (without copying).

The primary idea behind the reduction is to replace copy instructions with resetting and swapping the counter values. This allows for the decision of which counter to retain the accumulated value in, and a mechanism is in place to ensure a bounded number of resets throughout the lifetime of each value. This bounded mechanism allows for a constant ratio decrease in the cost of each word.

In summary, the paper addresses the extension of r-automata with a new operation of copying values from one counter to another and demonstrates its impact on the decidability of the universality problem.
