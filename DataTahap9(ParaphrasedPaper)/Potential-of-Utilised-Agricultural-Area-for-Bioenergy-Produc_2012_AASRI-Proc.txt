Land is a crucial resource with significant implications for development and renewable energy production. In Latvia, the majority of land is located in rural areas, with a significant portion being woodland and agricultural land. The utilization of agricultural land for renewable energy production, particularly through biogas facilities, has become increasingly important in the European Union. The output of renewable energy has been on the rise, with agriculture playing a key role as a supplier of biomass for energy production.

Efforts have been made to assess and utilize agricultural land in Latvia for additional immovable property tax, with a focus on maintaining good agricultural and environmental conditions. There is potential for significant production of biogas and electricity from agricultural sources, which could lead to rural development, job creation, and increased tax revenues. Furthermore, by improving agricultural productivity and efficiency, Latvia has the potential to substantially increase food output and electricity production from agricultural biomass.

In summary, Latvia has the opportunity to develop both food production and renewable energy resources, particularly through the expansion of biogas facilities, which could bring about numerous economic, environmental, and agricultural benefits.
