As the concept of the metaverse gradually becomes a reality, it presents significant opportunities for education by offering a new level of engagement, interaction, and experiences for both students and educators. However, there is a lack of tools available to researchers that allow for the comprehensive examination of numerous factors that influence an individual's experience when engaging in educational activities within the metaverse. This study aimed to address this gap by developing and testing the Metaverse Learning Experience Scale (MLES). The scale was validated and found to be reliable through statistical analyses of data collected from 462 university students who participated in its testing. The final version of the scale consists of forty-three items, examining ten factors, including perceived quality of virtual environment graphics, perceived cognitive load, perceived ease of use/control of the virtual environment, immersion/presence, perceived feedback and content quality, perceived degree of interaction, motivation to learn and use the virtual environment, perceived usefulness/knowledge gains, simulator sickness, and positive feelings. The study also discussed the scale's factorial structure and its implications for research and practice.

The concept of the metaverse is commonly associated with 3D virtual environments and the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets, raising questions about the extent to which computers, smartphones, and tablets can offer similar levels of immersive experiences. Experts believe that the metaverse has the potential to connect individuals worldwide, acting as a central hub for various activities including gaming, socializing, education, and commerce. This in turn could revolutionize how people access information and communicate. The study sought to define the metaverse as a collection of highly immersive and interactive 3D spaces accessed through XR headsets/devices, and focused specifically on the educational uses of the metaverse.

The study adopted a holistic approach to the development of the scale, aiming to address challenges such as defining difficult-to-capture factors, and comprehensibility of the instruments used. The research involved a comprehensive review of past studies and instruments used in educational applications with VR headsets, resulting in the initial draft of the MLES consisting of 208 items organized into fifteen constructs. Feedback from thirty university students was gathered to refine the scale, and a subsequent examination of past studies led to the retention of forty-five items belonging to ten factors.

The study then utilized exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the scale, demonstrating its robustness and ability to measure multiple aspects of one's learning experience in the metaverse. The study highlighted the potential applications of the scale for diverse groups of learners, application developers, researchers, and educators in evaluating the effectiveness of educational applications in the metaverse.

In conclusion, the study's contribution lies in the development of a brief, yet robust and reliable scale that can be used to assess various educational applications in the metaverse context, providing valuable insights into the impact of metaverse-based education. The study's findings have the potential to enhance our understanding of the metaverse's educational impact and guide future research in this area.
