The findings presented in section 4 are limited to semantics that are defined by preorders that are coarser than the ready simulation and are included in i. This means that finer semantics, such as possible and impossible futures, as well as other coarser preorders not encompassed in i, such as the trace and complete trace preorders, are excluded from the scope. To address these cases, we intend to utilize the results of our developed general constrained simulations.
