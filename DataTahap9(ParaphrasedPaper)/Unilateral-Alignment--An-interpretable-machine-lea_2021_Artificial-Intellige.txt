Geophysical logs interpretation involves using logs to predict information about borehole geology, such as lithofacies and porosity, which is crucial for understanding the subsurface earth. In recent years, there has been a growing application of machine learning in logs interpretation. For instance, a semi-supervised model called Laplacian Support Vector Machine has been introduced to address the challenge of limited labeled data. This model leverages smoothness in the feature space and depth to extend labels from labeled samples to unlabeled ones, thereby improving classification accuracy. However, the setting of Laplacian in semi-supervised learning is still largely empirical, and incorporating unlabeled data may lead to reduced performance compared to using only labeled data. To address this challenge, an ensemble mechanism has been employed to combine multiple candidate Laplacians and calculate an optimal one to ensure the safety of using semi-supervision. Similar approaches can be found in existing literature.

Furthermore, data mining and processing techniques can be combined with machine learning algorithms to address the issue of data imbalance. Filtering techniques can help eliminate non-stratigraphic responses, but their impact on the distribution is limited.
