This paper presents a study of an icing rate sensor that utilizes infrared spectrum absorption. The sensor employs two infrared laser diodes driven by a pulse circuit. The key technology of this sensor is discussed, highlighting its compact size, ease of extension, and more reliable components compared to traditional circumvolving filter projects.

The formation of ice on aircraft surfaces due to structural icing is a major cause of flight disasters for general aircraft. Ice buildup can rapidly disrupt aerodynamics, leading to decreased flight efficiency and performance. This can result in various issues such as engine power consumption, breakdowns of control panels, brakes, and landing gear, ultimately leading to serious flight accidents, especially for aircraft unable to fly over icing conditions. The infrared-based sensor is designed to precisely measure surface icing rates when a helicopter is hovering.

The sensor amplifies and filters alternating two-way signals using a preamplifier circuit. The filtered electrical signals are then converted into digital signals by an AD converter in the detection circuit. These digital signals are subsequently transformed into analog signals characterizing ice thickness by a DA converter and are sent to a higher-level system or display device via the communication interface circuit of the signal detection circuit.

To ensure the high light intensity and spectral stability required by the infrared absorption-based icing rate sensor, attention is drawn to the significant impacts of ambient temperature and lamp-house drive current of the light source. Therefore, a key technology in this context is to control the light source intensity and spectral stability. The program aims to develop a high-precision constant current source drive circuit and temperature control circuit to ensure access to high-performance light sources.
