This paper introduces respect nets, a formalism that can be utilized to represent reactive behaviors with both successful and failed outcomes, and enables encoding to Petri nets with inhibitor arcs. Respect nets serve as a fundamental model for a portion of the respect language, and lay the foundation for developing an analysis methodology that includes formal verification of safety and liveness properties. The paper provides a semantics to respect specifications through a mapping to respect nets and discusses the potential of this approach for analyzing respect specifications, presenting initial results for the analysis of safety properties.

In the subsequent discussion, a set x is denoted by the metavariable x and its decorations such as x', x0, and so on. The symbol x represents the set of multisets over x, with its elements taking the form x||x||..||x (potentially with repetitions), and is used to represent the void multiset.

Communication events can arise from either external events (such as listening or speaking events) or be triggered when a reaction primitive is executed. The execution of a reaction is considered atomic, meaning that if any of its goals cannot be achieved, the entire reaction fails and does not alter the tuple space state.

To transform a ground respect specification into a flow-oriented one, the following steps are taken: (i) translate c-rsts, (ii) translate r-rsts and their calls, (iii) resolve head clashing in different r-rsts, and (iv) reorder the body of r-rsts. These steps are elaborated in detail in the paper. For brevity, the paper refers to specification tuples as re(head, body) instead of reaction(head, body).

The paper also discusses the use of the primitive no r(t) to verify whether a transformation process over a set of tuples is complete, while still preserving the well-structured monotonic nature of the overall process. An example is provided where all instances of tuples t a in the tuple space need to be replaced by tuples t b, resembling broadcast protocols which maintain the well-structured property. This tuple transformation can be implemented with a flow-oriented respect specification.

A notable limitation of the approach outlined in the paper is the lack of treatment for logic variables and unification. This challenge stems from the inherent dichotomy between operational and declarative, logic-based formal frameworks. However, a potential solution to this issue is to utilize techniques for the groundization of general, non-ground respect specifications. Under certain assumptions, such as a finite alphabet and finite data structures, the number of possible ground versions of any general respect specification is finite, making the automatic translation techniques introduced in the paper applicable once more. Future work is expected to pursue this research direction.
