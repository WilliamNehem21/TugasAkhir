The paper introduces a model for object-orientation-based direction relations in three-dimensional space, building on the existing model for two-dimensional space. The new model eliminates the computation related to the world boundary of spatial direction regions and transforms the processing of direction predicates into topological operations between open shapes and closed geometry objects. The algorithms for these topological operations are presented along with theoretical proof for their correctness and completeness.

The study underscores the importance of providing a method for modeling and processing direction queries in three-dimensional space within a spatial database management system. It outlines the significance of researching object-orientation-based open shape models in three-dimensional space.

The paper focuses on defining a topological operation called "interiorintersects" and discusses its implementation using open shapes and closed geometry objects. It also introduces the concept of simplex data structures, which simplify spatial operations by representing geometries as basic elements.

Furthermore, the paper presents an extended base class of openshape in two-dimensional space and proposes an object-orientation-based open shape model for three-dimensional space. This new model reduces the I/O and CPU cost of processing direction relation queries in three-dimensional space, leading to improved filtering effectiveness. Future work will involve further extending the base class of openshape and studying the processing of direction relation queries in a mobile environment.
