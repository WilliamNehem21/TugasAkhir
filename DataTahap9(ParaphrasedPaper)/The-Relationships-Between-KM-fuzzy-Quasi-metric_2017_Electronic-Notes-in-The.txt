This paper aims to explore the linkages between km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the corresponding order structures of formal balls. The concepts of yoneda t-completeness and yoneda s-completeness for km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces are introduced and it is shown that the associated posets of formal balls are directed complete in both cases. For a specific subclass of km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces, the characteristics of yoneda t-completeness and yoneda s-completeness are determined by the directed completeness of the associated posets of formal balls.

For further details on Theorem 2.11, readers are encouraged to refer to Remark 2.12. It is also worth noting that there exist fuzzy quasi-metric spaces where any mapping of the characteristic family does not qualify as an ordinary quasi-metric, as demonstrated by a specific example.

The focus of this paper is on examining the connections between fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the associated order structures of formal balls. To this end, we introduce the concepts of yoneda t-completeness and yoneda s-completeness for km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and discuss the relationships between completeness in fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the corresponding posets of formal balls. Additionally, we characterize yoneda t-completeness and yoneda s-completeness for a subclass of km-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces based on the order-theoretical properties of the associated posets of formal balls.
