Our simulation findings indicate that miners' perceived uncertainty about the transaction execution cost greatly affects their potential block profit, whereas uncertainty about transaction income has no discernible impact. Specifically, miners' block profit can increase fourfold when they have certainty about the transaction execution cost. On the other hand, the certainty about transaction income does not contribute to miners increasing their block profit.

A blockchain functions as a distributed database that records all transactions across the network. It enables untrusting participants to securely communicate and transact without relying on a trusted intermediary. Each block in the blockchain is identified by a cryptographic hash and contains a set of transactions.

The earliest and most popular example of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, which is an electronic payment system enabling secure transactions between non-trusting parties without involving a middleman. Ethereum and other blockchains have emerged to support complex distributed applications beyond cryptocurrencies, with smart contracts being a key feature of this evolution.

Transactions within a blockchain system can take three different forms, including transferring digital money between accounts, creating and deploying new smart contracts, and invoking existing contracts.

Most existing research on blockchain systems focuses on addressing security, privacy, and performance issues related to the development of smart contracts. Some studies have utilized modeling and simulation techniques to investigate performance issues in blockchain systems.

In blockchain systems such as Ethereum, miners are uncertain about the exact income (transaction fee) they can obtain from executing each transaction, as well as the CPU time cost of executing transactions. This uncertainty affects miners' ability to make informed decisions about which transactions to select and execute in order to maximize their profits.

The experiment's aim is to examine how the uncertainty miners perceive about the income and cost of executing transactions impacts miners' block profit. The study compares the block profit under conditions of uncertainty about income and cost with scenarios where there is certainty about income, cost, or both.

One scenario involves providing miners with exact income and exact CPU time consumed by each transaction to examine the impact of income and cost uncertainty. The results show that miners can achieve four times as much block profit in this scenario compared to baseline scenarios. This suggests that certainty about the cost of executing transactions significantly impacts block profit.

In contrast, providing miners with certainty about income or cost individually does not lead to significant improvements in block profit compared to baseline scenarios.

Overall, the simulation results demonstrate that uncertainty about transaction income does not impact block profit, while uncertainty about transaction execution cost significantly affects miners' potential block profit. Specifically, when there is uncertainty about the cost of executing transactions, the block profit miners can obtain is about a quarter of what they would get when there is certainty about the cost.
