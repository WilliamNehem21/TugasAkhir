The issue of congested roads, high traffic, and parking problems poses significant challenges for modern city planning. In particular, the congestion of on-street spaces in official neighborhoods can lead to inappropriate parking areas in office and shopping mall complexes during peak times for official transactions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligent and optimized scheme to solve parking space problems for small cities, such as Mauritius. This scheme utilizes a reactive search technique known as tabu search and is assisted by rough set theory for the extraction of uncertain rules from parking situation databases. The inclusion of rough set theory aims to characterize the uncertainty of parking lots and depict accuracy in rough classification across different dynamic parking scenarios. The hybrid metaphor of tabu search and rough set theory could offer valuable research directions for addressing similar challenging optimization problems.

The increasing demand for parking spaces due to the rise in on-road vehicles in urban areas has created a difficult problem in managing these spaces. This shortage of parking spaces has led to congested roads, overcrowded transit lines, increased travel time and costs, as well as economic, social, and environmental losses. With the continuous increase in population, the problem becomes even more critical. Several approaches have been proposed to address this issue, such as fuzzy knowledge-based decision making for estimating parking space supply and demand, as well as integrated models for curbside parking and traffic congestion control in downtown areas.

Tabu search, initially proposed by Glover in 1989, is a meta-heuristic procedure used in combinatorial optimization problems to find local optima using a local search subroutine and memory structures known as tabu lists. This method has been applied to a wide range of optimization problems involving various classes of integer problems. However, one limitation of tabu search is its potential to restrict the search too much, preventing some promising moves to the most probable solution in the search space.

Rough set theory, on the other hand, introduces two general types of decisional rules: exact decisional rules, which contain all conditional attributes, and approximate decisional rules, which only include some conditional attributes. In the case of parking function, rough set theory is used to appraise the causal relationships between property features and their values without uncertainty. This theory involves the creation of a set of logical prepositions and associates two crisp sets, called lower and upper approximation, with each rough set.

In the proposed intelligent scheme for car parking, a rough set methodology is incorporated to address the uncertainty in parking function, as well as the nature of traffic. This approach could offer valuable research directions for similar hard optimization problems. The scheme also involves the dynamic adjustment of tabu lists based on the distribution of uncertain and tabu points in the parking solution space, illustrating the potential for innovative solutions in addressing parking space optimization.
