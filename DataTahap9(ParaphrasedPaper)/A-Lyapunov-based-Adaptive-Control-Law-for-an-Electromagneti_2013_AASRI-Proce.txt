This academic paper introduces a direct adaptive non-linear control framework for a non-linear electromagnetic actuator. By employing a Lyapunov approach, the paper computes a continuous control law for the actuator, followed by the proposal of an approximated sampled final control law. The resulting adaptive control strategy is contingent upon the actuator's variable inductance, a critical factor in preventing saturation during the control phase.
