Example 3.16 presents a Kripke model that represents the operations of a local network within a business office, comprising three computers and two printers all managed by a shared server. The focus of the analysis is restricted to the printing protocols, assuming that all office employees use the computers solely for printing documents.

The interaction of interleaving and synchronization can be employed to describe a broad range of games. A recent study also utilizes the concept of concurrency operators to model simultaneous games. The authors leverage CPDL as a foundation to develop a concurrent dynamic game logic. However, since CPDL does not support communication, their logic is similarly limited. Given the drawbacks of generalizing from CPDL to channel-CPDL, namely the loss of decidability and a complete axiomatization, our logic may be better suited for extending the logic presented in the study to handle simultaneous games with communication, as we have briefly demonstrated.
