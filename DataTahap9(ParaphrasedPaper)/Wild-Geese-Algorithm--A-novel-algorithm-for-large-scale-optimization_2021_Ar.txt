The study evaluates the efficacy of the WGA in finding global optimal solutions for high-dimensional optimization problems, comparing its performance with other methods found in existing literature. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WGA shows efficient performance in solving a variety of large-scale optimization problems, making it a strong contender among other algorithms, despite its simpler structure and easier implementation. The source code for the WGA algorithm is available publicly on GitHub at github.com/ebrahimakbary/wga.

The study finds that the dispersion of results and test functions for WGA are generally lower compared to other algorithms. Upon comparison with the DECC-D algorithm, WGA outperforms it for 18 out of 20 functions, except for functions f2 and f20 where it yields worse results. Despite this, for function f2, the average value of WGA is very similar to that obtained from the DECC-D algorithm. Additionally, the DECC-D algorithm does not provide good quality solutions for various test functions.

While the DECC-DML algorithm surpasses WGA for five test functions, it delivers the worst solution for six functions. The CBCC1-DG and CBCC2-DG algorithms also outperform WGA for two and three functions, respectively. However, CBCC1-DG is not the best for any functions, and CBCC2-DG only provides the best result for one function. The DECCDG algorithm performs better than WGA for 2 out of 20 test functions but yields the worst solution for four test functions among all the algorithms.

The study highlights that WGA has the advantage of having only one control parameter, CR. Experimental evidence demonstrates that WGA exhibits competitive results compared to the mentioned algorithms and outperforms all other algorithms for the majority of test functions. Furthermore, WGA is a straightforward and fundamental algorithm for large-scale optimization that can be applied to various real-world optimization problems. The study also notes that in recent years, numerous studies have focused on the area of cooperative co-evolution techniques in high-dimensional optimization. In the future, WGA may be incorporated into the frameworks of different CC methods of varied categories to enhance its performance. Additionally, WGA can be used for solving other real-world large-scale optimization problems.
