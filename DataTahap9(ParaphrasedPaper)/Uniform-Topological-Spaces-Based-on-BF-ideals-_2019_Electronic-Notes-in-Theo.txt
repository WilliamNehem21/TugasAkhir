(iii) The lattice and adjoint operations in a negative non-involutive residuated lattice exhibit continuity under the uniform topology, thereby making the negative non-involutive residuated lattice into a topological negative non-involutive residuated lattice. Furthermore, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the compactness and discreteness of uniform topological spaces. The findings in this paper play a constructive role in uncovering the internal characteristics of negative non-involutive residuated lattices at a topological level.

Non-classical mathematical logic has become an indispensable and formal tool in computer science for handling fuzzy and uncertain information. Various logical algebras have been proposed to serve as semantic systems for non-classical mathematical logic. Among these algebras, residuated lattices, initially introduced by Ward and Dilworth, are fundamental and pivotal algebraic structures. Additionally, other logical algebras, such as mtl-algebra, bl-algebra, mv-algebras, and nm-algebra (also known as r0-algebra), can be viewed as specific classes of residuated lattices. The concepts of filters and ideals are pivotal for the study of logical algebraic structures, and related research in this area has garnered significant attention from scholars. It is noteworthy that in logical algebras with negative involutive (regular) properties, the focus has been on the problem of filters due to the mutual duality of filters and ideals. However, when the negation operation in a logical algebra loses its involution, the dual relationship between ideals and filters is also broken. Therefore, exploring the concept of ideals and its application within the framework of negative non-involutive logic algebras is a meaningful endeavor. Consequently, the concepts of ideals and fuzzy ideals have been introduced in bl-algebra and negative non-involutive residuated lattices, yielding results of theoretical and practical significance.

The concept of fuzzy sets, introduced by Zadeh in 1965, has become a pivotal idea in mathematics and is extensively employed to solve various problems in applied mathematics, control engineering, information sciences, expert systems, and automata theory. However, traditional fuzzy sets are limited in expressing the differentiation between irrelevant and contrary elements, as the membership degrees of elements are constrained to the interval [0, 1]. In contrast, a set representation capable of expressing this differentiation would provide more informative results than traditional fuzzy set representation. Based on these observations, Lee proposed the notion of bipolar-valued fuzzy sets, abbreviated as bf-sets, as an extension of traditional fuzzy sets. Consequently, in recent decades, an increasing number of researchers have been applying bf-sets theory to various algebraic structures.

Recently, we introduced the concept of bf-ideals in negative non-involutive residuated lattices and examined some related properties. Building upon this work, we consider a collection of bf-ideals and utilize the congruence relation induced by bf-ideals to define a uniform topological space, investigating some of its properties in this paper. As a result, we obtained several interesting findings.
