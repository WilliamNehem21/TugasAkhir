Plasma reaching the wall of the vacuum vessel will uncontrollably disrupt, leading to discharge failure, high heat load stress, and the potential for serious or destructive runaway electron generation. In order to manage this, it is necessary to establish a feedback control system to regulate the vertical displacement of the plasma.

The control of plasma vertical displacement can be achieved through passive feedback and active feedback. Passive feedback is a fast-responding method that operates at the millisecond level. When the plasma moves vertically, the surrounding conductor induces an eddy current, creating a magnetic field that generates a Lorentz force opposing the plasma's direction, thus mitigating the vertical displacement. The passive feedback system for controlling plasma vertical displacement consists of a double-layer stainless steel vacuum vessel and two pairs of passive conductor plates. However, passive feedback becomes less effective over time due to conductor resistance dissipating the eddy current, necessitating the use of active feedback for disturbances occurring beyond the diffusion time scale. Active feedback involves detecting the plasma's vertical displacement and feeding this information back to the control power supply, which then generates an excitation current in the active feedback coils to produce a magnetic field that restrains the plasma's vertical displacement.

The power supply features two types of controllers. The system controller manages the coil current based on the plasma control requirements and also provides protection. Its output is divided by 24 and distributed to the controllers in each inverter unit, which are based on current feedback.
