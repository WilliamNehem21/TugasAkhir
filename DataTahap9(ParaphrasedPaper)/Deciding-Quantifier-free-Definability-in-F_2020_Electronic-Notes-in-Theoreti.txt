This paper addresses the definability problem using quantifier-free first-order formulas over finite algebraic structures. The authors demonstrate that the problem is CONP-complete and propose a decision algorithm based on a semantic characterization of definable relations preserved by isomorphisms of substructures. They also develop an algorithm for computing the isomorphism type of a tuple within a finite algebraic structure. The paper includes proofs of the soundness and completeness of the algorithms, as well as empirical tests evaluating their performance.

The authors also explore the computational complexity of the definability problem in various logics, including classical propositional logic, first-order logic, the primitive positive fragment of first-order logic, and basic modal logic. They show that the definability problem is CONP-complete for the quantifier-free fragment of first-order logic with a purely relational vocabulary, and they establish that a parameterized version of the problem is complete for the complexity class W.

The paper is structured as follows: the first section introduces notation and basic definitions, the third section presents the complexity result, the fourth section introduces the algorithm for computing the isomorphism type of a tuple in an algebra, and the fifth section presents the algorithm for deciding quantifier-free-definability for algebraic structures. Additionally, empirical tests are performed in the sixth section, demonstrating that the algorithm performs well on models with a large number of symmetries. Finally, the seventh section summarizes the results and suggests potential future research directions.

The authors emphasize the importance of further empirical testing to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, and they express interest in extending the design of models to encompass a wider range of algebras. They also express a desire to introduce control variables as they extend their approach and tool to other fragments of first-order logic, and they express an interest in studying definability over finite classes of models rather than a single structure. Finally, they highlight the potential value in identifying classes of algebras in which the problem is well-conditioned and for which polynomial time algorithms exist.
