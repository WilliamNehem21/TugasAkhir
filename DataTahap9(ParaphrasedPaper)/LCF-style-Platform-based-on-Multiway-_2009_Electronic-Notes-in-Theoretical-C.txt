The merging of state exploration methods, primarily model checking, and deductive reasoning methods, especially theorem proving, holds great promise in addressing their respective limitations and enhancing their capabilities. This paper aims to establish a platform for multiway decision graphs (MDGs) within an LCF-style theorem prover, defining the operations of MDGs as a set of inference rules. The platform will then be utilized to implement reachability analysis using the MDG theory within the HOL theorem prover. The paper also presents experimental results to demonstrate the performance of the MDG operations within this platform.

Model checking involves representing a system as a finite-state structure and automatically determining if a temporal property holds within the desired states of the system. However, the technique faces challenges, particularly the state explosion problem when applied to complex systems. The paper also discusses the challenges in transferring model checking techniques to software verification due to the state explosion problem and the semantic gap between software developers and verification tools. The authors propose approaches to address these challenges, including developing new dedicated techniques for software and integrating existing tools using high-level modeling techniques.

The approach presented in the paper embeds directed formulae (DFs), an alternate representation for MDGs, within an LCF-style interactive theorem prover as inference rules. The authors define a platform to represent MDG operations, such as conjunction, disjunction, relational product, and prune-by-subsumption, as a set of inference rules within HOL. Furthermore, the reachability analysis is implemented using these rules. The paper outlines the inference rules for well-formedness conditions and the basic MDG operations, and also demonstrates the MDG reachability analysis tactic in HOL. Finally, experimental results are presented to showcase the platformâ€™s performance.

The paper organizes its content as follows: it reviews related work in section 2, provides preliminaries on MDGs and HOL systems in section 3, explains the inference rules governing well-formedness conditions in section 4, presents the inference rules for basic MDG operations in section 5, introduces the reachability analysis tactic in HOL, and summarizes experimental results in section 6. Finally, the paper concludes in section 7 and offers suggestions for future research directions.

The authors' work strives to integrate multiway decision graphs with the Bandera framework by defining a schema for translating the intermediate representation of a Java program using Bandera to the language of the MDG model checking. The paper introduces a novel approach that embeds MDG syntax and operations within HOL, allowing for the formalization of various MDG operations as inference rules. Additionally, the paper presents the formalization of the set of reachable states of an abstract state machine in HOL and provides experimental results showing the platform's performance advantages.

The authors conclude by highlighting that their platform exhibits a considerable gain in automation without sacrificing CPU time and memory usage. They suggest that the MDG-HOL platform could be used to implement a complete model checker in HOL, providing an automated conversion that reduces the time expenditure of proof experts. The work described here is expected to inform the design of a second-generation tool integration platform supporting a spectrum from loose to tight integration of external tools.
