While the concept of higher inductive types is straightforward, a comprehensive explanation of their structure and meaning is still incomplete. Current research has focused on their categorical semantics [13,24] and the semantics of specific examples in cubical sets. Nevertheless, these efforts have not addressed the fundamental question of what constitutes a general notion of higher inductive type. In this regard, the book "Homotopy Type Theory" [22, p 179] poses the question of what introduction rules for points and paths look like in a general context. Additionally, a setoid model for a general notion of 1-hit is constructed, with a search for a schema for hits resembling the schema for inductive families. One approach, as suggested, is to maintain proximity to the schema for inductive families by stipulating that the type of a point constructor for a hit can have the same form as the type of a constructor for an inductive type, and the type of a path constructor for a hit can have the same form as the type of a constructor for a binary inductive family.

However, to avoid complicating the metatheory, the paper opts to focus on the simpler case of finitary hits, which still cover most hits discussed in the HoTT book. The preference for this simplification is attributed to the complexity of the theory of inductive-inductive definitions. Despite this simplification, the paper notes that the theory of finitary 2-hits is intricate, suggesting that the additional complexity of generalized inductive definitions should be left for future exploration. It is emphasized that this simplification is primarily for presentation purposes, and there is potential for generalizing this simplified form to the general form for constructors for ordinary hits â€“ an essential step to obtain interesting hits.

The paper interprets the schematic hit h as the inductively generated groupoid (h0, h1, h2), with constructors ensuring that the types of the point, path, and surface constructors in the theory of 2-hits are interpreted as appropriate dependent functors between groupoids. Moreover, it is observed that the types of all the constructors are instances of the general form of a type for a constructor of a finitary inductive family. Hence, the paper conjectures that the groupoid model of 2-hits can be developed within a core extensional type theory extended with a schema for these finitary inductive families.

The paper acknowledges that its current work is only a preliminary step towards a general theory of hits. Potential future directions include generalizations to 3-hits and their interpretation as weak 2-groupoids, hits with generalized induction, and hits with a broader class of constructor point and path expressions. The reformulation of the theory of 1-hits and 2-hits using degeneracies and restriction maps is also proposed as a useful step towards achieving a general theory of hits in cubical type theory.
