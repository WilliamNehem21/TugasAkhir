In this section, we expand upon the mappings introduced in the preceding section to accommodate non-normal natural deduction (ND) derivations and linear logic with cuts. Due to space constraints, we have omitted the proofs in our presentation. However, we believe that by reading through our discussion, the reader will gain a sufficient understanding of the isomorphism we have established between linear logic with cuts and ND.
