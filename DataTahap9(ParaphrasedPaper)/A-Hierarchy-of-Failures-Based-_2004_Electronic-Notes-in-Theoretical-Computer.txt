In section 6, we address related work. Throughout this paper, we incorporate into the main text the proofs that contribute to understanding the results being established, while the remaining proofs are relegated to the appendix.

Within the context of CSP, a process serves as a communication pattern that characterizes the behavior of a system. Systems that could be represented using this language include individual machines, networks, and protocols. Additionally, simple components can be aggregated to form a composite process. Regardless of the system, its behavior is articulated in terms of events or synchronous atomic communications, which represent pivotal moments in the system's evolution.

We demonstrate initially that encoding is feasible for all models associated with predicates that are either upwards or downwards closed, a feature that is prominent in all the specific models considered in this paper. Subsequently, in section 5.3, we establish a corresponding result for the general case and deliberate on the practical applications of our rule. The detailed proofs are appended to the paper.

An associated paper takes the work described here further by expanding and exploring its practical applications. It identifies and justifies non-standard measures of consistency. The verification of consistency within each such measure can be seen as a refinement in one of the models presented in the current paper and therefore can be automatically carried out using existing tools.
