The process of image classification plays a crucial role in biometrics, especially in applications such as face recognition. One of the key aspects of image classification involves representing or encoding the images, as this forms the foundation for achieving robust classification results. Well-represented images allow for the easy differentiation of one subject from others. One approach to representation-based classification involves representing a target sample through a linear combination of training samples, and then evaluating the dissimilarity to classify the test sample into the closest class. Sparse representation (SR) and collaborative representation (CR) are two highly important methods within representation-based classification algorithms, particularly in the context of face recognition.

This paper introduces a novel method, Absolute Collaborative Representation based Classification (ABSCRC), aimed at improving image classification. The proposed method is tested on various facial and non-facial datasets, and it consistently achieves higher accuracy compared to conventional CR. The paper's main contributions include the introduction of a fusion method to enhance CR, an analysis and implementation of reverse integration on multiple classifiers, and an experimental approach to finding tuned factors for integrating multiple classifiers.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers related work on SRC and CRC, Section 3 describes the proposed ABSCRC method, Section 4 analyzes the selection of fusion factors and presents classification examples in the experiments, Section 5 reports the experimental results on popular benchmark datasets, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

Additionally, various related research efforts and improvements in SRC and CRC are discussed, including fast L1-minimization algorithms for robust face recognition, kernel sparse representation, occlusion dictionary-based algorithms, and usage of virtual samples to improve classification accuracy.

The experimental results for ABSCRC method are demonstrated using popular visual benchmark datasets, such as Caltech Faces, Caltech Leaves, ORL, FERET, CMU Faces, and Senthil IRTT Face Database. The results show that ABSCRC generally outperforms conventional CRC in classification accuracy.

Furthermore, the paper discusses experiments involving the optimization of fusion factors and their effect on the classification accuracy. The experiments conducted across both facial and non-facial datasets illustrate the effectiveness of integrating absolute distance into collaborative representation for image classification.

In conclusion, the proposed ABSCRC method shows promising results for robust image classification, and it outperforms state-of-the-art CRC in most cases. The work was supported by various research foundations, and the authors have extensive expertise and research interests in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to image classification that demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods, particularly in the context of face recognition. The findings contribute to the advancement of robust and accurate image classification techniques.
