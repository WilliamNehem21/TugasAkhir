In recent years, global issues like the coronavirus pandemic have emphasized the need for digital alternatives to traditional student exchanges. This paper examines the potential of using telepresence robots in intercultural seminars as a substitute to in-person visits to enhance students' cultural intelligence (CQ). The study evaluates the effects of two semi-virtual intercultural seminars using telepresence robots, which enable interactions between students in Germany and Kenya, to enhance diversity and intercultural competence. The research explores the impact of these seminars on students' CQ and the acceptance of telepresence robots, and also discusses the challenges and limitations of this approach.

The concept of cultural intelligence (CQ), introduced by Earley and Ang in 2003, refers to the ability to operate effectively in intercultural settings. While there is no consensus on how intercultural competence is defined, CQ provides a means for homebound students to engage interactively in class and maintain social relationships. The potential of telepresence robots in fostering social interaction processes and inclusion in learning has been noted in previous studies.

Despite promising initial findings, there is limited research on the use of telepresence robots in higher education, particularly in intercultural seminars to enhance students' CQ. To address this gap, the study evaluates the effects of intercultural seminars that integrated telepresence robots for the first time to help students increase their CQ. The research involved participants from Germany and Kenya and examined the impact of the seminars on various facets of CQ.

The study found that the intercultural seminars using telepresence robots led to significant increases in several CQ facets, including metacognitive CQ, cognitive CQ, and behavioral CQ. However, there were challenges with technical issues related to the telepresence robots, and students expressed the need for improvements in internet connectivity, sound transmission, and motion characteristics. The study also discussed potential biases in the research, such as self-selection of participants and investigator effects, and recommended future research to address these limitations.

Overall, the intercultural seminars using telepresence robots proved to be successful in enhancing students' CQ. However, the study identified areas for improvement and emphasized the need for further investigations to examine the long-term effects of these seminars on students' CQ.
