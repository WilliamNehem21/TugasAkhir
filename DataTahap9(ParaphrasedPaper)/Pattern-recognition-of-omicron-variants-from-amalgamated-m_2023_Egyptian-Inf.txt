The effective diagnosis of the Omicron variant is crucial in containing the spread of the disease and quarantining affected patients and their families across different countries. As the disease continues to spread, it becomes increasingly important to promptly admit severe cases to specialized hospitals to control its spread. However, the high costs associated with diagnostic tests for COVID-19 pose challenges for both governments and patients with limited access to healthcare. In response, there has been an increase in publicly available datasets of chest x-rays and EEG images to aid in the diagnosis of this pandemic. Diagnosis through visual images aids researchers in identifying potential trends for detecting the disease. The high transmission rate of COVID-19 has led to a surge in patients entering hospitals, placing significant strain on imaging physicians and exacerbating physician shortages. These challenges can be addressed using deep learning methods, which have made significant advancements in recent years, with the goal of enhancing classification or prediction accuracy by learning more accurate features through multi-hidden layer machine learning models trained with large sample data.

In recent years, machine learning applications, particularly deep learning, have rapidly advanced to address pandemic diseases. Deep learning focuses on automatic identification and classification of image information and has been widely applied in areas such as object detection and medical picture classification. As new developments emerge, it has become increasingly important to apply these innovations in computer-aided and clinical decision-making systems.

Machine learning-based models are gaining popularity as they offer easy and quick processing compared to the traditional RT-PCR test, which is considered the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 and its variants. Additionally, the RT-PCR test is expensive, time-consuming, and requires a laboratory kit, making it challenging to access in many countries during times of crisis or epidemics. This research proposes a deep learning model for diagnosing the Omicron variant using EEG and chest x-ray images, aiming to provide an alternative and more sensitive method for diagnosis in ambiguous cases. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for reducing the spread and death rate of the disease, and this study presents a transfer learning-based deep learning model for classifying patients with COVID-19 or its Omicron variant.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews past research on COVID and Omicron, Section 3 presents the proposed architecture for detecting Omicron from EEG and x-ray images, Section 4 presents the experimental outcomes and a comparison to current best practices, and Section 5 covers the conclusion and future work.

Numerous studies based on machine learning have focused on screening for COVID-19, highlighting the importance of early identification for minimizing risks to public health and the need for accurate and efficient models for new variants such as Omicron. Traditional machine learning models may struggle to detect new variants due to limited features and test/train data availability, as well as the poor quality of trained images. In contrast, this research explores the use of a deep learning model for the binary classification of x-ray images and EEG for the detection of COVID-19 and its Omicron variant. The proposed transfer learning model leverages feature extraction, pre-training, and final classification to achieve desirable results, with the effectiveness of the model evaluated through receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and cross-validation.

In addition, a database has been created, containing a significant number of images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients and other related data, to facilitate collaboration among scientists and aid in understanding COVID-19 and its impacts.

Looking ahead, this approach could be extended to diagnose other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, using advanced machine learning models like reinforcement learning and federated learning. Additionally, enhancements such as the incorporation of advanced similarity measures could be explored to detect other variants of COVID-19.
