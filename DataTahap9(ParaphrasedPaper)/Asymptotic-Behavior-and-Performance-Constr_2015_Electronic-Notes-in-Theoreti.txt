In this paper, we expand upon the findings presented in a previous work, which determined the optimal number of replicas required to handle a given transactional workload for open models. Our current study extends these results to closed systems and leverages both the previously established relations and the new ones introduced here to derive analytical connections between the achieved response time and the number of replicas as it approaches infinity. These relationships enable the design of control policies on one or more performance metrics while still satisfying constraints on other metrics. For example, ensuring that the average response time of a system is less than 5 seconds implies that the response time of the bottleneck resource is less than 3.5 seconds. By monitoring the value of a convenient metric, it is possible to control the violation of a threshold for another metric using these relationships.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents related work on model analysis and optimization in cloud computing. Section 3 analyzes the response time metric and the corresponding number of replicas necessary to meet constraints. Sections 4 and 5 investigate the asymptotic behavior of performance indexes with respect to the number of replicas in open and closed systems, respectively. Section 6 reports experimental validations, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

The replication of resources has gained increased interest due to its association with virtualization and cloud computing. The flexibility of provisioning virtual machines has made both static and dynamic replication techniques, particularly adaptive ones, a simple and effective means to achieve performance goals without the need for excessive over-provisioning. However, the use of cloud computing has introduced unpredictability, making model-based analysis more complex and necessitating the consideration of additional factors. For instance, different virtual machine manager allocation policies have a significant impact on both CPU and I/O performance. Various approaches have been proposed to account for the effect of virtualization, such as scaling CPU demand in queuing network models and defining resource utilization in probabilistic models.

This paper derives relationships between the asymptotic behavior of the system's response time and both the class and resource aggregated residence time for closed systems. Various scenarios are considered based on the workload type (single or multiple classes) and the characteristics of the original system to be replicated: homogeneous or heterogeneous. The replication process duplicates the bottleneck resources, leading to a convergence to a state in which all demands are similar.

The study presents a single resource queueing network model, where the resource can be replicated m times and is capable of handling different actions for different applications. Each application is represented by a job class, and the population of the corresponding class is considered as the number of data that must be handled by each action.

Additionally, the text discusses the collection of response time data, determination of mean demand, and fitting procedures using real data obtained from benchmark applications, and it introduces future directions for research, including considering relations among different metrics, completion of the analytical computation of the optimal number of replicas, and the definition, testing, and validation of dynamic replication policies based on the results presented in the paper.
