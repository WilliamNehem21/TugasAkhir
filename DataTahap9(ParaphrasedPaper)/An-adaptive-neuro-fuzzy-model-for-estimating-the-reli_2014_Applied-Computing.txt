The academic paper discusses component-based software engineering (CBSE), a form of software reuse that involves building software from existing components, including off-the-shelf components, by assembling them in a compatible manner. While combining high-quality, pretested, and trusted software components can be challenging, several techniques have emerged to analyze the reliability of component-based applications. These techniques can be categorized into two groups based on expert advice, but this process can be time-consuming. The proposed model aims to integrate the best features of fuzzy logic and neural networks in a CBSE reliability estimation model, providing an improvement over an existing model. The remaining sections of the paper are organized to discuss related work, introduce the proposed model framework and model, present experiments and their results, and conclude.

Fiondella et al. (2013) proposed an approach based on correlated component failures (CoCoF) to assess the reliability of a software application, taking into account component reliabilities, correlation, and application architecture. This approach is based on an algorithm that transforms a multivariate Bernoulli distribution (MVB) into a joint distribution of component outcomes.

Palviainen et al. (2011) introduced a technique for reliability estimation, prediction, and measurement of component-based software systems (CBS). The approach emphasizes the importance of reliability in safety-critical systems and integrates heuristic reliability estimation, model-based reliability prediction, and measuring activities at the component level.

Lo (2010) proposed a software reliability estimation model based on support vector machines (SVM) and a genetic algorithm (GA), which relies on recent failure data alone for estimating reliability. The parameters for reliability estimation in the SVM are determined by the GA, making the model less dependent on failure data than other models.

Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), first proposed by Jang in 1992, integrate the best features of fuzzy systems and neural networks. ANFIS has advantages over Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) in areas such as operational profile for the component and component dependency in a CBSE.

The proposed model in the paper is an additive model that does not explicitly consider the architecture of the CBSE system. The measure of application complexity is platform-dependent and comes from the integration code. The model considers reusability, application complexity, component dependency, and operational profile as input factors for a first-order Sugeno fuzzy model, with a rule set of fuzzy if-then rules. The ANFIS was trained and tested using data obtained from projects, resulting in a total of 81 rules dividing the input factors into three variables: low, medium, and high.
