The paper proposes the transition of existing energy systems into a smart grid infrastructure to effectively manage two-way energy transfer and the interactions among different devices on the grid. The bi-directional flow of electrical energy to and from the main grid is influenced by factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and electricity prices. To ensure proper functioning in diverse scenarios, the complex algorithms governing smart grid functions should be comprehensively studied through simulation before implementation.

The paper introduces a simulation model that depicts various components of a smart grid, encompassing user-demand, centralized and decentralized energy production, and storage elements. This comprehensive model simulates a smart grid at the neighborhood level, encompassing multiple households with individualized smart grid scenarios. Each household may incorporate solar panels, a battery, and a unique demand profile, providing insights into energy flows within and between houses, thereby aiding in smart grid design. Moreover, the modular nature of the model allows for easy expansion to accommodate additional devices and scenarios.

The simulation model is designed using the AnyLogic software, which supports system dynamics, agent-based, and discrete event simulation methods. The inner operation of the model employs the system dynamics method to effectively model energy flow through different components, represented as agents, facilitating interaction and data exchange. The subsequent sections of the paper elaborate on the functionality of model components, present simulation results for various scenarios, discuss related work, and conclude the paper.

The demand module defines the electricity demand profile of a house, dependent on factors such as time of day and day of the year. Standardized demand profiles are available online, and personalized profiles can be measured using smart meters for customized simulations. The weather module provides necessary weather data for computing renewable energy generation, currently limited to solar panels, with potential for extension to include wind speed data.

The paper also presents a smart energy city model based on demand response (DR) and load control, highlighting the capability of a smart city to lower energy consumption. The smart grid simulation tool developed in the study models residential units with solar panels and batteries, utilizing statistical data from local meteorological sources to represent weather patterns and their impact on solar panel output power.

The program's development using AnyLogic simulation software facilitated a flexible environment for implementing the desired models, with the use of system dynamics and agent-based modeling methods. The agent-based modeling approach allows for scalability of residential units and enhances diversity in the neighborhood simulation. Future expansions of the model may include incorporating stationary electric vehicles as additional storage units, integrating other renewable sources, and implementing algorithms to study behavior in different scenarios, such as power purchase/sell based on market prices and battery usage control.
