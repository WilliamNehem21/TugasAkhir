This paper presents an algorithm aimed at enhancing image processing for impulse noise using a median filter. The algorithm involves identifying noise points in an image through the concept of indiscernibility on rough sets, and then removing the impulse noise by refining the selection of threshold and filtering templates of the median filter. Experimental simulations demonstrated that the proposed image enhancement method outperforms traditional methods in effectively improving image degradation and clarity.

The key operation in addressing impulse noise using the median filter is the selection of threshold and filtering templates. The article focuses on advancing image processing for impulse noise through the median filter. It introduces a method of detecting isolated noise points in an image based on the concept of indiscernibility on rough sets, and proposes refinement of the threshold and filtering templates of the median filter to eliminate impulse noise.

The study found that while the normal median filter improved the signal-to-noise ratio of an image compared to a linear filter, it led to a loss of overall image edge details and blurred image vision. The adaptive threshold median filter exhibited noticeable enhancement effects, but incorrectly identified some edge pixels as noise. On the other hand, the impulse noise median filter successfully enhanced image edge clarity, but also misjudged a portion of edge pixels as noise. The improved median filter introduced in this paper aims to mitigate the impact on image edges, while effectively improving image degradation and clarity by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.

The primary focus of this study is the effective improvement of image processing for impulse noise using a median filter. The main contributions of the research include proposing a method for detecting isolated noise points in an image based on indiscernibility on rough sets, and suggesting improvements to the threshold and filtering templates of the median filter to remove impulse noise. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approaches for enhancing image processing for impulse noise through a median filter using illustrative examples.
