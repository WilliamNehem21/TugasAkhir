In order to extend the operational lifespan of power transformers, it is crucial to create tools for monitoring and diagnosing issues, enabling real-time detection of potential failures. The analysis of gases present in insulating oil, either dissolved or free, is a crucial aspect of assessing the transformer's health and forms an integral part of preventive maintenance programs. The state of the oil significantly impacts the performance and longevity of transformers, and real-time monitoring has proven to be a reliable method for ensuring safe operation. A system for the online monitoring of dissolved gases produced by active transformers was developed, serving as a critical parameter for fault detection and monitoring the chemical degradation of insulation oil. This paper introduces a method for analyzing the generated gases using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) via a specially designed prototype that can be integrated into the Buchholz transformer relay. The combination of NIR spectroscopy and chemometric tools has enabled the extraction of valuable information from the samples. Recent advancements in chemometrics software and computer technology have made NIR analysis a practical choice for process analysis applications.

The significance of analyzing and interpreting fault gases in transformers is well established and extensively documented. The deterioration of transformer oil and paper insulation leads to the formation of characteristic gases as by-products. In the presence of an active fault, the rate of deterioration increases significantly, and the types of gases generated vary with the nature and severity of the fault.

Given the importance of early failure detection and the ability to provide near real-time data on conditions, the analysis of exhaust gases from online monitoring has become a reliable method for ensuring safe operation. The utilization of both online and offline monitoring methods for power transformers is steadily increasing and can serve as a powerful tool for mitigating the risk of multiple failures. Monitoring gases dissolved in oil or collected from the Buchholz relay can be an invaluable diagnostic tool for identifying incipient faults in transformers currently in operation. When gases produced exceed the oil's saturation limit, they escape and can be collected in the Buchholz relay. This reduction in the insulation strength of the transformer oil can lead to further failures.

This paper assesses the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and chemometric methods in analyzing light gaseous hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene) associated with insulation system faults. A spectrophotometer prototype with a measurement cell was developed for the purpose of monitoring gases in the Buchholz relay. The calibration procedures, measurement limitations, and error analysis are presented in detail.

The combination of these features, along with instrument control, low maintenance, and data treatment, has made it possible for this application. This analytical technique has also been used with fiber-optic technology to identify and quantify water and oil in transformer insulating paper.

Synthetic gas mixtures were directly prepared into the cell using flow meters and pure gases, and the calibration set consisted of 29 gas mixtures, with the prediction set containing 10 gas mixtures. The concentration ranges of gaseous hydrocarbon mixtures were 0.5 to 2.0% (v/v). The chemometric models were developed using the Unscrambler 9.2 software package. The concentrations of the gases within the cell were determined using gas chromatography as a reference method.

The results of the study indicate that near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) in conjunction with chemometric techniques proves to be a useful tool for monitoring gas species produced during the decomposition of insulating oils. The calibration model built using partial least squares (PLS) regression yielded results with root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values of 0.19% (v/v) for methane, 0.15% (v/v) for acetylene, approximately 0.11% (v/v) for ethylene, and 0.14% (v/v) for ethane. This suggests that the developed chemometric model is suitable for application to the hydrocarbons present in real samples. Additionally, ongoing work is looking to develop a new type of cell measurement system based on multiple reflection, which could lower the detection limits of hydrocarbon gas to the range of a few parts per million (ppm) and could have important implications for online monitoring of power transformers.
