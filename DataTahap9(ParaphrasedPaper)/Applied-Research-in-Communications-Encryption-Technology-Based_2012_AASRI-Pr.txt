During the process of embedding watermarks, the initial step involves creating the actual watermark. The information to be embedded can encompass various types, such as numbers, images, and text. Using a password serves to bolster security by safeguarding against unauthorized access to messages. The result of the watermark embedding process is an image containing the embedded watermark.

The input for the watermark detection process is the image undergoing testing, which may or may not have an embedded watermark, or may have been subject to an attack after having a watermark embedded. Due to variations in watermarking algorithms, the inputs for the watermark detection process can also include passwords, intact images, and so on. These inputs might consist of detected watermarks or confidence values regarding the presence of watermarks in the signals that have been detected.

An important application of digital watermarking is data hiding. In projects where watermarking is employed, it is essential to ascertain the presence or absence of a watermark. Consequently, it is feasible to embed nonsensical watermarks. However, in projects involving sensitive data, the watermarking is meaningful and contains a larger amount of information.

Various technological methods exist for data hiding, primarily encompassing spatial domain algorithms and transform domain algorithms. An example of a spatial domain algorithm is the digital image hiding algorithm based on integration. This algorithm utilizes a BÃ©zier curve to embed confidential images into original images of the same size. Notable characteristics of this algorithm include simple computations, ease of implementation, and high quality of recovery for confidential images. Furthermore, it can embed binary stream files in digital images of any form and, with proper parameter selection, can precisely recover the binary stream files. Its key feature is the high capacity for data hiding, with the ability to conceal up to 3 bits per pixel in grayscale images identical to the original image. Given this capability, the algorithm is primarily employed for concealing confidential data.

Additionally, the length (l) of the bit substring is restricted to positive integers, specifically within the range of [1, 2, 3]. The associated chart illustrates the relationship between the value of l, the numeric domain of t, and the maximum concealment capacity when an 8-bit per pixel grayscale image serves as the original image.
