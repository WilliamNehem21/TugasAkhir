The harmony search metaheuristic has been successfully employed in numerous scientific and engineering applications. However, its efficacy in addressing multiobjective optimization problems based on Pareto optimality principles has not been definitively established. This paper proposes two approaches for using the harmony search metaheuristic to tackle multiobjective optimization, with the ZDT functions serving as a test platform. Performance metrics derived from experimental results demonstrate that these approaches are competitive, even when compared to the NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the definition of multiobjective optimization problems and relevant concepts. Section 3 provides a detailed explanation of the harmony search metaheuristic, drawing a parallel with the musical improvisation process and describing each component of the algorithm's structure. Section 4 presents a concise overview of prior research that addresses the harmony search algorithm and multiobjective optimization. Section 5 introduces adaptations of the mono-objective harmony search algorithm for both proposed solutions in this paper. Section 6 presents the series of tests and the corresponding experimental results. Finally, Section 7 presents the conclusions and outlines potential future research directions.

The paper begins with a brief comparison of the processes of musical improvisation and optimization before delving into the harmony search algorithm and its components in Section 3.1. Subsequently, Section 3.2 dissects the algorithm's structure and its constituent parts.

The paper also discusses the process of generating new solution vectors and how they are integrated into the harmony memory. Additionally, it covers the concept of pitch adjustment and its impact on the search space exploration, as well as the application of the Pareto optimality concept in ranking non-feasible solutions.

Furthermore, the authors propose a modified version of the harmony search algorithm for addressing mono-objective optimization problems with constraints, leveraging the concept of Pareto optimality. They also outline the ranking procedure for solutions and the associated computational cost.

Finally, the paper touches upon the iteration process and the calculation of rankings using the Fonseca-Fleming method.
