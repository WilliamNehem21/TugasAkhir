The academic paper discusses the use of sensor, image processing board, software, and hardware in chicken monitoring systems to acquire and process chicken images in different farm environments. The camera sensor converts photons to electrical signals, and different processing algorithms are applied to perform objective tasks based on specific programming frameworks such as MATLAB, ImageJ, and OpenCV. The paper also examines various research efforts on computer vision systems for monitoring chicken welfare-related issues, such as weight, lameness, behaviors, temperature, activities, and health.

Furthermore, it delves into the challenges and limitations in assessing animal welfare and adopting Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) techniques, along with the obstacles to the implementation of PLF. The study investigates the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Residual Networks (ResNets), Capsule Networks (CapsNets), Recursive Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) in poultry monitoring systems.

Additionally, the paper focuses on the modeling step in poultry monitoring systems, which includes regression and classification tasks. It describes the challenges in poultry weight estimation systems and the potential research areas for improvement. The paper also evaluates the tracking of poultry for assessing behavioral and physical indicators in poultry welfare.

Finally, the study emphasizes the importance of appropriate image processing algorithms in computer vision for precise localization of birds and monitoring various bioprocesses and bio-responses in poultry.
