The augmented set is employed with the aim of preventing the re-visitation of states, and it is not essential for ensuring the termination of the algorithm since the locally time-sensitive states are devoid of cycles. Consequently, this set can be gradually purged from memory and stored on disks if memory constraints are reached, without jeopardizing the termination of the algorithm. For other approaches to memory management, refer to [3, 9].

Distributed algorithms for generating state spaces typically consist of the code executed by each client and the code for a managerial process. In Algorithm 2, we present the portion of our DPOR algorithm that is executed by the clients. The manager monitors the progress and decides to cease the generation process when no new states are discovered. We have omitted the code of the manager process here, as it does not interact with the POR pruning component. For a general specification of the manager process, see, for example, [citation].
