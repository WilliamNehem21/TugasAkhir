There are multiple systems related to geothms. Some combine features of dynamic geometry software (DGS) and automated theorem provers, some have web interfaces, and some provide repositories of geometrical theorems. To date, there is no system similar to geothms that offers complete, web-based access to DGS, utilizes theorem proving with human-readable proofs generated, and provides an open repository of geometrical constructions and conjectures.

The paper's sections are organized as follows: Section 2 describes the components of geothms; Section 3 presents the structure of the web interface; Section 4 discusses communication and representation issues; Section 5 illustrates geothms through examples; Section 6 provides details on related work; Section 7 discusses future work; and Section 8 concludes the paper.

The gclcprover is an automated theorem prover (ATP) based on the area method, enabling formal deductive reasoning about objects constructed within DGSs. It generates human-readable proofs in LaTeX and XML formats, with an explicit justification for each proof step. Integrated tightly with gclc, the prover can reason about a gclc construction without requiring modification for the deductive process; users only need to add the conclusion they wish to prove. Geometrical constructions within gclc are internally transformed into primitive constructions of the area method, and in some cases, auxiliary points are introduced. Additionally, a tool called euktogclcprover has been developed to convert Euclidean files to gclcprover files, facilitating the prover's use with geometric constructions described within Euclidean.

Access to the second level of geothms is limited to registered users, with regular users able to browse the database and use the drawing/proof programs interactively. Contributors have privileges to insert new data and/or update existing data.

Geother is an environment for manipulating and proving geometric theorems implemented in Maple, with drawing routines and an interface in Java. It features a menu-driven graphical user interface and contains a collection of theorems in both elementary and differential geometry, along with sample specifications that have been proved.

Geometriagon boasts a vast repository of problems in classical constructive (ruler and compass only) Euclidean geometry. Registered users can access and edit all problems and solutions, but the system does not provide an automated theorem prover. Users can only perform valid steps in the construction using a limited set of tools, and the system is capable of recognizing when a user has reached a solution to a problem, although no formal proofs are provided.
