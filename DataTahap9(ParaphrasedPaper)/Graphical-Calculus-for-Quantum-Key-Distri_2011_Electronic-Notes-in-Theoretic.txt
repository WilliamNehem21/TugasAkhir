The paper focuses on the importance of controlled complementary measurements in quantum key distribution protocols and aims to provide an axiomatization of these measurements within symmetric monoidal categories, along with a corresponding graphical calculus. Specifically, the study examines the bb84 and ekert91 protocols, including scenarios involving intercept-resend attacks. While there is an existing graphical understanding of complementarity and controlled observables, blending these concepts together is not straightforward due to the abstract nature of the control space. The main contribution of the paper lies in its establishment of an axiomatization of controlled complementary measurements within symmetric monoidal categories, allowing for a concise presentation of the bb84 and ekert91 protocols. The correctness of these protocols is proven, and the paper analyzes the intercept-resend attack scenario. Previous work on bases, complementarity, measurement, control, and the classical-quantum distinction within graphical calculus is also reviewed in the paper.
