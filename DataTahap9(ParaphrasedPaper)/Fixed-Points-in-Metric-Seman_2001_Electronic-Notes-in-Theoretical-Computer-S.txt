Once the Baire metric is introduced, it provides a foundation for the effective application of various classical metric (or topological) tools. By extending the Baire distance to the Hausdorff distance on sets of entities, a spectrum of non-deterministic concepts can be modeled. The aim is to work with sets of meanings where all relevant limits are present, which leads to the use of closed subsets and complete spaces. Many programming concepts naturally give rise to the notion of a primary computational step followed by the remainder of the computation. In many cases, this corresponds to the semantic function associated with the concept having the property of being contractive. This leads to the classical Banach fixed point theorem, which states that each contractive endofunction on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. This theorem is influential in metric semantics, serving as both a definitional principle and a proof principle.

Regarding the role of topology, it is noteworthy that transition systems may satisfy finiteness conditions, such as being finitely branching or image finite. An important conclusion from metric semantics is that the operational semantics associated with a finitely branching (or image finite) transition system forms a compact (or closed) set.
