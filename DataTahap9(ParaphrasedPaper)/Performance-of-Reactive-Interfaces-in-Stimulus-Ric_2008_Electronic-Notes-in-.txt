In interactive systems, the success or failure is influenced by human operators and their cognitive capabilities. This paper argues that it is important to specify and analyze the human cognitive system, and suggests that formal methods can be used to simulate cognitive frameworks and the interaction between users and computer systems, allowing for qualitative and quantitative performance measurement.

One important issue in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) systems, such as cockpit interfaces or operations control rooms, is information overload, which can lead to errors when attentional mechanisms are overwhelmed. This can result in human operators missing important stimuli. The paper presents a cognitive-level formal methods-based model to explore the limits of temporal attention deployment in humans, using a process algebra specification to simulate attentional capture in a specific experimental paradigm.

The paper also discusses the general applicability of cognitive frameworks in human-computer interaction, such as the interacting cognitive subsystems (ICS) architecture, and highlights the advantages of using symbolic models instead of connectionist networks for formalizing large-scale mental architectures.

The paper demonstrates the use of the formal model to simulate stimuli in rapid serial visual presentation systems, and presents simulation results focusing on the performance of the interface in terms of the probability of perceiving a target. It also discusses the potential for using electroencephalogram (EEG) measures to improve the performance of rapid serial visual presentation systems, and suggests further research in this area.
