The structure, situated at an elevation of approximately 5300 meters above sea level, experiences exceptionally cold temperatures, with the lowest outdoor temperature in the coldest month dropping below -40 degrees Celsius. The area also endures more than 330 frost days, has a frost line of over 3.0 meters, and is subject to severe winds reaching Class 8. Due to these harsh conditions, residents are unable to bathe throughout the entire year and rely on ice for their water supply. In response to this challenge, passive solar houses have been developed to address the residents' water and bathing needs, with the houses positioned to the south of the main buildings.

The solar house, measuring 2.5 meters in height, has been designed by taking into account the local latitude and the solar altitude angles in winter. The day lighting glass is inclined at a 45-degree angle and covers an area of 11.8 square meters. It intersects with a vertical glass measuring 1.85 meters in height and covering an area of 7.42 square meters.

The solar house is partitioned by a trombe wall into a bathroom and a heat preservation room, with the inclined glass covering both areas. The heat preservation room receives direct sunlight from the inclined plane. The day lighting glass, made of a single-layer of ordinary transparent glass with a thickness of 5 mm and a light transmission ratio of 70%, is utilized. The east, west, and north walls of the solar house are integrated into the pool wall, with heat storage material incorporated to increase the house's thermal inertia. The south side of the trombe wall consists of a 200mm thick concrete brick, while the west and east side walls also serve as heat collection and storage walls. The outside surface of the south trombe wall is black and includes four holes for ventilation, two uptakes, and two downtakes, all of the same size (400 x 250).

For heating water, a heat pipe vacuum tube solar energy water heater collector is employed as the primary heat source, with an electrical heating system serving as a supplementary energy source, powered by 2 kW electric heaters. The heat pipe vacuum tube has a light area of 1.2 square meters, and the effective volume of the water tank is 150 liters.

In terms of sensor arrangement, indoor temperature sensors are positioned at a height of 1.5 meters from the ground in the bathroom and heat preservation room, whereas outdoor temperature sensors are placed at the same height under shadow conditions and without wind. The solar radiation intensity measurement instrument is situated at a height of 1.0 meter from the ground, outside the window.
