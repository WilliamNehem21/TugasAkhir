This paper introduces a method to generalize chaotic systems using two-dimensional affine transformations with six parameters, enabling control of the strange attractor's size, location, shape, and trajectory without altering its chaotic dynamics. The approach enhances system randomness and sensitivity, and the dynamic parameters control the system's response. The study applies the transformations to the simplest and Lorenz chaotic systems, demonstrating their effects on time series, attractor diagrams, and maximum Lyapunov exponent. Additionally, the paper showcases the application of the transformed Lorenz system in image encryption, highlighting its improved performance compared to the conventional Lorenz system and other recent works. The study also investigates the effect of the affine transformations on the eigen vectors of the Jacobian matrix and evaluates the performance of the transformed Lorenz system as a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in image encryption applications by testing it on three standard color images. Finally, the paper assesses the robustness of the encryption scheme against noise and various attacks, and discusses the implications of the findings, providing future research directions.
