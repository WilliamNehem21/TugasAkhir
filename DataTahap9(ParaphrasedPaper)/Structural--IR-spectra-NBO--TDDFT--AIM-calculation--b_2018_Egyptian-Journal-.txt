The fukui function (FF) of a molecule, as indicated by previous studies [46,47], provides insight into the reactive sites and facilitates the comprehension and classification of chemical reactions. The atom with the highest FF value is considered to be the most reactive site compared to other atoms within the molecule. In this study, the utilization of fukui functions for determining site selectivity in a specific molecule for nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks is thoroughly discussed, with a particular focus on the correlation between the fukui values and the basis of the b3lyp/6-311g(d,p) level of theory. Additionally, the reliance on Mullikan atomic charges of the neutral, cation, and anion states is emphasized, with a comparison made to the compound 2-{[5-(adamantan-1-yl)-4-methyl-4h-1,2,4-tria zol-3-yl]sulfanyl}-n,n-dimethylethanamine and thiazole azo dyes, where the former exhibits a charge state similar to nearly one-fifth of the latter. Furthermore, the compound's nitrogen-linked organic structure and functional groups are shown to closely resemble urea, a benchmark compound for nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, thus warranting a comparison with urea. Notably, the calculated hyperpolarizability value of the compound is approximately nine times greater than that of urea, suggesting its promising potential as a NLO material.
