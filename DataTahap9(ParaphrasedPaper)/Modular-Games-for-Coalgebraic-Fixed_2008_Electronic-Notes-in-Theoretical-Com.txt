Venema initially explored coalgebraic fixed point logics, using a finite version of Moss's coalgebraic logic as the foundational modal language. Our interest in verification methods for systems modeled as coalgebras motivates our examination of fixed point logics across various modal languages. Through modular techniques outlined in previous work, we have observed that the resulting logics are more suitable as specification logics in this context.

Our investigations into the implicit negation and alternation-free fragments of these logics rely on the concept of an s-modality, characterized by a syntax constructor with associated one-step semantics of finite arity. This concept enables us to establish connections between logics induced by sets of polyadic predicate liftings, as explored in prior research, and logics induced by syntax constructors. Consequently, we have developed a method for integrating fixed points into logics of the former type.

It is important to highlight that all the definitions presented above are variations without negation of the definitions in previous literature. The exclusion of negation is a prevalent approach to ensuring that fixed point logical operators defined within these languages possess a well-defined semantic, as commonly observed.

It is notable that for languages in which the semantic dual of each modal operator is also present in the language, omitting the negation operator does not compromise expressiveness. In such cases, we demonstrate that negation can be implicitly defined. To facilitate this, we introduce the concepts of an s-modality and a dual modality.

In the context of the spatial transition system presented in Example 2.3, we observe that the modal operator 0 functions as an s-modality of arity 0, while the temporal operators ♦ and □ are unary s-modalities. Additionally, the spatial operator | is a binary s-modality.
