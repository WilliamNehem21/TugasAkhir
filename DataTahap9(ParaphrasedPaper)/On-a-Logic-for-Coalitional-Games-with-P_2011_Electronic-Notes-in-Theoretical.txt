The paper addresses the issue of coalition formation and resource-based agent behavior within a formal logic framework. It discusses the computational complexity of determining minimal cost coalitions and model checking problems within the context of priced game arenas. The authors also explore the problem of actions producing resources and propose a notion of bounded resource production to address real-world scenarios. Additionally, they introduce the concept of optimal coalitions and present a new formalism called prb-atl, which is based on a stronger notion of resource bounds. They analyze the computational complexity of the model checking problem and the optimal coalitions problem and suggest further research directions for studying variants of the logic. The paper concludes with considerations on future research directions.
