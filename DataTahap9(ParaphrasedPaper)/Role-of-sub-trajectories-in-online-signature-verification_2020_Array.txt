The study conducted experiments on the svc task 2 benchmark dataset, which was used in the first signature verification competition in 2004. The dataset comprises 20 genuine signatures from forty writers and 20 forgery signatures from five skilled forgers not belonging to the forty writers. Three combinations of training and testing datasets were used. The first dataset (ds1) consisted of 5 genuine signatures for training and 15 genuine signatures for testing, resulting in a testing set of 35 signatures (15 genuine and 20 forgery signatures). The second dataset (ds2) involved 10 genuine signatures for training and 30 signatures for testing (10 genuine signatures not used in training, and 20 forgery signatures). The third dataset (ds3) included 15 genuine signatures for training and 25 signatures for testing (5 genuine signatures not used in training, and 20 forgery signatures).

The overall conclusion drawn was that the categorization allowed for an assessment of how each set of features, when considered together, could be valuable in evaluating system performance as opposed to considering single features. Moreover, the incorporation of sub-trajectories led to a reduction in equal error rate (EER) to an optimal level, which could be implemented with any state-of-the-art verification technique in signature verification and further improved the EER. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the discussed categorization and sub-trajectories in the signature verification system.
