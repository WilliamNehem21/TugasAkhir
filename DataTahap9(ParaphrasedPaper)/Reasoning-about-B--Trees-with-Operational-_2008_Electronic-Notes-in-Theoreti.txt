This academic paper presents a formalization of B+ trees as a data structure invariant using separation logic. Section 2 outlines the formalization, while section 3 introduces abstract machine semantics for B+ tree insertion operations and demonstrates their correctness. Section 4 focuses on finding elements in a range query, and section 5 discusses the deletion of elements. The paper concludes with a discussion of issues raised by the work, conclusions, and plans for future research in section 6.

The B+ tree is described as an ordered, n-ary branching, balanced search tree that supports destructive updates. Updates are designed to maintain the B+ tree invariant, triggering further updates at higher levels of the tree when necessary. Data items are stored only in the leaves, and all nodes except the root are guaranteed to be kept at least half full. Additionally, leaf pages are maintained in a singly-linked list.

The paper explains that the B+ tree predicates directly limit the maximum occupancy of a node to its maximum capacity (maxn), while the predicate Btreeh+1 ensures that each child node is at least half full. The usual occupancy guarantee of B+ trees, which states that all nodes except the root node are at least half full, follows from an inductive argument.

The operations related to B+ tree insertion and splitting are detailed in four sections. The first section describes the rule for descending down the correct path of internal nodes in the tree and pushing the path location information on the stack at each step. The second section outlines the three cases that can occur when a leaf page is encountered during insertion, including the scenarios where the entry replaces an existing entry, fits into the page, or requires the page to be split. The third section discusses the possible ripple in post operations up the tree, detailing three cases and their corresponding actions.

Overall, the paper formalizes the B+ tree data structure using separation logic and demonstrates the correctness of insertion operations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the behavior and maintenance of B+ trees.
