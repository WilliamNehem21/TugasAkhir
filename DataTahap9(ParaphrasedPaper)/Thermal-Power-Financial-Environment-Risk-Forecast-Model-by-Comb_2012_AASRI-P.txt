The conventional method of generating electricity in the power industry, known as thermal power, has distinct advantages, yet it also harbors various risks. Hence, it is crucial for the thermal power sector to thoroughly examine these risks, as doing so holds great significance for both industry operators and the broader national economy. With the power industry transitioning from a state of monopoly to one of competition due to deregulation, the instability and security risks stemming from fluctuations in electricity and raw materials prices have emerged as prominent concerns in the electricity market. Consequently, as China's electric power system planning dictates the eventual full opening of the electric market, the relationship between financial markets and the power industry will become even closer, thereby subjecting market participants to unprecedented risks. Hence, it is imperative to urgently enhance the development of a modern financial system, as financial security is deemed the core of industrial safety according to Zheng Xinli. Additionally, other scholars have provided insight into the fundamental framework of China's power financial markets and have proposed risk management strategies and methods. Notably, the anticipation of power financial environmental risks is a crucial aspect; however, it is noted that relevant literature on this topic is scarce.

The paper goes on to construct a data forecasting model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network, taking into account several impact indicators in order to validate the forecast model. Specifically, three indicators - ma5, bias6, and psy12 - were aggregated to form the input vector, offering an effective algorithmic model for the thermal power industry to conduct analysis and forecast the financial environment. From the technical indicator group, bias6 and ma5 emerged as superior to other indicators. Remarkably, when using a single indicator to forecast stock closing indices, whether it was a technical indicator, an average stock yield indicator, or a closing index indicator, the accuracy was lower than that achieved with group indicators. Among the hybrid combinations tested, bias6 + ma5 + psy12 stood out as the optimal group with the smallest forecasting errors.

While the paper highlighted the use of quantitative indicators to forecast closing indices, it acknowledged that stock movements are influenced not only by quantitative factors, but also by non-quantitative factors, such as macroeconomic policies, regulations, and psychological influences. Introducing these non-quantitative elements into mathematical algorithms using mining techniques to enhance forecast accuracy is deemed a topic meriting future research.
