This paper examines a fundamental network operation, node discovery, in ad-hoc networks, where a node with limited network knowledge seeks to establish connections with a specific number of other nodes in the network, which it may not be aware of. The paper formally defines the correctness, security, and efficiency requirements of node discovery protocols, and explores the challenge of designing such protocols under appropriate network topology assumptions. Specifically, the paper focuses on ensuring the security of these protocols against byzantine adversaries capable of corrupting a limited number of nodes in the network. Following the presentation of several secure node discovery protocols, the paper also discusses their applications in secure service architectures within ad-hoc networks.

The network is represented as a graph G, where each node is associated with a different party, and an edge between nodes indicates that the associated parties are within radio range of each other. The structure of the graph may change over time due to factors such as party mobility, geographical changes, power disruption, or low battery, resulting in the failure or creation of nodes and edges. The paper assumes the absence of contention or transmission errors, as these issues can be addressed at different network layers.

Furthermore, the effectiveness of node discovery protocols is heavily influenced by the topology assumptions of the network graph. The paper emphasizes the importance of minimizing the topology assumptions under which node discovery protocols are proven correct and secure, particularly in real-life ad-hoc networks and in the presence of node mobility.

Finally, the paper introduces a phase where a node divides its set of neighboring nodes into two subsets, one containing the neighbors that successfully forwarded the identities of two distinct nodes for session establishment and the other containing the remaining neighbors. In this initial phase, the node receives distinct identities from the subset of successful neighbors.
