In this research paper, we discuss the concept of algebraic operations in the context of both closed and non-closed categories. Section 5 presents what we consider the most significant finding of the paper, which involves a formulation using generic effects that generalizes a previous study of Lawvere theories. Additionally, in Section 6, we examine algebraic operations in terms of operations on the category T-alg, providing insight into how call-by-name languages with computational effects can be incorporated. Finally, in Section 7, we offer conclusions and suggest potential future research directions.

An algebraic operation in computing involves the consideration of an operator on expressions. However, an alternative perspective views arrows of the category ct as primitive, treating them as programs. This alternative approach was the basis of the reformulation of the semantics for finite nondeterminism. Consequently, we aim to redefine the notion of algebraic operation within this framework, a task made possible by Proposition 3.1. To clarify the rationale behind the coherence conditions, we initially express the result assuming the category c is closed. Subsequently, we eliminate the closedness assumption and demonstrate how the result can be reformulated using parametrized naturality.
