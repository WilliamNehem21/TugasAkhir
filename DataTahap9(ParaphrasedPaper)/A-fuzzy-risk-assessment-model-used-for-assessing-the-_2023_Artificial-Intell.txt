An effective strategy to prevent the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in a country involves investigating the various pathways through which the ASF virus is transmitted. These transmission pathways include interactions with feral pigs, domestic pigs and pig products, as well as soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros. Long-distance transmission of the virus is attributed to human activity. For example, in March 2017, an ASF outbreak in Irkutsk, Russia led to the spread of the virus thousands of kilometers into Europe. A similar recent example is the ASF outbreak in Timor-Leste.

To evaluate the validity of a fuzzy risk assessment model, it is essential to use other assessment results to validate the functionality of the established model. The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) employed a qualitative method to assess the risk of ASF introduction to the UK, categorizing it into five risk levels (i.e., very low, low, medium, high, and very high). DEFRA utilized various data from European countries and the UK, such as trade volume and the importation of pigs, to calculate the risk level of ASF impact for the UK through different pathways. A similar parameter, transport, in their method correlates with the "international import trade" (IIT) variable in the established fuzzy risk assessment model.

Comparing the risk levels generated by the two methods, it was observed that when the import pathway (IP) is very low and the IIT is low, the risk of ASF introduction (RAI) is very low. However, when both IP values are very low and the IIT values are low, the final results indicate a low risk. Despite the IP value for 2019 being very close to the next degree (low), it influenced the final output as it approached the low level. Furthermore, the decrease in the IP for 2020 resulted in a decrease in the final result, which still indicated a low risk. This could be attributed to the widespread travel restrictions and reduced international tourism as a result of the global lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the risk factors associated with passengers decreased, and the major risk in the near future will likely arise from international trade. However, international tourism is expected to recover, and this may lead to an increase in the risk of ASF introduction.

This study presents a quantitative fuzzy risk assessment model for evaluating the risk of ASF introduction into Australia. The paper offers two key contributions. Firstly, it establishes an ASF introduction risk assessment model using fuzzy modeling techniques. Secondly, it utilizes the established model to provide insights into the risk level for ASF introduction into Australia. The analysis conducted suggests that Australia is at a low risk of ASF introduction. The risk associated with international tourists has shown a declining trend between 2019 and 2020. By analyzing import volumes and flight numbers, it is concluded that the highest risk of introduction comes from countries in Asia. These findings can support the development of more effective inspection and monitoring methods by relevant departments to safeguard Australia's biosecurity.
