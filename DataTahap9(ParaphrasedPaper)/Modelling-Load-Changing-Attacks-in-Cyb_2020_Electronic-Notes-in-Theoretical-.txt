The prevalence of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in various domains, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart grids, makes them susceptible to large-scale cyber-security attacks, known as gridlock or BlackIoT. In response to this threat, a stochastic modelling approach has been developed to evaluate the impact of botnet attacks on power infrastructure, with a specific focus on power load management in smart grids. This paper presents a modelling approach to quantify the impact of a botnet attack on a power supplier and demonstrates how different power generator types and control strategies can affect the success of such attacks.

The paper provides a comprehensive review of the cyber-security concerns related to CPS, followed by a discussion of the modelling approach. The proposed modelling technique applies continuous-time Markov chains to capture the behavior of power plants and botnets under normal and attack scenarios. The modelling approach is demonstrated in the context of a power supplier targeted by a botnet, showcasing how it can be generalized for any CPS system involving power load management in a smart grid.

The study also compares its work with related research that has simulated coordinated attacks by botnets on the power grid, emphasizing the focus on quantifying the impact of such attacks from the perspective of a potential supplier. The paper investigates the effectiveness of different power plant types in responding to botnet attacks and discusses the impact of control strategies on the power supply in the face of attacks.

In addition to the theoretical modelling, the paper discusses practical implications for smart infrastructures, highlighting the vulnerability of self-regulating power supplies to targeted attacks. The authors propose a model checking approach to investigate the effects of attacks on the power system, with potential applications in devising countermeasures and enhancing the resilience of power infrastructures.

The paper concludes with potential extensions to the model, such as considering additional attackers with different patterns of behavior, incorporating costs and rewards for important states, and scaling the model to different CPS types and wattage needs. The extension of the model could enable further analysis of new security measures to mitigate potential attacks on power infrastructures.
