This paper examines the scheduling of boat launches to minimize contacts between boats and maximize visits to the river, while efficiently utilizing available campsites. The study considers three groups of boats to be launched each day: group 1 consists of motorized boats of varying durations, group 2 comprises oar-powered rubber crafts with different durations, and group 3 consists of motorized boats with different durations. By adhering to this schedule, it is ensured that there will be no contact between the boats. The river's carrying capacity is determined to be 238, indicating the need for at least 238 campsites. Over a six-month period, there are a total of 3163 visits to the river. It is suggested that neither schedule is definitively superior to the other: the former schedule results in an even distribution of boat types based on propulsion, while the latter maximizes river visits.

The objective is to devise a schedule that minimizes boat-to-boat contact, maximizes visits, and optimizes campsites utilization. Increasing the number of boats launched into the river, or reducing the time interval between groups of boats, leads to improved campsites utilization. However, this also increases the likelihood of boat contacts. Conversely, fewer boat launches or longer intervals minimize contacts between boats, illustrating an interdependent relationship. The aim is to develop a schedule that effectively manages this interaction. To simplify the problem, the considerations are approached from two perspectives, and the schedule is optimized with respect to the contact issue. The crafting activities begin daily at 6:40 am.

Considering a six-month period to consist of 180 days, the first 161 days involve launching the same number of boats daily, which is 19. On the 162nd day, due to unavailability of oar-powered rubber crafts or motorized boats of a specific duration, the number of daily boat launches decreases. This reduction continues until the 175th day when no boats are permitted to set off.
