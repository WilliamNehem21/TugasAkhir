In recent years, there has been significant advancement in the field of electronic health records (EHR), leading to the generation of substantial volumes of digital clinical data. This has facilitated the development of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to improve decision-making processes. For instance, public databases like MIMIC-III have contributed to advancements in clinical predictions. These databases have been utilized to create and enhance severity scoring systems, traditional machine learning algorithms, and deep neural networks (DNNs) for more accurate clinical prediction tasks such as patient mortality, disease classification, and length of hospital stay.

Conventional severity scoring systems such as Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II), Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) are widely used for mortality prediction. Clinicians typically select patient-specific events based on their experience and then implement a standardized process. This involves calculating a severity score based on relevant events, usually within the first 24 hours after ICU admission, and subsequently applying a simple model like logistic regression to predict the likelihood of mortality.

To benchmark the performance of various methods, three critical clinical prediction tasks commonly studied by machine learning researchers were selected. These tasks include in-hospital mortality, ICD-9 code group prediction, and length of stay prediction in intensive care units (ICUs). A comprehensive set of 136 time-series features and five non-time series features were extracted based on their clinical significance and missing rate, capturing all features used in severity scoring systems such as SAPS-II and SOFA. Different feature selection methods, including genetic algorithm (GA) based methods, scoring methods, and machine learning methods, were assessed based on this feature set.

In the evaluation, it was observed that GA consistently outperforms other feature selection methods. This superior performance is attributed to GA's capability to converge to local and even global optima with a sufficient number of iterations (epochs). Although this method incurs a time overhead due to the need for high precision, it only needs to be trained once offline, and in practical application, doctors can quickly make a diagnosis using a subset of selected features.
