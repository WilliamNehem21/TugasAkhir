The opposite can be easily demonstrated by applying the weighted subject reduction property. It should be noted that comparable findings for idempotent intersection type systems cannot be established using a combinatorial approach; rather, they usually rely on reducibility arguments. This is precisely where the quantitative approach using non-idempotent types becomes significant.
