The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explores the existing research in this area. Section 3 provides a detailed explanation of the proposed architecture. Section 4 outlines the experimental setup utilized to assess the performance of the proposed architecture, along with a brief discussion of the findings. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude the discussion by identifying potential avenues for future research.

During assessments, participants experienced difficulties and lacked online support. However, the utilization of ELRA, VA effectively addressed these issues, and the recommendation method reduced the likelihood of inappropriate course selection. Consequently, individuals in the experimental group (including students, instructors, and virtual agents) reported higher satisfaction levels compared to those in the control group. Additionally, parametric analysis indicated that ELRA users exhibited higher levels of satisfaction than users of the traditional approach, with a satisfaction rate exceeding 50% as opposed to less than 50% for traditional approach users.
