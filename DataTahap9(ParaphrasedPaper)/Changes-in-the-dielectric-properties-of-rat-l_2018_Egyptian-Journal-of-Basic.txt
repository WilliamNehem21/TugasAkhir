Exposure to ionizing radiation has been shown to result in various cellular effects, including damage to the cell membrane, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular functionality and integrity. Therefore, studying the damage to the cellular membrane is essential in understanding the effects of ionizing radiation on cells. Detecting radiation-induced damage relies on the extent of the damage and the sensitivity of the detection techniques. This study utilized dielectric spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy, both of which are powerful, sensitive, and non-destructive techniques for investigating radiation-induced damage at the cellular and molecular levels.

The study observed changes in the fluidity of the cellular membrane following irradiation. The results showed that the greatest change in membrane fluidity occurred after exposure to 2 Gy of radiation, as indicated by the shift and broadening of the CH2 asymmetric stretching vibration band in the FTIR data. The effects of 2 Gy irradiation on membrane fluidity were found to be significantly greater than those of 10 cGy irradiation. These findings highlight the considerable impact of low-dose radiation, such as 10 cGy, on cellular membranes and the associated risks.

The study also utilized dielectric spectroscopy to measure the influence of different radiation doses on the lung tissues of irradiated rats. The results indicated that induced membrane fluidity was significantly higher following 2 Gy irradiation compared to 10 cGy irradiation. Furthermore, the FTIR data confirmed substantial conformational changes in the cell membrane following 2 Gy irradiation, emphasizing the damaging effect of low-dose radiation exposure at the cellular level.
