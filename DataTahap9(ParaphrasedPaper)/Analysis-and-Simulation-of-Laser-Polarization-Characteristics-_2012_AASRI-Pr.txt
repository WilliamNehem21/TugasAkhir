In various fields such as remote sensing and medical imaging, the focus of domestic research on laser polarization has mainly revolved around these areas, with little emphasis on short-range detection of ground objects. This study is primarily concerned with modeling and analyzing the polarization characteristics of laser light on the surface of metal targets, as well as simulating the polarization properties on several representative metal targets.

Upon examining the reflection characteristics on metal surfaces, it is observed that both the reflectivity and phase of s and p components undergo varying degrees of change. Generally, when a linearly polarized laser beam is incident on a metal surface, it becomes elliptically polarized upon reflection. According to the definition of Stokes parameters, the changes in polarization upon reflection from metal can be described by a Mueller matrix, which captures the reflection process. Assuming the Stokes vector of the incident light is [si; si; si; si], and the Stokes vector of the reflected light is [sr; sr; sr; sr], the Mueller matrix for reflection on a metal surface can be derived by coordinating formulas (1) and (5).
