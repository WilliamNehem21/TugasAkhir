Space solar power satellites (SSPS) have a wide range of potential applications in the future. While the immediate challenge of transmitting power from space to the ground remains difficult, SSPS can be utilized for other purposes, such as establishing charging stations in synchronous solar orbits to power small satellites. This space-based infrastructure could help address the power requirements of small satellites operating in low or medium orbits, making the construction of SSPS imperative.

Since Peter Glaser first proposed the concept of SSPS in 1968, over the past 50 years, research in this area has seen both progress and setbacks. Despite the highs and lows, SSPS research has persisted, with a focus on innovative conceptual designs and experimental validations.

In 2019, an experiment using phased array technology successfully powered a flying drone, receiving approximately 60 W of DC power at a distance of 10 meters, and approximately 42 W at a distance of 30 meters. Furthermore, in 2020, the US Navy Research Laboratory (NRL) launched a solar energy-collecting module aboard the Air Force X-37B orbital test vehicle, and also demonstrated the conversion of wireless network signals into DC power using a light-emitting rectenna at the International Space Station.

The space segment of the Omega 2.0 system encompasses three subsystems: hemispherical condenser and photoelectric conversion, transmitting antenna and microwave conversion, and a smart-structure subsystem with a high-power mass ratio. This complex system presents several challenges, including the coupling problem of multiple physical fields, nonlinear influences on electrical and optical performance, and the optimization of design variables to maximize the power mass ratio.

Additionally, careful consideration must be given to the management of waste heat from the transmitting antenna, as this poses a significant challenge for sandwich-structured transmitting antennas. The spacing and alignment of monitoring antennas were used to gather incident microwave power-density distribution data on the rectenna, with the data used for feedback and compensation adjustments.

The development of the ground-based Omega 2.0-based SSPS verification system was made possible with the support and assistance of various individuals and research students. The authors express their gratitude to everyone involved for their contributions and support.
