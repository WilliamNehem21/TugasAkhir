The concept of subjective logic [10, 11] is applied to an intelligent coffee corner scenario within a research institute, where a user's authentication level determines which colleagues' positions are displayed on a wall screen. The paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 discusses the use of contextual information and context-aware trust to enhance authentication. Section 3 covers the fundamentals of subjective logic, while Section 4 explains how to calculate trust based on location sources. Section 5 describes the instantiation of the framework into a realistic sensor model, and Section 6 presents simulation results validating the location-based trust algorithm. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and Section 8 concludes the paper and highlights future work.

The issue of distributed authentication has been extensively researched, but this work specifically focuses on utilizing context and context-based trust to enhance traditional authentication processes.

A complementary approach involving a fusion algorithm running on a building map is described, but the paper argues that an approach based on belief theory is more suitable than one based on probability theory for developing a general-purpose sensor fusion algorithm. The proposed approach is scalable with the number of sensors and can be extended to other context types beyond location-based information.

As the simulations validate the theoretical expectations regarding trust trends, the algorithm is being implemented in an office application to display colleagues' locations on a wall screen based on the user's authentication level. The current authentication procedure is based on recognizing personal devices associated with the user (e.g., PDA, badge, laptop, Bluetooth devices, RFID) to prevent unauthorized use of the service, such as someone else using the user's badge or sitting at their desk while the user is temporarily away.
