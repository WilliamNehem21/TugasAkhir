This research paper presents a unique approach to representing quantum data using classical interactions for manipulating quantum states and performing measurements to extract information from them. Specifically, quantum states are depicted as strategies that guide decision-making in accordance with the principles of quantum mechanics. The proposed model is based on concepts from game semantics and introduces a new game in which moves describe the behavior of quantum stores.

In this framework, quantum measurement serves as the quantum equivalent of dereferencing in classical computing, retrieving the stored value, while state preparation corresponds to assignment. It is important to note that, unlike classical stores which can be assigned a value multiple times, quantum stores do not allow for this as quantum states cannot be destroyed. Instead, state preparation extends a given state with new known information.

The paper presents a proof by induction on the construction of 'm', taking into account the second and third clauses of the definition of computability which imply that 'm' is constructed from semiclosed terms. The most significant part of the proof is explained, with the more routine classical cases omitted.

The paper acknowledges that the categorical properties of quantum store arenas have not been fully explored. For instance, it suggests considering the subcategory of the category of arenas and probabilistic strategies that consists of quantum store arenas and the quantum strategies between them. This category differs significantly from other categories studied in understanding quantum information flow, as the qstore arena does not have a fixed dimension, whereas the objects in the other categories are finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
