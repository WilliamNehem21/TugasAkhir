Ta et al. proposed a method based on SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) for object tracking in videos. The SURF descriptor is utilized to optimize the similarity search of interest points. Experimental results demonstrate that the SURF feature extraction algorithm has a smaller computational footprint and is faster than the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the SURF features matching algorithm, Section 3 describes the hardware design for the tracking system, Section 4 presents the experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

The SURF algorithm consists of three main steps: interest points detection, interest points description, and interest points matching. The interest points detection employs a detector based on the Hessian matrix, which exhibits superior stability and repeatability compared to existing state-of-the-art detectors such as Harris. Interest points description utilizes Haar wavelets to reduce computational costs and enhance robustness. Block filtering is used to approximate the second-order Gaussian filter, and integral image is employed to accelerate convolution, reduce computational complexity, and enhance speed.

According to the SURF algorithm, interest points are detected at different scales, particularly because similarity searching often relies on their comparison in images where they are detected at various scales. Typically, scale spaces are implemented using an image pyramid. In SURF, block filters are employed to approximate the Gaussian kernel, and the computational cost is independent of its size, which is crucial for achieving speed.
