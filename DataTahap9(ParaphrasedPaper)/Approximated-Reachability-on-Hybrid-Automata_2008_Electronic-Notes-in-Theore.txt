The paper asserts that hybrid automata can only be approximated rather than precisely defined. This approach can be applied to a broader class of hybrid automata that encompass the evolution of continuous variables using trigonometric terms, which cannot be handled through symbolic computation but can be effectively approximated using methods such as interval arithmetic. The method involves iterating through a loop to recover the states relevant for ensuring the safety of the abstracted dynamical system. The paper introduces a framework for the three-valued safety analysis of hybrid automata and considers stronger properties expressed through temporal logic CTL. The proposed method for reachability analysis of hybrid automata relies on constructing a series of abstractions that do not require exact representation of predecessor or successor regions but still encode sufficient information to verify safety properties and more general CTL formulas. Additionally, the paper provides efficient algorithms for the three-valued safety analysis on these abstractions.
