Initialization of a dlpsl node involves the inclusion of several components, such as the storage index value (SID), data information, storage node ID (CID), priorities (weights), and a pointer field. The SID typically ranges from a minimum value to a maximum value, and is utilized as a 32-bit binary number to locate specific user data. The data information field is used to store relevant data and is initially set to null. The storage node ID refers to the storage ID of the corresponding file fragmentation and generally consists of multiple addresses. During node initialization, all weights are set to 0. The level of each node is determined using a random function, and the weights are dynamically adjusted based on the search rate. Additionally, the node's level will change dynamically according to the weights' magnitude.

Node insertion requires several steps to be followed: first, the insert position of the node must be located; then, new nodes are created; and finally, the pointer value is modified. Node insertion is commonly used during node updates, and its time efficiency is largely dependent on the efficiency of the localization algorithm.

Node deletion follows a process similar to node insertion. First, the nodes that need to be deleted are located, and it is then determined whether the node can be found. If the node is found, the relevant pointer value is modified, and the node is deleted. If the node cannot be found, the deletion operation fails. The time efficiency of node deletion is also influenced by the efficiency of the localization algorithm.
