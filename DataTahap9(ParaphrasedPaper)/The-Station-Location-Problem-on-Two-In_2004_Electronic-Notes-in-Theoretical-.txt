The issue of station location involves the placement of new stations in an existing railway network to attract more users, primarily for local traffic. However, the company incurs costs for new stations, and additional stops can lead to longer travel times for existing users. Consequently, the objective is to minimize the number of new stations. This research was instigated by a collaborative effort with deutsche bahn on this very issue.

While solving the station location problem for a single line segment is feasible in polynomial time, it becomes NP-hard for two or more line segments. Nevertheless, a heuristic approach involves decomposing the railway network into independent line segments and carefully considering the common area between them for an effective solution. This paper addresses the initial steps toward such an approach.

A set of algorithmic tests is employed, wherein Algorithm 2 successively examines whether a set of two, three, or four stations can cover a given set. If not all points can be covered by four stations, the solution involves covering the entire common area of the two lines with five stations. The running time for this algorithm is evidently in O(n^3).

The problem of covering the common area between two intersecting straight line segments, which is generally NP-hard, is analyzed. A characterization of solutions to this problem based on the angle between the line segments is presented, leading to a linear-time algorithm to identify a small, though not generally minimum, number of discs covering the common area. This result is then applied to the station location problem for a railway network comprising two intersecting tracks with a sufficiently large angle.
