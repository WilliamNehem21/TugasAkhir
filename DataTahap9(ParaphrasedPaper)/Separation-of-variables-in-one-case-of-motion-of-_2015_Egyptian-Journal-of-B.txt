A variant of the solvable problem concerning the motion of a gyrostat with dynamic symmetry around a fixed point, akin to the Kowalevski top, subjected to a combination of uniform gravitational and magnetic fields is examined. In general, this variant can be reduced to hyperelliptic integrals. The specific scenario in which the gyrostatic momentum is not present is resolved using elliptic functions of time.

Euler originally discovered the separation of variables in Euler's case, but it was Jacobi who expressed the solution in terms of his newly devised elliptic functions. Lagrange then reduced the axisymmetric top case to a separation of variables involving elliptic integrals. Jacobi initiated the explicit expression of the solution in terms of time, which can be found with some variations in [3e5].

Zhukovsky generalized the solution, which Volterra demonstrated could be expressed using sigma functions of Weierstrass. Wittenburg subsequently identified another solution in terms of elliptic functions of time. A comprehensive overview of the historical development of both general and specific solutions for a heavy gyrostat can be found elsewhere.

The extension of the problem to the gyrostat context was explored in a different context. The problem of a gyrostat with similarities to the Kowalevski top, subjected to two non-parallel uniform fields (gravity and magnetic), was investigated. A general first integral, quartic in velocities, and generalizing the Kowalevski integral was derived for this generalized problem. In the gyrostat motion in only one field, the second case does not encompass the classical Kowalevski case, as the magnitudes of the two fields are proportional and can only vanish simultaneously. In the last case, the cyclic variable is an angle complementary to the sum (or difference) of the two precession and proper rotation angles, where "i" and "l" represent the inertia tensor at point "o" and the gyrostatic momentum vector, both of which are constant in the moving frame. We consider the components of all vectors as rows, leading to the unconventional order of the objects in the above expression for "m".

A separation of variables does exist, and one of the possible methods to achieve separation was identified in the literature. Complete real algebraic separation for the Goryachev case was presented elsewhere. Here, we provide real separation for the gyrostat in the double field with singular symmetry under a specific condition.

The Hamiltonian (equation 21) can be expressed as the discriminant set of some polynomial. However, for Chaplygin's case, the complete algebraic separation of variables is not yet known. It appears probable that such a separation can be attained based on the evident analogy between the two problems.
