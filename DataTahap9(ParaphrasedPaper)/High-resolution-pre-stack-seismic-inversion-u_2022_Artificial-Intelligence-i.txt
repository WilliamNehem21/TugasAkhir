In the field of geophysics, acquiring labeled data is costly. To address the challenge of limited samples, many researchers have opted to enhance the generalization ability of artificial neural network (ANN) inversion frameworks by introducing constraints. For instance, Song et al. (2022) proposed an inversion framework based on semi-supervised learning, while other researchers have utilized techniques such as incorporating initial models as constraints in the ANN framework, employing a physics-guided approach in a convolutional neural network (CNN), and utilizing a data-driven approach. In this study, we utilize a different ANN learning architecture known as FSL for high-resolution pre-stack seismic inversion of reservoir parameters.
