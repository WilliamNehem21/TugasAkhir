The domain of process algebras is often perceived as a complex network of related yet distinct theories. Different process algebras address various concepts such as nondeterminism, parallelism, distribution, real time, stochastic phenomena, and more, each employing different approaches for their expression. Numerous researchers focus on different subcalculi, but the understanding of the relationships between them remains incomplete.

A subsequent study in 1989 delved into the expressible operators of a specific algebra, particularly examining the asynchronous parallel composition and its implications on the expressibility of De Simone operators. The analysis revealed that a significant subset of De Simone operators satisfying the idling rules could be expressed up to weak bisimulation, which is essential for the construction of supervisory terms and their interactions with operands. However, the limitation of most process algebras to binary communication is noteworthy. Consequently, there remains a lack of a definitive measure for the expressible operators in most algebras, including the original CCS.

The use of these expressible operators naturally raises questions about whether the chosen observables are comprehensive. Different observables hold relevance for different purposes, and some may not fully capture the intended semantics, thus necessitating the combination of other criteria, notably operational correspondence.

The translation of formalism to a lower level one poses challenges, as resulting terms from such translations will primarily comprise combinations of protocols or compiled code snippets. However, the target level may contain elements that are not translations of terms in the original level, and although these elements may not appear in translations, their presence within the contexts of the target level impacts the definition of full abstraction. It may be unreasonable to expect that the encodings from the original level behave identically in all possible contexts of the target level, as they will only be exposed to a subset of such contexts which are translations of contexts in the original level.
