The cellular grid involves agents with the objective of reaching their respective target positions as quickly as possible. Four models using agents are proposed to address this task within the context of cellular automata (CA) paradigm. The agents are categorized as either directed (having a specific moving direction) or undirected, and they exhibit deterministic behavior based on a control automaton. Each agent is positioned at a single site and has its own distinct target, with the targets being mutually exclusive. Consequently, each agent independently endeavors to move towards its designated target while being constrained by neighboring cells.

This work is linked to a CA-based path planning algorithm in multi-agent systems, where numerous agents are tasked with reaching a shared target. However, a key distinction in this investigation is that each agent has an individual target. Research on target search in agent systems has explored various scenarios, including moving targets and single-agent systems. In this study, the focus is specifically on stationary targets and multiple agents with distinct target objectives.

One of the proposed models does not employ a control automaton; instead, the agent attempts to move directly along the shortest path to the target, with the shortest path defined as one that reduces the distance to the target in each step in either of two directions. When faced with a choice, the agent randomly selects one of the alternate directions for the shortest path. In instances of anticipated conflict, the agent randomly chooses a different direction or remains stationary when conflict is foreseen in all four directions. Notably, the success of the agents is not contingent on all of them following the shortest path, although they do so if no conflicts arise.

In another model, each agent has a predetermined moving direction, and no control automaton is used. Instead, the agent maneuvers itself toward the target by adjusting its direction. Similar to the previous model, the agent may be presented with two alternate next directions for the shortest path, with a random choice being made when necessary. In cases of anticipated conflict, an arbiter contained within the crossing cell selects one agent to move, or if two agents are in direct contact and face each other, they are swapped.

Ultimately, the research involves directed agents and random directed agents, utilizing mealy control finite state machine as part of the cell automaton to control the moving and turning actions of both undirected and directed agents. Furthermore, control algorithms were developed for different numbers of agents ranging from k=1 to 256.
