Therefore, our approach aims to approximate associativity for up to three elements. It is important to note that confusion arises only when two sessions of the protocol are executed simultaneously, with strands communicating through the intruder by sending and receiving messages. The intruder learns messages only through the strands, and initially knows nothing. During the rule generation stage, Maude-npa examines the remaining paths and generates a new set of grammar rules based on a set of heuristics. After this stage, the process reiterates until all paths are eliminated, successfully defining a language, or until no new language rules can be defined, indicating a failure to define a language. The intruder's knowledge is crucial in the backwards reachability process, and our tool is capable of determining the initial state of the protocol.
