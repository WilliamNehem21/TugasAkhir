This academic paper discusses the Controller Area Network (CAN), which is a high-speed serial bus system with real-time capabilities. The paper presents a formal model of the CAN bus protocol, focusing on the arbitration process, transmission process, and fault confinement mechanism. It also formalizes 11 important properties of the protocol and describes the system model and properties for verification using the UPPAAL verification tool. The verification results reveal that certain properties are not satisfied due to issues such as starvation and bus-off nodes. To address these problems, the paper proposes the application of a dynamic priority scheduling algorithm and a bus-off recovery mechanism at the application layer.

CAN, originally developed by Bosch and established as an international standard in ISO 11898, features multi-master broadcasting as its key characteristic. The paper emphasizes fault confinement mechanisms and the interframe space characteristic as important elements of the protocol. It also discusses the use of formal methods based on rigorous mathematical theory for ensuring the correctness of the CAN protocol, with a focus on formal notations and verification tools such as SPIN, NuSMV, UPPAAL, and Coq.

The paper details the structure of error frames, the use of the carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism to resolve collisions, and the fault confinement mechanism to ensure data consistency and reliability. Additionally, it explains the interframe space characteristic, which separates data and remote frames from the preceding frame. The paper also addresses the modeling process of the CAN protocol using UPPAAL and the verification of its properties, including comparison with related work and concluding remarks.

The paper discusses the challenges and limitations in the CAN protocol, such as the occurrence of errors and the potential for data loss and inconsistency. It proposes the use of time-triggered controller area network (TTCAN) and algorithms in the application layer to address these issues. Furthermore, the paper suggests future research directions, including modeling and verifying the probability of CAN communication and integrating probability models into the verification process.
