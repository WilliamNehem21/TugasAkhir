The paper introduces biochemical space (BCS) as a semi-formal notation for representing reaction networks of biological processes. BCS is designed to provide a concise mapping of mathematical models to their biological descriptions at a specified level of abstraction. The authors first aim to formalize BCS by defining its semantics using a simplified kappa calculus. They also support BCS with a translation to BioNetGen Language (BNGL), a popular rule-based language. The paper also addresses the current status of BCS in the context of processes specific to cyanobacteria.

The authors demonstrate that rule-based methods can be directly applied to condense existing kinetic models of oxygenic photosynthesis, leading to a compact and non-redundant form achieved by applying automated syntactic reductions defined in kappa. They further propose the use of rule-based definitions of biological processes as a framework for qualitatively describing the chemical reactions underlying the processes, allowing for the mapping of quantitative models onto the qualitative rule-based BCS.

The paper discusses the general concepts underlying BCS and describes the transition of BCS from a semi-formal to a completely formal language with well-defined syntax and semantics through its embedding to kappa. It also compares BCS to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) format, highlighting the differences in rule-based description and logical organization of entities and reactions. The paper emphasizes that the simplicity and precision of BCS specifications align with KEGG's format.

Further, the paper discusses the qualitative nature of BCS in comparison to process algebraic languages, emphasizing its adherence to a purely qualitative level of description of chemical reactions. It also explains how BCS provides a biological background for mathematical models of processes specific to organisms and how complete BCS models establish a connection between existing ontologies and partial mathematical models.

The paper details the structure of BCS models, including the representation of entities and rules, and addresses the issues related to complex and detailed descriptions in BCS models, necessitating abstraction for simplicity. It also defines the hierarchical representation of agents and introduces structure agents to capture the composition of biochemical objects at various levels of hierarchy and abstraction. The paper outlines algorithms for translating BCS models into kappa models.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the construction and hierarchy of complex structures in BCS and points out the benefits of employing BCS rules over enumeration for representing complex systems, illustrated by examples from cyanobacterial processes such as the circadian clock and photosynthesis.

Finally, the paper highlights the implementation of BCS at e-cyanobacteria.org and its coverage of several functional modules of cyanobacteria. It also elaborates on the translation between BCS and BNGL and the benefits of BCS rules in representing complex biological processes.
