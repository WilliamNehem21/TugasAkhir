This paper introduces an approach to coordination in multiagent systems that emphasizes constructionism over the traditional reductionist design philosophy. The approach involves modeling coordination scenarios of autonomous agents as a constraint optimization problem and presenting a distributed asynchronous algorithm to compute potential coordination outcomes. The paper also demonstrates how this algorithm can be integrated into a real-world coordination mechanism.

Traditionally, coordination in multiagent systems has relied on a reductionist approach, which decomposes tasks from the top-down and assigns subtasks to agents based on pre-established interaction patterns. However, this approach has limitations when applied to real-world scenarios, leading to the emergence of a constructionist approach where agents interact to pursue their local goals, with coordination based on a mechanism that balances benevolence and self-interest. The paper describes the concept of structural cooperation as an example of this constructionist approach to coordination.

The algorithm presented in the paper utilizes distributed constraint-based search and is applied to specific coordination scenarios in multiagent domains where cognitive agents develop short-term plans. The paper also discusses the concept of Pareto optimality in agreement among agents and how the coordination mechanism determines the best option among multiple Pareto-optimal solutions.

The algorithm is designed for decentralized multiagent problem-solving systems, which are typically applied to domains with a priori distribution. The paper analyzes the properties of the algorithm, highlighting its parallel, asynchronous computation and limited communication load through selective addressing.

Additionally, the paper outlines the application of the algorithm to a real-world problem in urban traffic management, specifically in the TRysa2 prototype, which consists of autonomous knowledge-based traffic control agents managing a road network. The authors plan to evaluate the mechanism of structural cooperation and the algorithm in other domains, including a comparison to centralized solutions in the traffic domain, and aim to improve its computational complexity through tighter integration of algorithm stages.

Overall, the paper presents an approach to multiagent coordination that emphasizes constructionism, provides an algorithm for decentralized coordination, and demonstrates its application in a real-world domain. The authors aim to further evaluate and refine the approach for use in various domains.
