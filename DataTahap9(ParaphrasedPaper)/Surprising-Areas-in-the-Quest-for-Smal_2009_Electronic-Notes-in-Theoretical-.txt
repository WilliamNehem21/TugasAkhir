This paper investigates several key points discussed in a presentation made at the MFCSIT meeting in Cork. The study focuses on three main areas: turing machines, cellular automata, and hyperbolic cellular automata, all of which are aimed at finding small universal devices. The research traces a path from properties within the classical domain to outcomes related to super-Turing computations.

The simulation of a tag-system computation by a turing machine is based on a compact location technique that minimizes the length of the program of the simulating turing machine. This concept, originally proposed by Watanabe in the 1950s, involves encoding the program of a tag-system as a string, associating productions with letters of the alphabet by their order in the string. The encoding of productions includes marking by a "p-delimiter," and within the encoding of a production, the encodings of the letters are marked by another delimiter, the "ldelimiter."

Cellular automata, a widely-used model of computation, extend beyond the realm of computer science. The significance of cellular automata from a computer science perspective is underscored by the existence of a dedicated journal and special issue, solely devoted to results on decidability and undecidability in the field of cellular automata.

Despite universal automata existing in the case of the von Neumann neighborhood using two states and the Moore neighborhood starting from three states, the literature has shown the construction of a universal cellular automaton in the case of the Moore neighborhood using only two states, demonstrated by Berlekamp, Conway, and Gay in proving the universality of the "Game of Life."

The study of cellular automata has predominantly explored Euclidean spaces, with limited investigations in 3D to simulate 3D diffusion-reaction processes. This changed in 1999 with the introduction of cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane, which opened new avenues and attracted a following of colleagues.

Hyperbolic geometry originated from efforts in the 20th century to derive the axiom of parallels in Euclidean geometry. This led to the discovery of hyperbolic geometry by Lobachevsky and Bolyai, where all axioms of Euclidean geometry hold except the parallel one. A new axiom in hyperbolic geometry states that from a point outside a line, there are exactly two lines parallel to the given line.

The paper discusses three key results in the area of hyperbolic cellular automata, including the development of weakly universal cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane and 3D space with a small number of states. Moreover, an intrinsically universal cellular automaton in the hyperbolic plane that directly simulates a cellular automaton of the hyperbolic plane is also presented.

The paper also introduces a mechanism for a locomotive consisting of two cells, each detecting the arrival of the locomotive to perform preliminary changes, thus initiating the change of the selected track once the locomotive leaves the switch.

Finally, the paper demonstrates how hyperbolic geometry provides a new approach to achieving super-Turing computations. Unlike other models, which manipulate time to obtain super-Turing capabilities, this approach takes advantage of the geometric properties of space.
