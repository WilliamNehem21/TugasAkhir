This research investigates the impact of obfuscating selected features of known Android malware samples on the reliability of malware detection. By intentionally obfuscating features and observing their impact on detection, the study aims to identify significant features used by popular Android malware detectors and conduct a black box analysis of these detectors. The findings reveal a high degree of variability among the key features used by different malware detectors. Additionally, the study introduces a modified version of an Android malware obfuscator, referred to as "maamo," and presents experimental results assessing the effectiveness of individual obfuscations and combinations of obfuscators with respect to a set of Android malware detectors.

In addition to discussing various obfuscators used in the experiments, the paper briefly touches on false positives in antivirus products, highlighting the trade-off between false positives and false negatives in malware detection. The paper presents experimental results showing that obfuscation can significantly impact the effectiveness of malware detection, with the optimal obfuscation depending on the specific malware detector and the malware sample being considered. The paper identifies wide variations in capabilities among different malware detectors and highlights the diverse impact of obfuscation on different malware samples.

The study suggests the potential for further research into evaluating the robustness of machine learning-based malware detectors when faced with obfuscations similar to those considered in the paper. The authors propose that the "maamo" tool, along with the findings presented in the paper, could form the foundation for future research comparing machine learning-based results to existing antivirus products.
