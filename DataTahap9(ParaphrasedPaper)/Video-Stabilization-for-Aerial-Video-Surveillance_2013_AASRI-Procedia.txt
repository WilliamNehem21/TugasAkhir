This research paper introduces a novel aerial video stabilization system designed to eliminate unwanted motion from aerial videos caused by the mobile sensor's undesired movements. The system employs keypoint tracking using the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) for motion estimation, along with the application of a Kalman filter and a median filter to remove video noise. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through the analysis of real aerial surveillance videos.

The paper focuses on digital video stabilization techniques, which can be classified into optical, mechanical, electronic, and digital approaches, with a specific emphasis on the digital approach. Within the digital approach, the paper outlines the global motion estimation, motion smoothing, and motion compensation as essential components, highlighting the challenge of global motion estimation.

The proposed system involves the extraction and matching of SIFT points for consecutive frames to stabilize aerial video surveillance captured by UAVs. The paper presents related works on video stabilization, describes the proposed system and its results, and summarizes the conclusions. The system operates by extracting SIFT points from successive frames, estimating the inter-frame motion using an affine transform model, and applying Kalman filtering and median filtering for frame compensation.

To estimate global motion, the system extracts SIFT points from two successive frames and calculates local motion vectors by matching the sets of invariant features. RANSAC is used for optimal matching, and a fixed threshold is employed to eliminate moving objects from the motion vectors. The system adopts a four-parameter 2D affine estimation model to describe geometric transformation between consecutive frames.

The main concept of the introduced system is to filter undesired motion by detecting and matching SIFT points to predict inter-frame motion. The experimental results with real UAV-captured videos validate the efficiency and accuracy of the stabilization system. Future work will focus on integrating optical flow for local motion detection in motion estimation.

In summary, this paper presents a new aerial video stabilization system leveraging SIFT point extraction and matching, demonstrating its effectiveness through real video experiments. The proposed system addresses the challenge of unwanted motion in aerial videos and provides promising results for future research in this area.
