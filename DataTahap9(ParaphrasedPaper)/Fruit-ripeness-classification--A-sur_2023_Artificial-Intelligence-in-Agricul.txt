The cultivation of fruit plays a critical role in global agriculture, supporting the nutritional needs of millions of people. The standard supply chain for fruit products involves rigorous quality checks to ensure freshness, taste, and safety. The ripeness of fruit is a crucial factor in determining its quality, and is traditionally assessed manually by field experts, which is a labor-intensive and error-prone process. This has sparked a growing need for automated methods to classify fruit ripeness. Various automatic methods using feature descriptors and machine learning techniques have been proposed to address this need. Recently, deep learning has emerged as a dominant approach, as it can work directly on raw data without the need for complex engineered features. This survey reviews the latest methods proposed in the literature for automating fruit ripeness classification, with a focus on the most recent deep learning techniques.

Addressing global food security and increasing agricultural productivity is crucial to meet the demands of a growing population. In order to achieve sustainable production, it is essential to increase productivity per unit of land area, as adding more land for cultivation is not a sustainable solution due to limited resources. Inefficient harvest timing can result in significant income loss and waste of resources, as under-ripe or overripe fruit often has lower retail value. Additionally, suboptimal timing of harvest can lead to reduced taste and quality for consumers, as well as decreased shelf life and undesirable flavors and odors. 

Fruit ripening involves complex phenotypic changes and various physical and chemical attributes. These changes encompass factors such as texture, firmness, color, sweetness, aromatics, and the concentrations of various compounds. Fruit ripeness is typically assessed visually by human operators, either through manual classification using visual cues such as color charts, or using tools-based techniques such as colorimeters or spectrometers to obtain accurate and reproducible measurements. Climacteric and non-climacteric fruits exhibit different ripening behaviors, with climacteric fruits being capable of continuing the ripening process even after detachment from the plant, while non-climacteric fruits are not.

There have been substantial advancements in the application of various techniques for fruit ripeness classification, with a focus on statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. These approaches have been used in conjunction with color spaces, aroma characteristics, and spectral analysis to effectively classify fruit ripeness. Non-destructive methods for in-field ripeness assessment have shown promise, but remain a challenge in linking the assessments to predicting yield and optimal harvest date, especially considering the variability in ripeness within and between plants.

In conclusion, the automated classification of fruit ripeness has seen significant advancements in recent years, driven primarily by the emergence of deep learning techniques. These advancements hold promise for improving global food security and optimizing agricultural production. Efforts are ongoing to integrate non-destructive methods for in-field ripeness assessment with the goal of predicting yield and harvest dates, but significant challenges remain in addressing the variability of ripeness within and between plants.
