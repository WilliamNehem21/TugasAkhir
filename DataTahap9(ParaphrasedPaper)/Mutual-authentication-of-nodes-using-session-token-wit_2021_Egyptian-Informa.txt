The paper discusses the importance of ensuring the security and privacy of data exchanged between nodes in the context of token-based authentication. It emphasizes the benefits of using token-based authentication compared to traditional methods such as usernames and passwords, and highlights the significance of data authentication in wireless networks, particularly in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). The paper also presents a review of existing security protocols and mechanisms utilized in MANETs, along with proposing new methods for enhancing security and authentication in these networks, such as the use of HMAC, OTP-based security devices, and two-factor authentication.

Furthermore, the paper outlines the challenges and constraints related to security in MANETs and presents proposed solutions to address these issues. It also provides a detailed description of the proposed work, including its implementation and performance analysis, followed by a discussion of the results and potential future directions for research in this area.

S.S. Rajput et al. proposed a security-enhanced zone routing protocol (SEZRP) that employs message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure message privacy and utilizes pre-distribution to manage overhead due to key sharing. S. Neelavathy Pari et al. developed a trust model based on the SHA1 encryption method to identify and evade malicious nodes in the network. R. Dilli et al. utilized hashed message authentication codes (HMAC) to achieve data integrity and authentication in a hybrid routing method, leading to improved throughput and packet delivery but with increased end-to-end delay. In addition, OTP-based security devices and two-factor authentication (2FA) are discussed as alternative secure authentication approaches.

The paper presents a detailed discussion of the proposed work and its implementation, highlighting the use of OTPs and transaction IDs for message decryption and confirmation at the receiver end. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of various authentication mechanisms and security protocols in the context of MANETs and emphasizes the importance of robust security solutions in wireless networks.
