In the process of researching 2D modeling, numerous studies were found that focused on early feature detection and subsequent image matching. Many of the initial implementations proved effective under specific image conditions, but the primary challenge for these researchers was to achieve true invariant feature detection across various image attributes such as consistency, accuracy, and speed.

Later advancements in digital image recognition were centered on identifying corners and edges, with the seminal work of Harris and Stephens leading to the development of the Harris corner detector. While this method was successful in detecting robust features in images, it was limited by its inability to establish connectivity between feature points, hindering the extraction of higher-level descriptors like surfaces and objects. Subsequently, the fast (features from accelerated segment test) corner detector algorithm was introduced to address these shortcomings.

In response to these limitations, a new class of image matching algorithms known as texture-based algorithms emerged, allowing the matching of features across different images despite the presence of textured backgrounds and the absence of well-defined edges. Pioneering this approach was David Lowe, who introduced the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) for extracting distinctive invariant features from images. Lowe's SIFT algorithm was widely adopted for various applications such as image mosaic, recognition, and retrieval. Furthermore, other researchers, including Ke and Sukthankar, utilized principal component analysis (PCA) to normalize gradient patch and demonstrated the robustness of PCA-based local descriptors to image deformations. Subsequently, the speeded up robust features (SURF) algorithm was introduced, leveraging integral images for image convolutions and fast-Hessian detector to achieve faster and effective feature detection.

The SIFT algorithm comprises four major stages: scale-space detection, keypoint localization, orientation assignment, and keypoint descriptor. The algorithm's effectiveness in detecting feature points varied across different images, with different algorithms yielding distinct results. Notably, SIFT excelled in detecting feature points in textured images but performed less effectively in images with planar textures. Conversely, SURF exhibited confusion in textured images with illumination changes, leading to suboptimal performance in such scenarios.

Comparative analysis of the algorithms revealed that the F-SIFT algorithm exhibited the best overall performance, although it suffered from detecting fewer features and matches. To improve the performance of F-SIFT, it is recommended to refine the algorithm and enhance its feature detection capabilities while ensuring robustness. Furthermore, future research should focus on evaluating the accuracy of the algorithms in detecting single objects within a scene, addressing the gap between high-level semantic perception and low-level features of an image. Additionally, advancements in photogrammetric techniques could benefit from further exploration in this area, laying the groundwork for deeper research.
