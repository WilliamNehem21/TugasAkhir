This study supposes that there are two mechanisms influencing technical progress and economic growth in the short and long run: a short-run energy cost-driven technical application mechanism and a long-run energy risk-driven technical progress mechanism. The study uses Japanese monthly data from 1988 to 2010 to conduct Granger causality tests on four time series: energy price, import volume of crude oil, geographical dispersion of oil imports, and real industrial output. The findings indicate that energy price shocks can trigger both the technical application and technical progress mechanisms, leading to separate effects on short-run and long-run economic growth in a country with tight energy constraints. Additionally, the study reveals that the geographical dispersion of oil imports is primarily used to manage import volume risk, rather than energy price uncertainties.

Petroleum products have made up a significant portion of overall energy consumption, and as a result, changes in oil prices have had substantial impacts on the price fluctuations of other primary energy sources. Notably, increasing crude oil prices may have different effects on energy-abundant countries and energy-poor countries.

Energy-abundant countries may directly benefit from rising energy prices, as the additional income from oil exports can boost short-term GDP growth. However, the downside is that the easy oil export revenues may harm the incentives for technological progress in developing countries, leading to a long-term trap of low-productivity specialization or the so-called "curse of natural resources." Meanwhile, energy-poor countries, particularly industrialized oil importing countries, often suffer from increasing energy prices, which result in higher costs. The escalating energy costs may shift the aggregate supply curve leftward, leading to higher prices and lower production outputs. However, in the presence of a highly constricted energy supply, profit-maximizing private firms may have greater incentives to manage their energy costs through technological and operational innovation, resulting in endogenous cost-driven technological progress.

In the formula provided, 'm' represents oil import volume and 'k' denotes the country. A higher 'h' indicates that oil imports are more concentrated and riskier. Assuming second-degree price discrimination in the global oil market, a reduction in 'h' can diversify the risk but may lead to additional transaction costs.
