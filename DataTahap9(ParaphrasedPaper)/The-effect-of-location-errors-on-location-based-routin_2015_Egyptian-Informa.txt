This academic paper examines location-based routing protocols, which use position information to determine packet forwarding without requiring the exchange and maintenance of routing information. Unlike topological routing algorithms, these protocols operate nearly statelessly but are subject to potential errors in the obtained location estimates. The study focuses on investigating the power consumption of two routing protocols, Geraf and MECF, designed for wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks. Additionally, the paper develops a mathematical model based on Gaussian distribution to characterize the impact of localization errors on the power consumption of location-based routing protocols. The model's validity is verified through simulations of the power consumption of the two routing protocols. The research emphasizes the impact of localization errors on location-based routing in wireless ad-hoc networks and presents an analysis based on circularly symmetric error characteristics of the localization algorithm. The paper also discusses the simulation of specific protocol descriptions and examines the packet delivery ratio and power consumption. The evaluation of the power consumption of the routing protocols is performed through simulations in MATLAB under different scenarios, including cases with and without location errors. The study highlights the power consumption of routing protocols and their relation to location errors, with a focus on Geraf's routing operation while omitting the complex mechanisms associated with the MAC layer.
