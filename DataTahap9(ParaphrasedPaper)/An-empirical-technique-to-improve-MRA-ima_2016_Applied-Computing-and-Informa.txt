Kim and Park have introduced a novel method for segmenting the carotid artery using MRA slices, based on a local adaptive thresholding approach. This method automatically calculates the threshold value by taking into account the midpoint between the maximum and minimum gray levels of only the first slice. Furthermore, the application of the computed threshold value filters the first slice, dividing it into two subregions based on the anatomical structure of the left and right carotid arteries. Seed points for each subregion are determined, and their eight connecting neighbors are labeled to obtain the region of interest.

Priyadharshini and Anitha utilized a region growing algorithm to detect glaucoma in the eye. Their technique incorporated pre-processing imaging methods and morphological operations such as dilation and erosion, with the addition of a median filter. This approach demonstrated improved performance in terms of image quality and edge preservation compared to traditional thresholding techniques.

In this study, we proposed several enhancements to the region growing algorithm, including the determination of an appropriate threshold value for each slice, seed point calculation, and the selection of the starting slice number. Additionally, we developed a two-pass algorithm for identifying grayscale 8-connected neighbors. We integrated these components into the region growing algorithm and evaluated the system's performance in terms of image enhancement. The region growing algorithm employed in our proposed system is derived from these advancements.
