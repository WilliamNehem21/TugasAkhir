The method described in the paper is not tied to any specific process calculus and explicitly delineates the various components involved in the design of such calculi. This includes distinctly separating the structural aspects of the underlying behavior model, such as active versus reactive and deterministic versus non-deterministic dichotomies, from the interaction structure that defines the synchronization discipline.

Furthermore, the paper introduces the concept of the "sort" of a process p, which refers to all the labels that appear in at least one derivation of p and is denoted by l(p). It proposes a syntactic criterion for approximating l(p) by induction on the process expression, while also suggesting a semantic definition for the same.
