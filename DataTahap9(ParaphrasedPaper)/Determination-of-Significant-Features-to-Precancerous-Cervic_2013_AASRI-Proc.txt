The authors of this academic paper aim to analyze processed images in order to identify patterns and classify cervix lesions for diagnostic purposes. They used supervised classification techniques of data mining to examine the resulting attributes of the image processing.

The existing literature discusses various works related to feature selection methods, including search techniques, applications in classification, comparisons, clustering, introduction of new methods, and combinations of these approaches. In the medical field, Martin et al. applied feature selection methods available in Weka to assess the nutritional status of children aged 6 to 11 years, while Balakrishnan attempted to identify an optimal feature subset of the Pima Indian diabetes dataset. Guyon et al. focused on selecting a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data recorded on DNA microarrays. These studies share the common goal of comparing attribute selection methods' performance with the results obtained by learning algorithms to determine which method significantly improves results across diverse situations and high or low dimensionalities.

The experiments conducted in this study showed that the ladtree decision tree achieved an 86.67% correct classification for lugol's iodine images in the sick class, while the metaclassifier adaboostm1 and reptree decision tree provided an 89.47% correct classification for acetic acid images in the sick class.
