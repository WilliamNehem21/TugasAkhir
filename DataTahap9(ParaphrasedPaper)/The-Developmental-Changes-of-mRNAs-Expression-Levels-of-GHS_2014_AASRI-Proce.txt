The expression of ghsr mRNA has been investigated using in situ hybridization or an RNase protection assay, primarily in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and in the pituitary. The main role of ghsr is to stimulate growth hormone (GH) secretion and release in conjunction with GHS, which is closely associated with animal growth.

Statistically significant differences are indicated with letters (capital for Xinjiang and lower case for Kazak), and means without a common superscript denote significant differences (p<0.05) between ages within the same breed. Double stars (**) indicate extreme differences (p<0.05) between breeds at the same age.

Sensitivity of arc ghsr expression to modulation by GH suggests that GHS-Rs may be involved in the feedback regulation of GH. Research by Shuto et al. (2002) involved creating transgenic (TG) rats expressing antisense ghsr mRNA, which resulted in lower body weight and reduced adipose tissue compared to control rats. Additionally, the stimulatory effect of GHS treatment on feeding was abolished, and daily food intake was reduced in TG rats. The ghsr gene is located on human chromosome 3q26, within multiple phenotypes linked to a quantitative trait locus strongly associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Baessler et al. (2005) found that common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes within the ghsr gene region were involved in the pathogenesis of human obesity. These findings suggest that ghsr is involved in the regulation of GH secretion, adiposity, and food intake, highlighting the potential utility of studying the developmental changes in sheep ghsr mRNA expression for exploring sheep growth and development and the regulatory mechanisms.

The current study revealed that the hypothalamic ghsr mRNA expression level increased initially and then declined with growth in both breeds, with the expression in Kazak sheep being significantly lower than that of Xinjiang fine wool sheep from day 60 to 90. The pituitary ghsr expression level in Kazak sheep was significantly higher than that in Xinjiang fine wool sheep from day 2 to 90, which paralleled the difference in body weight between the two breeds in the early growth period. The mRNA expression level of pituitary ghsr increased with growth in both breeds and was highly positively correlated with the cumulative growth curves, suggesting that ghsr played a role in sheep growth.

An endogenous ligand of ghsr, ghrelin, was found in rat stomach tissue and was shown to stimulate the release of growth hormone (GH) upon binding to ghsr. Furthermore, it was established that ghrelin plays a role in weight regulation, as its administration increased food intake and led to fat and weight gain in rodents. Research by Huang Zhi Guo et al. (2006) studied the hypothalamic and pituitary distribution and developmental changes of ghrelin mRNA expression in sheep and found that ghrelin mRNA was most abundant in the abomasum and increased steadily during the early growth period. This study also found that sheep pituitary ghsr mRNA expression level was highly positively correlated with abomasum ghrelin mRNA expression level, indicating that it may be pituitary ghsr, and not hypothalamic ghsr, through which ghrelin influences sheep growth.
