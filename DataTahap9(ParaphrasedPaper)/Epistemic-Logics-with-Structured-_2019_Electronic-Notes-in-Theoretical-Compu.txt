Some research uses epistemic models with structured states [1,16]. One such model introduces a multi-agent epistemic logic where states are positions in rn and the accessibility relations represent possible states compatible with the current one. Additionally, other works [16,26,27] present (dynamic) epistemic logics based on the notion of visibility or observability of propositional variables, where some variables are observable and others are not.

Example 3.4, adapted from a source, illustrates a scenario where a father has three envelopes, each containing 0, 1, and 2 dollars respectively. The father has three children - Anna, Bob, and Clara - and each child receives one envelope without knowing the contents of the other children's envelopes.
