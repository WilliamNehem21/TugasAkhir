Considerable efforts have been devoted to automating the grading and sorting of mangoes based on their external attributes, including shape, size, color, weight, and defects. Khoje and Shrikant (2012) have conducted work on grading mangoes using shape features such as region-based and contour-based methods, as well as wavelet descriptors. Additionally, Khoje and Shrikant (2013) have employed feed-forward neural networks and support vector machines to grade mangoes based on their size features. Other research has addressed the identification of external defects on mangoes using texture features (Musale and Pradeep, 2014; Pauly and Deepa, 2015).

In addition to the aforementioned attributes, ripeness is also considered in the grading of mangoes. The ripening process primarily involves changes in skin color and texture, regardless of the ripening method used. In this study, color features from various color spaces, such as RGB, L*a*b, HSV, CMY, and YCbCr, were extracted to represent each stage of mango ripeness. Four color features were extracted from each color space, including individual channel features (e.g., R, G, B) and their fusion. The study also employed a hierarchical method of classification, involving the evaluation of different classifiers and color features to optimize the grading system's performance. The findings highlighted the significance of L*a*b color space features in discriminating different classes of Alphonso mango variety. The study demonstrated the superior performance of the hierarchical approach compared to a single-shot multiclass approach and identified SVM and simple threshold classifiers as particularly effective.

The success of this study in post-harvest management of Alphonso mangoes has led to the recommendation for further studies on other mango varieties, in addition to considering additional parameters such as store time, temperature, and moisture. The proposed classification method has the potential for offline application in post-harvesting management of mangoes.
