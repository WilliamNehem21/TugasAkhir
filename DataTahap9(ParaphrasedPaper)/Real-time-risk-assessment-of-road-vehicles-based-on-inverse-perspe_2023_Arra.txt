Intelligent traffic monitoring systems are commonly employed in various traffic scenarios such as highways, urban roads, tunnels, and bridges, and their extensive usage is attributed to the integration and advancement of different technologies such as pattern recognition, video image processing, and network communication. Nevertheless, these systems face significant challenges in complex traffic monitoring scenarios and adverse weather conditions.

An approach is proposed in this study to analyze road vehicle risk in real time using a method based on camera inverse perspective transformation, which considers complex traffic scenarios. Firstly, the method involves camera calibration and utilizes the camera-to-road inverse perspective transformation to obtain the actual position information of vehicles by projecting the image plane onto the road surface. Subsequently, vehicle speed measurement and real-time risk assessment are achieved by calculating the average of instantaneous velocities across multiple frames. This method determines the vehicle risk value by analyzing the relative speeds and distances between vehicles in complex traffic scenarios.

In order to complete the camera calibration process, accurate detection of broken and solid lines on the road is required. The method also involves adjusting the focal length value until the minimum error distance is achieved, thereby completing the camera calibration.

The study also discusses the fundamental elements of traffic, including traffic flow rate, vehicle speed, and traffic density. Furthermore, it emphasizes the methodology for measuring vehicle speed and the importance of accurately assessing road risk values based on road segments in real-time monitoring of changes in road risk conditions and predicting future traffic situations.

Additionally, the study discusses the detection and tracking of vehicle targets using deep learning YOLO detection algorithm and optical flow tracking algorithm in trunk road and highway scenes. The proposed vehicle risk assessment calculation method is shown to reflect the real-time road safety situation through simulations, which can be valuable for traffic management authorities in formulating effective traffic management strategies to reduce the occurrence rate of road accidents. However, it is noted that a single camera's effective field of view is typically within 200 m, and connecting vehicle trajectories across cameras is required to achieve complete risk monitoring coverage of a road section.
