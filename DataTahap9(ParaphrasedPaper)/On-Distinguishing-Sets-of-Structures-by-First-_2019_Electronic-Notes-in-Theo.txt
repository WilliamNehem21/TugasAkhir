A new algorithm is introduced in this paper to address the challenge of identifying a formula with the smallest quantifier rank that distinguishes two sets of structures using any vocabulary. The algorithm incorporates Hintikka formulas as a crucial component and operates efficiently for arbitrary finite relational structures, albeit at an exponential time cost. It has been applied in the development of a comprehensive system for learning formulas that define rules for board games and for reduction finding. Furthermore, a variation of the problem that involves considering samples of classified strings is defined by the authors.

The paper also presents necessary and sufficient conditions for a winning strategy for the players in an EF game on certain classes. Specifically, the authors provide a characterization of the winning strategies for both players, and then utilize these results to devise an algorithm for identifying a sentence with minimal quantifier rank that aligns with the sample. Additionally, the EF-similarity for certain classes can be computed in polynomial time with respect to the size of the structures. Consequently, the algorithm runs in polynomial time with respect to the size of the sample, representing an improvement for these specific classes.

Furthermore, the paper discusses a new logical framework for finding a formula given a sample, utilizing a model-theoretic approach. This framework differs from existing approaches by considering a sample comprising multiple structures that are classified as positive or negative. Another logical framework, namely Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), is also mentioned, but it is noted that ILP and the approach proposed in the paper differ fundamentally, and techniques from ILP cannot be readily applied to the proposed approach.

EF games are highlighted as a source of information about the similarity between structures, and the paper demonstrates the PSPACE-completeness of the problem of determining whether the spoiler has a winning strategy in an EF game. The significance of EF games on a specific class of structures to the proposed framework is emphasized, and the authors utilize the conditions characterizing winning strategies for the spoiler to define distinguishability sentences.

The paper concludes by outlining the plan for extending the approach to other logics, such as monadic second-order logic, and highlights the potential application of an algorithm that returns monadic second-order sentences consistent with a given sample of strings in the problem of finding a model of a regular language consistent with a given sample of strings.
