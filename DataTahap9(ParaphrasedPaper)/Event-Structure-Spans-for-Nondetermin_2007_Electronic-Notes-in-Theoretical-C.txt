The example provided is similar to the one outlined in the academic paper. In this example, a1 represents a nondeterministic process that can either output a token and halt, or output a token, await an input token, and then output another token. On the other hand, a2 represents a process that can either output a token and halt, or wait for an input token and then output two tokens. Both a1 and a2 have equivalent input-output relationships when it comes to sequences of tokens.
