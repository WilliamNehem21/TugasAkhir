Python is a language that blurs the line between programming and scripting, incorporating features like tuples, arrays, lists, dictionaries, string pattern matching using regular expression notation, as well as other capabilities influenced by languages such as Perl and Miranda. It offers a clean and concise syntax, as well as strong feature integration, with a small but powerful core language and a rich module library providing high-level functionality.

In comparison, a Java program solving the same problem would be less concise, containing redundant type information and being clumsy in string pattern matching. Despite these differences, modern scripting languages like Python are assimilating programming language principles and features, while scripting languages continue to favor dynamic typing and implicit variable declarations.

The convergence between programming and scripting languages is desirable as it combines the advantages of both. Main obstacles to complete convergence include the issue of static versus dynamic typing, with static typing enabling compilers to certify absence of type errors and to generate efficient object code, and dynamic typing providing essential flexibility in many scripting applications.

Object-oriented languages support a measure of dynamic typing and can combine static and dynamic typing smoothly. Java 5 has largely addressed its weaknesses by introducing generic classes, although limitations such as the inability to instantiate generic classes at primitive types exist.

There's a desire to allow some generic classes to be covariant, and different translation methods exist for generic classes, including type-erasing translation, which represents all objects of type arguments as objects of a non-generic class, and specializing translation, which translates each instantiation of a generic class to a distinct non-generic class, with type argument information encoded in the names of the generated classes.
