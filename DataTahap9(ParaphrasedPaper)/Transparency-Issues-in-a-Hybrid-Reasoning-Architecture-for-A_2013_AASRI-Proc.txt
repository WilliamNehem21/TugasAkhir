In a smart home healthcare setting, a body area network (BAN) gathers direct information about an individual, while home environmental sensors collect data about the surroundings and the person's potential situation. The system utilizes various wireless communication protocols, such as Bluetooth and Zigbee, to receive sensor data. Remote monitoring services, data mining services, and real-time reasoning services operate concurrently. The current system employs a hybrid reasoning framework that combines case-based reasoning and fuzzy rule-based reasoning to enhance its reasoning capabilities, but as the case base grows, the efficiency of case-based reasoning diminishes. Consequently, a cloud-based solution is proposed to alleviate the burden on resource-constrained clients. This study highlights the transparency issues associated with using such advanced techniques in a healthcare system. In this context, transparency and clarity are crucial, particularly in a system aiming to provide intelligent services for individuals in critical situations.

The hybrid architecture processes contextual information from sensors and other sources using both case-based reasoning and a fuzzy logic-based rule engine. Fuzzy logic rules complement case-based reasoning by providing expert insights and the ability to disambiguate cases using domain knowledge. To enhance transparency, rules are described using linguistic terms and user-friendly range-type values derived from expert knowledge. For instance, a rule might state "if the room temperature is very low and the room is occupied, then turn on the heater." Fuzzy logic allows the system to handle imperfect data and apply rules to draw conclusions. However, the complexity of fuzzy logic could pose challenges for both the subject and caregiver, making transparency and clarity critical concerns.

The hybrid reasoning architecture integrates both rule-based and case-based reasoning, making the system more resilient and adaptable to changes by continuously retraining with new cases. Transparency is an important issue for both reasoning methods. In the rule-based approach, the goal is to make the rules transparent enough for the subject or caregiver to review and possibly modify them, achieved through the use of structured natural language and incorporation of fuzzy logic. Similarly, transparency and clarity in interpreting the results of case-based reasoning are essential, necessitating a critical analysis of test results and the use of appropriate metrics.
