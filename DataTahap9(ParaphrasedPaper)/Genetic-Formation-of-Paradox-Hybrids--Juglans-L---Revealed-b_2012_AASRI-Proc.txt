The Juglans sect. Rhysocaryon, comprising 16 black walnut species, is remarkable within the angiosperms due to its unique distribution across continents and islands within the Americas. This suggests promise for its potential utilization in crop improvement of the Persian walnut (J. regia of sect. Juglans, commonly used for nut production), high-quality wood for cabinetry, and agroforestry applications for restoring degraded areas such as cloud forests. Consequently, a comprehensive investigation into this paradox would be beneficial for walnut breeding and the commercial industry.
