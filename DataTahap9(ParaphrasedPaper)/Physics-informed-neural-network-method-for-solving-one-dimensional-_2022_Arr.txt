The use of automatic differentiation has gained attention for optimization and control problems in various fields such as education, media, power, and healthcare. Even for problems with analytical solutions, there may be difficulties due to fixed constants. Python is a widely used language with a broad range of application packages and features that simplify program development and documentation. While it may not be suitable for extensive computational computations, precompiled library routines can be invoked for such tasks. In computational fluid dynamics, specific boundaries such as walls, inflows, and outflows may be required, and the approach for handling these boundaries differs slightly from traditional methods like finite difference or finite elements. The use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can offer improved resolution of discontinuities but may introduce oscillations, leading to a net reduction in error. It has been observed that PINNs can potentially enhance the solution for problems with significant discontinuities. An analysis of error ratios across different discontinuity widths in specific time intervals has revealed that larger discontinuities result in lower error ratios. Anomalous oscillations have been observed in solutions obtained using different numerical methods such as Lax Friedrich, FTBS, and Lax Wendroff.
