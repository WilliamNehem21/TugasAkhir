The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explores prior research in the field. Section 3 outlines the suggested methodology. Section 4 offers an examination and comparison of apps designed for hajj and umrah. Section 5 presents the outcomes of the app assessment. Section 6 concludes the paper.


The goal is to gather and assess evidence related to the automated testing of mobile applications. Usability is measured in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction, while attributes like cognitive load are not included. Emphasizing the constraints of existing usability models for mobile devices, Rachel et al introduced a new usability model named "people at the center of mobile application development".


Scholars have also scrutinized mobile applications in specific domains. A variety of mobile applications have been created for health-related purposes, such as cardiology, heart failure symptoms, and diabetes. Boudreaux et al proposed seven strategies for evaluating and selecting health-related applications in a separate study.


The subsequent section outlines a case study involving ten apps selected based on specific criteria. A questionnaire, employing mobile app rating scale evaluation criteria, is distributed to multiple participants. The participants contributing to the study come from diverse backgrounds, with varying levels of experience and education, thereby enhancing the evaluation. The questionnaire data is collected for statistical analysis, and the resulting findings are then reported.
