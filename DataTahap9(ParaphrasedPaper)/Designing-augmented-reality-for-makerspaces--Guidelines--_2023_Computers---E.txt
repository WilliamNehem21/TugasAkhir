Simultaneously, augmented reality (AR) technology, which integrates physical objects with virtual information, is increasingly being utilized in educational settings, demonstrating potential to enrich learning and collaboration in open-ended environments. Due to its suitability for supporting and enhancing activities in makerspaces, the number of AR applications in these contexts is expected to increase (Radu, Joy, & Schneider, 2021). 

Several projects and research studies have showcased the potential of AR technology for learning with physical objects, indicating that AR can enhance task efficiency, decrease cognitive load, improve comprehension, and foster collaboration (Huang, Kestin, Shah, & Schneider, 2022; Radu & Schneider, 2022; Kyjanek, Al Bahar, Vasey, Wannemacher, & Menges, 2019; Fidan & Tuncel, 2019; Song, 2020). However, while these investigations demonstrate the promise of AR technology in open-ended, collaborative environments, they often do not provide explicit design guidelines, making the development of AR applications tailored to such complex environments costly and time-consuming. The estimated cost of developing an AR application ranges from $50,000 to $250,000 (Berman & Pollack, 2021), posing a potential barrier to reaping the benefits of AR. 

Certain considerations need to be taken into account to ensure that AR is a suitable technology for the intended purpose, such as using AR to access phenomena that are challenging to observe, rather than merely for its novelty, and ensuring that tangible objects are augmented. In educational contexts, guidelines recommend using AR to visualize complex or unseen topics, concretize abstract concepts, incorporate narratives and scaffolded problems, and leverage physicality to empower existing curricula (Dunleavy, 2014; Laine, 2018; Radu, 2014; Rose, 2021).

Our research team has been investigating various possibilities of AR applications for makerspace environments over the past 5+ years. Through the development of projects involving headset-based AR, such as Microsoft HoloLens, we have conducted experimental studies in controlled laboratories and natural settings to assess the impact of AR technology on student learning, collaboration, and affect. Based on our findings, we have derived a set of best practices for designing effective AR experiences. These findings are synthesized into guidelines and tensions for designers to consider when developing AR systems in open-ended learning environments. The guidelines are a result of reflecting on our personal experiences as designers, user feedback, qualitative observations, and quantitative results from each study (Qt: quantitative findings; Ql: qualitative observations; Pt: lessons learned during pilot studies; Fd: user feedback). 

The paper details 14 design guidelines for creating AR systems in makerspace environments, offering recommendations on supporting social collaboration, integrating virtual content with physical objects, enhancing conceptual understanding, and improving usability. These guidelines are intended to assist designers in making informed decisions when considering the use of AR in various open-ended learning environments, such as factory settings, hands-on lab sessions, professional workshops, and engineering contexts. 

One of the main tensions that designers need to navigate is the amount of AR visuals displayed, as they need to be mindful of avoiding visual overload while utilizing AR to its full potential. Another trade-off is the level of agency given to users, with a balance needed between providing enough scaffolding and allowing user freedom to explore and interact with the AR content. 

The paper also acknowledges the limitations of the guidelines, emphasizing the need for further research in different contexts to generalize the results and refine the guidelines to accommodate future advancements in AR technologies and learning environments. Finally, it is clarified that the data used in the study is confidential and adheres to ethical guidelines approved by the university's institutional review board.
