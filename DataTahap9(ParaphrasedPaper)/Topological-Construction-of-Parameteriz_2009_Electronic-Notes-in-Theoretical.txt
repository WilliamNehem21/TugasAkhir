This paper aims to expand the strong bisimulation topology to a set of parameterized bisimulation limit topologies. By utilizing parameterized limit bisimulation, we establish topological structures that allow for the comprehension and analysis of infinite evolution. These structures are entirely determined by process behaviors and are therefore completely extensional and observable. We concentrate on exploring the subnet closure, tail closure, natural extension, and iteration structure of parameterized limit bisimulation.

The upcoming section focuses on the topological characteristics of parameterized limit bisimulation, specifically emphasizing subnet closure, tail closure, natural extension, and iteration structure. Understanding these properties is crucial for comprehending the infinite evolution of parameterized limit bisimulation from a mathematical perspective.

Given the dependence of process execution on its environment, a certain determinacy must be imposed on the involved processes to extend the notion of iden to parameterized limit bisimulation.

In the subsequent subsection, we introduce a specialized structure of parameterized limit bisimulation, demonstrating that the composition of two parameterized limit bisimulations is also a parameterized limit bisimulation. This proposition holds significance in the composite execution of certain programs. To simplify matters, the definition of product directed set is primarily derived from.

It is well-known that a topology can be derived from an existing convergence structure. This section is dedicated to constructing a collection of parameterized bisimulation limit topologies based on parameterized bisimulation limits. One of the key outcomes of this work is Proposition 4.2, which asserts that the parameterized bisimulation limit yields a convergence class and subsequently leads to a topology on processes.
