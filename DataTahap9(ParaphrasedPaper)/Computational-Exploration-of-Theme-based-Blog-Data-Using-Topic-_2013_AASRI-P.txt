The abundance of blog posts and comments on blogging sites becomes more compelling when considering the user profile statistics. Research by blogging.org estimated that approximately 60% of bloggers are hobbyists (infographic, 2012), driven not by business or professional motives but by a voluntary desire to write about a wide range of topics, including politics, religion, and society. While the ease of creating blog posts, low barriers to publication, and open standards of content generation contribute to the popularity of blogging, it is the urge for expression and the availability of a convenient platform that have led to the substantial growth and scale of the blogosphere.

An aspect of the blogosphere that has received relatively little attention until recently is its potential as a rich and unique resource for cross-cultural psychological and sociological analysis. This paper presents our computational exploration of blog text data with this broader objective. Section 2 outlines the motivation for this work, while section 3 describes the computational framework we utilized. Section 4 provides details on dataset collection and properties, and section 5 presents the comprehensive experimental setup and results. The paper concludes with a summary of observations in section 6.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a statistical method that utilizes a generative process to model topics as distributions over a fixed vocabulary. This method assumes that documents are generated by these topics, with each document exhibiting these topics in varying proportions. A well-implemented topic modeling algorithm can reveal the thematic structure of the document collection. In addition to LDA, other variants of topic models include the Bayesian non-parametric topic model, dynamic topic model, and correlated topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2009).
