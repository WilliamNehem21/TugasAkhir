The regulation governs the manner in which a clock moves to its subsequent state, either a normal operational state clock(t, c) or a malfunctioning state broken(t, c), with t denoting the current time and c representing the current battery charge. The clock's battery charge diminishes as it ticks. Whether the clock switches to an operational or broken state depends on the outcome of a Bernoulli trial using a new variable, b, with a success probability of c/1000.0. Since the likelihood of success in a Bernoulli trial is proportional to the current battery charge, the clock becomes more likely to fail as time passes and the battery charge diminishes.

As previously discussed, the Dolev-Yao model is unsuitable for analyzing denial of service (DoS) properties. A more fitting model for this purpose is the shared channel model. In this model, attackers and legitimate clients probabilistically share a communication channel to the server. Unlike the Dolev-Yao model, an attacker does not possess full control over the channel. However, an attacker may replay altered or fabricated versions of previously observed legitimate packets at a specified maximum rate within the model.

When a client receives an acknowledgment message [crec, cdscrd] while in the waiting state, the client processes the message and shifts its status to connected. Accepted clients do not transmit new messages. If an acknowledgment is received while the client has already been accepted or failed, the acknowledgment message is simply discarded.

We have utilized the aforementioned ASV model to conduct statistical quantitative model checking analysis of various QUATEX formulas using Vesta. Vesta executes Monte Carlo simulations on the model through its interface with Maude to generate a point estimate of the quantity of interest for each of these formulas, based on a desired confidence interval for the experiment and its maximum tolerable size. We also specify the nature of the quantities to be statistically estimated, which are declared as QUATEX formulas.

In addition, we set the mean server processing rate (s) to 600 packets per time unit, the server and client timeouts (ts and tc) to 0.4 time units, and the initial generation delay (initdelay) to 0.2 time units, unless otherwise indicated.

Regarding denial of service (DoS) attacks, our approach is founded on probabilistic rewrite theories, quantitative probabilistic temporal logic QUATEX formulas, and statistical model checking, and is supported by tools such as Maude and Vesta. We have applied this approach to formally specifying and verifying the ASV DOS-resistant protocol, thereby enhancing our confidence in the availability properties that were previously analyzed for ASV using either manual analytic proofs or simulation.
