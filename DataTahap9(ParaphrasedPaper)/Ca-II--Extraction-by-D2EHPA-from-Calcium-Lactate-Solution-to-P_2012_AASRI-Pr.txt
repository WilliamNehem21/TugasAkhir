This research paper introduces a novel solvent extraction method for removing calcium ions from calcium lactate to produce lactic acid, which is a valuable chemical commodity used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Traditionally, lactic acid is produced through bacterial fermentation, but this study explores an alternative method of separating lactic acid by extracting cations from calcium lactate solution using di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA), while leaving lactic acid in the aqueous phase. The study investigates the effects of various parameters, such as the composition of the organic phase, phase ratio, temperature, and calcium concentration, on the extraction yield. Additionally, the study focuses on optimizing the extraction conditions and gaining insights into the kinetic mechanism of the process.

The materials used in the study included calcium lactate, D2EHPA, 1-octanol, 2-octanol, iso-octanol, and aromatic free kerosene. Experiments were carried out using a 250 ml conical flask, and the aqueous and organic phases were shaken for 5 minutes at a constant temperature on a magnetic stirring apparatus. The phase separations were performed in 250 ml separatory funnels. The research also discusses the construction and working procedure of the Lewis cell used in the investigation.

The study investigates the influences of D2EHPA volume fraction, modifiers, phase ratio, temperature, and calcium concentration. The optimal conditions for the extraction by D2EHPA were found to be a reaction temperature of 323 K, a phase ratio of 4:1, an initial calcium concentration of 1.03 mol L-1, a D2EHPA volume fraction of 40%, and the addition of 5% 1-octanol as modifiers. Under these conditions, the extraction rate reached 91%, and the concentration of H+ reached 1.4 mol L-1.

In summary, this research presents a new technique for the extraction of lactic acid from calcium lactate solution, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional solvent extraction methods and provide an efficient and environmentally friendly approach to lactic acid production.
