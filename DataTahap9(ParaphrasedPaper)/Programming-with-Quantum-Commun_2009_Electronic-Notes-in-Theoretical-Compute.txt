The term quantum communication denotes the process of moving a quantum state between different physical locations. This can be achieved through either sending a quantum bit over a quantum communication channel, similar to classical communication, or utilizing a classical communication channel with entangled states and applying quantum operations locallyâ€”an approach without a classical counterpart. The field of computer science known as program development, or programming methodology, involves the application of mathematics and logic to software engineering tasks, with formal methods providing tools for expressing specifications, proving implementation correctness, and reasoning about various properties. This paper analyzes quantum communication protocols based on quantum predicative programming, an extension of established predicative programming, which allows for proving the correctness of each programming step as it is made. The framework supports the writing of classical and quantum specifications, developing corresponding quantum programs, and reasoning about their time, space, and communication complexity within the same framework.

Section 2 provides a brief introduction to quantum predicative programming, while the main contribution of this work is presented in Section 3, introducing a formal framework for specifying, implementing, and analyzing quantum communication protocols and providing an analysis of two such protocols: quantum teleportation and quantum dense coding. Section 4 outlines conclusions and future research directions.

Additionally, the paper discusses the concept of probability and distribution, describes the process and precautions for defining a quantum communication channel, and introduces the basic concepts of quantum mechanics as they relate to quantum systems for quantum computation. The provided formal framework is not limited to reasoning about the data sent or received during the execution of the protocol, but also includes tools for formally proving the complexity of communication protocols, such as the number of classical and quantum bits sent during execution.
