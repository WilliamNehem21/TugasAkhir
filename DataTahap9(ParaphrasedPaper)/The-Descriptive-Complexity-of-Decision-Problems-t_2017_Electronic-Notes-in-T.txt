This paper presents a generalized framework for fixed-point logics, wherein relations are used instead of operators to accommodate the concept of nondeterminism. The primary concept involves the utilization of loops within a relation in place of fixed points of a function. Specifically, a point x is considered a fixed-point of the relation r if the pair (x, x) is a member of r. The authors introduce the concept of initial fixed-point of an inflationary relation r and the corresponding operator rifp. They define rifp as a first-order logic incorporating the inflationary relational fixed-point operator rifp and demonstrate its capability to capture the polynomial hierarchy through translation to second-order logic. Additionally, they explore a fragment of rifp, referred to as rifp1, which imposes a restriction allowing the rifp operator to be applied only once, and show that rifp1 captures the complexity class NP. The paper also offers a comparison between rifp and the nondeterministic fixed-point logic proposed by Abiteboul, Vianu, and Vardi.

The paper discusses the link between complexity classes and logical languages, indicating that problems within a complexity class can be defined by sentences of a particular language. This connection bridges finite model theory and complexity theory, offering the potential to leverage methods and findings from one field to address problems in the other. The authors note that such associations enable the exploration of relationships between logical and computational resources.

Furthermore, the paper highlights the connection between database theory and finite model theory, particularly in the context of the relational model of databases introduced by Codd. It emphasizes the growing interest in logical languages and their associated semantics as crucial theoretical underpinnings for database theory and query processing. The authors suggest that techniques from model theory can be effectively applied in this context.

The paper also addresses the complexity of decision problems expressed in various logics, emphasizing that the set of finite models derived from a logic's sentence defines a decision problem. The authors provide insights into the complexities of several logics, such as the correspondence of first-order logic with the logarithmic-time hierarchy.

Moreover, the paper outlines the fundamentals of fixed-point theory and logics, introduces important concepts related to relational fixed-point theory, and presents the relational inflationary fixed-point logic (rifp) along with its syntax and semantics. The authors demonstrate how problems can be expressed in this logic and illustrate its ability to capture the polynomial hierarchy complexity class through translation to second-order logic. They also define a fragment of rifp logic called rifp1 and show that it captures the complexity class NP. Additionally, the paper provides a comparison between rifp and nifp, a logic proposed by Abiteboul, Vianu, and Vardi. Finally, the authors conclude the work and highlight potential future research directions.
