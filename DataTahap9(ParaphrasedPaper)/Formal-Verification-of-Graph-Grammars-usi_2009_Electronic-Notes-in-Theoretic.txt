The paper defines a translation of object-based graph grammars (OBGG) to the Promela language for verification using the SPIN model checker. It also presents an approach to verify a timed extension of graph grammars, enabling the automatic verification of real-time systems using the UPPAAL model checker. The paper discusses different approaches for model-checking other types of graph grammars, covering logical languages, monadic second-order logic, relational logic, set theory, and alloy modeling. It also proposes a relational and logical approach to graph grammars to facilitate the analysis of asynchronous distributed systems with infinite state space. The main goal of the work is to enable the use of theorem proving techniques to establish properties about graph grammars, particularly properties related to reachable states. The paper concludes by outlining plans to extend the proposed approach to specific classes of graph grammars, such as object-based graph grammars and timed object-based graph grammars, and to implement the approach using tools like the Isabelle theorem prover.
