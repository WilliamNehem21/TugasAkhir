Instead of focusing on gesture recognition, this study examines contact control methods used in human-robot interaction, particularly in environments where direct human contact may not be feasible. It suggests that noncontact tele-control methods are better suited for such scenarios, and cites examples of mechanical, optical tracking, and vision-based master-slave devices and teleoperation systems developed for robotic systems. The study also discusses the use of data gloves in hand gesture recognition, as well as the challenges and limitations associated with them, such as high cost and the inability to track hand position. Additionally, the paper explores the use of vision-based methods for hand tracking and gesture recognition, noting the impact of lighting and background conditions on gesture recognition performance and discussing methods to improve recognition accuracy. Furthermore, it evaluates the leapmotion sensor as a non-contact finger/hand tracking device and discusses its applications in robot manipulation. The study then introduces a multi-leapmotion hand tracking system developed to address the limitations of single leapmotion devices and presents an algorithm to calibrate the delay and combine data from two leapmotion sensors to improve hand tracking and gesture recognition stability. Finally, it outlines functional experiments and a scenario demonstration to illustrate the proposed system's application in a robotic environment.
