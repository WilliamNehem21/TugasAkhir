We are all aware of how punctuation helps readers differentiate between interrogative and declarative sentences. In a similar vein, the technical writer, serving as an expert in tailoring information, can make effective use of an appropriate visual representation provided by the annotation system to explicitly convey the concepts of GCP and LCP. In some respects, CTML can be characterized as a communicative traffic control system.

CTML is centered on the idea that communication can be improved and mutually regulated through the visual processing of text. It begins with a visible overall organization of text and culminates in the actual language of the text, drawing on cognitive research to elucidate how our minds comprehend, process, and communicate knowledge.

The term "describe," derived from the Latin "describo," refers to the act of complementing the original sentence with additional information that may be of interest, without specific constraints. This is represented by a spiral, starting from the central point indicating the original sentence and expanding outward at various degrees, connecting it with other relevant sentences from different sources to aid interpretation.

"Explain," stemming from the Latin "explano" meaning "unwrap" or "open up," involves providing facts and reasons to support the interpretation of a specific event within a sentence. This can involve indicating the originating cause and then showing the effects, or vice versa, depending on which is more significant.

The term "regress," from the Latin "regredior," meaning "go back," indicates the need for further in-depth information about a specific topic presented within a sentence to gain a deeper understanding. It entails a focused process of information expansion and is activated only for that precise topic, allowing the reader to consider whether additional information is required and to inquire about further resources.

"Express," coming from the Latin "exprimo" meaning "push out" or "press out," involves adding personal opinions and individual feelings related to facts and events within a sentence. It represents the most subjective form of information packaging, inherently tied to personal evaluations, judgments, and emotional states.
