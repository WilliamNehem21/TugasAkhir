The paper introduces novel technological advancements to enhance percutaneous cryoablation procedures, consisting of a planning software and a simulation algorithm. The planning software is designed to determine a viable positioning of the tools to ensure effective lesion ablation while complying with specific procedural constraints. Using intra-operative CT scans, a virtual model of the anatomical site is created and utilized to compute the displacement of cryoprobes, aiming to cover the entire tumor volume with an iceball while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Conversely, the simulation algorithm serves as a graphical tool to analyze temperature distribution throughout the procedure's progression. It employs a discrete iterative function to calculate heat transfer from the probes to the surrounding tissue within a three-dimensional grid, enabling the identification of significant isotherms to determine potential freezing of the entire tumor. The accuracy of the simulator has been validated using real intra-operative data, demonstrating close matching of the generated iceball with the actual one in terms of size and shape. Although initially designed for integration within a robotic system, these methods are adaptable for various applications and can be extended to simulate different scenarios or procedures.

Future work will focus on further refining these methods, such as enhancing the simulation algorithm by incorporating additional parameters to account for previously simplified thermal dynamics and interactions. Additionally, efforts will be made to integrate the planning software and simulator into a unified tool, allowing operators to determine probe displacement and assess therapy outcomes without requiring intermediate steps.
