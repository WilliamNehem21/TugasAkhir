The Concurrent Logical Framework (CLF) is a language designed for the specification and analysis of concurrent systems. Its primary innovation lies in its ability to directly represent concurrent executions as monadic expressions, a feature that is not found in other frameworks. This paper demonstrates the various representation techniques within CLF by applying them to an asynchronous pi-calculus with correspondence assertions, encompassing dynamic semantics, safety criteria, and a type system that incorporates latent effects as proposed by Gordon and Jeffrey.

The paper also introduces the concept of latent effects, wherein each value transmitted across a channel carries a multiset of effects, which are debited from the sending process and credited to the receiving process. By synchronizing the communication between processes, the framework ensures that debited effects are introduced before any credited effects are utilized. The tasks of introducing and consuming linear hypotheses for the multiset of effects contained in a latent effect are handled by the "assume" and "consume" operations. Furthermore, the safety criterion for processes is defined, with the focus on characterizing violations of safety and modeling each step of the criterion as a CLF judgment.

The paper also discusses the intrinsic connection between linear logic and the notions of state and concurrency, highlighting the numerous observed connections between concurrent calculi and linear logic in the literature. It emphasizes the role of CLF in providing a different perspective on prior investigations by representing, rather than embedding, calculi within a logical framework.
