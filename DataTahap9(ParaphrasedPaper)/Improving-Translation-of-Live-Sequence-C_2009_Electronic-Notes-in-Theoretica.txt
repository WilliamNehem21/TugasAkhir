The study discusses the automation and formalization of the LSC-to-temporal logic and LSC-to-automata translations for the LSC language. Previous work has shown that the resulting temporal logic formulas from translations are of extraordinary size, limiting the scalability of the charts that can be translated and verified. The current work introduces intuitive temporal logic reductions to generate a formula that is at most quadratic in the size of the chart, with demonstrated benefits on several examples.

The paper emphasizes the importance of developing specifications for verification efforts and suggests that English, traditionally used for specifying communication protocols, is not ideal due to its context sensitive, imprecise, and cumbersome nature.

The use of LSCs in the development and verification process is discussed, highlighting their role in verifying properties of communication protocols, providing specifications against which implementations are verified, and serving as the supported interface of the IP core.

The study also addresses the challenges associated with translating LSCs to temporal logic, which result in large formulas hindering the verification of larger LSCs. The authors propose an improved translation method that uses logic minimization to generate smaller and more efficient-to-verify formulas. Additionally, the study extends the translation to include constructs of the LSC grammar that were not previously translated to temporal logic.

The paper also mentions the applicability of LSCs in specifying provisional behavior, modeling and verifying systems, and their potential for use in the automatic synthesis of systems. It outlines ongoing interest in model checking of LSCs and translation of LSCs to automata, as well as the challenges and limitations associated with these processes.

The study presents an approach for translating LSCs to temporal logic, addressing various LSC constructs while highlighting the benefits of using a smaller formula during verification, as well as the performance improvements demonstrated in explicit and symbolic model checking.

Additionally, the paper discusses the translation of specific LSC constructs and presents extensions to remaining constructs, such as asynchronous messages, co-regions, bonded conditions, and invariants.

Finally, the study proposes an empirical study to understand the performance of the improved LSC-to-temporal logic translation in explicit and symbolic state model checking, and discusses potential threats to the validity of the empirical study, including omitted times for LTL-to-automata synthesis and indirect comparison to a multi-tiered approach.
