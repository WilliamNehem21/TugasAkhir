The primary objective of this study was to utilize rice straw (RS) in the development of environmentally friendly composites using corn-based adhesives (CA). Various treatments of RS with NaOH and hot water were conducted to assess their impact on the performance of the resulting composites. Additionally, the influence of composite density and starch content on composite properties was investigated, along with the observation of fractured surface microstructures. The findings indicated that composites made from cornstarch exhibited higher flexural strength. Moreover, composites comprised of hot-water treated straw and cornstarch demonstrated superior interface and increased flexural strength, with maximum values achieved at a starch content of 10% and composite density of 0.7 g/cm3. Furthermore, untreated straw-based composites showed lower moisture absorption, with moisture absorption increasing as starch content increased and density decreased. The composites developed in this study hold potential for applications in ceiling panels and bulletin boards.

The use of straw and other agricultural residues for manufacturing composite materials has gained widespread attention. However, existing composite materials primarily rely on crushed agricultural residues (e.g., straw powder, rice husk powder, or extracted straw fiber) and often employ discarded tires, formaldehyde resins, and polymers as matrices. While these composites offer improved water resistance and acoustic insulation properties, as well as greater internal bond strength and flexural strength, the energy-intensive process of crushing agricultural residues and extracting fiber results in significant energy consumption, while the non-degradable nature of the composite matrices poses environmental challenges.

To ensure the purity of the RS, extensive washing with distilled water was conducted to remove impurities, primarily dust, followed by air-circulated oven drying and storage in hermetic plastic containers to prevent microbial attacks. The washed RS without further treatment served as the control and was denoted as CRS.

Cornstarch adhesives were prepared by dispersing cornstarch powder in distilled water at a 1:10 cornstarch-to-water ratio, and incorporating 1.2wt% sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3.5H2O) on a dry basis of cornstarch to prevent deterioration. The resulting adhesives were then mixed with RS.
