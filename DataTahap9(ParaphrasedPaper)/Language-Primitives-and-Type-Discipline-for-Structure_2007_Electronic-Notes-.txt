After addressing the challenges associated with higher-order session communication, this study also introduces a session typing system that facilitates more flexible higher-order session communication. This system is based on the work of Gay and Hole and has already been employed in various contexts. The report includes full proofs of two theorems, and also provides clarifications for certain definitions that were previously absent. The motivation behind revisiting these proofs nine years later is the identification of a subtle counterexample to the results in some recent works on session types. This counterexample was discovered after the publication of the original work being considered, although it does not affect the results of the original system. The report elaborates on this issue in detail in section 3.

A session refers to a sequence of reciprocal interactions between two parties, potentially involving branching and recursion, and serves as a fundamental unit for describing interaction. Communications pertaining to a session are conducted through a channel-specific port known as a channel. A new channel is created for each session initiation to facilitate secure communications.

Structured communication-based programming enables the clear delineation of complex interaction structures beyond traditional communication primitives. As the complexity of the interaction increases, capturing the entire interactive behavior and writing accurate programs becomes more challenging. The session type discipline offers a straightforward static verification framework to ensure the accuracy of communication patterns in such scenarios. It ensures that well-typed programs are free from compatibility issues in interaction patterns.

There is a notable addition to the typing system discussed in the report: the [bot]-rule. Without the [bot]-rule, subject congruence (Lemma 2.9) is not preserved. For instance, the process "throw k[k']; inact| inact" is structurally congruent to "throw k[k']; inact" and does not permit the transmission of an arbitrary channel. In most cases, a process "catch k(k'') in p2" can be alpha-converted before communication 3 such that the bound variable k'' syntactically matches the free variable k' in the throw process. However, an exception arises when k' is free in p2, making alpha-conversion impossible (as it would capture the free variable k'), and thus communication cannot occur. A more lenient rule would allow the transmission of an arbitrary channel.

An alternative approach would involve typing the contractum with a different typing. In the aforementioned case and for the catch process in the redex, we have k': ![nat]; end and k'': ?[nat]; end. In the contractum, channels k' and k'' are aliased, and it is not evident how to derive the correct type ?[nat]; ![nat]; end for k', based on the premises. This type is not typable. The final step is to only consider typings for subject reduction and type safety purposes, where the two ends of a channel are of dual types. Such typings are referred to as balanced, and this restriction eliminates the aforementioned typing (as ![bool]; end is not dual to ?[nat]; end). Consequently, process (5) is not guaranteed to maintain typability under reduction or ensure type safety.
