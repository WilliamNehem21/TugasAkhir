This academic paper introduces a resolution-based proof method for finite-valued propositional logics. The method is based on an algorithmic reduction procedure that expresses these logics in terms of bivalent semantics. The approach is hybrid, incorporating both internal and external elements to the many-valued logic. This is achieved by embedding the original language of the logic into a more expressive metalanguage to address the satisfiability problem. Unlike previous approaches, the target language utilized in this method is fully classical, which simplifies the design of resolution-based rules for specific many-valued logics. The paper provides detailed correctness results, which are easily derived from classical resolution results. The method is illustrated with examples, and its implementation is discussed, indicating that it can be readily achieved by translating into classical propositional logic using existing automated provers.

The paper situates the significance of many-valued logics in the context of their centennial jubilee, and highlights the semicentennial anniversary of the computational proof method known as resolution. Previous studies have extensively covered the applicability of many-valued logics, as well as various automatic proof methods for such logics. Notably, the resolution-based methods described in other papers are of interest and are closely related to the method introduced in the present paper. These papers outline clausal resolution-based procedures that transform a formula in the language of a specific many-valued logic into a labelled formula. Labels are used to represent truth-values at the syntactic level and reflect the semantic conditions under which a formula is satisfied. The resolution inference rule is applied to clauses containing complementary literals and whose labels are unifiable, based on consistent semantic conditions. The main difference between these proof methods lies in the form of the labels used: while one paper uses singleton labels, the other uses sets of signs for labels.
