The paper demonstrates that logic c1 cannot be expanded into a paraconsistent logic that satisfies the substitution theorem. However, it is shown that by introducing certain desirable properties as axioms, logic c1 can be extended into larger paraconsistent logics. The use of three-valued logics is employed to support these assertions.

In the field of logic, as in other areas of mathematics, it is important to have axiom independence when defining a logic. Multi-valued logics are utilized to achieve this, although this approach may have limitations. Nonetheless, it is a valuable tool for researchers interested in studying logics.

In various systems, the presence of inconsistencies is nearly inevitable. The application of paraconsistent logics in non-monotonic reasoning, which has not been fully recognized, is discussed, along with examples illustrating their potential utility.

Some authors argue that a paraconsistent logic should retain much of classical logic while permitting non-trivial inconsistent theories, and should not validate inferences that are not valid in classical logic. It is noted that paraconsistent logic should be contained within classical logic.

Classical logic is widely used in applications related to artificial intelligence. The paper analyzes different paraconsistent logics and their proximity to classical logic. It emphasizes the importance of the substitution theorem, a property inherent to classical logic, and demonstrates that any paraconsistent logic extending c1 fails to satisfy it. Furthermore, it shows that certain paraconsistent extensions of c1 uphold some of the de Morgan laws, which are valid in classical logic.

The use of three-valued logics is employed to support the claims made in the paper. A diagram is presented to illustrate various ways of extending c1 into other paraconsistent logics. Additionally, the paper indicates that the discovery of new paraconsistent logics and the determination of maximal paraconsistent logics are part of future research goals.
