Active learning (AL) within the domain of machine learning (ML) involves the iterative selection of the most informative samples from an unlabeled dataset, followed by querying an expert or other information source to label them. This process aims to reduce the cost of labeling while enhancing model performance. The application of AL algorithms to drug discovery was first introduced by Warmuth et al., who demonstrated its applicability to labeling tasks in pharmaceutical research and development. Over the past two decades, there has been increasing interest in leveraging AL, driven by advancements in the accuracy of ML prediction models. Several studies have showcased the potential of AL in diverse drug development projects, including focused library design, rational de novo design, and drug combination. Given its established efficacy, AL holds promise as a readily applicable technology to support researchers in molecular reasoning and experimental design.

Furthermore, researchers have explored retrospective applications of AL on datasets with known labels. Firstly, AL applied to labeled datasets can expedite the comparison of different model architectures and query strategies to identify the most effective AL workflows before their implementation in costly prospective studies. Secondly, AL can function as a data filtering tool to eliminate redundant data that have already been comprehended by the ML model based on prior training data, thus offering no new insights. Lastly, some studies have observed that the subsample of training data selected by AL is consistently balanced, even in cases where the original dataset is highly imbalanced, suggesting that AL algorithms may also contribute as a data balancing technique.
