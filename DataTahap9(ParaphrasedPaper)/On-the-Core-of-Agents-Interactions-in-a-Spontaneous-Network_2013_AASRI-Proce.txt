In numerous dynamic open systems, social interaction plays a critical role in the development of social capital. However, these interactions may be compromised by self-interested agents. To address this issue, it is essential for each agent to be able to identify trustworthy interaction partners. Therefore, the focus of this study is on fostering a new type of interaction among agents within a spontaneous networked organization (SNO) to mitigate this problem. This is achieved by implementing a diverse set of negotiation policies to expedite the execution of tasks assigned to the agents by the organizer. Additionally, collaborative filtering (CF) is used to explore various forms of data to demonstrate how agents interact both implicitly and explicitly, and the impact of these interactions on social capital. This strategy not only enhances interaction performance, but also contributes to better management of the spontaneous exchange of behaviors and knowledge among agents, resulting in more reliable communication within the distributed organization.

A spontaneous networked organization (SNO) is a group of agents characterized by their shared values and interactions aimed at achieving a common goal. In real-world scenarios, individuals consistently strive to find satisfactory strategies for reaching their objectives, even if these strategies are not computationally optimal. The formation of SNOs is a key factor influencing interactions among agents, who collectively contribute to the growth of social capital within the organization. These interactions give rise to a set of social norms, shared values, relationships, and common goals that define the organization. The behaviors, attitudes, and experiences of each agent are mutually influenced by others, leading to the rapid development of social capital. As social capital expands, new strategies and plans are dynamically implemented to prevent disintegration. Consequently, the process of social interaction is a powerful driver in establishing trust between agents and other entities within the organization.

Shared values can enhance the competitiveness of agents within SNOs, serving as cognitive contexts that enable coordinated actions and facilitate effective communication among agents. These cognitive contexts represent social norms that dictate roles and behavioral plans, aligning agents' communication with each other.

Social norms encompass the customs, traditions, and common trends demonstrated by agents within the organization. They comprise legislated rules and procedures that encourage individuals to adapt to simple or complex interactions, thereby promoting unity and interdependence within the organization. Shared values, deeply cherished by individuals, significantly impact their interactions, fostering congruence and similarity among agents and ultimately enhancing the unity and cohesion of the organization.

SNOs share similarities with traditional organizations, undergoing processes from formation to dissolution, with potential additional operations occurring within them. These processes define the organization's lifecycle, observable in many existing organizations, including SNOs.

The primary focus of this study is on fostering a distinct form of interaction among agents within SNOs. The paper outlines negotiation protocols for agents during the interaction process, followed by the exploration of service level agreements (SLAs) and their implementation within SNOs in subsequent sections. The interaction using a distributed database is then discussed, followed by an examination of implicit and explicit interactions using the concept of collaborative filtering (CF) in the final section.

Negotiations among agents are built on contract net protocols, where tasks are announced to agents by the organizer, allowing negotiations among the agents to identify the most suitable candidates for executing the task. Subsequently, agents unable to solve tasks may transform them into sub-tasks, leading to the formation of contracts among the agents and the announcement of sub-tasks to the contract net. Agents evaluate tasks based on their capabilities and bid for contracts, with the winning agents displaying their abilities to the organizer for task assignment. The organizer evaluates the submitted bids and selects the most suitable agent to perform the task. Additionally, the organizer captures agent-specific data for specific tasks, with SLA violation monitoring applied to determine whether negotiation protocols are being adhered to or violated.

SLAs contain parameters and metrics that elucidate service standards between various parties in the network, promoting appropriate interactions. The use of SLAs in interactions involves events such as service discovery, negotiation, scheduling, and monitoring, thereby enhancing the credibility of tasks offered and attracting agents to participate.

SLAs are integrated with each group of agents interacting in different locations within SNOs. Interaction among agents with similar attributes occurs implicitly using SLAs, indicating a relationship and level of coordination between agents based on similarities. This implicit agreement binds agents with similar attributes, enabling dynamic behavior over time and facilitating the development of implicit connections.

Through the application of collaborative filtering (CF), agents that interact implicitly or explicitly can be identified. This model demonstrates that agents within the same cluster negotiate and communicate their agreed payoffs or final results, revealing similarities in interests. The similarity between two groups of agents is computed using memory-based CF, filtering data using collaborative techniques, and analyzing past agent behavior, ultimately predicting agent interests by aggregating preferences. This method facilitates the identification of agents with similar interests, enhancing interaction between them.

Within the organization, many agents share values and have commonalities in their attributes, enabling explicit interactions with others in different clusters of SNOs. The organizer has control over explicit interactions, as opposed to implicit interactions, which are managed by SLAs. Agents' characteristics and attributes may lead to explicit interactions, promoting unity and cohesion within the organization.

The SNO organization is founded on implicit and explicit connections between agents, characterized by various attributes in different locations. As social capital is rooted in social similarity, implicit interactions and explicit connections are established among individuals, enabling agents to interact both within and outside their groups. This form of interaction contributes to the dissemination of ideas and enhances social consensus to achieve common interests, while SLAs work to establish agreements between different actors and stakeholders within the organization.

In conclusion, this study has emphasized the development of a novel form of interaction among agents within a spontaneous networked organization (SNO), addressing interaction challenges through the implementation of a diverse range of service level agreements (SLAs). Collaborative filtering (CF) has permitted a thorough examination of how agents interact implicitly or explicitly, as well as the impact of these interactions on social capital. This approach has resulted in high-performance interactions and enhanced management of the spontaneous flow of behaviors and knowledge, promoting secure and rational communication among agents within the distributed organization. Future research will focus on exploring the security implications of these interactions and their effects on a wide range of organizations.
