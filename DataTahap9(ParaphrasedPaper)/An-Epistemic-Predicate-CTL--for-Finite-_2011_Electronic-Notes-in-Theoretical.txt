The use of this terminology may be inconvenient for immediate application, but by employing existential quantification and disjunction, one can readily define predicates such as z(n1, n2), signifying the existence of a name y for which the current process term takes the form... | n1(x).p(n2, x, y) |...

This unconstrained (unrestricted) condition can be achieved by selecting p to encompass processes pm that emulate Turing machines m as previously described, with the specific property being that m terminates and e functions as storage in the previously mentioned manner until m ceases execution. By constraining m to be deterministic, pm|e can be designated to have only one instance of execution.

Several key questions are left open for future exploration. Firstly, the practical implications of the closed system modeling approach proposed in this paper have not been thoroughly investigated, and it remains to be seen whether it can provide novel methodologies for specification and verification, as suggested by [previous authors mentioned]. Secondly, the model checking algorithm presented in this paper is non-elementary and requires enhancement to become practicably applicable. It is yet to be determined if existing methodologies for model checking of epistemic logics [10,15] can be expanded. Lastly, there is interest in extending the results presented in this paper to also encompass strategic capability, along the lines of afl.

Dimitar Guelev worked on the subject of this paper during a research visit to KTH in September 2009, partially supported by the ACCESS Linnaeus Excellence Centre, funded by the Swedish National Research Council. The work also received partial support from the Bulgarian National Science Fund grant ID-09-112. D. Guelev expresses gratitude to Mark Ryan for providing feedback on a preliminary version of the paper.
