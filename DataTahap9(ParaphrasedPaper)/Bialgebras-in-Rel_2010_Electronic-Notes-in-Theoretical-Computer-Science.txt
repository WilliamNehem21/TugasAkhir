This academic paper investigates bialgebras within the compact closed category rel, which consists of sets and binary relations. The paper demonstrates that various monoidal categories with additional structure can be constructed as the categories of (co)modules of bialgebras in rel. Specifically, for any group G, the paper constructs a ribbon category of crossed G-sets as the category of modules of a hopf algebra in rel, achieved through the quantum double construction. This category of crossed G-sets serves as a model for the braided variant of propositional linear logic.

The paper begins by reviewing fundamental concepts and properties of monoidal categories and bialgebras in section 2. In section 3, it investigates some bialgebras in rel, which stem from monoids and groups, and explores the associated categories of (co)modules. Section 4 focuses on the quantum double construction in rel, leading to the establishment of a category of crossed G-sets. The potential use of this category as a model for braided linear logic is discussed in the subsequent section.

For instance, as a classical illustration, the paper considers the category vectk of vector spaces over a field k and linear maps (example 2.3). The category vectk is a symmetric monoidal category, with its monoidal product defined by the tensor product of vector spaces, and k serving as the tensor unit. A monoid in vectk corresponds to a standard algebra, and a comonoid in vectk is equivalent to what is conventionally known as a coalgebra. Modules, comodules, bialgebras, and hopf algebras in vectk align with their classical interpretations, and further details are provided in the paper.
