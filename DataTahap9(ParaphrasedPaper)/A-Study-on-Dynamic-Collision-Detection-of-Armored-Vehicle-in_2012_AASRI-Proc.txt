The movement pattern of a moving object is quite intricate, and for the purpose of this study, the motion process of the entity is simplified. The study primarily focuses on rigid entities. Initially, collision detection is conducted when the entity is moving in a linear manner on a horizontal surface, followed by an analysis of collision detection for the entity during fixed-axis rotation. This is because the complex motions of entities can all be simplified to the combination of these two fundamental movements.

Translation is the most common and simplest form of movement in engineering and daily life. Therefore, studying the motion of an entity in a virtual environment should start with the investigation of translation. During translation, an entity can move in a straight line or along a curved path. However, in a virtual environment, the entity's motion is represented by changes in its position at each frame. The entity's position at the next frame is only dependent on its position and speed at the current frame, allowing the translation between two frames to be considered as linear motion.

This paper introduces a dynamic collision detection method for the phenomenon of armored vehicles penetrating the ground object in visual scenes, and presents a dynamic collision detection model. The model has been shown to have good collision detection performance through simulation and numerous comparative tests, thus addressing the stated problem. The drawback of this model is its failure to account for the specific shape of armored vehicles, which will be considered in future research.
