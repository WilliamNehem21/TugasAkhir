While there are various possible foundations for mathematics, in reality, mathematicians do not typically articulate their work in terms of a specific foundation. Most contemporary mathematicians tend to think in terms that align with ZFC (which is Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory extended with the axiom of choice), although they seldom express the complete formal details in practice. Additionally, although type theories represent a well-developed logical foundation, mathematicians rarely base their thinking on them, preferring instead to use a common mathematical language (CML), also known as mathematical vernacular.

Many factors contribute to the widespread adoption of CML, and there is significant potential for integrating advancements in logic and computerization not only in mathematics, but also in other fields such as program verification, bioinformatics, chemistry, and music. While computers have been utilized for mathematical computations since their inception, they have also recently started to play a role in handling abstract mathematical knowledge. However, storing pixel map images of mathematical articles on computers presents challenges in accessing the semantics of mathematical knowledge. Additionally, the lack of reliable OCR for mathematical material further complicates keyword searching, particularly in cases involving matrices.

Computer algebra systems (CAS) like Maxima, Maple, and Mathematica are extensively used for carrying out symbolic and sometimes numeric computations, as well as for representing mathematical knowledge. However, CAS languages typically lack ties to specific foundations and provide limited support for verifying the correctness of mathematical statements. Additionally, CAS languages often lack support for embedding natural language text or enabling precise typesetting control. As a result, while CAS are used for computation, their results are usually converted into other languages or formats for dissemination or verification. Nonetheless, there are valuable potential applications for using CAS for archiving and communicating mathematical knowledge.

The design of a language for mathematics, referred to as "mathlang," should be adaptable to future extensions that support additional uses of mathematical knowledge and enable seamless integration with existing languages like OMDoc and TeXmacs. In this regard, mathlang could serve as a method for extending existing languages in addition to, or possibly instead of, creating a separate language.

It is also important to represent the mathematical structure of natural language text in a manner similar to symbolic formulas, and to accommodate mixed text and symbols. However, previous systems have not adequately supported the handling of natural language text in this way.

The current design of mathlang has been informed by the experience of numerous students and has been divided into three aspects. Additionally, efforts have been made to relate mathlang text to a fully formalized version of the text, resulting in the development of methods for producing corresponding Mizar and Isabelle documents.

Furthermore, a representation known as tsa allows for interleaving pieces of Common Graphical Annotation (CGA) with pieces of CML, incorporating mixtures of natural language, symbolic formulas, and formatting instructions for visual presentation. The tsa representation is akin to the XQuery/XPath data model used for representing the information content of XML documents.

Additionally, mathlang is a long-term project with ongoing work on improvements to the mathlang software, including facilitating the entry of information for the core aspects of CGA and Document Representation Aspects (DRA). The ultimate goal is to create a system that makes it easier for mathematicians to write mathlang documents without formalizing them, while also supporting various forms of consistency checking for non-formalized mathematics. Mathlang is intended to be independent of any specific logical foundation, allowing individual documents to be formalized in one or more particular foundations, or to be non-formalized altogether.
