When a function is called, a set of three elements is added to the function stack, including the function name, the existing environment, and the remaining computation. The current computation is then substituted with the function's body, and the environment is updated to reflect the mapping of the arguments to their respective values. Upon returning, the environment and computation are reinstated, and the function call is substituted with the returned value.
