Understanding the contextual environment of a scene is crucial for the advancement of autonomous vehicles. While humans can easily recognize scene context from a single glance, this remains a challenge for computers. Automatic data labeling using deep learning models for scene classification can help address this issue, allowing for the selection of relevant scenes to create balanced datasets for training advanced instance detection models in specific road conditions.

This study introduces a new framework based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic classification of road scenes in automotive images. Using a well-known autonomous benchmark dataset, the approach extracts geo-position data and combines it with predictions from the scene classification model to create ground truth labels for training and evaluating a ResNet-50 model. The results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are presented.

Although significant progress has been made in image classification, particularly for a wide range of image categories, scene categorization is vital for improving visual perception for autonomous driving. The study discusses the challenges of scene-level task feature learning due to the larger diversity of scenes and the number of possible combinations in scenarios. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of scene placement for further advancements in visual perception for autonomous driving.

The paper also addresses the limitations of current autonomous datasets, which often lack traffic scene labels and precise per frame annotation. To address this, the study focuses on image classification in the context of road scenes for automotive datasets, specifically urban, rural, and highway road scenes, using convolutional neural networks to obtain scene labels and a map-based approach utilizing spatial data.

The paper is structured as follows: a review of related works, an explanation of the proposed methodology and system architecture, presentation of the results, and a discussion of the findings and avenues for further research.

The paper explores various methods used in image classification, including the use of convolutional neural networks and semantic labels for scene classification, and discusses the implementation of deep network architectures to improve classification accuracy.

Additionally, the paper discusses traffic scene classification methods, such as using deep network architectures for predicting geographical objects from satellite images and the use of openstreetmap (OSM) for obtaining semantic labels.

The study provides descriptions of urban, rural, and highway conditions and explains the implementation of the experiment using PyTorch v1.8.1. It details the process of data division, hyper-parameter settings, and data augmentation techniques that improve the training process and model performance.

Finally, the paper suggests potential areas for further research, such as experimenting with diverse image conditions and datasets, exploring unsupervised methods for scene classification, and considering the use of scene condition labeling for online and offline applications in autonomous driving.
