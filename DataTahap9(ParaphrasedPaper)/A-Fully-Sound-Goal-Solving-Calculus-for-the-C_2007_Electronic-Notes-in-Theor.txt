The paper establishes the soundness of a cooperative goal solving calculus, with the support of constraints referred to as "bridges" within the framework of Constraint Functional Logic Programming (CFLP). The focus is on the cooperation between herbrand, real arithmetic, and finite domain constraints. The paper comprises various sections: Section 2 provides an introduction to constraint domains and solvers underlying the CFLP scheme, Section 3 discusses the necessary constructions for coordination within this framework, while Section 4 delves into the details of programs, goals, the lazy narrowing calculus, and the full soundness results. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and outlines future work.

In Section 2, the essential components of the CFLP(d) scheme are outlined, serving as a logical and semantic framework for lazy constraint functional logic programming over a parametrically given constraint domain d. The appropriate selection of the constraint domain d to model the coordination of several constraint domains is further examined in Section 3. Notably, the updated presentation of CFLP(d) incorporates an explicit treatment of a Milner-like polymorphic type system, distinguishing it from previous work in functional logic programming.

This academic paper introduces the cooperative constrained lazy narrowing calculus CCLNC(c) in Section 4, extending to cooperative goal solving in CFLP(c) for any coordination domain c, which has been demonstrated to be fully sound with respect to CRW L(c) semantics, as detailed in Subsection 4.4. The paper also explores the computational power and implementation challenges of projections, establishing their significance and distinctiveness in comparison to propagations within the context of constraints.

The paper concludes with an illustrative example in which the solved forms are computed from a given constraint and program rules, accompanied by a comparison between the computations presented and those briefly outlined earlier.
