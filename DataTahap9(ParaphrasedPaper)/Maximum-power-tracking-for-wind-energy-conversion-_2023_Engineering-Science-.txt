This academic paper introduces a high-order optimal disturbance observer (hoodo) for estimating aerodynamic torque, which is crucial for estimating wind speed. The paper also employs a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to address the speed tracking problem of the generator. The proposed optimal composite control scheme is validated through computer simulations in Matlab/Simulink. The main contributions of this work are as follows: 1) the proposed hoodo relaxes the assumption that disturbances change slowly and provides a theoretical foundation for accurately estimating fast-varying disturbances such as aerodynamic torque of wind energy conversion systems (WECS); 2) an optimal algorithm is used to systematically select the gains of the proposed hoodo, addressing a common challenge in existing observers; 3) the paper compares, analyzes, and investigates four different orders of the hoodo, namely first, second, third, and fourth order; 4) a straightforward gain tuning rule for the LQR is implemented, which is practical for real hardware implementation; 5) the paper presents a detailed analysis of the stability of the closed-loop hoodo-based LQR using the Lyapunov approach.

The paper underscores the dependency of the control effort K_u on the weight matrices Q and R. An increase in Q positively affects reference tracking efficiency with more control efforts applied, while an increase in R results in a smaller control value and poor reference tracking performance. It is recommended to carefully consider the influence of Q and R on K_u and find a compromise between control efficiency and energy consumption. The paper also emphasizes the importance of selecting the values of K1 for the observer, which can be done by adjusting Q0 and R0. By doing so, the observer can ensure boundedness and uniform stability.

The error in estimating the aerodynamic torque and wind speed for different values of R in the hoodo-based LQR control scheme is provided. The work demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed hoodo-based LQR for WECS, as it is capable of accurately estimating aerodynamic torque and wind speed with fast-varying dynamics. The simulations show that the hoodo-based LQR outperforms the traditional Hoo-based LQR method in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, the presented controller with hoodo ensures smaller error and faster response time compared to previous observer-based control schemes. Moreover, the paper highlights the parameter insensitivity property of the hoodo-based control, which is superior to that of the Hoo-based LQR. The study's results confirm the efficacy of the proposed hoodo and its superiority over other high-order observers. Future work could involve building an experimental setup to validate the performance of the proposed methods.
