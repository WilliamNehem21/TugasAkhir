Today, there is a proliferation of interactive services offered on the internet, many of which rely on cryptographic protocols to provide a certain level of security. These protocols can be viewed as relatively straightforward programs running in an insecure environment. Various methods exist for modeling cryptographic protocols and assessing their security attributes. One such approach is the Dolev-Yao model, which characterizes the capabilities of an attacker using a deduction system. This model is frequently employed to analyze protocol security against passive attackers, who intercept communications between honest parties and derive information from the messages. The issue of whether a passive attacker can obtain specific information from observed network messages is referred to as the intruder deduction problem.

When it comes to algebraic properties, the capabilities of the intruder typically rely on the perfect cryptography assumption, which posits that it is impossible to extract any details about an encrypted message without knowledge of the exact decryption key. However, this assumption is overly idealistic, as there are protocols that may be deemed secure under the perfect cryptography assumption but are vulnerable in practice, as attackers can exploit cryptographic primitives in conjunction with the protocol rules to uncover secret information. To address this, it is essential to relax this assumption and enhance the deductive power of the intruder. One approach is to introduce the ability to consider algebraic properties, offering a more realistic representation of an intruder and potentially uncovering new attack methods.

In the remainder of the paper, we establish a new concept of subterms (defined as Definition 5.7) to demonstrate the locality of the deduction system, and introduce proof transformations that allow us to show that any proof can be converted into a normal proof. Consequently, we establish that a normal proof is indeed a local proof (as per Theorem 9.1), leading to the solvability of the intruder deduction problem per Theorem 4.2.

It is always possible to simplify any proof by removing branches or segments, and by merging consecutive applications of certain rules (e.g., (ck), (dk), and (gx)) to transform a flat proof into a flat and simple proof.
