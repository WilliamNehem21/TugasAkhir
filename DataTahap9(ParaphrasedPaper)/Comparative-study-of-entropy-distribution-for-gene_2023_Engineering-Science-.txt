This academic paper discusses the thermal analysis for porous surfaces in the context of Brinkman fluid models, with a focus on entropy production, nanofluid characteristics, and fluid flow characteristics across inclined planes. The paper also delves into studies on the thermal conductivity and diffusion of nanofluids and the impact of thermal conductivity on mixed convection fluid flow. Additionally, it explores the impact of heat transfer entropy and the Darcy parameter on heat transfer irreversibility, kinetic energy, and Bejan number. The authors of the paper cite various research studies to support their arguments and findings.
