The research focuses on the development of a document understanding system capable of extracting target fields from document images processed with different OCR engines. To achieve this, a Layout Alignment Algorithm (LAA) is proposed, which creates a unique document layout representation to train a machine learning-based extractor. This extractor is trained on various layouts from a training dataset and is heavily dependent on the document layout, containing the positions of the target fields.

The motivation for this research stems from the need to extract target fields from document images processed by different OCR engines, which may generate different layouts for the same document image. Without the LAA module, specific extractors would need to be trained and maintained for each OCR engine, which is not feasible when the OCR engine used is unknown. Therefore, the LAA module is necessary to convert any layout representation into a unique form from which the extractor can identify target fields.

The paper is structured as follows: it introduces related work, discusses the motivation, novelty, and contribution of the proposed method, presents the LAA algorithm for layout alignment, and explains the page segmentation process, which is crucial for document layout analysis. Additionally, the paper proposes a unique measurement scale and units to achieve desired information extraction independence of document source. Several experiments were conducted to test the LAA module's performance, indicating its effectiveness in aligning different document layouts generated by various OCR engines.
