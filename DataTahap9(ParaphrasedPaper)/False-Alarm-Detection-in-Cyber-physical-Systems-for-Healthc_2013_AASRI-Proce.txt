In this study, the authors attempted to address the shortcomings of the CPESC3 system but did not present a comprehensive CPS architecture. They introduced a promising framework for an automated secure community cloud designed to deliver cost-effective healthcare services with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes. However, their architecture did not address the issue of alerting physicians in emergency situations.

The high rate of alarm generation in an independent threshold alarm system also leads to the generation of false alarms, which can fatigue caregivers. Given that the CPS in this healthcare context will involve various types of sensors, a strategy for the reliable coexistence of heterogeneous sensors is necessary. The authors proposed a "tru-alarm" method based on a battle ground situation, which aims to identify trustworthy alarms and enhance the feasibility of CPS. Once the locations of objects responsible for alarms are determined, an object-alarm graph is constructed, and trustworthiness inferences are made based on the link information in the graph. Simulation results confirmed that their method can effectively filter out noise and false information, ensuring the accuracy of meaningful alarms. To identify trustworthy alarms, an enhanced method for detecting and reducing false alarms can be employed. Given that vital information is evaluated to determine the patient's condition and multiple sensors may provide different data, trustworthiness analysis can be a valuable tool.

The study also proposed a false alarm detection architecture for CPS healthcare applications. This architecture combines the threshold alarm method with multiple classifiers in a decision set. Furthermore, the architecture aims to address several outstanding issues such as completeness, false alarm detection, and accurate alarm generation. It suggests using multiple classifiers and comparing them with vital health data from patients to detect false alarms from medical sensors. The proposed framework is expected to offer improved performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and smart alarm systems. The authors plan to explore security issues and implement a prototype architecture in a healthcare scenario in the future.
