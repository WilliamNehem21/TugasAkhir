This academic paper discusses the use of formal methods to describe properties such as invariance, event precedence, periodicity, liveness, and safety conditions in non-trivial systems. The paper proposes an approach based on tilco (temporal logic with compositional operators) and its compositional version called c-tilco. The tilco language provides a uniform model for representing time from past to future and features unique operators for expressing facts and events over time, extended temporal operators (tilco-x), and process communication support (c-tilco). The compositional nature of c-tilco allows for the specification of complex systems by decomposing them into multiple processes, enabling inter-process communication and modeling.

In c-tilco, multiple instances of the same process component specification can be arranged in the global architecture, with each instance having its own distinct values for parameters. Process communication is based on synchronous input/output ports connected through channels, following a 1:1 connection model where each output port is connected to at most one input port and vice versa.

The paper also describes the realization of the system in terms of communication nodes, each with a higher-level communication interface. These communication nodes handle simple data communication and protocol management, with boolean tokens transmitted over dedicated channels as a form of message, including the origin and destination node IDs. The paper outlines the use of a backup ring to recover from failed attempts of communication on broken channels, with specific predicates determining the ready state after successful transmissions and the handling of broken channels to prevent port freezing.

Overall, the paper presents a detailed approach for using tilco and c-tilco to specify and execute the real-time systems and describes the mechanisms for communicating between processes and managing system-level communication in a distributed architecture.
