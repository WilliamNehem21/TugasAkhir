The study explores methods to enhance the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for reconstructing seismic data with detailed features. The authors propose the use of a multi-layer wavelet convolutional neural network (MWCNN) which integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and inverse discrete wavelet transform (IWT) within a U-Net architecture to prevent information loss caused by pooling operations. MWCNN leverages U-Net as its backbone, enabling the propagation of context information to high-resolution layers through the use of a large number of feature channels during the upsampling process.

Furthermore, MWCNN adopts IWT to reconstruct high-resolution feature maps, effectively expanding receptive fields without significantly increasing computational costs. This addresses the limitations of dilated filtering, which can lead to grid effects and sparse sampling of the input image with checkerboard patterns. MWCNN is also positioned as a generalization of dilation filtering and subsampling, benefiting image restoration tasks.

To enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of irregularly missing seismic data reconstruction, MWCNN incorporates channel attention and spatial attention through the use of DWT and IWT for multi-scale seismic data analysis. The proposed W-CBADL (wavelet-based convolutional block attention deep learning network) combines wavelet transform with traditional CNNs, leveraging the multi-scale characteristic of DWT and IWT to enhance seismic data reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, W-CBADL utilizes a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to identify feature maps with stronger feedback capabilities in both channel and spatial dimensions. This approach outperforms U-Net and MWCNN in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons for irregularly sampled seismic data reconstruction, particularly for areas with significant gaps and weak reflections.

The study conducts experiments using synthetic and field seismic data to verify the effectiveness of W-CBADL, showcasing its superiority over existing models.
