The use of agricultural products is essential for meeting the dietary needs of both animals and humans. Agriculture plays a significant role in the lives of people, directly or indirectly, by providing the foundation for food production. Crop cultivation, such as wheat and cotton, has been vital for human survival, regardless of whether individuals reside in urban or rural areas. The advancement of civilization has led to extensive development in the field of agriculture, encompassing various activities like farming and cattle raising.

Crop production necessitates careful attention to various factors to ensure optimal yield across all seasons. This involves analyzing the soil, selecting appropriate seeds, and addressing the specific nutritional requirements of different crops. The resulting yields are essential for meeting the daily needs of farmers and others. However, crop production faces significant challenges, particularly in the form of crop diseases, which can have a detrimental impact on the quality and quantity of the overall yield. These diseases can lead to reduced growth, lower fruit production, increased leaf loss, and other ailments, ultimately affecting the functional capacity of the plant.

Traditional methods of identifying crop diseases have relied on experts using visual inspection based on their knowledge and experience. However, these methods are time-consuming and costly, leading to delays in disease eradication, particularly in large areas. Modern techniques, such as processing, similarity identification, and deep learning-based classification, offer more efficient and timely solutions for plant disease detection.

Various imaging techniques, including photoacoustic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging, are being used for disease detection in plants. These techniques provide detailed insights into plant health and disease at different levels, such as genotypic and physiological, and offer valuable information for early disease detection.

Additionally, machine learning and deep learning techniques, such as deep neural networks and support vector machines, have been employed for plant disease detection and classification. These methods have shown promise in accurately identifying and differentiating between various plant diseases.

Overall, the review emphasizes the importance of efficient and reliable methods for early detection and identification of plant diseases, as well as the need for continued advancements in agricultural technologies to address the challenges associated with crop production and disease management.
