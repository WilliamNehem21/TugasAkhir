Currently, true color images are the most commonly used multichannel images in everyday life. These images can be sparsely represented by processing the channels individually or by imposing constraints on the correlation across colors. However, this study demonstrates that utilizing 3D elements from a highly redundant dictionary can significantly increase the sparsity in the representation of true color images, particularly for arrays involving more channels like hyper-spectral images.

The main limitation of the MP method is the potential selection of linearly dependent atoms and the lack of stepwise optimality in approximating the coefficients to minimize the norm of the residual error at each iteration. To address these issues, the pursuit strategy known as OMP can be employed.

The OMP3D implementation described in this work extends the 2D implementation of OMP and overcomes the limitations of linear dependency by employing adaptive biorthogonalization and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedures. Additionally, the self-projected matching pursuit (SPMP) methodology is introduced, which can be extended from 2D to 3D using separable dictionaries.

The study emphasizes non-overlapping blocks for independent approximation, which are then assembled together to produce the approximation of the entire image. The experiments were conducted using MATLAB on a dual-core i7 3520 M CPU with 4 GB of memory, utilizing C++ MEX files for the channel-by-channel and 3D approximations.

The study investigates the data reduction context by considering high-quality approximation of 3D images, showcasing improved sparsity achieved through simultaneous approximation of multiple channels. Specifically, it was demonstrated that treating images as very thin 3D arrays instead of 3 independent 2D arrays can lead to a substantial reduction in elementary components required for high-quality approximation, as shown with standard RGB images and hyperspectral images in the wavelet domain.
