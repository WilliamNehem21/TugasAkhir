The project's motivation is derived from a broader initiative aiming to offer tool support for a real-time refinement calculus. Real numbers are valued for their continuity, a property that is crucial when dealing with real-time systems. For instance, in a system involving a temperature sensor, standard differential calculus based on real numbers may be used to specify limits on the rate of change of temperature. Without real numbers, only weaker properties of a discrete model can be formally stated.

Mathematicians have established various algebraic structures such as monoids, groups, rings, and fields, identified through defining axioms. Theorems developed for these structures represent shared properties among many mathematical structures. For example, real numbers share multiple properties with rational, integer, and natural numbers. Once a model satisfies the axioms of an algebraic structure, its theorems can be used for reasoning. Introducing more general algebraic structures enables increased theory reuse and confidence in system validity.

Dedekind represents a real number by a set of all rational numbers less than it, referred to as a cut. Cuts must satisfy several properties, such as not being empty, not being the set of all rationals, and being downwards closed. However, defining real multiplication complicates proofs as it involves negative elements, resulting in sets that are not cuts.

The traditional development of real numbers has produced a well-defined hierarchy of algebraic structures, providing modularity and opportunities for theory reuse. Theory instantiation allows for syntactic inclusion and enables reuse of theory properties and axioms.

Various approaches exist for building the axiomatization of algebraic structures up to and including the ordered field theory. While theory interpretation and instantiation are advocated, careful consideration of alternatives is necessary. The process continues until the ordered field theory is developed, with the rationals modeled and the ordered field theory interpreted into the rational theory to obtain ordered field properties.

The final argument copies the interpreted theories into subtheories of rational field under provided renamings. This listing of subtheory renamings, however, breaks down the modularity of the theories, as the rational field theory must have knowledge of the subtheories of the ordered field theory.
