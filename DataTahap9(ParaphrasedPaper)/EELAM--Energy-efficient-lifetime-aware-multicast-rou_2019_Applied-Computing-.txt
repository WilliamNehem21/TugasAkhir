The paper discusses the importance of developing an energy-efficient multicast algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), where nodes have limited energy levels and rely on intermediate nodes to transmit data. The proposed solution, called Energy Efficient Lifetime Aware Multicast (EELAM), aims to address the critical factor of intermediary node lifetime in route selection. EELAM utilizes an adaptive genetic algorithm to select optimal intermediate nodes with maximal residual energy and minimal energy usage. The paper explores various existing multicast routing protocols and proposes EELAM as an alternative approach to optimize energy consumption and network lifetime in MANETs.

Compared to wired networks, multicast communication in wireless networks faces higher complexity due to interferences and mobility issues. The paper emphasizes the need for more efficient multicast routing protocols to address energy and scalability constraints. Several existing multicast routing protocols are discussed, including tree-based and cluster-based approaches, as well as models focused on power efficiency and network lifetime improvement.

The paper proposes an approach for multicast route discovery using an adaptive genetic algorithm, with the goal of selecting optimal multicast routes with minimal energy consumption and maximal network lifetime. The proposed model relies on dynamic fitness assessment and experimental simulations using the NS2 network simulator to evaluate the performance of the EELAM routing approach compared to other benchmarking models. The results highlight the scalability and efficacy of EELAM in improving energy efficiency and network lifetime in MANETs. The paper also suggests potential future enhancements, such as integrating fuzzy reasoning into the fitness function of the adaptive genetic algorithm to further optimize multicast route selection.
