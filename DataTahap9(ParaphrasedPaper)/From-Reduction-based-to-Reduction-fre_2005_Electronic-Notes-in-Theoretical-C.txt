The paper proposes a method to streamline the intermediate process of a normalization function by introducing a new "refocus" function that directly transforms a reduction context and contractum into the next reduction context and redex. This refocused normalization function is compared to an abstract machine and is demonstrated using examples of arithmetic expressions and terms of the free monoid. The authors implement this method on reduction semantics for arithmetic expressions and terms in the free monoid, and subsequently transform the reduction-based normalization function into a reduction-free normalization function by refocusing and then refunctionalizing the resulting abstract machine. The resulting function is expressed in direct style and is reduction-free. The paper also discusses the successful construction of weak-head normalization functions for lambda-calculus and establishes a connection between normalization by evaluation and abstract machines for strong reduction. This research is detailed in the technical report published by Ma≈Çgorzata Biernacka, Dariusz Biernacki, and Olivier Danvy in December 2004. The preliminary version of this work was presented at the fourth ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Continuations (CW 2004). The related work by Olivier Danvy and Lasse R. Nielsen on refocusing in reduction semantics is also referenced.
