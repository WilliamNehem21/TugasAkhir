This academic paper introduces a language extension for process calculi aimed at modeling the exchange of cryptographically composed data. The extension provides a succinct syntax for terms and patterns that captures the concept of perfect cryptography. It is designed to be independent of the specific process calculus chosen and can be applied to any calculus that supports data exchange. Initially, the model is limited to symmetric cryptography, but the paper also presents how it can be expanded to incorporate asymmetric encryption and digital signatures.

Many security protocols rely on process calculi for modeling, and a common approach to ensuring security is through the use of cryptography. While several process calculi incorporate cryptography in their designs, the paper emphasizes that the modeling of cryptography and the underlying communication model should be developed independently.

The language extension includes a term language with pattern matching that reflects the concept of perfect cryptography in an intuitive and concise manner. The design is not tied to a specific communication model and can be utilized in any process calculus supporting data exchange.

The paper also discusses basic elements such as patterns, which are used for matching terms. It provides examples of pattern matching and discusses how the syntax and semantics of the language extension do not strictly adhere to the assumption of perfect cryptography. The paper also outlines a well-formedness condition for enforcing this assumption, allowing the model to remain flexible and accommodating of various attack scenarios.

Additionally, the paper introduces sieves, which are used for matching on terms, and outlines their syntax and features. It also discusses how well-formedness ensures the enforcement of perfect cryptography and how the extended model introduces new ways to circumvent it.

The paper proceeds to formalize the protocol in an extended protocol narration without assuming anything about the underlying semantics of the communication model. It offers an example translation of a simple protocol narration into the extended narration, emphasizing the need for fresh distributed keys and the knowledge of master keys by involved parties.

Furthermore, the paper presents important properties of the language extension, noting that well-formedness is preserved in the semantics and a well-formed pattern guarantees perfect cryptography. It also describes how a principal can extend its knowledge using known keys and decompose values according to perfect cryptography rules.
