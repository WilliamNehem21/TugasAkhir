This academic paper discusses the need for teachers to easily find and create visualizations with the required interaction, and it highlights the development of several algorithm visualization (AV) systems, such as animal, jawaa, and matrixpro, which provide various ways of creating animations and interactions. The paper emphasizes the value of integrating these systems to allow teachers to choose based on the level of interaction provided, and it acknowledges the work done by a working group in developing XML specifications for AV.

The paper presents the development of a language called XAAL (extensible algorithm animation language) for data exchange between algorithm animation systems, based on the specifications and examples provided by the working group. It introduces tools aimed at benefiting AV system developers by facilitating data exchange between different AV systems, as well as supporting other useful export formats. The paper explains that XAAL is defined as an XML language and describes its basic graphical components, support for data structures, and abstract data structure operations.

The paper also discusses the modular XML schema for XAAL and presents two processing pipelines for adding XAAL support into existing algorithm animation systems. It further describes a prototype implementation of XAAL and various transformations. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential use of this work for participants of the ITICSE XML Working Group, developers of AV systems, and teachers interested in using AV technology.
