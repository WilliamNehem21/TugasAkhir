The importance of ontologies in capturing and sharing knowledge within a specific domain cannot be overstated. This paper introduces a method for automatically generating domain ontologies from Chinese encyclopedias available on the web. The approach involves using the terms found within the category systems of these encyclopedias as concepts and identifying synonyms, subsequently constructing an original taxonomy from Chinese Wikipedia and Hudong-Baike. For concepts not initially present in the taxonomy, a set-theory like method is employed to create a directed graph, from which a tree is derived using the maximum-spanning-tree algorithm. This tree is then merged with the existing taxonomy. Additionally, the titles of regular articles are used as instances, and their population is facilitated through the inclusion of category labels. The attributes of both concepts and instances are extracted from specific structures such as infobox modules. The successful creation of a plant ontology using this method showcases the high precision and coverage of the resulting ontology.

Manual ontology creation is a costly and labor-intensive process that requires the collaboration of domain experts and programmers over an extended period. This manual approach is prone to errors and results in ontologies with limited coverage and rapid obsolescence. Notably, there are only a few manually created ontologies, including WordNet, Cyc, and Gene Ontology. In Chinese, Hownet provides a knowledge database, but it is limited in scope and not freely available. To the best of our knowledge, there are no extensive Chinese ontologies published for free at present.

Ontology learning, which entails the automatic generation of ontologies, can be categorized into general ontology learning and domain ontology learning based on their coverage. Furthermore, when considering the source of the learning, ontology learning can be based on structured data, semistructured data, and unstructured data. The focus of this paper is on learning ontologies from Chinese encyclopedias, particularly in the context of the increasing availability of collaborative semi-structured data on the internet, as exemplified by platforms such as Wikipedia, Baidu-Baike, and Hudong-Baike.

There are various methods for learning ontologies from unstructured text, including Text-to-Onto and automatic ontology building approaches that rely on natural language processing techniques, structured knowledge, and sometimes human intervention. Additionally, efforts have been made to extract domain ontologies from unstructured text documents through novel episode-based ontology construction mechanisms.

The paper highlights the challenges and methods for accessing and utilizing data from Chinese encyclopedias, with a particular focus on Chinese Wikipedia, Baidu-Baike, and Hudong-Baike. The categorization hierarchies present in these platforms facilitate the derivation of an original taxonomy. However, challenges arise from scattered categories and unorganized data in certain encyclopedias, necessitating the use of set-theory methods to merge these categories into the original taxonomy. The inclusion of infobox modules, while valuable for attribute extraction, also presents limitations as they are only found in approximately ten percent of articles. However, the later experiment reveals that about eighty percent of plant articles contain infobox modules, highlighting their potential value for ontology generation.
