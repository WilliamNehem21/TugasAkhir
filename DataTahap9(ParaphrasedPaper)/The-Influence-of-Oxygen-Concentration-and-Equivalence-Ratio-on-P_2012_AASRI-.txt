As a result, the selection of the equivalence ratio (ER) was highly significant in the oxygen-enriched pyrolysis process, as it exerted control over the composition and calorific value of the gas products. Furthermore, the quality of the gas products could be enhanced by increasing the oxygen concentration within a specific ER range.

Solid waste encompasses both general solid waste and hazardous solid waste. Municipal solid waste (MSW), which falls under general solid waste, refers to the solid, semi-solid, or liquid waste generated from urban residential activities or municipal services. The methods for managing MSW are broadly categorized into solid waste landfilling, partial recovery, partial fermentation, and heat disposal. Due to its numerous advantages such as high efficiency, substantial volume reduction, utilization of energy, minimal land usage, and increased calorific value, many developed countries have adopted heat treatment for MSW disposal. Heat disposal technology comprises thermal incineration, which is a more established method, and pyrolysis, a newer technology that has emerged in recent years.

The organic components of MSW are distilled in the dry distillation layer, leading to the generation of CNHM gases with methane (CH4) as the primary constituent. In the reduced layer, the water-gas reaction and reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) occurring at the carbon materials layer predominantly take place. Additionally, the oxidation reaction of waste carbon and oxygen occurs in the oxide layer. Consequently, the resulting gases mainly consist of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), CNHM, and other compounds. In the dry region, high-temperature walls of the pyrolysis device and the high-temperature gases produced in other reaction regions are utilized to dry and dehydrate the MSW, preparing it for further cracking.

The theoretical temperature for oxygen-enriched pyrolysis of MSW was calculated by adding the enthalpy of the combustible products from the gasification process and examining it against a reference value. The actual furnace temperature is expected to be lower than the theoretically calculated temperature. When using air as an oxidant, the entry of excess cold air and the presence of nitrogen in the air (constituting 79% of the air) contribute to a reduction in furnace temperature, increased heat loss, and excessive smoke emissions. Moreover, inert nitrogen and incompletely reacted oxygen are retained in the produced gases.

Observations revealed that the heat value of the gas products experiences a significant increase with rising oxygen levels, attributable to the interaction between the increased combustible gases and the decreased nitrogen content. However, the heat value of gasification products decreases with an increase in the equivalence ratio, especially when the ratio exceeds 0.30, leading to a rapid decline in the heat value of the gas product. This decline is ascribed to the increase in carbon dioxide content and the decrease in carbon monoxide and methane contents resulting from the elevation of the equivalence ratio. Additionally, when the ratio surpasses the transition point (ER=0.25), the hydrogen content starts to decline, resulting in a rapid decrease in the heat value.
