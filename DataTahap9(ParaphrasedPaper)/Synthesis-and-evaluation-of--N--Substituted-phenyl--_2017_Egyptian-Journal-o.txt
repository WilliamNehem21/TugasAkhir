After conducting extensive research in the literature, it was observed that combining sulfonamide and amide compounds in various ways results in different activities, such as carbonic anhydrase inhibition, antimycobacterial effects, and acting as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P1) receptor. Additionally, some sulfonamides also function as 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1) inhibitors for treating metabolic disorders, as well as potential antibacterial and antifungal agents. Furthermore, compounds with sulfonamide and amide linkages exhibit selective sirt2 inhibiting activity.

These findings indicate that the combination of sulfonamide and amide compounds with various groups leads to diverse activities. The references also suggest the potential for potent anticancer activity in derivatives containing benzene sulfonamide and phenyl amide compounds. Therefore, compounds with benzene sulfonamide and phenyl amide groups, coupled at the meta positions of benzene to each other, were synthesized for this study. Simplified reaction conditions were developed to avoid the use of costly reagents and to streamline purification processes. All synthesized compounds were of high purity. The synthesis of new substituted sulfonamide derivatives (scheme 1) was reported to investigate their anticancer activity. The synthetic methods used for the preparation of the title compounds (4a-4u) are detailed in the provided scheme.

The reaction mass was treated with cold 2N aqueous HCl and stirred for 30 minutes, resulting in solid precipitates in all the intermediates. These solids were filtered, washed with cold diethyl ether and cold pentane, and obtained as white solids. In most cases, the yield of solid was 70% to 80%. The remaining aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) and evaporated to obtain the remaining solids, leading to an increase in yield up to 80% to 90% in all the intermediates.
