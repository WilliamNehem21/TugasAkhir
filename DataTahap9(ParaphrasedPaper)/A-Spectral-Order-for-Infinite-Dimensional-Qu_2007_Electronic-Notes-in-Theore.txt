In 2002, Coecke and Martin introduced a Bayesian order for finite dimensional classical state spaces in physics, and subsequently applied this order to define a similar order, known as the spectral order, for finite dimensional quantum state spaces. These orders imbue the spaces with a structure analogous to that of a domain, facilitating the measurement of information content in states and the determination of approximations of partial states to pure states. In a prior publication, the author extended the Bayesian order to encompass infinite dimensional classical state spaces, but observed that while the order retained many important characteristics for physics, it lacked the domain theoretic structure. Consequently, the ability to measure information content in a manner similar to that for finite dimensional spaces was compromised, and the notion of approximation was forfeited. This paper aims to leverage the Bayesian order to define a spectral order for infinite dimensional quantum state spaces.
