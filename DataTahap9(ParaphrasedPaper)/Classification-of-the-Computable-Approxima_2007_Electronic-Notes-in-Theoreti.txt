In this section, we will present precise definitions of the key concepts discussed in this paper. Initially, we introduce the most general concept of (f, e, d)-effectively computable, followed by an explanation of how this concept can be reduced to the simpler notion of f-effectively computable in two steps. Consequently, it is sufficient to only investigate f-effective computability later on.

Another natural constraint on the modulus and distance function is that they must be nondecreasing. Therefore, in this paper, we only consider the unbounded nondecreasing modulus function e and distance function d. Even under this restriction, an (e, d)-divergence degree v can still be a non-monotonic function. However, since our interest lies solely in the bounding function f that bounds the function v, we also assume that the function f is nondecreasing when discussing the (f, e, d)-effective computability of real numbers.
