Railway operators face numerous intricate decision-making challenges in their pursuit of delivering high-quality service at a reasonable cost. One such issue is the shunting problem, which arises during off-peak periods when there is an excess of rolling stock, leading to the need to park passenger trains in a shunting depot, particularly during nighttime. Complicating this matter is the constraint on train movements imposed by the railway infrastructure of the depot, which comprises a collection of tracks and may be classified as a shunting yard or marshalling yard based on the type of tracks. In a shunting yard, each track is accessible from only one side, whereas in a marshalling yard, each track can be approached from both sides.

The existing literature on the shunting problem encompasses works by Winter and Zimmerman, as well as Blasum et al., on tram dispatching. Additionally, Gallo and Di Miele extend their research on bus dispatching by considering mixed arrivals and departures in a depot. The shunting problem for passenger train units is also addressed in various papers, which discuss different aspects of the problem and propose mathematical models. Furthermore, other papers focus on rearranging cars of trains in a train depot.

The paper is structured as follows: it begins with a section on notations and basic concepts, followed by a discussion in section 3 of the scenario where the last train arrives before the first departing train. Results related to four subproblems, arising from the imposition of certain constraints on arrival and departure directions, are presented in this section. Section 4 delves into the case of departures occurring before the last arrival, addressing both shunting and marshalling yards. The final section examines some open problems.

For the problems discussed in this paper, the assumption generally made is that the depot topology is marshalling, allowing each track to be approached from both sides. The lengths of trains and tracks are not taken into account, and it is assumed that each track can accommodate the assigned trains. Additionally, it is assumed that the first departure occurs after the last arrival, as may be the case in a depot used during nighttime.

The paper also touches upon the single input, single output (SISO) problem, which arises when each track can be approached from one side and exited from the other side, effectively functioning as queues. Furthermore, it addresses the scenario in which tracks are used as stacks, with the inputs and outputs of the trains occurring from a single side, which is characteristic of a shunting yard.

Additionally, the paper introduces the pigeonhole principle to assert the existence of si and sj such that f(si) = f(sj) for some i â‰  j. It then presents a lemma regarding the G-SISO problem on a shunting yard for a set of trains t, stating that this problem can be solved with k tracks if and only if there exists a k-coloring of g[i].
