Plants are widely used as sources of remedies for the treatment of a wide range of human diseases, with approximately 87% of diseases, including bacterial and fungal infections, cancer, and various disorders, being treated using plant-derived drugs. It is estimated that around 3000 species of plants worldwide have medicinal properties for treating curable and incurable diseases, and over 80% of people in developed and undeveloped countries rely on herbal remedies for primary health care. The Arabian Gulf region has a rich tradition of using herbal remedies as the primary source of health care, with Oman alone having about 1204 terrestrial plants used in traditional medicine. Compounds derived from plants continue to play a vital role in the development of new pharmaceutical entities entering the market or undergoing clinical trials annually, highlighting the urgent need for novel and effective ingredients to treat incurable diseases without adverse side effects.

In this study, various solvents, reagents, and standards were used, with the majority of solvents being purchased from Fisher Scientific and other chemicals obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The disc diffusion assay was used to determine the antibacterial activity of plant crude extracts against pathogenic bacterial strains, and significant inhibition zones were observed against all tested bacterial strains. The study revealed that non-polar organic solvent extracts were more potent due to the presence of antimicrobially active components that are not water soluble. Additionally, the chloroform crude extract of A. majus demonstrated significant antioxidant activity by the DPPH method, indicating the presence of polyphenolic compounds. The seed crude extracts inhibited the growth of several microbes in agar media, with notable inhibition against E. coli and S. aureus. Furthermore, the chloroform and hexane crude extracts exhibited strong cytotoxic activity against artemia cysts, with the mortality rate increasing with concentrations. Based on these findings, the screened plant showed potential antibacterial activity compared to commonly used antibiotics, suggesting the possibility of developing new drugs from readily available plant sources for disease treatment.

The authors expressed their gratitude to the Oman Research Council for providing funding through the FURAP project and to the University of Nizwa for providing laboratory and other facilities. They also thanked the staff from the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Laboratory, Pharmacognosy Laboratory, and Organic Chemistry Laboratory for their assistance, as well as Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim Yagi for editing the manuscript. Additionally, the paper by Throne et al. (1995) was referenced for probit analysis of correlated data.
