We introduce a category of local stochastic rewrite rules applied to directed site trees. We provide a concise representation of coarse-grained differential systems, often countably infinite, that characterize the behavior of these rules in the deterministic limit. Additionally, we investigate finite approximations based on truncations to a specific size in a straightforward scenario and demonstrate an application of this approach to model the dynamics of sugar polymers.

Consider proteins that are capable of binding through specific domains [17,14] to form an extensive variety of species, necessitating diverse methodologies and alternative perspectives on the protein world. This is where rule-based modeling comes into play. The fundamental idea is to represent basic molecules as sets of domains, consolidating the various reactions they can participate in into reaction classes or rules. This enables the description of highly complex systems in a concise manner without the need to enumerate a potentially infinite set of species. This concept has been formalized, examined, and implemented in two essentially equivalent languages, namely kappa and the bng language. Other formalisms, following the tradition of process algebras, utilize rules of slightly less direct expressivity but similar in their intentions, and possess the fundamental capability to handle unbounded sets of species.

We have selected these rules as a simple category that allows for a stylized depiction of the activities of different classes of enzymes involved in the polymerization and management of large sugar polymers. Please refer to the subsequent section for further justifications and elucidations regarding the biological context. Within the context of this paper, however, these rules mainly serve as a means to investigate infinite fragmentations, as mentioned earlier in the introduction.

Introducing deletions significantly alters the situation, as fragmentations generally become infinite. In fact, even with just "e's" and "b's," there are instances in which the fragmentations are infinite, as we will demonstrate. Additionally, unless specific constraints are imposed, chains are not closed under fragmentation. In particular, the right glueings on "d" described below allow branching on any free site, and "b" glueings will generate such sites. Thus, a significant conclusion from this section is that the simple "be" fragmentation space we have previously studied is somewhat atypical and does not fully represent the complexity of the general problem.

In order for this to be viable, one must be able to switch to a site that can also be co-extended. However, this would not be applicable to our previous example of sugar polymers from the preceding section, even with volume branching, as one would be moving away from the edges generated by "e" rules. Indeed, in this case, the fragmentation of the volume variant without deletion is finite.

Consequently, it is immediately evident that determining whether a given monomial is in the associated differential system to "s" is feasible. While the decision procedure outlined above could be made more efficient, the style of proof might be extended to cover the "b" case, although this has not been pursued yet.

We have defined a straightforward yet expressive set of kappa rules that operate on directed polymers, generating a type of coarse-graining known as fragmentations that generally result in infinite ODE systems. We have illustrated, through an example, the invaluable nature of such coarse-graining in studying the dynamics of our ideal tree polymers. Furthermore, we have encapsulated the generation of fragments (the variables featured in the coarse-grained ODE system) in a simple set of rewrite rules that leverage an extension of kappa to manipulate partial objects (trees, in our case). Lastly, we have demonstrated that the "ed" class yields predictable fragmentations.

Moving forward, the most crucial question before expanding to a broader class is how to define a truncated version. Decidability should ensure that syntactic truncations can be formulated, but as demonstrated, they may prove entirely futile due to their inability to propose consistent boundary conditions. Conversely, there is a desire for an appropriate version of Kurtz theory that elucidates why in certain cases, truncations serve as effective approximations.

Finally, there are inquiries pertaining to the algebraic aspects of the fragmentation expansion. For instance, it is essential to determine in which generic rewriting universe the operations underpinning the construction of generative rules are feasible and applicable to what specific rule class. Another aspect to consider is that the fragmentation process, as defined, is entirely syntactical and may generate observables that are not all linearly independent. In such instances, there is no necessity to incorporate the new fragment into the current inventory. Therefore, a pertinent question arises as to whether we can identify such scenarios and utilize them to streamline the aforementioned generation scheme.
