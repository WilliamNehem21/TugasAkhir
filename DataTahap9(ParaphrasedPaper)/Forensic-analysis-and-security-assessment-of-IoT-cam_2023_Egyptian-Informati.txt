The Internet of Things (IoT) faces unique challenges related to its firmware. These devices operate using a multitude of specialized microprocessors that handle various functions such as graphics, input response, and artificial intelligence. Each microprocessor runs its own firmware and may be compatible with multiple operating systems. The firmware layer enables IoT devices to perform their intended functions and ensures the proper operation of their physical components, including the device kernel, file system, and bootloader.

To address firmware stability, Son et al. (2019) proposed a novel firmware management architecture based on blockchain and the inter-planetary file system. This approach aims to secure firmware transmission and updates over blockchain networks, potentially improving the security level of IoT devices. Similarly, Thakur et al. (2019) developed a scheme for over-the-air firmware updates to efficiently upgrade connected IoT devices without physical access, enhancing device performance and security.

Furthermore, Zhu et al. (2020) focused on analyzing firmware codes in IoT terminals to identify harmful code, vulnerabilities, backdoors, and copyright protection. By applying a security detection solution based on code similarity and homology analyses, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing firmware security.

Other research works, such as that by Zhu et al. (2019), Jang et al. (2020), and Wang et al. (2021), also introduced innovative methods for analyzing, detecting, and managing IoT firmware to improve security and performance.

In addition, Ahmed et al. (2020) proposed a scalable approach to verify the security of IoT firmware against the Mirai threat, which was tested on over 1200 firmware images, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and improving resilience against potential attacks.

Notably, Almazrouei et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive investigation into the security and privacy flaws of Internet Protocol (IP) cameras, aiming to enhance cybersecurity awareness and preparedness in protecting individual homes against cyber threats.

The importance of implementing secure firmware upgrading mechanisms in IoT devices was underscored, as it can address critical security flaws and contribute to the overall cybersecurity resilience of society. It was emphasized that manufacturers and service providers play a crucial role in ensuring the security and privacy of IoT products, promoting responsible practices and trust in the IoT industry.

Overall, the research highlights the significance of addressing firmware security in IoT devices, leveraging innovative techniques and technologies to enhance their resilience against potential cybersecurity threats.
