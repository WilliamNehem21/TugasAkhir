Session types describe how two parties interact in multi-party communications by specifying the order and type of interactions. Correspondence assertions provide synchronization mechanisms, and when combined with session types, they can describe synchronization across different communication sessions, creating a rich language for expressing interaction patterns in multi-party communications.

Our society increasingly relies on processors to monitor and control devices in various aspects of life. These processors often communicate with each other, either within the same system or remotely, to govern their behavior. Reliable software governing these communications is crucial in critical areas such as space exploration, air traffic control, medical devices, banking, and electronic commerce.

We assume a set of names, including expression names (denoted as a, b, c, etc.) and channel names (denoted as k, h, k', etc.). The use of integer constants in assertions, such as "begin l" and "end l," helps in managing the synchronization obligations. Effects determine the lower bounds of the required "begin" assertions, and an empty effect correlates all "end" assertions with a corresponding "begin" assertion.

If we allow general arithmetic, which is not decidable, we aim to define a sound semi-decision procedure that avoids false positives or negatives. The algorithm should trace all information back to its sources when it asserts "yes." Conversely, if it asserts "no," the algorithm should demonstrate that the data does not originate from the intended source. Failure to terminate should not allow any deduction of information.

In this example, we simplify the assumption that an auctioneer can handle only one seller at a time and that at least one buyer should make a bid. We also disregard error capture and recovery scenarios. To initiate the operation, we assume the presence of an initial seller (dummyseller) and buyer (dummybuyer). When a new bidder arrives, the auctioneer reads the product, bid, and contact information from the buyer, then informs the buyer manager (buyermanager) that a new bidder has arrived and passes on the bidder and input data to the manager.

The "newbidder" operation, selected by the auctioneer when a new bidder arrives, involves the buyermanager reading the bid and comparing it to the current highest bid. Depending on the comparison result, the current highest bidder is informed of being outbid, or the new bidder is informed that their bid is too low. This process is carried out recursively as necessary.

Despite the bid operation placing a smaller bid than initially communicated to the auctioneer, the resulting electronic auction system is considered typable according to the pure theory of session types, under the same typing assumptions as the original system. However, other examples highlighting the limitations of the pure theory of session types are also discussed.
