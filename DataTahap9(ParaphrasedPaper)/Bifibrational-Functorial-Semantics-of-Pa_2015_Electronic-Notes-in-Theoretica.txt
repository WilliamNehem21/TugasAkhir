The proofs for both parts of lemma 5.6 follow a similar structure. They both utilize the graph functor to map commuting diagrams in b to morphisms in rel(e), and then leverage the graph lemma to demonstrate that these morphisms are fr-algebras. By considering lemma 5.5 and lemma 5.6 together, we can immediately derive the main result.
