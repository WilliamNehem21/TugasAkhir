In the seafood processing industry, measures are put in place to ensure the safety and quality of products. Various quality assurance standards, such as ISO, HACCP, QMP, and TQM, exist to guarantee the safety and quality of goods. The following sections of the paper are organized as follows: Section 2 details the materials and methods, including the design of ontologies, analysis of quality test parameter values, and proposed algorithms. Section 3 encompasses results and discussions, highlighting the data sets used, the performance of the algorithms on the selected data sets, and the values of performance metrics. Section 4 presents the conclusion, followed by references.

Ontologies define the semantics of concepts within a domain and can be developed using various methods. This research follows the approach proposed by Noy and McGuinness for the development of ontologies. While many ontologies are available in different domains, including the medical domain, there is a lack of relevant ontologies in the seafood domain. As a result, the ontologies used in the proposed model are developed from scratch.

Within the seafood ontology, the test specifications ontology comprises the microbiological, chemical, and organoleptic test standards (min_value and max_value). However, due to scalability issues, retrieving test standards directly from the ontology is time-consuming. To address this, a data store update algorithm is proposed to compute the permitted values for each test item, facilitating fast retrieval. The comparison algorithm then checks whether the value entered by the user is within the allowable range by comparing the test input value with min_value and max_value available in the data store.

The study utilizes data sets from seafood companies in Kerala, India, which export seafood and seafood products globally. These data sets, validated by the Marine Product Export Development Authority of India (MPEDA), include details of seafood purchased from various landing centers, microbiological, chemical, and organoleptic test details, and information on seafood exports to different countries. The experiment utilizes three datasets of seafood families: bony fish, cephalopods, and molluscs. Each family contains different types of seafood, with both valid and invalid data.

For the bony fish dataset, the algorithm correctly identified 37 test samples as true positives and ten samples as true negatives. However, it incorrectly flagged two valid test samples as having problems and misidentified three invalid test samples as within the allowable limit. This research was presented by P.V. Vinu, P.C. Sherimon, and K. Reshmy at the 2015 International Conference on Advanced Research in Computer Science Engineering & Technology (ICARCSET 2015).
