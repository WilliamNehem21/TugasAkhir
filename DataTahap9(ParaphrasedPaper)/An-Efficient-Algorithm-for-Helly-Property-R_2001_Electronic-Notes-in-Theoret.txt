The concept of the helly property, which originated with C. Berge, has evolved into a wide-ranging area of study and is considered one of the most significant concepts in hypergraph theory. It has been the subject of rigorous investigation for many years and has been found to be a common characteristic in various classes of set systems, including balanced hypergraphs, unimodular hypergraphs, normal hypergraphs, and arboreal hypergraphs.

Recently, the helly property has also demonstrated its relevance in the field of image analysis. It emerged as a term in the study of geometric properties of digital images, extending the geometric concept of visibility. Consequently, in image processing, this property can be viewed as a measure of local uniformity. This article aims to present some findings related to this property, including the development of a polynomial algorithm for determining whether a linear hypergraph possesses the helly property.

One well-known theorem related to this concept is attributed to Edward Helly. It is evident that a specific instance of the helly type theorem is the helly property. Notably, this property manifests in various mathematical disciplines; for instance, in arithmetic, the Chinese remainder theorem can be interpreted as asserting that arithmetic progressions exhibit the helly property. Similarly, families of intervals in a lattice also form examples of the helly property. Additionally, the computational aspects of this property have been underscored in discrete geometry and computational geometry, firmly establishing the helly property as a fundamental concept in hypergraph theory due to its prevalence across multiple classes of hypergraphs.
