L-systems, which were first introduced in the 1970s to simulate biological development, revolutionized the use of parallel string rewriting and significantly advanced both formal language theory and life sciences [4, 7]. Another model known as splicing systems, which has recently emerged from biological considerations, aims to model certain recombination behaviors of DNA molecules and is currently the subject of active interest and research.

Conversely, in the realm of syntactic approaches to the generation and recognition of digitized images or pictures represented as arrays, numerous two-dimensional grammars have been proposed and investigated. A generative model extending the rewriting concept of L-systems to arrays was put forth in a previous work. Additionally, an elegant generalization of the notion of local and recognizable string languages to two-dimensional picture languages was accomplished in another study. Notably, Krithivasan and colleagues further extended the concept of splicing to arrays and defined array splicing systems.

The simplicity of handling splicing systems when compared to other generative mechanisms of picture languages is examined in this paper. Moreover, the paper considers certain closure results under geometric operations and language-theoretic operations. The explorations initiated in this study may prove beneficial in further analyzing the structure of images.
