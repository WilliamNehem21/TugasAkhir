Probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) have become highly significant in complexity theory. They offer a fresh characterization of the complexity class NP and also demonstrate a profound connection to approximations of combinatorial optimization problems. This study explores the concept of PCPs in the real number model developed by Blum, Shub, and Smale. The existence of transparent lengthy proofs for the real number analogue NPr of NP is examined.

In 1989, Blum, Shub, and Smale introduced a uniform real number model of computation called the BSS machine, aiming to parallelize structural complexity theory over finite alphabets and integrate approaches in algebraic complexity theory. Subsequently, much work has been carried out in the BSS model, with various textbooks offering comprehensive insights into the problems considered within this framework.

In this context, the focus is not on approximation concerns as addressed in numerical analysis, as such a concept may result in issues in the original BSS model unless analytic functions are introduced. Consequently, a more combinatorial notion is deemed appropriate.

Verifiers are now utilized to define PCP and PCPR complexity classes. As the latter are newly introduced, this paper exclusively provides the definition for the real classes. The PCP classes in the Turing framework are similarly defined, with the obvious terms in the BSS setting being replaced by those in the Turing model.
