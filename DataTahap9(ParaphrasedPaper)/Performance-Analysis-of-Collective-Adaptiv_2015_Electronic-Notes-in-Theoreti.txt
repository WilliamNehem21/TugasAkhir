The development of increasingly large-scale, geographically distributed information and communication technology (ICT) systems is aimed at supporting various human activities. This can be viewed as the realization of the informatics environment foreseen by Milner and Weiser. Such systems involve human agents interacting seamlessly with computing elements, as exemplified by applications like smart transportation, smart grid, and modern automotive systems deployed in smart cities.

Given the transparency and pervasiveness of these systems, it is more important than ever to thoroughly study their behavior from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives before deployment. Ongoing work, such as the Quanticol project, focuses on developing formalisms to model the behavior of these systems. In this paper, we initiate a complementary investigation into the types of measures that can be derived from spatio-temporal systems. We advocate for a radical approach that explicitly models and fully utilizes space when characterizing system behavior.

For example, we consider a scenario where movement occurs on a torus, with a distinguished leader and follower agents. The followers aim to mimic the leader's movement while maintaining a minimum distance and avoiding collisions. We explore various scenarios of increasing complexity, illustrating our points using the Paloma process algebra, designed for modeling spatially distributed collective and adaptive systems.

Additionally, we examine perception functions that influence the likelihood of induced actions based on the states and action types of the agents. We introduce multiple followers into the system to observe collective behavior and modify perception functions to ensure avoidance of collisions among followers.

Furthermore, we discuss different types of measures that are relevant for analyzing spatio-temporal systems, including state-based measures that consider the probability of certain properties holding, and rate-based measures that focus on the rates of the system, such as throughput and collision probabilities.

We also emphasize the dimensions of state and time as fundamental aspects of system behavior analysis. In this context, we explore how spatial information can be integrated into measures of interest, such as spatial utilization.

Finally, we highlight the importance of studying systems that exhibit both temporal and spatial behaviors, particularly in the context of collective adaptive systems (CAS). To illustrate these concepts, we present a study of a simple leader-follower system across various scenarios. This research provides insights into the types of measures that are valuable for analyzing CAS, which are distributed systems composed of interacting autonomous agents.
