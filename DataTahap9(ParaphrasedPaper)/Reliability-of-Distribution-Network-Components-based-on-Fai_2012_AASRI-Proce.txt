The academic paper focuses on the computation of reliability parameters for components in distribution networks. Understanding these parameters is crucial for reliability calculations and reliability-centered maintenance systems in power networks. Accurate databases maintained by distribution companies are necessary for retrieving component reliability parameters, which are derived from records of outages and interruptions in power networks. However, the heterogeneity of the data makes direct retrieval of reliability parameters challenging. The paper presents findings from database calculations and applies a framework for retrieving parameters from outage data in the Czech and Slovak Republics, including actual results.

An analysis of failure durations revealed that the most significant failure rates are due to mismanaged service and operation. The impact of these failures on reliability was computed for all components, using a method similar to that described in the previous chapter, with the difference that the time to repair used for computation is not limited to one month.
