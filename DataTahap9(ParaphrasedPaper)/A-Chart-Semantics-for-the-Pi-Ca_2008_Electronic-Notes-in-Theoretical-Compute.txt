This research paper explores an alternative approach using MSCs (Message Sequence Charts) as a formal semantics to represent potential execution histories of known code within the context of the pi-calculus. The pi-calculus is a process calculus, and typically, its semantics are specified using a reaction or reduction relation, or as a labeled transition system. However, the paper proposes using MSCs as an alternative.

To illustrate the potential benefits of using chart semantics for the pi-calculus, the paper presents a simple example involving a stateful server and client interactions, which are then visually represented using a pi-chart. The pi-chart depicts interactions between a server and two clients, offering a two-dimensional representation that facilitates the visualization of the system's evolution and individual process threads.

Additionally, the paper discusses how charts can effectively illustrate biological reactions expressed in the pi-calculus and presents a case study demonstrating how properties expressible with pi-charts can be proven. Furthermore, the paper discusses the formalization of pi-charts, introduces the set of processes, and establishes formal links between MSCs and the semantics of security protocol languages, particularly the SPL (Security Protocol Language).

The paper also discusses the potential use of verification tools for proving properties about the set of all charts generated by a given process, which could be beneficial for validating high-level protocols expressed as pi-calculus processes. Lastly, the paper presents a specific example of how a chart depicts a genetic process involving the transcription of proteins and the regulation of gene expression.
