In this paper, we establish a framework for precisely determining when a logic can support a classical modal expansion. We consider a fully self-extensional logic S and identify sufficient conditions under which the Vietoris endofunctor V can be defined on S-referential algebras. We propose to define the modal expansions of S as the logic that arises from the V-coalgebras. Additionally, we demonstrate how the Vietoris endofunctor on referential algebras extends the Vietoris endofunctor on stone spaces.

We examine systems whose state space can be represented by a set X along with an algebra A of subsets of X. The elements of A are viewed as admissible predicates over X, or the observations that can be made of states in X, with the algebra's operations reflecting the ability to construct new observations using logical connectives. This interpretation, along with the analogy with topological spaces, leads us to classify these structures as referential algebras.

The construction of V_X is well-known and presented in section 3. The primary contribution of this paper is the construction of V_A, motivated by the logical interpretation of referential algebras as models for self-extensional logics and utilizing the duality theory for self-extensional logics.

Referential algebras are complete with respect to their corresponding class of referential algebras, and interderivability captures the intensional identity of meaning in a compositional way for self-extensional logics. We note that self-extensional logics can be seen as generalizing modal logics, although many logics, such as classical and intuitionistic propositional logics, are also self-extensional. This paper initiates an investigation into the relationship between self-extensional logics and modalities.

The key contribution of this paper is the construction of the Vietoris endofunctor on S-referential algebras. We also explore the relationship between this construction and the Vietoris endofunctors on certain classes of topological spaces, such as stone and priestley spaces. We demonstrate a natural extension of these constructions based on the representation of topological spaces as referential algebras. This duality between algebraic logic and S-referential algebras preserves logical content, which uniformly extends known dualities, including the stone and priestley ones.

In this section, we illustrate the construction of the Vietoris endofunctor on referential algebras corresponding to stone spaces, showing that it extends the familiar definition of the Vietoris endofunctor K on stone spaces. This construction has implications for various modal expansions, including n-ary modal operators, and suggests a systematic methodology for defining endofunctors on referential algebras. Extending the definitions of other hyperspace topologies to endofunctors on referential algebras could be a promising launch point for a comprehensive investigation into modal expansions.
