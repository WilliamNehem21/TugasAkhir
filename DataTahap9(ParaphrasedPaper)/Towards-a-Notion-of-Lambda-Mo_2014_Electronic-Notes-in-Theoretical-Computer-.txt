I will first provide a definition of algebraic theory that closely parallels the definitions for operads or symmetric operads. Similar to the definition of operads, there is a significant amount of underlying structure to explicate. This complexity presents a compelling case in favor of the abstract approach.

To conclude, I present my preferred category theoretic definition of algebraic theory. It is evident that, with the aforementioned definitions, each cartesian operad yields an algebraic theory. Conversely, given an algebraic theory T, it is straightforward to retrieve the corresponding cartesian operad. The category theoretic definition of algebraic theory carries the advantage of brevity in comparison to the operadic definition, while still emphasizing the essential aspect of functoriality. Therefore, I simply refer to it as an algebraic theory. Nonetheless, if one chooses to disregard the category theoretic viewpoint, a simple and elementary formulation is sufficient.

We have our identity, projections, and compositions, and the need for unit and associativity laws. I have abstained from presenting these laws for the monoid to address them collectively. I will first present the unit laws, expanding upon those for the monoid, which require occasional modifications to account for the retraction. I present them in a manner that aligns with the laws as presented in section 3.3. The left laws are as follows.
