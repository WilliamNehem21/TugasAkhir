This academic paper discusses the challenges and approaches to integrating geographic information systems (GIS) that are spread across multiple sources. It highlights the problem of semantic heterogeneity and focuses on the process of schema integration, particularly semantic enrichment and mapping discovery. The authors propose an approach that utilizes ontologies to reconcile semantic differences and find similarities between elements of different but related ontologies.

The paper reviews various existing approaches related to semantic matching, such as ontology-merging tools, and describes the use of lexical and conceptual layers to find similarities in ontologies. It also discusses the use of reasoning systems and formal ontologies to integrate data schema and the application of description logic for ontology representation. Furthermore, the paper compares its proposed approach with existing literature and outlines an architecture and process for integrating geographic sources, utilizing both logic and non-logic tasks.

The authors also present a case study illustrating the application of their method to integrate two geographic sources managed by different organizations. They emphasize that their method combines both logic and non-logic processes, allowing for the representation and comparison of more properties of the ontologies. The main advantage of their method is seen in this combination, as mappings or implicit relations found in one process are taken into account by the other to build a new integrated system.
