The selection of network topologies significantly impacts the performance of wireless sensor nodes in WSNs, primarily due to their limited battery power. When sensor nodes exhaust their energy, data transmission becomes unavailable, leading to network fragmentation. In response to these challenges, our research not only addresses topology selection but also introduces recharging and load balancing concepts to prolong the network's lifespan. Our proposed solution involves UAVs moving to predetermined anchor points to recharge nodes within their transmission range, considering both recharging demand and data gathering performance in the UAV's migration tour.

WSNs are a subset of sensor networks comprising a sink node (base station) and battery-operated wireless sensor nodes. The sink node typically has higher data storage and processing capabilities compared to other nodes in the WSN. Various components, such as sensor nodes, gateways, bridges, aggregators, and sink nodes, are integral to WSNs, enabling smart sensing, information gathering, processing, and communication within the network. Routers facilitate data packet forwarding between computer networks, while gateways perform protocol translation across different networks at any network layer. Bridges connect multiple network segments at the data link layer, and sink nodes are responsible for data reduction.

While star and ring topologies outperform cluster topology, they present distinct energy-saving and communication fragmentations. Notably, ring topology offers reliable and long-lasting communication, making it a suitable choice for WSNs. We integrated ring topology into an existing approach to enhance performance, as evidenced by statistical data favoring ring topology over star and cluster topologies.

We propose utilizing regular topologies—such as bus, ring, star, cluster, and hybrid topologies—in wireless recharging sensor networks (WRSNs) to improve overall performance. Notably, such topologies provide predefined trajectories for mobile nodes to accurately locate and recharge nodes. Subsequent analysis of existing approaches revealed reduced throughput and residual energy. To address these limitations, we implemented 3sm for testing its effectiveness in comparison to existing approaches in WSNs.
