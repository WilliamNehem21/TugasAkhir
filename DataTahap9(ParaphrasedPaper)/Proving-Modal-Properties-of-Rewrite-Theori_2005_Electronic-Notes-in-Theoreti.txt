Rewriting logic offers a powerful formalism for describing concurrent and distributed systems, serving as a logic of change. Conversely, VLRL is a modal logic that is constructed on top of rewriting logic and aims to precisely reason about such changes. In this paper, we introduce a method for mechanically demonstrating VLRL properties of rewrite theories by leveraging the reflective capability of rewriting logic through its implementation in Maude.

In summary, rewriting logic provides a formal framework for modeling concurrent systems based on states and state transitions, efficiently implemented in the Maude system. It serves as a logic of change, with deduction directly corresponding to these changes. On the other hand, Verification Logic for Rewriting Logic (VLRL) is an action modal logic designed to address change in a more indirect and global manner, similar to other modal and temporal logics. VLRL was developed specifically to prove abstract properties of systems specified in rewriting logic.
