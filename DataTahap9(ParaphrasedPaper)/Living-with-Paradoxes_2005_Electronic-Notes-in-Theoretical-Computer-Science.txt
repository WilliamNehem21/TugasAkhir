A well-designed knowledge representation system must strike a balance between expressive power and efficient reasoning, while also acknowledging its limitations and challenges. Introducing strings into a logical framework enhances its expressiveness and facilitates natural representations, enabling appropriate reasoning patterns. However, such a system's ability to formulate self-referential paradoxes presents both a strength and a weakness. While it is advantageous to represent paradoxes formulated in natural language, caution must be exercised to prevent trivializing the logical system. This paper explores various aspects of knowledge representation that allow for self-referentiality and introduces a pragmatic compromise between expressive power and the simplicity and efficiency of the reasoning processâ€”a three-valued system that incorporates reasoning techniques from classical first-order logic.

The subsequent section will formalize our system, followed by a clarification of the concept of a paradox in section 3. Section 4 will delve into three-valued Kleene logic, the chosen system for addressing paradoxes, while section 5 will outline an efficient reasoning approach for the three-valued system. Related work will be discussed in section 6, and the paper will conclude with a summary.

The language under examination is a standard first-order sorted language augmented with strings as terms. In addition to the conventional framework, we incorporate strings into the language by representing characters as constant symbols prefixed by a colon.

Typically, the semantics of a language is discussed at this juncture. However, the meaning of syntactic theory in our case is intricate, posing a significant challenge with this language. Consequently, we first seek to develop an intuitive understanding of the semantics before delving into a more detailed discussion on constructing such a system.

Attempts to address paradoxes using many-valued logics or by introducing additional truth values are not novel. Bochvar made a similar attempt in 1939, but Church pointed out that the same problems could easily be reconstructed in the three-valued setting. While adding more truth values may solve the problem, it results in a loss of intuitive meaning associated with these values.

Nevertheless, if we confine the language to a system wherein each function derived from the connectives has at least one fixpoint, it becomes impossible to construct self-referential paradoxes. This restriction appears to be relatively minor, as it is infrequently necessary to communicate paradoxicality. If the need arises, one would have to adopt a four-valued setting, albeit this would introduce higher-order paradoxes.

This culminates in a calculus for first-order Kleene logic in general. Handling quoted expressions necessitates the incorporation of axiom schemas that describe the semantics of the meta-predicates defined on them. For instance, with the truth predicate "true," additional rules or corresponding axiom schemas would need to be added.

To summarize, we have presented a framework for expressing truths, with the possibility of extending it to accommodate knowledge and belief by adding further axiom schemas. This system does not impose artificial limitations on expressive power to avoid self-referential statements. Section 5 demonstrates that standard calculi can be employed. While we have not provided a formal fixpoint construction for the true predicate in this work, we have indicated why such fixpoints exist. Building upon the work of Kripke, Barwise, Etchemendy, and Moss, this should be feasible, but is deferred to future research.
