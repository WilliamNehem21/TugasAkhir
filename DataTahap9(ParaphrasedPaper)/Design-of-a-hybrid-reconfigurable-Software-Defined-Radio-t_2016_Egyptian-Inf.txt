The polymorphic instance utilizes a specific number of pulse shaping samples per symbol to determine the desired samples per symbol for the pulse-shaping filter. If the pulse-shaping filter is employed for demodulation, it is essential for the parameter value to align with the samples per symbol element in the system parameters cluster that is passed to the demodulation VI. An even number greater than 2 should be specified for the matched samples per symbol. This parameter also needs to match the samples per symbol element in the system parameters cluster that is passed to the digital demodulation VI. Additionally, an even number greater than 2 should be specified for the matched samples per symbol. The pulse shaping filter coefficients provide an ordered array of filter coefficients that correspond to the desired filter response for the pulse-shaping filter used in modulation. These calculated filter coefficients are utilized during modulation to reduce the transmitted signal's bandwidth and during demodulation to decrease inter symbol interference. The pulse shaping filter can be employed for either transmission or for demodulation of FSK modulated signals, whereas the matched filter is solely used for demodulation. The VI calculates the filter's impulse response using specific formulas.

A LabVIEW-based interactive software defined radio system has been developed in a shorter timeframe compared to other text-based programming languages. This design demonstrates that data errors can be minimized using coding techniques, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Observing the results reveals that turbo coding offers enhanced data error minimization compared to convolution coding. In conclusion, it can be inferred that the signal can be recovered with a significantly lower probability of error using turbo coding than with convolution coding, especially with an increase in the number of levels at the destination.
