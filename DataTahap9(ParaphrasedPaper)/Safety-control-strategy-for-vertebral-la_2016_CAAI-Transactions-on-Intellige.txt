Recent developments in science and technology have led to the utilization of various robotic systems in the medical field. In particular, surgical robots have seen extensive application in orthopedic surgeries such as laminectomy, total knee arthroplasty, and artificial disc replacement. Spinal surgery, in particular, is considered high-risk due to the potential for damage to the spinal cord, which can result in severe consequences for patients. Traditionally, spinal surgeries have been performed manually, leading to long duration times that may cause surgeon fatigue and reduce the quality of the procedure.

Laminectomy, a common surgical procedure for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, involves the removal of a portion of the vertebral lamina to alleviate pressure on the spinal nerve and restore spinal cord function. The success of laminectomy hinges on ensuring the appropriate amount of lamina remains, as too little can harm the spinal canal and nerves while too much may not achieve the desired decompression effect.

Efforts have been made to develop a spinal surgical robot capable of real-time force sensing during the pedicle screw insertion process, as well as the implementation of safety control strategies for vertebral lamina milling. To achieve this, researchers have utilized a fuzzy force control theory to maintain constant horizontal milling force and employ vertical milling force to distinguish bone layer structures. Experiments conducted on pig vertebra samples have demonstrated the advantages of this fuzzy force control strategy in adapting the milling depth based on tangential milling force, ensuring the safety of the operation.

The study also conducted experiments to establish the relationship between axial force and state recognition during milling operations on samples from various animal vertebrae. This research represents a significant advancement in the field of surgical robots, with potential implications for improving the safety and precision of spinal surgeries.
