The study demonstrates the decidability of the model checking problem for (weakly extended) process rewrite systems when properties are specified using LTL formulae with temporal operators "strict eventually" and "strict always." Additionally, the paper poses an open question regarding the decidability of the problem when the set of properties is expanded to include past counterparts of the operators. The paper provides an affirmative response to this question.
