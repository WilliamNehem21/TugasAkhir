The paper explores the concept of confluence within the framework of bigraphs, emphasizing its relevance in the modeling of real-world systems, encompassing both natural (e.g., biological) and artificial (e.g., pervasive computing) systems. Utilizing bigraphs with names possessing multiple localities, the paper presents a formulation of the lambda calculus featuring explicit substitutions. Furthermore, it outlines ongoing work aimed at identifying conditions within a bigraphical reactive system that guarantee confluence, taking into account the complex intertwining of bigraphical redexes. These conditions are expected to be applicable to the lambda calculus as well. The paper also introduces two conjectures following the discussion of these issues.
