About 300 years ago, Damietta is now a significant industrial hub of Egypt, and its importance has grown with the establishment of a new container platforms harbor along the Mediterranean Sea in the 1980s. The Damietta governorate consists of four administrative centers: Kafr Saad, Faraskour, El-Zarka, and Damietta city, with a population of about 1.3 million people, most of whom reside in Damietta city.

The region experiences an arid climate with an aridity index of 0.07 according to the UNESCO classification of arid lands, with agricultural land significantly outweighing precipitation rates. The maximum evapotranspiration occurs in June with a total annual evapotranspiration of 1374 mm, and the wind is generally bimodal.

The soils in Damietta exhibit diverse characteristics, and a comprehensive soil classification system is used to categorize them based on their distinctive features. The American soil classification system is widely used for this purpose. Land assessment is also an important focus for soil scientists, with the Storie Index (SI) being a widely accepted soil rating system that considers various soil characteristics like profile, texture, slope, and soil conditions such as salinity.

Understanding land use and land cover is vital for planning and management activities, and land cover maps are developed from local to global scales using satellite data and aerial photographs. NASA's Landsat series of satellites has been instrumental in this effort, with the latest one being Landsat-8, launched in 2013. The study aims to highlight the spatial distribution of barren lands in Damietta, evaluate soil quality in these areas, and assess their suitability for different land uses.

Factors of soil formation at Damietta, including parent materials, climate, topography, biota, and time, were examined to understand soil maturity in the region. The soils were classified using the American system of soil classification, and a soil rating index was determined using the Storie's index, considering factors such as soil profile, texture, slope, and salinity. The region's soils have characteristics shaped by the Nile's deltaic sediments and sands along the coastal strip.

The study also delves into soil properties such as electrical conductivity, pH, available potassium, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, and action in the soil profile. The salinity of agricultural lands is lower due to their origin from Nile sediments and the quality of irrigation water, while soils along Lake Manzala shores have higher salinity. The study found the majority of soil sediments to have a near-neutral pH and varying levels of available potassium, available phosphorus, and total nitrogen across different soil types.

The classification of soils in Damietta revealed the presence of one soil order (Entisols) with three suborders (Fluvents, Psamments, and Aquents), and five classes of soil Storie's index â€“ excellent, good, fair, poor, and very poor. The study also highlights the potential for managing high-salinity soils in particular areas by growing swamp vegetation in basins after primary treatment of domestic wastewater.

Overall, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of the environmental and soil characteristics in Damietta, offering valuable insights into soil classification, land use assessment, and soil properties in the region.
