This paper introduces version 1.5 of the Maude Termination Tool (MTT), which is designed to assess the termination of Maude programs by employing various transformation techniques and utilizing existing termination tools as backend resources. MTT is capable of utilizing any termination tool that supports the TPDB syntax, either locally if it adheres to the rules for the termination competition, or remotely as web services, enabling consistent interaction with different tools and avoiding confinement to a specific toolset. As a result, tools that have partaken in the competition, such as AProVE, MU-TERM, and TTT, as well as others conforming to the syntax and interaction format, can serve as backends for MTT. Within the MTT infrastructure, Maude specifications can be proven terminating by employing distinct formal tools, empowering users to select the most suitable tool for each specific case, a combination of tools, or alternative options in cases where a particular tool fails to provide proof.

Users have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate transformation technique for each specific scenario. For instance, a Maude specification's termination can be demonstrated by transforming a Sugared Rewrite Theory (SRWT) into a Context-Sensitive Term Rewrite System (CS-TRS), which can be processed by tools like AProVE and MU-TERM, through the combination of diverse transformations. Alternatively, multiple paths can be pursued, such as transforming a Context-Sensitive Membership Conditional Term Rewriting System (CS-MCTRS) into a Context-Sensitive Conditional Term Rewriting System (CS-CTRS) using Transformation A (which can be complete, discard information on kinds, or discard all information on sorts), or into a Context-Sensitive Order-Sorted Conditional Term Rewriting System (CS-OSCTRS) using the OS transformation.
