The concept of magic labelings has practical applications in communication networks, where each communication line is assigned a unique identifier to prevent collisions and ensure security. A key requirement is that the sum of the identifiers of the line and the two connecting devices remains constant throughout the network. Additionally, magic labelings are utilized in the use of radar impulses for measuring distances between objects.

This study explores edge-magic labelings in certain configurations of star forests and caterpillar forests. A star forest is defined as a collection of stars, and it is noted that a star forest with an even number of edges is not super edge-magic. The focus is on symmetric star forests, where each size of stars occurs in an even quantity except for at most one size.

The main result of the study (Theorem 2.2) shows that every odd symmetric star forest possesses a super edge-magic labeling, thus providing a positive outcome toward a conjecture. Moreover, the labeling demonstrated in this result is also special super edge-magic, which pertains to a labeling of a bipartite graph with specific properties. An open problem is posed regarding the characterization of star forests that admit special super edge-magic labelings.

The proof outlines an inductive approach based on the number of vertices in the symmetric star forest. It demonstrates that for every edge uv, the sum of the labels assigned to u, v, and uv is constant, and also establishes that all labels assigned by the labeling are different and within a specific range.

In conclusion, the study makes significant contributions to understanding edge-magic labelings in certain types of forests and addresses open problems in the field.
