To comprehensively understand the typical aerodynamic parameters of a icicle-shaped conductor, a thorough theoretical analysis is conducted. The dynamics of the iced conductor are examined using wind tunnel tests, varying the thickness of the ice and the speed of the wind. The research systematically analyzes the aerodynamic parameters under different conditions of iced conductors, providing detailed results of the characteristic parameters.

The tests are conducted in a 1.4x1.4m open-type closed test section wind tunnel with wind speeds ranging from 10m/s to 65m/s. A three-component balance (FGC03A/FGC3B) is used to measure forces, and a PXI data acquisition system, along with an industrial control computer, controls and records the data of attack angle and speed pressure.
