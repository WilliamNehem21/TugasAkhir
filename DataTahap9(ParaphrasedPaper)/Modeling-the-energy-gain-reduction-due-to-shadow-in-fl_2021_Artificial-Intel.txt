Flat-plate solar collectors commonly utilize one or two layers of transparent glass positioned above the absorber plate to minimize convective air flow losses (Duffie and Beckman, 2013). Although increasing the distance between the transparent glass and the absorber plate reduces convective losses, it also casts shadows on the absorbent plate, diminishing solar radiation absorption and consequently decreasing overall performance (Farhadi and Taki, 2020). Previous research has suggested a distance between 4 and 5 cm (Nahar and Garg, 1980), and the optimal distance can be determined through shadow estimation, as previously demonstrated by Farhadi and Taki (2020). In this study, the authors propose an efficient and accurate method for estimating the reduction in energy gain in flat-plate solar collectors due to shadows, using artificial intelligence (AI).

In a separate study, Ghritlahre and Prasad (2018) developed multilayer perceptron (MLP) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models to forecast the heat transfer in two different types of roughened solar air heaters. The findings indicated that MLP models with a 5-10-1 topology could predict heat transfer characteristics with greater accuracy (R2 = 0.9953) compared to MLR. Furthermore, an ANN-MLP model was used to predict the performance of a solar chimney filled with phase change materials, demonstrating a high correlation coefficient above 0.99 between actual and predicted data, as well as a relative error of less than 3%.
