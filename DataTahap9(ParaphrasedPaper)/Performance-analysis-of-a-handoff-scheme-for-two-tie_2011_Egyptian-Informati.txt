This research paper presents a two-tier model implemented in cellular networks to enhance quality of service (QoS) by reducing the blocking probability of new calls and forced termination probability of ongoing calls. The model utilizes microcells for slow or stationary users and macrocells for high-speed users. In code-division multiple-access (CDMA) cellular systems with soft handoffs, a channel borrowing scheme is introduced in conjunction with a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue in the macrocell tier to further improve QoS. A multidimensional Markov chain is established to model the resulting system, and an iterative technique is used to determine the steady-state probability distribution, which is then employed to calculate performance metrics such as new call blocking probability and forced termination probability.

The paper proposes a channel borrowing handoff scheme based on the mobility of calls in a two-tier cellular CDMA network. In this scheme, if a handoff call arrives at a cell with no available channels, a channel is borrowed from a call in the corresponding group of that cell, or the handoff call is placed into a queue if no channels are available. Analysis of the performance of the scheme using the Markov chain model and an iterative method reveals that it decreases the blocking probability of low-speed calls by an average of 12% and high-speed calls by an average of 9%, while reducing the forced termination probability of low-speed calls by an average of 0.1% and high-speed calls by an average of 26%.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the classification of calls based on the speed of mobile stations (MSs) and the handoff process between cells in a two-tier cellular network, considering the make-before-break scenario for MSs and the division of CDMA cells into handoff and non-handoff regions. Additionally, it examines the differences in performance improvement between high-speed and low-speed calls due to the channel borrowing scheme, attributing the greater improvement in high-speed calls to their higher mobility and handoff frequency compared to low-speed calls. The paper also presents an overview of the proposed model and discusses the evaluation of the scheme through numerical results, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving QoS without compromising system throughput.
