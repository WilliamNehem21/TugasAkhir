We have developed an approach that allows users to define and modify deformations using a mouse interface within an editor, streamlining the editing process and enhancing visual representation. By utilizing prismatic cells, we have reduced the number of control grid points, facilitating easier deformation editing and visualization. Our experimental findings indicate that this method is both uncomplicated and efficient.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 outlines related works, while Section 3 introduces concepts related to spline surfaces, C0 and C1 continuity, and local control. In Section 4, we present the methodology employed in this study, and Section 5 showcases our experimental results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with discussions and future avenues of research.

We have delineated an effective 2.5D deformation method for 3D microorganism models, utilizing a control grid composed of prisms and splines with arbitrary degrees. This method enables convenient deformation editing while preserving surface continuity during the process. Our experimental results illustrate the capability to simulate various biological structure deformations.

In future research, we intend to concentrate on control mesh editing and deformation techniques to facilitate the representation of common coarse deformations. One potential extension involves implementing a method that supports multi-scale editing, as well as exploring a space deformation technique based on curves where each point represents a group of control points. Additionally, we aim to explore the integration of volume-preserving constraints and the avoidance of self-intersections.
