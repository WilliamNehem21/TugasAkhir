The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis L.) is a significant pest that primarily feeds on cotton plants and has led to economic losses exceeding $23 billion in the U.S. since its introduction from Mexico in the 1890s (Harden, 2018). Although the National Boll Weevil Eradication Program has successfully eliminated the boll weevil from major parts of the U.S., the southern regions of Texas, specifically the Lower Rio Grande Valley, remain susceptible to re-infestation due to their subtropical climate and proximity to the Mexican border. Consequently, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) equipped with leftover spray are used to target the boll weevil in these regions, with malathion being the pesticide of choice despite its potential human and environmental hazards. To address this, the detection and precise location of volunteer cotton (VC) plants within rotation crops is crucial for targeted pesticide application. A study was conducted to investigate the use of remote sensing imagery from UAS, employing the YOLOv5 algorithm, to detect VC plants in corn fields at different growth stages, and to provide insights into improving the accuracy and practicality of the system for boll weevil management in agricultural settings.

This research aimed to compare the performance of different variants of YOLOv5 in detecting VC plants at various growth stages (V3, V6, and VT) of corn plants. The study is an extension of previous work which successfully used YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 for VC plant detection at a single growth stage of corn plants.

The experimental setup involved planting Phytogen 350 W3FE cotton seeds and other varieties in the corn fields of Weslaco, as well as in a test field in Burleson County. The study identified an imbalance between the instances of VC plants and the background class (i.e., corn with weeds) at all three growth stages of corn. As a result, classifiers tended to favor the majority class, highlighting the need for addressing this imbalance in future iterations.

The study also pointed out the tradeoff between detection accuracy and survey area coverage, with higher flight altitudes leading to compromised spatial resolution and detection accuracy. Nonetheless, it recommended surveying at the V3 growth stage, as it resulted in detecting VC plants in a larger area, suggesting that improving detection accuracy through preprocessing techniques could make the system more viable and practical for personnel involved in the boll weevil eradication program.
