In today's educational landscape, there is a significant push to improve the learning process by integrating new technologies, with the goal of enabling students to better understand educational materials. Various theories have been developed in pursuit of this objective, and some of these theories have been translated into digital systems. However, a challenge lies in creating a system that harmoniously integrates multiple such theories for the benefit of the student community. This paper seeks to address this challenge by proposing a novel system that combines the core characteristics of three well-established educational theories - learning objects, collaborative learning, and mobile learning - within the context of teaching and learning cultural heritage. The results of the evaluation suggest that such an endeavor is technically feasible, with the integrated features of the educational theories remaining accessible to educators of cultural heritage courses. Additionally, educators in the cultural heritage domain have expressed a positive attitude towards the potential incorporation of the proposed platform into the educational process.

The development of a unified digital learning environment for cultural heritage courses, incorporating characteristics derived from collaborative learning theory, mobile learning theory, and learning objects theory, is grounded in the principles of these approved educational theories. Collaborative learning theory advocates for student collaboration and active participation, while mobile learning theory emphasizes the effective use of mobile technology for teaching and learning both inside and outside the classroom. Learning objects theory, on the other hand, provides guidance for creating reusable, aggregation-ready, independent, and metadata-enriched educational content. These theories have been successfully implemented in numerous educational software applications and serve as the foundation for this work.

Several examples in the literature demonstrate the feasibility of integrating and adapting the characteristics of collaborative learning theory, mobile learning theory, and learning objects theory into educational software applications. For instance, Wang's work focuses on designing a collaborative learning environment to facilitate friendlier collaboration among students, while Chen and Choi have developed an online collaborative location-aware platform for history learning. Furthermore, Dorca et al. have presented an efficient approach for personalizing the teaching process using learning objects. Additionally, various technical aspects of mobile learning, including usability, user experience, and accessibility, have been thoroughly discussed in literature.

Several existing platforms, such as Medcgame, Mused, and Castle Route, exemplify the integration of the aforementioned educational theories into interactive software for cultural heritage education. These platforms engage students in active learning processes, offer repositories of reusable cultural heritage content organized as learning objects, and encourage reflection, investigation, dissemination, and sharing of cultural heritage and historical content in a collaborative environment utilizing mobile devices.

The proposed system, guided by learning objects theory, has been designed to organize educational content into units, each retaining the key characteristics of a learning object. These units are semantically independent and can be used individually or aggregated into collections based on metadata. This organization allows for the creation of specific collections tailored to the needs of educators, enabling students to interact with the system, search and view educational content, and contribute to the construction and sharing of personal knowledge.

In addition to providing a framework for the integration of educational theories, the proposed platform also offers features such as collaborative projects and a mobile lesson service. The platform supports the creation and assignment of specific educational projects, as well as the transfer of lessons outside the classroom using mobile devices. An extended role-based access control model has been implemented to manage content access, distinguishing between registered users and non-registered users, and differentiating access levels for viewing cultural content.

Overall, the proposed platform appears to have successfully achieved its design goals, integrating characteristics from specific educational theories while garnering positive feedback from students regarding its compliance with learning object, mobile learning, and collaborative learning theories. With the potential to become a central part of the educational process, the platform is perceived as a valuable asset in supporting educational objectives.
