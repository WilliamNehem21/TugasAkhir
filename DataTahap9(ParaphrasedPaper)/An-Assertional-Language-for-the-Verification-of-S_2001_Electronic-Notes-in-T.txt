The article aims to examine the verification of properties for all potential initial configurations in systems, using colored Petri nets as a theoretical basis. By mapping processes to tokens, system behavior can be described through places, transitions, and initial markings parameterized by variables. The objective is to ensure the validation of specified properties regardless of the parameter values in the initial marking. To address this, the paper introduces an assertional language to symbolically represent infinite state collections in systems with multiple dimensions. This language combines concepts from various fields, such as high-level Petri nets, constraints, multiset rewriting, and constraint logic programming, with a central focus on constraints. The adoption of colored Petri nets (CPNs) as the general model of parameterized concurrent systems forms the basis of this approach. Moreover, the paper explores the incorporation of the assertional language in the backward approach, and discusses its practical application through a case-study analysis. Additionally, the paper outlines future research directions and proposes potential areas for further exploration. The approach presented in the paper constitutes a generalized extension of previous work on timed Petri nets, aiming to address problems and constraint systems beyond temporal dependency by leveraging the combination of multiset rewriting and constraints.
