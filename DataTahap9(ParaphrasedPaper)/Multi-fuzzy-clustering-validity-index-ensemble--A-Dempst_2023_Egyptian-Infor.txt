As smart devices become more widely used, they generate large volumes of data, leading to the challenge of extracting valuable information from this data. To address this issue, data mining technology, including cluster analysis, has been employed in various fields such as medical, education, and finance. Clustering, as an unsupervised learning technique, is particularly useful for exploring inherent structures in data sets without prior knowledge. In this context, the paper introduces a clustering validity ensemble model (DSMFCE) that leverages multi-fuzzy clustering algorithms and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory. The DSMFCE model aims to improve the generalization ability and adaptability of clustering validity evaluation by utilizing a combination of multi-fuzzy clustering algorithms and DS theory. The model is further complemented by the introduction of a decision module to determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, the paper introduces the VK validity function, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the degree of separation between classes. The effectiveness of the DSMFCE model is demonstrated through simulation experiments, which show its stability and accuracy in clustering validity evaluation. The paper also compares the performance of DSMFCE with other models and evaluates its robustness under different parameter settings. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of data mining techniques for extracting valuable insights from large datasets.
