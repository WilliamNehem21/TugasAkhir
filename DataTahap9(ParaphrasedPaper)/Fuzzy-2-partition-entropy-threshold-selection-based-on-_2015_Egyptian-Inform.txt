Image segmentation serves as a crucial pre-processing technique within the field of machine vision, aiming to partition images into distinct regions with similar characteristics and extract relevant features. Various methods for image segmentation, including image thresholding, edge detection, region growing, stochastic models, artificial neural networks (ANN), and clustering techniques, have been employed based on specific application requirements. Image thresholding, inspired by concepts from the big bang and big crunch theory, functions by generating random points during the big bang phase and consolidating them into a representative point in the big crunch phase using the Bacterial Foraging-Brainstorm Optimization (BBBCO) algorithm.

The BBBCO algorithm offers advantages such as numerical simplicity, minimal control parameters, low computation cost, rapid convergence, and straightforward implementation, making it suitable for various optimization problems. Leveraging the success of BBBCO in diverse applications, this study investigates its potential for identifying optimal parameter combinations for fuzzy membership functions to determine the optimal threshold value in images.

The study primarily focuses on utilizing the fuzzy 2-partition entropy criterion to select the optimal image threshold value. The BBBCO algorithm is employed to identify the optimal parameters of membership functions, maximizing the entropy of fuzzy 2-partition and subsequently determining the optimal image threshold value. This approach, termed the BBBCO-based fuzzy 2-partition entropy thresholding algorithm, is evaluated using standard test images and compared against genetic algorithm (GA)-based, biogeography-based optimization (BBO)-based, and recursion-based thresholding algorithms.

To achieve the division of images into foreground (white) and background (black) regions, the study utilizes two fuzzy membership functions, namely the s-function and z-function. The s-function represents the membership function of the foreground region, while the z-function represents the background region. The objective is to search for the optimal combination of parameters a, b, and c to maximize the function h(a, b, c), with the resulting optimal values used to determine the optimal threshold for separating the foreground region from the background in the image.

The proposed BBBCO-based fuzzy 2-partition entropy thresholding algorithm and the other metaheuristic algorithms, including the GA-based fuzzy 2-partition entropy thresholding algorithm, and recursion-based fuzzy 2-partition entropy thresholding algorithm, are evaluated on a 2.2 GHz machine. The key parameters of the metaheuristic algorithms are specified for comparison and analysis.
