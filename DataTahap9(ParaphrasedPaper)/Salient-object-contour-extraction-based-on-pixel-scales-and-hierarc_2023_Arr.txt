The paper discusses the discontinuity of characteristic distribution in images, such as pixel grayscale and texture, and its impact on image features. It examines the use of image edge detection to enhance contour edges, details, and grayscale jumps in images. The paper also explores the challenges and complexities associated with existing methods of salient object extraction and contour detection.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related works on contour extraction and the basic network structure. Section 3 describes the principle of salient object contour extraction, while Section 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusion and outlines potential future work.

The paper introduces a new hierarchical network for salient object contour extraction. It discusses the use of multi-task hierarchical networks, such as HED, RCF, FSDS, LMDS, and HIFI, to address the challenges associated with salient object contour extraction. The paper proposes a new method that involves the use of classification problems, piecewise quantization for pixel scales, and refined contour evaluation using standard algorithms.

The paper presents experimental procedures and evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm through comparative experiments on three datasets and cross validation. It compares the contour extraction accuracy results of various network structures and discusses the potential for further optimization, including the design of more effective network structures and the incorporation of multi-regressive aiding tasks.

In conclusion, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and complexities involved in salient object contour extraction and proposes a new method to address these issues while also outlining potential directions for future research.
