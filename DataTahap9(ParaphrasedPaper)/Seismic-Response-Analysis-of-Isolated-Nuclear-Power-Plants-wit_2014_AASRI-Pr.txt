This paper introduces a novel friction damper isolation system (FDIS) designed for isolated nuclear power plants (NPPs). The study employs finite element analysis to evaluate the seismic responses of NPPs by constructing a representative multi-particle model. The findings of the time domain analysis indicate that the response of structures supported by FDIS under small seismic events is similar to that of fixed structures, while behaving comparably to conventionally isolated structures under large seismic events. The yield force of the friction damper is identified as a critical parameter that influences the responses and energy absorption of the new isolated structures under seismic input. Comparatively, superstructure responses increase in correspondence with the yield force, while the displacement of the isolation layer is effectively reduced. The proposed FDIS has the potential to improve the seismic safety of isolated NPPs.

Given the critical nature of nuclear power plant structures, any damage to these facilities could result in severe disasters. Seismic isolation is considered to be the most promising technology for safeguarding nuclear reactors from violent earthquakes, particularly in areas of high seismicity. Studies conducted in Japan have highlighted the necessity of incorporating seismic isolation in the design of large plants in economically feasible ways. However, despite the potential benefits, only a limited number of nuclear power plants have been protected by isolation systems in commercial operation to date.

One significant challenge in the application of seismic isolation in nuclear power plants is the potential for significant relative movements under small seismic events between the isolated superstructure and the ground, which can pose a risk to crucial service networks and pipelines crossing the isolation layer. In response to this challenge, the proposed friction damper isolation system (FDIS) is introduced as a solution to mitigate the seismic response of the superstructure. The FDIS, comprising a friction damper and a normal rubber bearing, is designed to maintain a rigid connection between superstructures and the ground under small seismic events, thus ensuring the functionality of networks and pipelines. As the seismic loading level increases, the friction damper starts to slide when the horizontal shear force of the isolation layer reaches the design yield force under violent seismic events, dissipating earthquake energy. This transitional behavior effectively reduces the seismic response of the superstructure and minimizes the damage to pipelines crossing the isolation layer, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional isolation systems.

The paper proposes a new friction damper isolation system specifically designed for NPPs to mitigate the limitations associated with isolation technology. The finite element analysis verifies the effectiveness of the system and explores the influence of the friction damper on the seismic responses of isolated NPPs. The study concludes that the displacement of the isolation layer is effectively controlled by the yield force, with the maximum displacement decreasing as the yield force of the FDIS increases. In the case of a 12% yield force with a 0.05g earthquake input, the isolation displacement remains less than 5mm, demonstrating the robust rigidity of the FDIS.
