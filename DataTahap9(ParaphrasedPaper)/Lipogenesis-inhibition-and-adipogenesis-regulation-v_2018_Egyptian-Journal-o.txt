The plant Zingiber cassumunar (ZC) has long been utilized by indigenous people in northern Thailand for traditional remedies and as a culinary ingredient. Despite its use in anti-obesity traditional remedies and food recipes, the cellular mechanism of its pharmacological effects, including anti-obesity, has not been clearly established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of crude extracts from ZC on the breakdown of fats and the prevention of new fat cell formation in a laboratory model of mouse fat cells, 3T3-L1.

The study found that the extracts did not exhibit significant breakdown of fats in mature fat cells but did demonstrate anti-fat-forming activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that the extracts influenced the activity of genes related to fat cell formation, glucose uptake, lipid metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, chemical analysis of the extracts indicated the presence of phenylbutanoids, a group of compounds known for their various biological activities, in the ZC extracts.

The plant, also known as cassumunar ginger, has been investigated for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-proliferative, anti-ulcer, and insecticidal properties. The study extracted the plant material with absolute ethanol and boiled water and evaluated its effects on fat cells. The results indicated that the extracts did not exhibit toxicity and demonstrated anti-fat-forming activity. Further analysis of the chemical composition of the extracts revealed the presence of phenylbutanoids. Overall, the study provided evidence supporting the traditional use of ZC in preventing obesity.

The study received financial support from the National Research Council of Thailand and the Research Professional Development Project. The researchers expressed their gratitude to various departments and institutions for their support and assistance.
