We have developed a proof of soundness and completeness for the axiomatization of strong late bisimilarity in the pi-calculus, using the interactive theorem prover Isabelle and its nominal data type package. This work builds upon our previous efforts to formalize the pi-calculus in Isabelle. Our completeness proof, which is the first of its kind to be formally verified, closely follows the structure of the original manual proof. We consider our contribution to be threefold: it clarifies the requirements for fully formalizing this particular proof, simplifies the verification of similar proofs, and demonstrates the suitability of Isabelle with the nominal data type package for deriving such results.

At the heart of the completeness proofs are head normal forms (HNF), which are terms that consist of prefixed processes. In Isabelle, we utilize a specific function to determine whether a term is in HNF.

Our machine-checked proof presents a complete axiomatization of strong late bisimilarity in the pi-calculus. The time required for this work is difficult to quantify, as it was developed in tandem with the infrastructure in Isabelle. For instance, the effort for section 6 (addition of the parallel operator) took roughly one day, with most of the time spent on proving soundness. Our experience indicates that the Isabelle system, particularly with its nominal datatype package and our implementation of the pi-calculus, is well-suited for this task, especially in handling bound names. While the benefits may not be immediately evident from this paper, the efficiency lies in numerous low-level details. Ultimately, judgments on this matter are subjective, and we refer readers to our previous paper for a comparison with other approaches. Nevertheless, our current result reinforces our claim: while similar completeness proofs have existed for over 20 years, none have been formalized within a theorem prover until now.
