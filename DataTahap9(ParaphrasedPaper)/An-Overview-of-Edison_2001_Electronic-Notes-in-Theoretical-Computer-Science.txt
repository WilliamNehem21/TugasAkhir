The current state of edison primarily serves as a framework, offering signatures but not a comprehensive set of implementations. The author hopes to foster community participation in developing new implementations for the edison abstractions. They acknowledge that while a particular implementation may not be replaceable for efficiency reasons, there is a need to explore more efficient alternatives. For instance, although it may be tempting to implement map on a binary search tree using the usual map function for trees, this may not be suitable as it doesn't guarantee preservation of element ordering. The author encourages community involvement at all levels, from design to implementation, and welcomes user feedback and new implementations of edison abstractions. The author expresses gratitude to Simon Peyton Jones for discussions about edison's design, as well as Ralf Hinze, Sigbjorne Finne, Koen Claessen, and John Hughes for their contributions and tools.
