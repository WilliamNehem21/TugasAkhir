The system generates neuronal circuits that sustain self-excited behaviors such as walking, breathing, and chewing, and serves as the central control unit for rhythmic motion. Spinal cord interneurons are crucial for controlling body motion and sensory processing, providing plasticity for restructuring the spinal cord loop and playing a vital role in the recovery of spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. It is theoretically possible to restore rhythmic motion under damaged areas by directly stimulating specific points or providing sensory input in the uninjured spinal cord central pattern generator (CPG) loop. The diverse positions of excitatory neurons in the spinal cord contribute to the diversity of potential distribution on the spinal cord surface. Understanding the relationship between the location of excitatory neurons and the regularity of potential distribution on the spinal cord surface can help in identifying the excitatory neurons in the spinal cord.

A three-dimensional model of the spinal cord was constructed, and the electrical conductivity properties of tissues were set. The resistance effect of nerve fibers is much greater than the capacitance effect of the spinal cord, so the latter can be disregarded. The conductivity of gray matter is 0.23 S/m, while the conductivity of white matter is 0.60 S/m (vertical) and 0.083 S/m (horizontal).
