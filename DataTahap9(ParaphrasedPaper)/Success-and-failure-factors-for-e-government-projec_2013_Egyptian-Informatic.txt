Developing countries continue to face challenges in implementing e-government initiatives, resulting in a high failure rate that imposes a substantial financial burden. Understanding the underlying factors that contribute to the success or failure of e-government projects is an ongoing area of investigation. While previous research has identified various factors influencing success and failure, there remains a need to examine the specific factors related to public administration. This study builds on previous research by analyzing the factors that led to a change in performance at different implementation sites within a specific e-government project, including the initial success, subsequent failure, and relapse of one site. The study integrates the findings from three different research methodologies to ascertain the causal relationships between different factors affecting e-government implementations, thus distinguishing between primary and secondary causes of failure. By identifying the significance and relative importance of success and failure factors, the study aims to provide recommendations for remedying setbacks in future e-government projects.

The increasing shift toward a multichannel environment for delivering public services implies that e-government is just one component in a broader service delivery framework. For example, citizens may utilize a combination of online resources, phone communication, and physical interactions with government offices for various service needs, highlighting the multifaceted nature of public service delivery.

The e-government program in Egypt, launched in 2001, implemented several pilot projects, some of which succeeded and were expanded nationwide, while others were discontinued or restructured due to lack of success. Notably, certain rollout projects were less successful than their pilot counterparts, and the performance of implementation sites within the same type of project varied. Investigating the reasons behind the success and failure of these projects is crucial for informing future e-government implementations.

The author of this study was closely involved in the design and implementation of the Egyptian e-government project from its inception, having managed numerous projects that experienced both accolades and challenges. Drawing from this field experience, the author aims to integrate practical insights with scientific research techniques to definitively identify critical failure factors and contribute to the avoidance of such pitfalls within the community.

Several research endeavors have endeavored to identify the factors driving success and failure in e-government projects, with diverse perspectives and identified factors. A unique opportunity exists in the form of a comprehensive review of an Egyptian e-government project at various stages of its existence, employing different research approaches. This wealth of information extends beyond the scope of individual studies and presents valuable insights for further exploration.

The initial implementation of the aforementioned project in Matrouh, Egypt, was successful, resulting in reduced process steps and durations, leading to the project being declared as successful in its early phase. However, subsequent re-evaluation revealed that the project had regressed in Matrouh, while a new implementation in a different governorate, Al-Tor, demonstrated success. The distinct success and failure factors identified for each site primarily implicated human resources in the collapse of the Matrouh site.

This research seeks to definitively identify the reasons for failure in e-government projects and highlight critical pitfalls to avoid, ultimately promoting project success. The author will critically review and analyze the findings of previous studies, subsequently elucidating the complex relationships between different factors derived from varying methodologies, and their respective importance. This approach aims to pinpoint the main factors influencing project success or failure.

The primary objective of the project was to support local authorities in managing investment projects within the governorate through an integrated information system encompassing service-related procedures and alleviating paper-based activities. The system incorporated management information systems (MIS), geographic information systems (GIS), and workflow functionalities, connecting relevant departments via a local area network. The GIS maintained spatial information on available and utilized lands and ongoing projects, while the workflow and database facilitated administrative tasks. These integrated functionalities allowed for joint analysis and decision-making support within the governorate.

The initial implementation of the project in Matrouh in 2006 was successful, leading to plans for expansion to other sites. However, by the end of 2007, the system encountered issues in Matrouh, ultimately leading to its discontinuation in 2008. Meanwhile, the system continued to function in the other two sites, South Sinai (Al-Tor) and Port Said. Matrouh's operations were later resumed under new management in late 2010.

Port Said, an urban governorate with economic activities centered around trade, commerce, maritime services, and national tourism, is notable for housing the University of Port Said, which emerged from institutes affiliated with the Suez Canal University. A careful examination revealed that the Matrouh case demonstrated successes at the system and project levels before its relapse, leading to a comprehensive review of the project's analysis.

Subsequent sections of the paper will present and compare the methodologies and findings of each research study, offering a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the success or failure of the e-government project. The study will specifically identify critical failure factors affecting the project and uncover the interrelationships between administrative discretion and the identified failure factors.

A comparison conducted three years later between the Matrouh site and a recent implementation at Al-Tor revealed discrepancies in their performance, with Al-Tor thriving under the close supervision of the implementing body, while Matrouh had operated independently for over two years. The management changes and shifting interests in Matrouh disrupted the continuity of operations, unlike the relatively stable conditions in Al-Tor.

This study draws upon prior surveys and analyses to revise and integrate the conclusions of previous works, ultimately validating the findings through a dedicated survey.
