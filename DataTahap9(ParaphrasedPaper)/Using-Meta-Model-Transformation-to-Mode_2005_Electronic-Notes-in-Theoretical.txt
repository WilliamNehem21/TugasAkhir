Understanding the evolution of software systems is valuable for various reasons, such as for reverse engineering and empirical studies. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding, it is necessary to have a clear meta-model in place. In this paper, the authors introduce "hismo," a meta-model that revolves around the concept of history, and demonstrate how it can be derived from a snapshot meta-model. Based on their experience with developing the hismo reverse engineering system, they illustrate the process of transforming a snapshot meta-model into a history meta-model.

Several methodologies have been suggested for analyzing different aspects of software evolution. However, these methodologies tend to focus on specific aspects of software evolution and do not rely on explicit meta-models, which can make it challenging to precisely understand the models and compare or integrate tools that offer similar yet different or complementary results.

The authors advocate for an explicit meta-model centered on the concept of history, which they have named hismo. They have implemented hismo in a tool called van, which is based on the moose reengineering environment, and have utilized it to characterize software evolution for reverse engineering purposes.

While the concept of history is not inherently tied to famix, it can be applied to other meta-models as well. In essence, hismo can be viewed as a meta-model transformation that converts a snapshot meta-model into a history meta-model. This paper explores this concept by examining the problem of evolution analysis from a model-driven (reverse) engineering perspective.
