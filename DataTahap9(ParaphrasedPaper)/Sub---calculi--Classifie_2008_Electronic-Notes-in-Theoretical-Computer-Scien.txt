The paper demonstrates that when a term contains the entire redex, there are three potential scenarios to consider: if the only occurrence of 'y' is located outside the redex, if it is within 't', or if it is within 'u'. The first two cases are relatively straightforward, while for the third case, the equation |t|x= 1 is utilized. In each scenario, it is concluded that |v1|y= 1.

As indicated in remark 7.2, disjunction does not display consistent behavior concerning stability. Nevertheless, the subsequent proposition reveals the specific behavior of 1, suggesting that the choice of p(1) may not significantly impact the stability of p.

In summary, the previous findings have been restated in a more specific manner. However, the paraphrase highlights an intriguing structure that does not appear to align directly with established algebraic concepts. This observation could be an indication that either the structure is interesting and warrants further investigation, or there might be a compelling structure overlaying it that could lead to an intriguing generalization of the subcalculus concept.
