The autoz framework serves as a platform for building various instance tools, with autocadiz and autoz/eves being the current instances. Autoz acts as a plug-in for the Eclipse development environment, a widely used platform in software engineering for modeling and model management activities.

The design of the tool in LaTeX is aimed at being completely transparent, catering to the needs of basic users who are well-versed in diagrammatic modeling but have limited interest in formal methods. For such users, the autoz tools seamlessly enhance traditional modeling tools by providing one-click validation of models without exposing the formal background.

Autoz, as a generic tool framework, is exemplified by an instance using the cadiz z tool. Both basic and expert uses of this instance are discussed, providing a usage scenario for each type of user.

An illustrative example is presented, where appropriate options result in the creation of a templates directory for the project in the Eclipse project explorer view. Expert users can include the template catalogue in the project when creating a new autoz project, enabling them to edit and add templates to subfolders containing egl transformation rules.

Relating error messages to diagrammatic models is a significant challenge for non-expert practitioners to use formally-underpinned tools for analyzing diagrammatic models. One potential solution is to develop an intermediate language for translating formal tool messages and managing the mapping back to diagrammatic model components, which is complicated by the diverse ways in which formal tools present messages.

The automatic translation of templates using ftl demonstrates that it aligns well with egl. This insight suggests that an expert user involved in template maintenance would need to be familiar with both languages. Additionally, ftl is essential for meta-theorems and proof work due to its formal underpinnings, and groundwork has been laid for an automatic translation from ftl to egl, which will allow expert users to maintain templates using either ftl or egl.

Exploring the integration of autoz tools into the Community Z Tools (CZT) initiative, which offers support tools for Z, including parsers, translators, typechecking, and a Unicode markup for Z, could be beneficial.
