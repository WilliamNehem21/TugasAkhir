The Coq formalization contains the full demonstration of Theorem 3.8. We offer a brief overview of the compatibility proofs to illustrate our approach to proving theorems, focusing specifically on the critical case of 'app' where it is necessary to differentiate between active and passive tests. In comparison to the proof technique used in [reference], which employs an induction on the definition of the closure using Definition 3.1, we do not require an induction on the number of evaluation steps for our small-step definition. However, a nested induction proof for a big-step relation would encounter similar challenges. The robust up-to techniques lam, refl, and red pose no significant difficulties; we provide a detailed account of the proof for lam.
