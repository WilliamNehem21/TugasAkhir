This academic paper discusses the development and implementation of a hybrid interface for interactive theorem provers, which combines elements from the Proof General and Isawin interfaces. The new interface is designed to provide a robust and generic environment for interactive proof development while also facilitating the exploration and implementation of new mechanisms for managing proofs. The system is based on an event-based architecture using the PG Kit middleware and employs the PGIP (Proof General Interaction Protocol) for communication between different components. The authors present a prototype implementation of the new interface and describe the use of XML schemas for defining the PGIP and PGML languages.

The paper examines the strengths and limitations of existing interfaces, such as Proof General and Isawin, and proposes a new architecture that aims to address these limitations. It highlights the use of lightweight protocols to connect different components involved in interactive proof development, with a focus on modularity and robustness. The paper also discusses the implementation of a prototype using Haskell and outlines the steps taken to enable integration with existing theorem provers, particularly Isabelle/Isar.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to interface design for interactive theorem provers, presenting a prototype implementation based on the PG Kit architecture. It emphasizes the benefits of a hybrid graphical and textual interaction model and the potential for implementing new interaction mechanisms in an open architecture. Finally, it draws comparisons with other similar systems, such as Mathweb and Prosper, which also employ middleware architectures for connecting different proof tools.
