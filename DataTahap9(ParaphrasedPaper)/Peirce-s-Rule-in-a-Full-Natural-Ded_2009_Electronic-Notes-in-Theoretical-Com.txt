The natural deduction (ND) for classical first-order logic can be derived from the intuitionist system by incorporating the Peirce rule. A previous study introduced a normalization strategy for the implicational fragment with the Peirce rule, resulting in an end normal form comprising an intuitionist subdeduction followed by a sequence of Peirce rule applications, which may be empty. This paper extends this normalization process to...

It is widely recognized that strong normalization (SN) holds for both classical and intuitionistic natural deduction, as demonstrated by Prawitz and Gandy. Gandy also provided a more direct proof of SN. However, when the Peirce rule is added to the implicational fragment, a counter-example to SN is presented, indicating that NP-Imp is not strongly normalizing. In fact, if derivations are not prepared for the application of red4, the reduction procedure becomes infinitely long.
