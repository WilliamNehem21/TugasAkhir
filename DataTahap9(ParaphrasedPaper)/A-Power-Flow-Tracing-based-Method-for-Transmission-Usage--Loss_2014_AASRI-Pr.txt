The evolution of the power sector has led to issues such as congestion management, where the transmission sector plays a crucial role. Consequently, the issue of transmission pricing holds significant importance. The primary goal of any transmission pricing methodology is to foster equitable competition in the electricity sector and issue effective economic signals.

Various approaches to allocate transmission losses have been suggested, including the prorata method, marginal methods, power flow tracing-based methods, and circuit theory-based methods. A usage-based transmission loss allocation method is proposed, along with a method based on circuit theory and the concept of orthogonal projection for pool-based electricity markets.

This paper introduces a model for the allocation of usage, loss, and transmission reliability margin based on the matrices methodology. The proposed method involves the development of a modified Kirchhoff matrix for usage allocation, followed by the formation of a loss allocation matrix for transmitting losses to loads and generators. Additionally, the calculation of the maximum flow of transmission lines is carried out by incorporating (n-1) reliability criteria. Finally, the transmission reliability margin of each line is allocated to generators using the modified Kirchhoff matrix.
