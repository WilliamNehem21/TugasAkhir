The proliferation of waste plastics poses a serious environmental threat, prompting global efforts to enact legislation and develop recycling strategies to mitigate the impact on human survival and the ecosystem. Current waste plastic management methods primarily encompass landfill disposal, incineration, and recycling, with the latter being classified into mechanical (physical) and chemical processes. Mechanical recycling involves using waste plastics as raw materials to produce similar or lower-grade products, while chemical recycling involves breaking down waste plastics into chemical raw materials or fuels through chemical reactions, such as cracking waste plastics into liquid fuels.

To execute the cracking process, the procedure begins by heating up and activating the stirrer while connecting the cooling water. As the temperature rises, the cracking reaction intensifies, leading to an increase in pressure. Once a specified pressure level is reached, the needle valve is opened to release the cracking oil gas to the fume cupboard after it has been cooled with air and water, and non-condensable gas has been measured and purified through alkali washing. The scheduled cracking temperature is maintained for 60 minutes before the heating is discontinued. The stirring continues until the temperature drops to 200째C, at which point the power supply is disconnected. Once the temperature falls to 50째C, the liquid oil and residual carbon produced during the coking reaction process are recovered and weighed separately. The liquid products are then collected, weighed, mixed for distillation (with the fraction below 200째C constituting light oil and the fraction above 200째C constituting heavy oil), and subjected to property analysis. Throughout the experiment process, alterations in temperature and pressure are recorded, and the reaction conditions are observed at different temperatures.
