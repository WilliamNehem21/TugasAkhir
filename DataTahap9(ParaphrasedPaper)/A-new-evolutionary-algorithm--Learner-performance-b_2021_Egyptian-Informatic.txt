The characteristics of metaheuristic optimization algorithms allow for various classification methods. They can be categorized as either population-based or trajectory-based/single-point search algorithms. In the latter approach, only a single solution is manipulated in each iteration, exemplified by algorithms such as hill climbing, tabu search, and simulated annealing. On the other hand, population-based algorithms modify the entire population of agents in each iteration, which includes genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 illustrates the inspiration behind the proposed algorithm, while Section 3 outlines the features and operators of genetic algorithms used in the technique. Section 4 introduces the LPB operators and techniques, along with the pseudocode. Additionally, Section 5 presents the algorithm's results and a comprehensive comparative study on benchmark test functions and a real-world problem. Finally, Section 6 provides the conclusion of the work and suggests future research directions.

The transition of learners from high school to college can be enhanced by employing effective learning strategies which differ from those in high school. Various behaviors, such as level of interest, deep processing, effective note taking, problem-solving, group work, seeking help, and self-study, have been considered to differentiate between strong and weak learners. Additionally, learners with high levels of creativity are often strong learners. The presence of the aforementioned behaviors indicates good learning potential.

The proposed algorithm involves selecting individuals from the population, followed by subdividing the main population into sub-populations, and then choosing individuals from these sub-populations based on their fitness levels. This strategy aims to prevent convergence to local optima by starting the selection process from the fittest sub-population. Subsequent steps involve improving individuals through group work and seeking help from peers. Moreover, possessing a good level of metacognition influences a learner's overall study behaviors in a stochastic manner (mutation), while learners also influence each other's study behaviors when studying together (crossover).

The genetic operators simulate the process of genetic heredity to generate new individuals at each generation, facilitating changes in the structure of individuals during the representation. Common genetic operators include crossover, mutation, and selection. Crossover involves integrating features of two individuals to produce offspring, while mutation introduces random changes in individuals, possibly restoring lost genes during the selection process or serving genes not present in the initial population.

For traditional benchmark functions, the performance time of LPB is smaller compared to DA, owing to the initial selection of a subset of the population, which is then used to construct other subpopulations. Since the subpopulations are much smaller than the main population, the search for solutions within these subpopulations is faster, thus improving randomness and optimizing time. However, compared to PSO and GA, LPB exhibits a higher performance time.

The Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) is a popular NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem aimed at assigning tasks to workers with minimum cost. In this work, the GAP is applied to the assignment of cases in the court to justice teams, with the goal of minimizing the working hours required. The paper proposes a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the process of transitioning high school graduates to university and enhancing their studying behaviors at college, based on genetic algorithms. The two most important phases of metaheuristic algorithms, exploitation and exploration, are outlined and mapped to the aforementioned process. The LPB includes parameters such as DP, crossover, and mutation, which are utilized to divide the population into different groups and improve learners' studying skills.

The proposed real-world NP-hard problem is solved using the algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness. The findings indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms most algorithms in the literature. However, challenges may arise with larger problem sizes for combinatorial optimization, making it essential for researchers to consider the algorithm for optimization techniques in various fields.
