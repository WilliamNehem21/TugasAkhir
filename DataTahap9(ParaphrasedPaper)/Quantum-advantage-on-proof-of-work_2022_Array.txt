While consensus can be achieved through various methods, proof of work (PoW) based blockchains currently dominate the market, representing over 90% of the market share. Notably, major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on PoW blockchains, together accounting for a market capitalization of over US$1.6 trillion as of November 2021. This underscores the significant financial assets managed by blockchains and their consensus algorithms.

The following section delves into an exploration of PoW as it stands today, culminating in a formal definition of PoW that enables rigorous mathematical analysis. From there, the paper derives the quantum advantage for PoW based on first principles. The subsequent sections examine how this advantage can be leveraged in adversarial scenarios, such as cyberattacks on cryptocurrencies, as well as in non-adversarial contexts.

The discussion centers on the quantum computational advantage in PoW and its cybersecurity implications, alongside an analysis of the potential profitability of using quantum advantage for more efficient cryptocurrency mining. It is noted that while the comparison has been drawn primarily on the Bitcoin network, with the largest hashing power of all blockchains, other smaller blockchain networks are expected to be vulnerable even sooner.

Quantum computers are highlighted to offer an asymptotic quadratic efficiency boost for existing PoW systems and any likely future PoW systems, in contrast to custom-built ASIC chips, which afford only constant-factor speed increases. As a result, a single quantum computer holds the capability to launch devastating attacks on cryptocurrency networks in the foreseeable future.

The authors assess the feasibility of a quantum computer effectively and profitably mining a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, noting that quantum supremacy in cryptocurrency mining may be achieved sooner than previously suggested dates for quantum attack viability.

Moreover, the paper delves into the impact of the reward gained per block mined, emphasizing its variability based on the cryptocurrency under consideration and the operating period. The potential profitability calculations necessitate careful consideration of these factors, such as the block reward adjustments over the lifespan of specific cryptocurrencies.

Furthermore, it is explained that increasing the difficulty parameter of PoW serves to solidify the quadratic advantage of quantum computers as miners, thereby incentivizing investment in quantum mining technologies and potentially leading to a complete replacement of classical miners by quantum counterparts.

The cascading effect of this advancement is seen to enhance the network's security, making it impervious to 51% attacks solely based on quantum advantage once the majority of miners are quantum. Over time, the increased difficulty parameter is anticipated to render classical miners obsolete, with quantum miners becoming more cost-effective, irrespective of their initial setup costs. This, in turn, is expected to lead to a scenario where all quantum miners are more cost-effective than classical miners over time.

The study concludes by affirming the definitive advantage of quantum computation over classical computation for performing PoW for blockchains.
