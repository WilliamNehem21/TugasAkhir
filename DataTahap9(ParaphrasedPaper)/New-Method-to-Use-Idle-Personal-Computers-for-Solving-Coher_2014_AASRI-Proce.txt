The authors of this study present a novel approach to addressing the challenge of efficiently performing coherent tasks in a distributed computing system using resources from personal computers. The parameters of these resources are subject to dynamic variations, making their application in distributed computations difficult. To enable the effective utilization of personal computers, the proposed method employs a multiagent approach, where a proactive agent manages each personal computer in the system, and the task-solving process is decentralized through interactions among agents. When tackling incoming coherent tasks, the system's agents form a community to facilitate the dispatch and execution of computations. The primary advantage of this method is the reduction of costs associated with creating and maintaining a distributed computing system.

The primary obstacles in using personal computers for distributed computing stem from the variability of their parameters and the potential coexistence of diverse computers in a single distributed system. These factors complicate the effective distribution and resolution of tasks.

Efficiently performing coherent tasks in distributed computing systems based on collaboration with personal computers is a significantly challenging endeavor. Loading a distributed computing system effectively while resolving coherent tasks is a current challenge. Nonetheless, addressing the resolution of such tasks amidst dynamically changing parameters of personal computers adds even greater difficulty, underscoring the importance of devising new approaches for organizing the distributed computation of coherent tasks.

This new method is grounded in a multiagent approach and the principles of collective decision-making. In the proposed organization of the distributed computing system, the aim is to eschew dedicated servers and establish a decentralized structure. Each personal computer in the distributed system is equipped with proactive agent software, which facilitates the dispatching of task-solving processes through interactions among program agents.

The key advantage of the proposed algorithm lies in its ability to adapt the computing process to the actual parameters of personal computers within the distributed computing system. The two proposed algorithms enable the resolution of coherent tasks in a distributed computing system with personal computers featuring varying parameters. The next phase involves assessing the performance and efficacy of the proposed method and algorithms.

The primary goal of the experimental research is to provide empirical evidence of the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, alongside an evaluation of the relative loss of processor time on personal computers resulting from the decentralized computing dispatching. Consequently, multiple sets of experiments were conducted with varying parameters of personal computers and computer networks. Real tasks utilized at Southern Federal University were employed during the examination of the proposed algorithms. The percentage of actual load on personal computers, indicating the time loss due to organizational purposes, was found to range from 8% to 28% of the total time. This demonstrates a promising outcome, as the current average effectiveness of resolving coherent tasks in distributed computing systems is approximately 40%, signifying the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
