Differing from the conventional fatigue specimen which is gripped at two tips, the ultrasonic specimen has one tip fixed with the amplifying horn and the other free. The ultrasonic fatigue specimen needs to satisfy the resonance condition with the experimental system. Assuming the axis of the specimen is the x-axis, with u(x, t) representing the longitudinal displacement of the specimen section at time t, the resonant length of an ultrasonic fatigue specimen can be derived as follows.

With the advancement of industrial technology, the design fatigue life of many metal components has increased significantly. Consequently, the high cycle fatigue behavior of metallic materials has become a focal point of research. The use of ultrasonic fatigue testing technology has made it possible to study the high cycle fatigue behavior of metallic materials. While there are challenges in conducting high cycle fatigue tests, the gradual resolution of these problems and the potential establishment of a very high cycle fatigue test standard in the near future will lead to broad application prospects for ultrasonic fatigue testing technology.
