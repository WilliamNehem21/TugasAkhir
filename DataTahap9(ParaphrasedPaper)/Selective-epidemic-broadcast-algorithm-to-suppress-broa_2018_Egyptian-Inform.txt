The optimal method for disseminating emergency messages throughout a vehicular ad hoc network is through broadcasting. However, the dynamic nature of vehicular ad hoc networks presents a challenge known as the broadcast storm problem (BSP), which can lead to performance degradation in message broadcasting, causing increased overhead, collision, and dissemination delay. This paper aims to address the limitations of existing broadcast storm suppression algorithms (BSSAs) such as p-persistence, TLO, VSPB, G-SAB, and SIR, by introducing a new BSSA based on the Selective Epidemic Broadcast (SEB) algorithm. Through simulation results, the SEB algorithm demonstrates superior performance in terms of emergency safety message (ESM) delivery ratio, message overhead, collision ratio, broadcast storm ratio, and redundant rebroadcast ratio, with reduced dissemination delay.

While several papers have discussed the impact of the broadcast storm problem, not all proposed solutions effectively address this issue. The BSP can lead to increased message overhead, broadcast collisions, dissemination delay, and other challenges in the dissemination of emergency safety messages, which require uninterrupted transmission within a short timeframe. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the time parameter when disseminating emergency messages.

Various delay-based BSSAs, such as DOT, DRIVE, and ADM, have been introduced to address the challenges posed by high vehicle density in vehicular ad hoc networks. However, these algorithms still face issues such as increased message overhead, dissemination delay, and redundancy. Similarly, existing techniques like VSPB and G-SAB attempt to mitigate the broadcast storm problem but encounter challenges related to collision ratio, broadcast overhead, and dissemination delay as vehicle density increases.

The paper introduces the Selective Epidemic Broadcast (SEB) algorithm as a new approach to address the broadcast storm problem. By leveraging an epidemic spreading model called the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) algorithm, the SEB algorithm selectively broadcasts messages to vehicles based on passive acknowledgment (P_ACK) from neighboring vehicles within the transmission range. Compared to the SIR algorithm, the SEB algorithm aims to suppress broadcast storm by targeting selective rebroadcasting, resulting in fewer messages being sent. Through simulation results, the SEB algorithm demonstrates improved scalability and link reliability compared to the SIR algorithm.

Furthermore, the paper evaluates the performance of the SEB algorithm using simulations in different vehicular network scenarios. The results indicate that the SEB algorithm outperforms existing algorithms across various vehicle density and vehicle moving speed scenarios. However, the paper acknowledges the need to adapt the SEB algorithm for disconnected networks, as the receipt of passive acknowledgment may pose challenges in such environments. The paper concludes with the author's credentials and areas of research interest.
