The study further investigated the impact of current on icing using a numerical simulation model. The critical current value was found to be dependent on both meteorological conditions and the physical parameters of the aerial cable. The results showed a linear relationship between the critical current and ambient temperature, wind speed, and other factors, indicating that the critical current value changes as a function of external weather conditions and cable parameters.

The natural phenomenon of water freezing on object surfaces, leading to the formation of ice (frost), is widespread. Icing on power transmission lines is a random phase transformation process influenced by meteorology, thermodynamics, and other factors. When severe ice disasters occur, it becomes challenging to prevent icing on power transmission lines. Various de-icing technologies have been developed, but some face difficulties when applied in the grid system. The paper proposes a two-dimensional value simulation method for soft rime icing on power transmission lines, exploring the influence of current on icing based on this method. It also presents the change rules of critical current based on external meteorological conditions and cable parameters.

The study also observed that icing on conductors in the same channel varies under similar climate conditions, with heavy load lines experiencing lighter or no icing, and no-load lines experiencing heavy icing. This phenomenon is linked to joule heat, which causes temperature variations at the conductor's surface, thereby affecting the icing condition. The critical current, which determines the minimum current flow without icing, is influenced by factors such as wind speed, air temperature, conductor geometry, and resistance. The application of critical current to prevent icing depends on scientific coordination and can be utilized to alter current distribution in grid sections prone to icing.

The research team investigated the influence of current on icing based on a value simulation model and presented the change rules of critical current based on external meteorological conditions and conductor parameters. The study found that the critical current is not directly proportional to the conductor diameter, especially when temperature rise and collision rates of water droplets do not significantly impact surface heat balance. This non-linear relationship between critical current and conductor diameter has implications for understanding and preventing icing on the conductor.
