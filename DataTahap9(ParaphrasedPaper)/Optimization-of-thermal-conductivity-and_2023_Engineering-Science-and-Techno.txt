The study used a neuro-regression approach to generate strength and thermal conductivity functions for bricks. Multiple targets were set, which included minimizing the thermal conductivity and maximizing the compressive strength of the bricks. The genetic algorithm was then employed to identify Pareto-optimal solutions, and the final sets of bricks with low thermal conductivity and high strength were chosen based on these solutions. Two sets of bricks were proposed to achieve the lowest thermal conductivity, and the results confirmed the validity and feasibility of the optimization study.

In the past two decades, the global population has experienced a 27% growth, with an expected increase of 30% over the next thirty years. Consequently, the energy demand for heating and cooling in developed cities, where 57% of the population resides, has risen. Lightweight insulation materials with low thermal conductivity have become a popular solution for enhancing building energy efficiency. Therefore, integrating lightweight construction elements with low thermal conductivity into building design is crucial for achieving high energy efficiency.

Materials such as hollow clay brick and foam concrete are known for their excellent insulation and thermal performance, primarily due to the air spaces that prevent heat flow through the walls. Closed pores, achieved by adding pore-forming organic and inorganic additives before firing, can improve the physicomechanical properties of the brick while reducing the amount of clay used. Sustainable raw materials, such as fly ash, waste marble, rice husk ash, and others, have been considered as viable additives for the construction industry.

This study aimed to optimize the thermo-mechanical properties of fired clay bricks using a genetically based design method. The objective was to simultaneously achieve maximum compressive strength and minimum thermal conductivity. The multi-objective optimization process involved several steps, including determining brick production parameters, testing bricks, analyzing their properties, preparing objective functions for compressive strength and thermal conductivity, conducting multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithms, and validating the results through testing. The study also investigated the effects of using pore-forming additives, specifically palm nut shell (PNS) wastes, on the mechanical and thermal properties of the bricks, presenting the first study in this field to optimize multiple properties of bricks using a multi-objective optimization approach.

The study also found that the use of PNS as a pore-forming additive led to a reduction in thermal conductivity and compressive strength, which was correlated with the increase in porosity. Additionally, the firing temperature of the bricks resulted in the emergence of new phases, which decreased visible porosity and increased brick density.

The modeling and optimization results showed that the compressive strength and thermal conductivity models accurately described the process, and the models successfully guided the multi-objective optimization study. Multiple solutions were proposed to produce strong bricks with low thermal conductivity, and validation tests confirmed the success of the model predictions.
