Additionally, we can demonstrate (using a straightforward application of the second moment method) that nearly all trees satisfy condition (ii) as stated in theorem 2.2. This, in conjunction with theorem 2.3, directly implies that almost every tree is contained in any digraph with high semidegree.

To sum up this section, we explain how we can infer theorem 2.1 from theorem 2.2. Firstly, we introduce several definitions and a lemma. A path decomposition p of a tree t is a set of edge-disjoint subpaths of t such that each edge of t is only contained in one path of p; we refer to p as "bare" if each path in p is bare. In other words, in a bare path decomposition of a tree, two paths are only allowed to intersect at their end vertices. We denote p(t) as the minimum size of a bare path decomposition of t, and l(t) as the number of leaves of t. Particularly, if t is a path, then p(t) = 1, and if t is a star, then p(t) = l(t). The following lemma can be easily proven.

It's worth noting that theorem 2.2 presents two cases for the structure of t. The proof is distinct for each case, albeit both follow a similar framework. For the sake of simplicity, we assume below that t falls into case (i) of theorem 2.2.
