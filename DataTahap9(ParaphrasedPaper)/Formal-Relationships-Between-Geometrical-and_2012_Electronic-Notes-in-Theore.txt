In recent decades, a wide range of concurrency models have been developed, including transition systems (with independence), asynchronous automata, event structures, and Petri nets. Despite their distinct natures, these models are intricately linked to one another. More recently, geometrically inspired models such as cubical sets (also known as higher dimensional automata or HDA) and local po-spaces have emerged as essential tools for studying concurrency due to their strong algebraic structure and ability to abstractly represent computations and commutations between multiple events. However, these geometric models have not been formally and systematically connected with other models, such as transition systems, despite containing a notion of generalized transition within their definition.

This paper represents a significant step toward formalizing the relationship between geometric models and other concurrency models. By constructing categorical terms for converting one variant of a model to another, we can embed various model variants within the model of HDA, allowing for precise characterization of the outcomes resulting from choosing one model variant over another.

Our study indicates that strongly labeled HDA may be the suitable notion of HDA for comparing with most other common concurrency models. Additionally, exploring these connections reveals intriguing phenomena, such as the relationship between persistent set types as a method for addressing the state-space explosion problem and the search for retracts of the state space in an algebraic topological sense. Our article concludes with hypotheses on further relationships, particularly with event structures and Petri nets.

From a concurrency perspective, a 1-cell corresponds to an event (an action), while an n-cell represents a commutation or independence between the 1-cells occurring in its faces. For example, a cubical set representing a cylinder intuitively corresponds to a program consisting of two processes running in parallel: a loop and a single instruction.

We have demonstrated that the 1-cells of a cubical set can be interpreted as event occurrences in the semantics of a concurrent computational process, and labeled (pre)cubical sets allow for formalizing the correspondence between these cells and the instructions of the process.

Asynchronous automata, which provide a generalization of both transition systems and Mazurkiewicz traces, have had a significant influence on other concurrency models. They have been independently introduced in previous works and offer a way to distinguish between true concurrency and mutual exclusion of actions through the decoration of transition systems with an independence relation between actions.

Event structures were introduced to abstract from the exact locations and times of events occurring in distributed systems. The focus is on the notion of events and the causal ordering between them. We establish an adjunction between strongly labeled event structures and HDA, formalizing existing relations between event structures and transition systems with independence.

One of the most novel aspects of this paper is the extension of adjunctions between 1-bounded Petri nets and asynchronous transition systems to an adjunction between general Petri nets and HDA. Moreover, we introduce a general methodology for associating a symmetric precubical set with a model for concurrent processes, which serves to associate a strict HDA with a Petri net.

In conclusion, this paper presents important strides in formally relating geometric models with other concurrency models, providing valuable insights and establishing connections that were previously lacking in the field.
