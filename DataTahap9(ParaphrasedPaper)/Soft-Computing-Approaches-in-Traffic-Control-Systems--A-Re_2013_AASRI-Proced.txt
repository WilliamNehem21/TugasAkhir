The research paper focuses on addressing urban traffic congestion using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, particularly soft computing methods. It explores various models and approaches such as fuzzy techniques, neural networks, genetic algorithms, petri nets, and multi-agent systems, for developing modern traffic control systems.

The paper is organized into six sections, with Section 2 reviewing fuzzy techniques, Section 3 examining simulation-based approaches, and Section 4 discussing cognitive and learning approaches. Section 5 covers other relevant methods.

In addressing traffic congestion at intersections, the paper proposes a multi-agent fuzzy system with three levels of control. It utilizes parameters like traffic intensity, recommendations from nearby intersections, and a knowledge repository to inform decision-making. Coordinating signals at adjacent intersections is also emphasized to minimize commuter waiting times in queues.

Additionally, the paper presents a distributed control approach where local agents act as traffic signal controllers at each intersection. Two models are proposed, with one employing multistage online learning and the other using perturbation stochastic approximation theorem with fuzzy neural networks. The efficiency of the proposed models is validated using the Paramics simulation program.

Furthermore, the paper explores the use of online reinforcement learning by multi-agents to compute green times, as well as a simulation approach for real-time evaluation of traffic situations. A hierarchical multi-agent architecture is also proposed, where agents are assigned specific tasks such as data collection, pre-processing, and decision-making, with the aim of reducing queue size and average waiting and traveling times.
