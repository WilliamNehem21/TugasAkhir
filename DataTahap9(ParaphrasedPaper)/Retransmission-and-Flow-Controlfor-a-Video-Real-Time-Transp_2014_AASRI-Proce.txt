The paper introduces a method for dealing with flow control and retransmission in the context of video streaming. It emphasizes the importance of retransmission in ensuring that entire frames are appropriately decoded, thus preventing users from seeing broken images and conserving bandwidth. The method also addresses flow control by adjusting the data transmission rate according to available network bandwidth. It contrasts the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), highlighting the latter's lack of retransmission and flow control standards, particularly in the context of video streaming. It highlights the detrimental impact of this deficiency on video streaming and proposes a retransmission and flow control method to mitigate packet loss and improve overall performance. This method aims to minimize the impact of packet loss on video streaming by employing a limited number of retransmission packets and controlling the sending rate based on the number of lost packets, ultimately enhancing the viewing experience for users.
