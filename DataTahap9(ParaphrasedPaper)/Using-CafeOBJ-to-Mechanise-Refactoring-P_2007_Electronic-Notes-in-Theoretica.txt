This paper demonstrates how the refactoring rules can be formally proven using the rewriting system CafeOBJ, and it also presents a case study highlighting the application of these refactorings. The paper emphasizes the importance of complementing manual proofs with formal rigorous methods to avoid mistakes. Furthermore, the study suggests that rewriting systems, such as CafeOBJ, can be valuable tools for developing refactoring environments.

The paper is structured as follows: 
- Section 2 introduces ROOL, the language employed to formalize the refactorings. 
- Section 3 presents three refactoring rules to illustrate the developed work.
- Section 4 briefly introduces the rewriting system CafeOBJ. 
- Section 5 discusses the mechanization of refactoring proofs and the implementation of two refactorings in CafeOBJ. 
- Section 6 describes a case study developed to validate the work. 
- Finally, Section 7 provides the conclusions and suggests future directions for the research.

The paper introduces a subset of ROOL laws necessary to understand the mechanization of the proofs presented in Section 5. These laws can be found in the comprehensive set of refactoring rules presented in another work.

CafeOBJ, a new generation algebraic specification and programming language, is described as being capable of implementing new paradigms, such as rewriting logic and hidden algebra. It is mainly used for system specification, formal verification of specifications, rapid prototyping, programming, and automatic theorem proving.

The mechanization of the proofs for the refactoring rules consists of two steps: the implementation of the ROOL grammar and laws (Section 5.1) and the automatic derivation of the rules from the implemented laws (Section 5.2). Once proven, the refactoring can be implemented as a rule and used to perform program transformation (Sections 5.3 and 5.4).

The paper also highlights the need to efficiently check the validity of side conditions present in most refactoring rules and laws of classes before applying the reduction. It emphasizes that constructing a refactoring environment using a rewriting system such as CafeOBJ requires an efficient way to check the validity of these conditions in an arbitrary program before applying the reduction, which presents a challenge for future work.
