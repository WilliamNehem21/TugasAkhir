The advent of version 2 of the Maude system in the summer of 2003 marked a significant milestone in its development, leading to its widespread adoption in educational and research settings worldwide. Notably, Maude has proven to be particularly valuable for the specification and prototyping of logical systems, programming languages, and computational systems. However, a notable deficiency that persists is the absence of shared and reusable common libraries.

To address this deficiency, the present tutorial seeks to bridge the gap by providing a comprehensive library of typical data structures specified in Maude. This endeavor involves updating and considerably expanding the existing set of specifications that were available in the tutorial distributed with version 1 of Maude. Specifically, the tutorial begins by detailing well-known versions of fundamental data types such as stacks, queues, and lists. It then proceeds to cover various versions of trees, encompassing binary, general, and search trees, including advanced forms such as AVL, 2-3-4, and red-black trees. Additionally, it delves into abstract and concrete versions of priority queues based on leftist trees.

Modules can be imported in different modes, with "protecting" being the most significant one that ensures the integrity of the imported module. Notably, the tutorial also discusses the instantiation of parameterized modules and the use of views, while emphasizing the importation and specification techniques within the Maude system. The tutorial further elucidates on the specification of stack, tree, and search tree data structures, highlighting the subtleties involved and the treatment of auxiliary data types such as forests.

Moreover, the tutorial delves into the concept of balancing search trees for improved efficiency, discussing solutions such as AVL trees, 2-3-4 trees, and red-black trees. It also touches upon leftist trees and the challenges associated with proving properties about search trees, including aspirations for exploring more complex relationships between different types of trees.

In essence, this tutorial aims to bolster the existing resources for Maude programming by providing a comprehensive library of data structures, thereby enhancing the usability and reusability of this powerful tool in diverse applications.
