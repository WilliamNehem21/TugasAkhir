This paper discusses the cooperative mechanism between constraint domains in the t oy system, a constraint functional logic programming implementation. The system follows a cooperative goal-solving approach based on lazy narrowing and manages the invocation of solvers for each domain and projection operations for converting constraints into mate domains through mediatorial constraints. Cooperation is implemented among the Herbrand, real arithmetic (R), finite domain (FD), and set (S) domains, with two mediatorial constraints connecting the FD and R domains, and the FD and S domains.

The t oy system solves goals and displays computed answers using a demand-driven lazy narrowing strategy combined with constraint solving. Features of the t oy system include the availability of the Herbrand solver, optional loading of real and finite domain solvers, and a beta version with a set constraint solver for solving intervals of sets of integers.

Projection occurs during goal solving when a constraint is submitted to its solver, where a mate constraint is built and submitted to the mate solver. This process is facilitated by projection rules and bridges between domains. The cooperation mechanism is demonstrated through examples, showcasing the potential of the t oy system in providing communication between the computation domains. Users typically write t oy program files and consult them before submitting goals, and can activate solvers using buttons in the environment.

The paper also introduces constraint functions and operators belonging to the FD and set domains, and explains the establishment of bridges between FD and set variables. Overall, the paper provides insights into the cooperative mechanism in the t oy system and its potential applications.
