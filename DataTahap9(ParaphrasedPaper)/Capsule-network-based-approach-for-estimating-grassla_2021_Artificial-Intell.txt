The grassland, which encompasses over 40% of China's land area, is the most extensive terrestrial ecosystem in the country. Approximately 78% of this grassland is situated in arid and semiarid regions and is crucial for sustaining animal husbandry and environmental conservation (Akiyama and Kawamura, 2007). In recent decades, grassland degradation has become a global concern, with approximately 90% of China's usable grassland experiencing varying degrees of degradation (Nan, 2005). Between 1982 and 2010, the degraded area in China accounted for 22.7% of the total grassland area.

To effectively monitor grassland degradation, remote sensing enables the estimation of key ecosystem parameters and functions, with vegetation coverage serving as a critical proxy. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and empirical models using satellite remote sensing datasets are two widely adopted approaches. SMA decomposes image pixels into linear components, known as endmembers, while empirical models establish relationships between remote sensing data and field survey data. The latter includes atmospheric or partially corrected atmosphere surface reflectances in near-infrared (NIR), red, and blue bands, with canopy background adjustment and coefficients for aerosol resistance. The study proposed a methodology using these techniques and achieved an improved accuracy of grassland coverage monitoring, with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient reaching 96.32% and 95.08%, respectively.

The study compared the proposed method with three other approaches and found that it delivered superior accuracy in classifying four different levels of grassland coverage. Particularly, it outperformed support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM NN) algorithms in accuracy assessment. The proposed method efficiently classified grassland coverage into high, medium, low, and other quantitative types, utilizing enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series data to predict grassland coverage and implementing capsule network for remote sensing image classification. The method achieved an accuracy of over 90% for each grassland class and an overall accuracy of 96.32%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.9508.
