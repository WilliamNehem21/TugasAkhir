The extensive array of challenges and solutions within the abstract interpretation framework is often influenced by the specific programming language and the property being analyzed. This dependence on language and property also reflects the semantic nature of abstract interpretation. Functional and logic programming languages, with strong semantic foundations, have served as fertile grounds for the development of advanced abstract domains and specialized fixpoint algorithms. However, the potential of abstract interpretation on mainstream programming platforms, particularly those utilizing object-oriented paradigms, is not fully realized, resulting in a fragmented landscape.

Various class analyses have been introduced in the literature, each considering different trade-offs between precision and cost. For instance, seminal work on untyped object-oriented languages has presented a highly precise but costly analysis, which has subsequently been refined to offer faster but less precise class analyses for the removal of virtual function calls in C++.

Class invariants are crucial for the effective software engineering of object-oriented programs, defining properties of a class that hold true before and after the execution of any method. They abstract the trace semantics by retaining only the states corresponding to the entry and exit points of method invocations of class instances.

A given abstract domain encompasses all properties captured by the refined domain along with additional ones specific to the refinement. Conversely, the extension of a base class inherits all behaviors of the ancestor class along with some additional ones, as exemplified by the classical 2D points and 3D points classes.
