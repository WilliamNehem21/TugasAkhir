The paper is organized as follows: in the subsequent section, an overview of the bio-pepa language and the deb theory is provided. Section 3 presents Pouvreau et al.'s deb model of the pacific oyster and describes its conversion to bio-pepa. This sets the stage for Section 4 to outline the general features of the translation process and present a generic approach to translating the deb theory to bio-pepa. The analysis of the pacific oyster case study is detailed in Section 5, while Section 6 summarizes the conclusion.

In the model, the agents carry out their enabled actions independently and concurrently. The model component s(x) represents the initial amount of the agent, where x is the parameter. Bio-pepa also allows the incorporation of timed events into the model. For instance, in epidemic networks, the introduction of a virus at a specific time can be depicted as an event.

The maintenance rate divided by the volume-specific cost for growth employs the specific rates defined in the deb model. V, a generic modifier in the other five actions, influences the kinetic rates and remains constant during these actions.

State variables in the deb model are typically v, e, and er, with the possibility of having more than one v and e. In the bio-pepa model, these variables are transformed into agents. According to Gurriero and Heath, the translation from simple ODE to bio-pepa is relatively straightforward, although it is worth noting that deb models include timed events, such as spawning, which are not accounted for in the ODEs of the models.

Integrating forcing variables into the model involves using wet laboratory values, typically entered at each data point in time. Since it is impractical to add each data point to every time point in a bio-pepa simulation, simple functions should be implemented to replicate the behavior of the forcing variables over time. Statistical techniques like regression can assist in this process.

The bio-pepa plug-in provides static analysis, which alerts the user to any syntactic and simple semantic errors in the model before running simulations. The outline view in the plug-in displays the actions and agents present, and indicates which of these actions serve as sources or sinks. This abstract view informs the user about the model, while the problems view highlights any syntax errors and also provides warnings for actions that need assessment. This static analysis instills confidence in the modeler regarding their understanding of the system and the syntactic correctness and consistency of their model, a feature lacking in ODE deb models and typical tools for processing ODEs.

The comparison between the bio-pepa model and the original deb model demonstrates that the bio-pepa model generates comparable results. It effectively simulates somatic growth and replicates a spawning event, with minor differences attributed to variations in forcing variable values.

The bio-pepa model accurately determines the timing of the spawning event, with simulations reaching the target value at precise times. However, for certain experiments, simulations do not reach the target value, signifying that a spawning event will not occur.

Parameter estimation and optimization techniques can be applied to bio-pepa models to determine unknown values, eliminating the need for additional wet laboratory experiments.

The generic translation approach has successfully facilitated the conversion of mathematical deb models to bio-pepa models. The results have been compared to the original deb model and published wet laboratory results, showcasing the utility of the translation process.

The bio-pepa model for the pacific oyster demonstrates its generic nature, providing results for different environmental conditions and state variables. This versatility enables its potential use in other related bivalve experiments, potentially informing and guiding further wet laboratory experiments, thus exemplifying the cycle of systems biology.

The translation to bio-pepa marks the initial stage of a research program designed to incorporate more complex, multi-scale model features, such as interactions between a population of oysters or interactions between oysters and their environment. A future line of research may involve developing a tool to facilitate the generic translation from deb models to bio-pepa models.
