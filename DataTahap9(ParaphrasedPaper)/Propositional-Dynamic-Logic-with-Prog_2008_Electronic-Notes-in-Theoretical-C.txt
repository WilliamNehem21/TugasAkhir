One motivation for examining propositional modal logics is to identify the fundamental logical aspects of the subject under consideration, such as time, certainty, knowledge, or the impact of imperative programs. Additionally, the aim is to create practical resources for logical reasoning and application. The focus on decidability, particularly in a manageable form, is crucial for the latter objective but not necessarily for the former. Introducing program quantifiers to PDL is intriguing as it provides a robust conceptual framework, although its complexity is comparable to that of full second order logic and surpasses that of other propositional formalisms.
