The research described in this paper focuses on the traditional use of Haplophyllum tuberculatum (H. tuberculatum) in Oman for various medical purposes, including the treatment of arthritis, nausea, fever, gastric pains, intestinal worms, and malaria. The study aims to prepare different extracts of H. tuberculatum with varying polarities and assess their antioxidant and cytotoxic activities using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and brine shrimp lethality (BSL) methods. The results indicate that the ethyl acetate extract demonstrates the highest antioxidant activity, while the butanol extract shows the highest cytotoxic activity. This study represents the first comprehensive investigation into the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of H. tuberculatum in Oman, suggesting potential therapeutic uses for this plant.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the traditional uses of H. tuberculatum for ailments such as fever, carminative and decongestant, as well as its external application for the treatment of ear and eye problems. The extract of the plant stem is also used to protect animals from insect bites, and it is used as an antispasmodic, antiflatulent, and to treat allergic rhinitis. Despite the medical importance of this plant, there is a lack of extensive research into the cytotoxic and antioxidant activities of the leaves of Omani H. tuberculatum, prompting the current study to address this gap.

The methodology involved the use of various chemicals and glassware, with the leaves of H. tuberculatum being washed, dried, and ground into a coarse powder. The methanol extract was then fractionated using solvents of increasing polarity, resulting in different extracts. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DPPH method, while the cytotoxic activity was assessed using the brine shrimp lethality method. Results indicated significant antioxidant and cytotoxic activities in all of the tested extracts. The research suggests that the leaves of H. tuberculatum contain bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic uses, and further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to explore these potential benefits.
