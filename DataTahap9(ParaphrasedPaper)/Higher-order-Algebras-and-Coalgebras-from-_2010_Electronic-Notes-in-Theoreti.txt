The investigation of algebras and coalgebras entails the parametric representation of a group of endofunctors, which can often be encapsulated as parameterized endofunctors. These parameterized endofunctors generate higher-order endofunctors on a functor category. We describe initial algebras and final coalgebras for these higher-order endofunctors, extending various findings in existing literature.

The subsequent sections of the paper are structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the concept of parameterized endofunctors and presents observations about specific examples. Section 3 sets the groundwork for the main outcome by establishing specific completeness and co-completeness conditions on parameterized endofunctors, which we refer to as suitability. Section 4 outlines the main results and furnishes a comprehensive proof for the algebraic scenario. We also offer examples of how these theorems can be applied in diverse contexts. The paper concludes with Section 5, which presents summarizing conclusions.

The definition of initial and final suitability extends various common concepts in the theory of algebras and coalgebras. Notably, free monads, completely iterative monads, and their duals are in fact predicated on initial or final suitability conditions for certain parameterized endofunctors. The subsequent examples elucidate how initial and final suitability broadens and consolidates these concepts.

The study of algebras and coalgebras often relies on the choice of the underlying category. In general, it is advantageous to select a category and examine interesting families of endofunctors that either admit algebras, coalgebras, or both. This research proposes considering functor categories as an attractive choice for the fixed category.

This finding serves as an application of Theorem 4.5, representing the most straightforward case where the parameter category b is non-discrete. The direct proof provided by Chuang and Lin is then applied to bestow inductive semantics on dependent types.
