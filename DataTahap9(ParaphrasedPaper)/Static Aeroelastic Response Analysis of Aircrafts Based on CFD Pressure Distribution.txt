The static aeroelastic problem governs aspects of flight such as load, lift, drag, control efficiency, aircraft trimming, static stability, and maneuvering quality under steady flight conditions. It exerts a significant influence on the performance and stability of modern high-performance aircraft, and therefore cannot be disregarded. Moreover, the increasingly shorter design cycles of modern aircraft necessitate more precise and efficient analysis methods during both the preliminary and detailed design phases.

This study recommends a static aeroelastic analysis method that utilizes surface elements and integrates CFD-derived pressure distribution, particularly for application in the early and detailed design stages of aircraft. The method involves using correction factors derived from external nonlinear steady aerodynamic pressure distribution data to adjust the aerodynamic influence coefficient matrix and the steady aerodynamic pressure distribution of a high-order panel method based on three-dimensional surface elements. By combining this approach with the modal method for elastic revision, the resulting static aeroelastic response analysis is accurate and efficient.

The study presents non-dimensionalized result data based on parameters such as shearing force (mg), bending moment (mgl), twisting moment (mgc), and wing tip vertical displacement (l), where 'm' represents wing mass, 'g' denotes gravity acceleration, 'l' refers to the reference half-wingspan, and 'c' represents the reference chord.

The analysis demonstrates that the method effectively revises the aerodynamic forces acting on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing, yielding revised aerodynamic pressure and distribution trends that align well with the original CFD results. This indicates the accuracy and validity of the revision method.

Comparison of shearing force and bending moment distributions along the wingspan reveals minimal differences in aerodynamic force values and trends between the high-order panel method and the high/low-order panel method revised by CFD data. Further refinement through elastic revision reduces these differences. The comparison of torsion moment distributions shows small differences in numerical values and trends between the high-order panel method and the high/low-order panel method revised by CFD data in both rigid and flexible cases, except for some discrepancies in the torsion moment distribution, attributed to the movement of the pressure center in the chordwise direction after the CFD data revision.
