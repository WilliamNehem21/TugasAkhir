New pathways have emerged for coordination models and languages within the framework of multiagent systems (MAS). By reinterpreting findings in terms of agent-oriented abstractions, new conceptual spaces have been identified, expanding the scope of coordination techniques well beyond their original domain. This is exemplified by the reconceptualization of coordination media as coordination artifacts within the MAS context.

Despite ongoing development in the conceptual foundations of MAS, significant progress is being driven by diverse contributions from distributed computing, programming languages, software engineering, simulation, artificial intelligence, and related fields converging towards an agent-oriented approach. Among the promising approaches, the A&A meta-model reinterprets MAS in terms of two fundamental abstractions: agents and artifacts. Agents, as active entities, encapsulate control and manage the goals/tasks constituting the MAS behavior. Artifacts, on the other hand, are passive and reactive entities responsible for providing services and functions that enable individual agents to collaborate within the MAS, shaping the agent environment in accordance with MAS requirements. The A&A meta-model significantly influences the engineering, programming, and simulation of MAS. Along this line, coordination artifacts can be conceived as a generalization of coordination media, representing specialized artifacts that encapsulate coordination services for MAS.

The complex activities within social systems captured by AT (ambient calculus) and distributed cognition are paralleled in MAS. Therefore, an interdisciplinary study of these conceptual frameworks is deemed essential for the analysis and synthesis of social activities within MAS, particularly in relation to the artifacts mediating such activities. Examples range from coordination abstractions such as tuple centers to infrastructure for stigmergy coordination, exemplified by the pheromone infrastructure, and the institution abstraction in electronic-institution approaches.

In the realm of managing interactions, coordination models and infrastructures such as Tucson provide natural technologies for testing the A&A approach. Consequently, revising Tucson models and languages from the A&A perspective is deemed suitable. Specifically, this paper reinterprets, revises, extends, and completes the Respect language for programming Tucson tuple centers to align with the A&A meta-model for MAS, aiming to demonstrate the modeling power of A&A when applied to MAS coordination and to provide MAS engineers with reliable and tested technologies for building MAS artifacts.

Tucson, a general-purpose agent-oriented model and infrastructure for MAS coordination, is based on a coordination model that introduces tuple centers as first-class abstractions for designing and developing general-purpose coordination artifacts. Tuple centers in Tucson are programmed using the respect logic-based specification language, which embodies generative communication, associative access, and suspensive semantics. The twofold nature of respect tuples allows for intelligent agents to reason about collaboration activities and influence their dynamics, promoting uniform representation of knowledge and control within the coordination artifact. Extensions such as linkability and situatedness have been introduced to refine the original Respect specification and are integrated within the A&A Respect framework.

The A&A Respect model developed in this paper encompasses the A&A meta-model and its general event model, extending the linkability of artifacts to maximize its reach. Situatedness of artifacts is also recognized as a general issue and fully formalized within the A&A Respect framework. The integration of these features in the A&A Respect model expands its capabilities and enhances its applicability.
