To tackle the above-mentioned issue, this paper introduces a specialized two-stage evolutionary algorithm named nacmoea, which is targeted at addressing niche-related challenges in optimization problems. This algorithm leverages dual collaborative archives and integrates a novel approach for incorporating infeasible solutions. The primary characteristics of this proposed approach are detailed below.

The nacmoea algorithm is based on the concept of a dual-archive set, initially introduced in the ctaea framework. In this approach, the two archive sets have complementary roles to ensure diversity within the population while simultaneously promoting convergence and feasibility. Another related framework, the ccmo framework, employs a dual-population co-evolutionary strategy based on a weak cooperative relationship. This strategy allows two sub-populations to evolve independently and share their offspring at distinct environmental selection stages. The c-dpea algorithm utilizes an adaptive penalty function to facilitate evolution using information from infeasible solutions and introduces a new objective function to balance population convergence and diversity. Additionally, the bico approach employs a bidirectional co-evolutionary strategy to approximate the constrained Pareto front from both feasible and infeasible perspectives. Meanwhile, the cmocso framework addresses constrained many-objective optimization problems through a competition and cooperation mechanism between two swarm optimizers, effectively enhancing convergence. The moea/d-dae framework offers a detection and escape mechanism for constrained many-objective optimization problems, determining whether the population is trapped in a local optimum based on the overall constraint violation rate of change.

In c-anea, an angle-based constraint dominance rule and density estimation method allow infeasible solutions with strong convergence to survive, aiding the population in crossing infeasible regions. Similarly, the ship strategy imposes a shift-based penalty on infeasible solutions, retaining those that do not fall into the region dominated by locally feasible nadir after the shift. Drawing inspiration from multi-task evolution, the mtcmo framework utilizes a highly related dynamic auxiliary task for the original problem and designs an improved constraint relaxation method to leverage high-quality infeasible solutions.

The ppta and dtaea frameworks propose push-pull and two-phase search strategies, respectively, leveraging dual archives and feasibility-based single population searches to enhance performance. The dd-cmoea algorithm employs a dual-stage and dual-population strategy to enhance search capability, while the fnds method focuses on population partitioning based on feasible non-dominated solution sets. Additionally, the cdp procedure, initially proposed by Deb et al. in nsga-ii, classifies the population into three categories and assigns a higher selection priority to solutions with high feasibility and excellent convergence.

Furthermore, the academic community has recommended additional strategies, including the c3m framework for determining constraint priorities, the nrc framework for utilizing multiple procedures to move the population towards the constrained Pareto front, the moea/d-dpf approach for dynamic penalty function integration, and the tige-2 framework for balancing convergence, diversity, and feasibility using multi-objective techniques.

The paper introduces a dual archive procedure comprising a convergence archive (CA) and a feasibility archive (FA) for assignment division and collaboration. The CA retains the uncovered Pareto front, utilizing angle-based niches to partition the objective space and establish spatial relationships between individuals. Meanwhile, the FA serves as the output population, storing elite solutions near the constrained Pareto front and employing a niche-based individual updating strategy to balance convergence, feasibility, and diversity. This strategy aims to select the most feasible individuals within a niche and, when niches are sparsely populated, ensures exploration in an approximate direction.

In the utilization strategy of infeasible solutions, angle-based niches provide directional information, pairing feasible and infeasible solutions in the same direction to generate offspring individuals. This enhances the convergence and diversity of feasible solutions and facilitates the attainment of a complete constrained Pareto front.

The dual archives perform distinct roles and collaborate effectively at different stages of the search. The transition between these stages is determined by evaluating the non-dominant coverage rate metric, reflecting the dominance relationship of the current generation population compared to its historical counterparts. In the experimental section, the proposed algorithm is compared with seven other advanced approaches on 28 test problems, demonstrating its superior performance. The study also introduces two variants of nacmoea, validating the effectiveness of the dual archive cooperation mechanism and the infeasible solution utilization strategy.

In conclusion, the paper proposes a multi-stage framework based on the niche technique, underscoring the importance of a balanced strategy encompassing convergence, feasibility, and diversity. It also highlights the potential of infeasible solutions in exploring unknown feasible regions and enhancing algorithm performance. While the proposed algorithm exhibits promising results, opportunities for its extension and improvement are identified, including enhancements to environment selection and archive update strategies, increased selection pressure, and the incorporation of multi-modal optimization techniques to address more challenging constrained multi-objective optimization problems.
