The research paper discusses the differences between deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in performing various tasks, highlighting the advantage of DL in handling image compression through techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNN), but also noting the issue of information loss leading to blurry images. The paper introduces a compression method using stacked autoencoders (SAE) and a content-based image filter to enhance the quality of reconstructed images, and it outlines the structure of the research paper with its sections. It also explores the use of variational autoencoders (VAE) and the introduction of a residual enhancement vector (REV) to further improve the compression and decompression process. The paper provides experimental results comparing the proposed compression model with JPEG-encoded images and demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed model in terms of structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores in several experiments.
