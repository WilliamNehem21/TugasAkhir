In many proposed designs for quantum computing, the nature of the physical system prohibits individual control of qubits. In such systems, universal computation may be achieved through collective manipulation of the system as a whole. In this paper, we present a method for globally controlled quantum information processing that incorporates a fault-tolerant quantum error correction mechanism. Our approach relies on three types of addressable two-level systems arranged in a one-dimensional array according to a specific periodic pattern. We demonstrate that this method exhibits a fault-tolerant error threshold.

The controlled phase operations are uniformly applied between neighboring qubits in the system. We consider the spin chain to be susceptible to temporal errors, which we assume to manifest as independent Pauli errors. We develop a hierarchy of logical meta-qubit encodings to mitigate errors, culminating in an effective meta-Ising model at the highest level, where associated meta-ZZ, meta-H, and meta-CZ operations display significantly reduced error rates. Quantum computation can then be implemented on this meta-cellular automaton using established approaches. While we establish the presence of a fault-tolerant threshold in our model, we do not provide specific estimates for the magnitude of the threshold at this time, focusing instead on demonstrating its existence.

In a previous study, we explored a setup where the ends of the chain were individually addressable due to having only a single nearest neighbor. However, it is not suitable to utilize end systems as an entropy sink, as the rate of errors in the chain depends on its length. This limits the removal of entropy from the system to a constant rate given the fixed positioning of the entropy sinks at the ends of the chain. In the subsequent discussions, we treat species A, B, and C as distinct physical entities.

We consider all errors occurring in the system to be random Pauli operators. This approach is justified as any system operation can be expressed as a sum of Pauli operators, weighted by complex coefficients, and the identity. Additionally, error detection procedures typically project the encoded qubit onto an uncorrupted state or onto a state with a Pauli group operator error. For simplicity, we focus on the effects of single-qubit errors, though more general errors can be handled similarly.

We begin by examining how a single level of error correction can be executed before progressing to the discussion of how this scheme can be extended to arbitrary higher levels. While many operations are performed in a consistent manner at both the base level and at higher levels, there are several essential distinctions.

The Hamiltonian dictates that controlled interactions are feasible between spins i and i+1 within the same subchain. The coupling between the end spin and the first spin of the next species is averaged out to zero, allowing for the independent control of species A and C, and the coupling between B and C.

Though not all codes are identical, stabilizer codes share common attributes. In any stabilizer encoding, logical qubit Pauli operators can be implemented through a combination of local Pauli gates on each of the underlying qubits. It is possible to implement each of these local gates similarly to how local gates were achieved in the rest of the system.

Many stabilizer codes also enable the application of Clifford group operations in a transversal manner. The Steane code is particularly advantageous in this context, as it allows for the application of a Hadamard gate to the logical qubit by applying Hadamard gates transversally to the underlying qubits. Remarkably, this corresponds to a single global pulse.

We demonstrate that a CZ operation can be performed using only local rotations on C spins, together with the A-C and C-B Ising interactions. As the C species spins are isolated, local rotations upon them are trivial. Using this approach for each pair of spins in the encoding, we can execute transversal CZ gates between species A and B.

Since it is not feasible to introduce new ancillary qubits, we must repurpose the qubits within the chain. Periodically resetting ancillary qubits is necessary for achieving this, without compromising the information at higher levels of encoding. Given the delocalization of qubits at higher levels, the reset procedure must be adaptable to the concatenation level.

We have now demonstrated how error correction can be carried out within the chain and how logic gates can be executed on encoded qubits without propagating errors within those encodings. However, this is insufficient to prove the feasibility of fault-tolerant computation. To establish that fault-tolerant computation is indeed possible, we must show the existence of an error rate below which any errors can be arbitrarily suppressed through the concatenation of the error correction code. This is not guaranteed, as concatenating codes may introduce errors at a higher rate than they are suppressed by the concatenation, leading to an increase in the error rate. Nonetheless, we show that a threshold does exist below which errors can be suppressed by concatenating the code.
