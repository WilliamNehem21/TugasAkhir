The extensive availability of rapidly accumulating information in data repositories presents a formidable challenge in extracting accurate and precise information. This has led to increased competition among developers to gain access to technology capable of comprehending the research intent and contextual meaning of terms. Despite the infancy of competition for the development of Arabic semantic search systems, the complexity of the Arabic language, with its intricate morphological, grammatical, and semantic aspects, presents a significant obstacle. In this document, we aim to showcase and introduce an ontological search engine known as ibri-casonto for colleges of applied sciences in Oman. Our proposed engine supports both Arabic and English languages and employs two types of search, namely keyword-based search and semantics-based search. Utilizing various technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) data and ontological graph, ibri-casonto's experiments are presented in two sections. The first section compares entity-search and classical-search within ibri-casonto, while the second section compares the entity-search of ibri-casonto with commonly used search engines, such as Kngine, Wolfram Alpha, and Google, to measure their performance and efficiency.

Ontology addresses the limitations of RDFS, making it the closest concept to semantic search. While the term "ontology" has long been employed by the artificial intelligence and knowledge representation community, it has recently become part of the standard terminology of a broader community, including information systems modeling. Ontology, borrowed from philosophy, refers to a systematic account of existence, addressing fundamental questions about existence and the makeup of the world.

Ontologies are categorized into three types based on their level of conceptualization: top-level ontology, domain ontology, and application ontology. Each type encompasses a specific range and capacity of information. For example, top-level ontology embodies general notions that are independent of a particular problem or domain and are applicable across domains, including vocabulary related to things, events, time, and space. Conversely, domain ontology represents data in a specific domain and offers vocabularies concerning concepts, relationships, or theories governing the domain, often incorporating axiomatic theories to clarify the intended meanings of terms used in specific domains. In addition, application ontologies can be derived from reference ontologies, streamlining the process of ontology development by utilizing pre-existing references and making minimal modifications as necessary.

The document discusses two types of search: classical search and semantic search. The classical search involves popularized keywords and enables users to submit a set of keywords to the search engine, which then returns a ranked list of information. In contrast, semantic search addresses the limitations of keyword-based search engines, aiming to understand the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning of the user query, ultimately providing more relevant and accurate outcomes. While the semantic search has been tackled and resolved by numerous semantic search engines, there are few ontological search engines that support the Arabic language, primarily due to the challenges in natural language processing and addressing syntactic search gaps to produce synonym meanings of words.

Arabic is integral to the majority of the Middle Eastern population and is the mother tongue and religious language of Muslims worldwide. The paper emphasizes the implementation of the ontological search engine, ibri-casonto, which supports both Arabic and English languages, with a focus on discussing the Arabic search. Furthermore, the paper presents the structure of the remainder of the document, including sections on the researcher efforts in building ontological search engines, the Arabic language and its relation to ontology, discussion on ontology components, detailed presentation of the proposed engine ibri-casonto, experimental evaluations comparing the proposed engine with other semantic engines, and concluding remarks with suggestions for future improvements.

Ontology is viewed as a gateway for enhancing the intelligence and power of search engines, serving as a vital mission for the current generation of the web, known as Web 3.0, and as a future mission for Web 4.0. Arabic language, with its significance to the population of the Middle East and Muslims globally, comprises 28 alphabets and is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, spoken as the mother tongue by over 330 million people worldwide.

The core component of most ontologies is classes, which represent a collection of individuals sharing common characteristics. Classes may be arranged hierarchically, with one class serving as a subclass to another. Individual objects within a domain are represented as instances, serving as the base unit of ontology. The ontology representation language and editor, as well as defining instances for each class, are essential steps in ontology development.

The paper also delves into the technologies and tools utilized in the development of ibri-casonto, such as the use of Apache Jena TDB for maintaining the triple-store and Apache Jena Fuseki for supporting semantic searching. It emphasizes the importance of a user-friendly interface and discusses metrics for evaluating the performance and accuracy of the search engine, such as recall and precision.
