This paper introduces a method to establish stochastic boundaries for a broad range of optimization problems on graphs in scenarios where the parameters for links are random variables, such as costs, weights, or delays. The study focuses on problems grounded in convex operators with polynomial complexity in the case of deterministic parameters. However, if the parameters, such as link delay, are discrete random variables, the complexity of the problems significantly increases, often resulting in NP-completeness. To address this, the paper proposes stochastic upper and lower bounds based on convex order, aiming to strike a balance between computation complexity and the accuracy of the bounds. The method involves simplifying discrete distributions to obtain easier-to-handle bounding distributions and designing a polynomial time algorithm to compute an upper bound. The approach is demonstrated through the calculation of task graph execution time.

The conventional assumption in optimization problems that edge or node costs are deterministic does not hold true in many real-world scenarios, such as communication networks where elements may suffer from various issues leading to partial or complete unavailability. To address this, the study analyzes the distribution of optimization results considering the probability distributions associated with edges and nodes. The scope of the analysis covers optimization problems like max-flow, shortest path, reliability, minimum spanning tree, and completion time, which are based on convex or concave operators. The paper also presents a distinct approach to bounding the execution time of a task graph with independently and exponentially distributed delays, using strong stochastic bounds.

The paper focuses on distributions of probability for edges as discrete, obtained directly from measurements rather than through fitting algorithms. Technical details include a brief introduction to strong stochastic order and convex order, definition of the optimization problem family, elementary actions for designing upper and lower bounds, the presentation of an optimal algorithm for upper bounds, and an illustrative example of a directed graph optimization problem.

The study aims to reduce the number of atoms while maintaining qualitative information on results using various stochastic orders, without establishing new complexity results. The paper emphasizes the importance of corollary 2.14, which discusses how replacing random durations with their expectations introduces bias, subsequently impacting the results. Additionally, the paper outlines computations required for obtaining upper bounding distributions and their associated graph, as well as the limitations of the method, while highlighting its promising theoretical results and practical applications. The paper also explores potential applications of the approach in combination with other structure-based approaches. Finally, the authors mention ongoing work to implement numerical methods in a software tool named xborne to study stochastic bounds.
