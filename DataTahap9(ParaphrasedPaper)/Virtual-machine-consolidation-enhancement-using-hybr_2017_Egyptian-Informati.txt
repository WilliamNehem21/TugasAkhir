The use of cloud computing enables the flexible scaling and cost-effective business model for computing and information technology services by eliminating upfront capital and operational expenses, but it also leads to high energy consumption and operating costs as well as carbon dioxide emissions in data centers. This excessive energy usage is attributed not only to the large quantity of computing resources and inefficient hardware power usage but also to the inefficient utilization of these resources. One potential solution to address this energy inefficiency is to leverage virtualization technology, which can reduce energy consumption by switching idle nodes to low-power modes (such as sleep or hibernation) to eliminate idle power consumption. Additionally, using live migration, virtual machines (VMs) can be dynamically consolidated to minimize resource usage.

While existing research often migrates VMs based on CPU utilization, as there is a known relationship between a server's total power consumption and its CPU utilization, this approach may provide accurate predictions for CPU-intensive applications but tends to be inaccurate for other types of applications such as network, I/O, and memory-intensive applications. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to propose a virtual machine consolidation technique. The paper includes sections covering virtual machine selection, related work, multiple regression host overload detection (MRHOD) algorithm, hybrid local regression host overload detection, evaluation methodology, simulation results and analysis, and concludes with a discussion on future work.

The study evaluates various VM selection policies for addressing host overload, presenting three different policies: random choice, maximum correlation, and the MRHOD algorithm. The MRHOD algorithm aims to enhance VM consolidation using hybrid factors and is presented in detail in the paper. Simulation results indicate that MRHOD and hybrid local regression host overload detection (HLRHOD) algorithms exhibit higher energy savings compared to other methods, particularly when running random workload traces.

The paper also discusses other approaches and algorithms for energy-efficient scheduling and VM consolidation, such as distributed system architectures, energy-aware allocation and consolidation models, heuristics based on historical data, and host overload detection algorithms based on statistical and fuzzy logic methods. It also covers the implementation of OpenStack NEAT to provide a framework for dynamic VM consolidation based on the OpenStack platform and concludes with a proposed MRHOD algorithm and its effectiveness in minimizing energy consumption and optimizing VM migration decisions based on the results of the experiments.

In summary, the study investigates different VM selection and overload detection algorithms for energy-efficient VM consolidation in cloud data centers, highlighting the advantages of the proposed MRHOD algorithm in reducing energy consumption and improving performance metrics. The paper provides a detailed overview of the proposed approach and its comparison with existing methods, demonstrating its potential in enhancing energy efficiency in cloud computing environments.
