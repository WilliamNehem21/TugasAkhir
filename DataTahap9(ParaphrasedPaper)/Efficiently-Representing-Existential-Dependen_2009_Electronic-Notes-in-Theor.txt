The study addresses the problem of identifying variable dependencies in quantified boolean formulas (QBFs) in prenex conjunctive normal form (PCNF). Previous research has proposed a formal definition of dependencies based on quantifier prefix reordering, stating that two variables are independent if swapping them in the prefix does not alter the satisfiability of the formula. Instead of considering the general case, the study focuses on identifying sets of existential variables that depend on universal variables, which is particularly relevant for expansion-based QBF solvers. The study presents an approach for efficiently computing existential dependency sets using a directed connection relation over variables, and demonstrates how this relation can be compactly represented as a tree using a union-find data structure. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

QBF logic extends propositional logic (SAT) with universal quantification. Although QBF is not more expressive than SAT, some problems from model checking and verification can be encoded more concisely in QBF than in SAT. Progress in the development of efficient decision procedures based on the DPLL framework has been achieved in the domain of SAT, thanks to advanced strategies for pruning the search space such as learning, backjumping, or restarts. These techniques have been extended to DPLL-based algorithms for QBF as well, but they have not led to similar progress as for SAT, despite their importance for performance.

There is strong indication that the quantifier prefix of QBFs in PCNF could be a reason for this phenomenon. The presence of different types of quantifiers in QBF introduces dependencies between variables that need to be taken into account by QBF solvers. In many cases, dependencies resulting from linear quantifier prefixes are overly pessimistic and negatively affect solver performance. The formal definition of dependencies suggests that the problem of identifying the optimal (smallest) dependency set is PSPACE-complete, similar to the decision problem of QBF. As a result, a compromise needs to be made between efficiency and optimality. Various approaches have been proposed to identify dependencies and overcome the drawback of linear quantifier prefixes, all based on analyzing the syntactic structure of a QBF.

For more detailed information about expansion, readers are referred to the aforementioned publications. The study focuses on the efficient computation and representation of "d(x)" and the cardinality of "d(x)." Duplicating variables is necessary to reflect the possibility of a depending existential variable assuming different values with respect to the value of the universal variable.
