Research in criminology indicates that crime is not evenly distributed among individuals and locations, and repeat crimes play a significant role in this pattern. About half of all crimes in the United States are committed by individuals with prior arrest records, and there is a substantial overlap between the populations of crime victims and arrestees. Studies have shown that victims of personal or property crimes and gun violence are at an elevated risk of experiencing further criminal incidents within a few months of an initial incident. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect a similar pattern to exist.

The motivation for this study stems from our collaboration with the Chicago Police Department and our research team at the Illinois Institute of Technology. We have developed prediction algorithms to estimate the risk of future violence for individuals with extensive criminal histories, and we believe that understanding the interpersonal near-repeat effect will enhance the power of these prediction algorithms. We aim to not only contribute to our understanding of crime behavior but also to have practical implications for the rapidly developing field of crime prediction. To provide context for our work, we will review basic concepts of the near-repeat effect and social networks.

Previous research has shown repeat effects in various criminal activities in different locations. Additionally, the influence of social networks on criminal behavior has been investigated, with evidence suggesting that the spread of repeat effects within a criminal social network is plausible. We constructed a social network using arrestee data, where each arrestee is represented as a node. When multiple individuals are arrested together, their nodes become connected in the social network. Although our network is dynamic, unweighted, and undirected, our analysis can be adapted to other types of networks.

We utilized geodesic distance to measure the separation between individuals in the social network and investigated the association between individuals' positions in the network and the occurrence of repeat crimes. Our study focused on both violent and non-violent crimes and found evidence of repeat effects within certain time frames, particularly in relation to violent crimes.
