This section examines the recent methods for predicting customer churn. Coussement et al. introduced a risk prediction technique for identifying potential churners, which uses generalized additive models (GAM). These models relax the linearity constraints to allow for complex non-linear fits to the data, improving marketing decisions by identifying at-risk customers and visualizing non-linear relationships.

Class imbalance significantly affects classifier reliability, with the underrepresentation of the minority class leading to undertraining. Zhu et al. proposed a technique to address this issue using transfer learning, training the classifier on customer behavioral data from related domains, particularly focusing on the banking industry for enhanced performance. Another technique by Xiao et al. addresses the imbalance nature of churn prediction, while Amin et al. presented a comparison of sampling techniques for effectively operating on churn data, including game theory-based approaches.

Due to the complexity of data, there is an increasing use of heuristics for predictions. Huang et al. employed rule generation techniques using heuristics for customer churn prediction in telecom services, while Faris et al. used a combination of self-organizing maps (SOM) and genetic programming (GP) to identify and predict churn, utilizing SOM to cluster customers and GP to build an enhanced classification tree.

The classification process begins with building the search space, where an initial population of fireflies is generated and distributed randomly. The position of each firefly is recorded, and their initial intensity is identified based on their distance from the test data. This process continues until a specified stopping criterion is met, typically set with conditions for reaching a maximum number of generations (maxgen) or for not moving to a better solution for a specified number of iterations. Cross-validation is then performed to assess the accuracy of the classifier.

The interpretation of the algorithm's performance shows very high true positive rates (TPR) and low false positive rates (FPR) initially, although the FPR ultimately exhibits a significant increase.
