The agent named Alice runs program E with qubits and inputs to produce specified outputs. In this context, an agent represents a piece of code running on a specific processor.
In subsequent discussions, we denote the set of input qubits as i= iii and the set of output qubits as o= iq', while d(hi) and d(ho) represent the quantum input and output spaces, respectively. The semantics of a network in relation to a schedule is such that it connects quantum states in d(hi) along with classical input to quantum states in d(ho) and classical output with specific probabilities. It is important to note that the transition system type is a mapping from initial to final sorts; this particular component is identical in the denotational semantics developed in section 2.2.
When we discard all distributed information, including sorts and communication events, we are left with an ordinary pattern, which is a quantum operation. One consideration to note is that due to asynchronous computation, there is typically some flexibility in the order in which agents execute events in their program â€” there can be different possible schedules. However, because at each instance of the computation, local events operate on disjoint sets of qubits, the order of these operations or whether they are executed simultaneously does not actually matter. This statement is formally proven in section 2.4, and it is crucial for other situations covered below. Consequently, any schedule of the computation yields the same quantum operation. To determine the operation elements of L, a specific schedule is chosen, and patterns are then composed accordingly.
In the case where the network includes classical outputs o= ioi, a distinction needs to be made between signal outputs, which are measurement outcomes, and external outputs, which are values originally inputted by an agent and passed around the network. The external outputs oe= ioi,e depend solely on the classical input i, and these constant values are transmitted via classical channels. On the other hand, the signal outputs os= ioi,s depend on the quantum operation and vice versa. When there are signal outputs, specific measurement outcomes are included within the quantum operations in the denotational semantics. This abstraction, combined with schedule-independence, makes the denotational framework advantageous. In fact, classical inputs remain the same for all schedules, and classical outputs, which depend on classical inputs and measurement values, thus occur with the same probabilities for all schedules due to the schedule-independence of L. Taking all of this into account, we have os= o1,s o2,s, and the quantum operations operate on the same i and o as mentioned earlier. Therefore, we only need to verify that first composing the quantum operations and then restricting them is the same as first restricting and then composing, which follows from the similar result for ordinary patterns.
