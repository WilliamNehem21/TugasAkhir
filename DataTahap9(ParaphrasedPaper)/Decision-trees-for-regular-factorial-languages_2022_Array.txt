In a previously published academic paper, a classification scheme for arbitrary regular languages was introduced, which was based on the smoothed minimum depth of decision trees required to solve the problem of recognition nondeterministically. However, this classification was presented without proofs. This paper aims to provide a simpler classification scheme for regular factorial languages, accompanied by a complete proof. The results presented in this paper are novel and pertain to decision trees that solve the membership problem.



It is widely acknowledged that every regular language can be depicted using a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). In this study, we will not only consider complete DFAs with a total transition function, but also partial DFAs with a partial transition function. Such DFAs can be represented by their corresponding transition diagrams (referred to as diagrams hereafter).
