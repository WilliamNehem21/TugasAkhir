In simple terms, a net n can be visualized as a graph with agents located at the vertices and edges connecting at most two ports. The ports that are not connected to any edge are considered free. There are two special cases of a net: a wiring (where there are no agents) and an empty net. The boundaries of wirings are also referred to as free ports. The interface of a net is defined as its set of free ports.

In the context of a case agent, the top auxiliary port represents the output. The interaction rule specifies that a specific branch i corresponding to a constructor ci is selected and connected to the output port, while all other branches are removed. It is important to note that all patterns are assumed to be disjoint (non-overlapping) but may not necessarily cover all possibilities. If a case agent is connected to a constructor for which there is no corresponding branch, the interaction results in a failure.

The following compilation involves a net p as the common prefix, with principal ports pointing towards t. This implies that the rules in a specific subsection will be applied. The diagram assumes that there are no additional elements to the pattern, as this scenario has already been addressed earlier.
