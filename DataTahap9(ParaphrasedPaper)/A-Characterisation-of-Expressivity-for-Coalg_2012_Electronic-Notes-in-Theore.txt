This paper presents a category-theoretic characterization of expressivity for coalgebraic bisimulation, building on the prior work that established this characterization in terms of internal models for a modal logic. The paper extends this work to encompass both bisimulation and simulation. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the framework, Section 3 introduces preordered sets, Section 4 revisits necessary definitions and results, Section 5 defines the generalized notion of expressivity, Section 6 presents the main characterization result, and Section 7 applies this result to the expressivity of simulation for finite branching labeled transition systems. The standard approach to coalgebraic modal logic is enriched in a symmetric monoidal closed category, and all categories, functors, etc. discussed are assumed to be enriched. The category 'x' represents a collection of state spaces, with generalised transition systems defined as coalgebras for an endofunctor 't'. Similarly, the category 'a' represents a collection of base logics, and modal operators are introduced via an endofunctor 'l', with the corresponding modal logics as 'l-algebras'. Future sections will require colimits of models, specifically conical colimits. The type 'r' determines the specific behavioral relation, and the definition of the functor 't' determines the meaning of simulation for the 't-coalgebras'. The paper demonstrates that each model for 'l' factors via an 'r-model', and the existence of coproducts in 'setr' is used to conclude that 'l' is expressive for the simulation of finite branching labeled transition systems.
