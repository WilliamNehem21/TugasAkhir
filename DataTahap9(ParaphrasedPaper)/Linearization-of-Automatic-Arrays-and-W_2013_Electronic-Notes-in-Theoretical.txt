The validity of the expression (mk + i, nl + j)k, l can be confirmed by observing that [mk + i]k = [m]ki and [nl + j]l = [n]lj. Consequently, the final pair in the standard k, l-encoding will be (i, j), while the preceding symbols will simply represent the k, l-encoding of (m, n). Thus, (mk + i, nl + j)k, l is equivalent to (m, n)k, l(i, j).

This result can also be inferred from the definition of the automata that operates on pairs of digit representations. By examining the pairs of red and black digits, which correspond to the encoding of the position in the array, we can see that at the position (2, 3)2,2 = (1, 1)(0, 1) = (0, 0)(1, 1)(0, 1) (highlighted in bold), we obtain the thirteenth element of the stream, with 001101 equaling 2.

We have outlined the interpretation of wvk, l(w,...,w) as the grid ord(a: lin(w)), and due to the isomorphic generating grammars, every weave term is the z-ordering of a zip term. Consequently, weave specifications will possess the same existence and uniqueness conditions for their solutions as their related zip specifications.

The unique solution is provided by the 2,2-automatic array from section 2.5. Since all weave terms are the z-ordering of a zip term, it is possible to easily translate between the two formats. This immediately leads to the following theorem.
