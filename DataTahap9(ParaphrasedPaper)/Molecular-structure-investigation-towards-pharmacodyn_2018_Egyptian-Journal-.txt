The compound hypoxanthine, a purine derivative with a nitrogenous base, belongs to the heterocycles family, which is characterized by pyrimidine and imidazole rings. These heterocycles exhibit unique structures and possess significant biochemical, pharmacological, and physicochemical properties. In recent decades, various pyrimidine derivatives, particularly those fused with imidazole rings, have shown broad clinical and pharmacological applications due to their wide spectrum of biological activities.

Despite the compound's unique tautomerism and hydrogen bond characteristics, there has been limited research on the reaction pathways, structure-activity relationships, and interpretation of the physicochemical properties of hypoxanthine. In this study, we conducted a detailed analysis to understand the pharmaceutical activity of the compound, using experimental and theoretical molecular spectroscopy tools.

Our findings suggest that the molecule's reactivity and new drug properties can be attributed to the presence of inductive and resonance effects in the rings and the attached atoms. Moreover, the arrangement of heteronuclear atoms in chemical bonds contributes to increased covalent energy and the augmentation of molecular orbital energy difference, leading to heightened chemical activity and potential pharmacological effects.

Additionally, our investigation revealed that the chemical shifts in the molecule, particularly in the imine groups, play a significant role in inducing drug properties. Moreover, the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) provided insights into the chemical reactivity and biological activity of the compound, highlighting its potential for interacting with chemical reagents or biological receptors.

Furthermore, our analysis of dipole moments and ionization potential indicated the compound's inhibition character and its ability to maintain stabilized chemical reactive energy. Notably, the compound's electronegativity values reflect its potential to bind with protein complexes and accumulate electron clouds, supporting its pharmaceutical properties.

In conclusion, the compound's hyper symmetrical polarizations and specific energy transitions within the six-membered ring contribute to its pharmaceutical properties and potential as an enriched antibiotic compound. These findings offer valuable insights into the pharmaceutical activity of hypoxanthine and pave the way for further research and applications in drug development.
