An example of an unbounded functor is represented by the power set functor, denoted as p, where its coalgebras correspond to well-known transition systems. It is evident that the terminal p-coalgebra, which is the empty product, is non-existent because the cardinality of any set x is less than the cardinality of its power set, p(x).
