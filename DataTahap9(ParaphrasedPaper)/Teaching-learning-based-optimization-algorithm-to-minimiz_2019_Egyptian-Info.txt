Image thresholding is a crucial method for segmenting images, and among the various techniques for multilevel thresholding, the cross entropy approach is widely utilized to determine multilevel threshold values. The primary objective of multilevel cross entropy thresholding techniques is to identify an optimal set of threshold values across different levels to minimize the cross entropy. This paper proposes the use of the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm to achieve this objective, resulting in a new approach termed TLBO-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (TLBO-based MCET) algorithm. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated using standard test images and is compared with other thresholding techniques such as firefly-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (FF-based MCET), honey bee mating optimization-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (HBMO-based MCET), and quantum particle swarm optimization-based minimum cross entropy thresholding (Quantum PSO-based MCET).

The main goal is to find an optimal combination of thresholds to minimize cross entropy, which can then be applied to segment the input image. The fitness function for the TLBO algorithm is determined by the cross entropy of the input image and the segmented image. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the TLBO algorithm, Section 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed TLBO-based MCET algorithm, Section 4 presents a thorough performance evaluation, and Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests future research directions.

In the learning phase of the TLBO algorithm, the approach emphasizes the transfer of knowledge from more knowledgeable students to less knowledgeable ones, mirroring a classroom setting. The proposed TLBO-based MCET algorithm demonstrates superior performance in terms of uniformity and fitness value compared to other methods. The experimental results indicate that the selected thresholds of the TLBO-based MCET algorithm effectively yield optimal solutions based on the minimum cross entropy criterion, establishing it as an efficient and feasible method for determining optimal threshold values across multiple levels.
