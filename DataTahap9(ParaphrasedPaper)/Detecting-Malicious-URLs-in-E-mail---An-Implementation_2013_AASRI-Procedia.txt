The distribution of information is facilitated by dissemination, which enables the timely, rapid, and easy exchange of information. Identity theft and identity fraud are two aspects of cybercrime in which hackers and malicious users acquire the personal data of legitimate users and use it for fraudulent or deceptive purposes in pursuit of financial gain. Phishing emails, designed to resemble legitimate communications, are used as a means to trick users into divulging sensitive information such as usernames, account numbers, passwords, and other financial credentials through the use of malicious URLs. Spam emails can often evolve into phishing emails, and spoofed emails, in which the sender impersonates a legitimate organization, play a significant role in tricking users into providing personal information. The content of these emails may circumvent content-based filters, and in some cases, the email may contain no message body apart from a malicious URL. This paper aims to detect malicious URLs in emails using a method that reduces the number of features used for identification.

The age of a domain is utilized as a means to identify potentially malicious websites, as newly registered domains are often used to obtain user credentials. These domains, being relatively new, may typically send a higher volume of emails, and some may not even be accessible at the time of inspection. The timeframe for domain registrations can range from a few months to several years, and the whois lookups on the whois server are employed to retrieve the domain registration date. If the domain registration entry is not found on the whois server, this feature is indicated as -1, signifying suspicion.
