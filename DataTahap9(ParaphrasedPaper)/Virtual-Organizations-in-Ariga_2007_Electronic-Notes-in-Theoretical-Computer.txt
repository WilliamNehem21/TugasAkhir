Arigatoni is a lightweight overlay network designed to implement the global computing paradigm over the internet. Communication within the overlay is facilitated by a simple resource discovery protocol (RDP), through which basic global computer units (FLCs) can interact by registering with a brokering service and then mutually offering and requesting services.

The main components of the model are colonies and individuals. A colony is a virtual organization consisting of a single leader and a set of individuals, which may be either global computers or sub-colonies. A formal definition of a colony is provided using a simple BNF syntax. The virtual intermittence protocol (VIP) is formalized in terms of a labeled transition system, representing the first attempt to capture the behavior of an intermittence protocol using formal methods and labeled transition semantics. This approach relies on a robust mathematical foundation, including language and concurrency theory, enabling formal and mechanical proof of protocols related to overlay networks.

Following data processing, the results are to be analyzed using a Virtual Reality Center (VRC) in Houston, USA, by a specialist team, and the resulting recommendations for the next data collection campaign are to be sent to John. The scenario is intended to proceed as described.

A sketch of the proof demonstrates that the red parts of the pseudocode for the GC related to setting and unsetting the variables globalmode/regmode correspond to the firing of the two rules, joingcu and leavegcu. Similarly, the red parts of the pseudocode for the GB concerning the set and unset of the variables globalmode/regmode lead to the firing of the two rules, joingcu and leavegcu. The last two rules of the transition systems, namely linkcol and unlinkcol, are encapsulated within the function calls update(colony,metadata).
