It is not surprising that there are multiple approaches to addressing the same issues, as these approaches are influenced by different goals and perspectives, leading to varied solutions and decisions. As such, it is essential to explore the connections between these models. This analysis can highlight both the similarities and differences among them, potentially demonstrating that seemingly unique features are either justified or unnecessary. Furthermore, these connections facilitate the transfer of properties, techniques, and structures between models, allowing for mutual enrichment. Additionally, formal comparisons can reveal weaknesses in certain models and suggest avenues for improvement.

Regarding sets, permutations are equivalent to automorphisms (since there is no structure to preserve), leading to the use of the notation for the permutation group. However, we continue to use the term "permutations" as it aligns with the prevalent usage in theoretical computer science and is the terminology employed in our primary sources (see [14, section 2.1] and the initial passages of [6, section 3]).
