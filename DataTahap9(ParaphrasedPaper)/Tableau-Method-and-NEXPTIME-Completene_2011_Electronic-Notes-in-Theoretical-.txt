To establish the nexptime-hardness of the satisfiability problem, we aim to demonstrate a reduction of a nexptime-complete tiling problem to it. Let k be a positive integer. We define a tile type t as a 4-tuple of colors t=(left(t), right(t), up(t), down(t)). The tiling problem under consideration is formulated as follows.
