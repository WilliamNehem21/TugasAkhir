The advancement of electronic communication technologies has facilitated the widespread access and sharing of information, leading to the proliferation of online piracy. Among various forms of media, textual information is predominantly used and plays a vital role in conveying speech and contributing to educational resources. Text-images are equally important and are still utilized in official transactions, although they are susceptible to intellectual property rights infringement. To address these issues, watermarking technology is employed.

However, text-image watermarking presents unique challenges compared to general images, as text-images have less redundancy for watermark embedding due to their clear contrast between the background and the typed text. The paper outlines various methods of text-image watermarking, including a word shifting method based on word classification, edge direction histogram-based watermark insertion, watermarking using discrete cosine transform (DCT), and watermarking based on singular value decomposition (SVD). Each method has its strengths and weaknesses in terms of imperceptibility and robustness against attacks such as compression, noise, and geometric transformations.

The proposed watermarking method discussed in the paper employs inverse wavelet transform (IWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) for embedding and extraction of the watermark image. The method aims to overcome the limitations of existing approaches by improving robustness against compression and noise, while acknowledging vulnerability to rotation attacks.

In summary, the paper provides an overview of existing text-image watermarking methods and presents a novel approach that integrates IWT and DCT to enhance robustness against compression and noise, but with limitations in addressing rotation attacks. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and lay the groundwork for addressing future challenges in text-image watermarking.
