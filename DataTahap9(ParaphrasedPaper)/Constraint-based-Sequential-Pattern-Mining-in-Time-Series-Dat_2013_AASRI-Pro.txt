The developed algorithm can be integrated into any existing query languages to enable the use of non-aggregate functions, thereby reducing the complexity of query processing and improving time efficiency. Sections III and IV provide a detailed description of the proposed algorithm along with a working example. The primary goal of this algorithm is to achieve a pattern shift by a length greater than the pattern itself, surpassing existing algorithms in this regard. The efficiency of the algorithm is evident from the pattern's own movements.

During the preprocessing phase, the algorithm calculates failure functions. In the event of a mismatch during the search process, the algorithm utilizes three attribute values from the input immediately following the aligned sliding pattern, known as look-ahead elements.
