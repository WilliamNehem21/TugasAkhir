We present a novel probabilistic modal logic called PPL, which builds upon previous work by allowing for arbitrary nesting of a path probabilistic operator. We establish the completeness of this logic and demonstrate that it offers greater expressive power compared to prior logics. By examining a probabilistic extension of CTL, we illustrate the necessity of this increased expressive power in certain applications.

In the 1990s, researchers investigated various probabilistic temporal logics that combined temporal reasoning with probabilities. A probabilistic extension of CTL was introduced in previous works, which also included results on the decidability of model checking. The definition provided here is a slight modification of the one presented in those earlier works.

The proof of soundness is relatively straightforward. To demonstrate completeness, we aim to show that any consistent formula has a model. In fact, the model we construct will have only finitely many worlds, and the number of worlds will be bounded by an exponential function in terms of the size of the formula. Before proceeding, we introduce some notation. From Definition 1.1, it is evident that every term is a linear sum of primitive terms. A term...
