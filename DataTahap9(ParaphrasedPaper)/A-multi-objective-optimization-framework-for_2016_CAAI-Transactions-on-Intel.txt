This academic paper introduces a multi-objective optimization framework for addressing ill-posed image inverse problems. These problems typically lack unique solutions and often involve conflicting or mixed-type objectives. The proposed framework leverages multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to simultaneously optimize conflicting objectives and achieve a set of trade-off solutions for image ill-posed problems. The study applies this framework to two case studies: sparse reconstruction and change detection in images. In the sparse reconstruction case study, the framework optimizes conflicting objectives related to measurement error and sparsity, aiming to balance the trade-off between enforcing sparsity and reducing measurement error. In the change detection case study, the framework designs conflicting objectives to balance robustness to noise and preservation of image details. The experimental results from both case studies confirm the effectiveness of the multi-objective optimization framework for addressing ill-posed inverse problems in image processing.

Hadamard initially defined ill-posed problems as those lacking unique solutions, and proposed the criteria for well-posed mathematical problems. This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization framework to solve ill-posed inverse problems in image processing, using sparse reconstruction and change detection as case studies. The sparse reconstruction case study focuses on optimizing conflicting objective functions related to measurement error and sparsity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The study also addresses change detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images by designing conflicting objectives related to robustness to noise and preservation of image details. Additionally, the paper outlines the use of evolutionary algorithms, specifically the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), for multi-objective optimization, as well as the sparse unmixing technique for hyperspectral data. Furthermore, the paper delves into methods for dealing with speckle noise in change detection, including speckle noise transformation and multilevel representation. The work concludes by presenting quantitative analysis results and discussing the funding support for the research.
