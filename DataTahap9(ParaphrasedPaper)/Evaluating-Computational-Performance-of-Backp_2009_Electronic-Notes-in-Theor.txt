The paper presents the implementation of the backpropagation learning neural network, a popular data mining tool, on graphics hardware. The evaluation of the prototype implementation shows the potential for accelerating backpropagation learning tasks using recent graphics hardware, which is equipped with vector processing units and high memory bandwidth. The increasing volume of data being generated daily has led to a growing need for efficient computer technologies for knowledge discovery in databases, such as data mining. Given the rapid expansion of databases, there is a demand for greater computing power for future data mining efforts.

The paper also discusses the potential of volunteer computing, demonstrated by the SETI@home project, in achieving large-scale data mining using idle computing resources on the internet. Additionally, it highlights the impressive computational power of modern game consoles, suggesting the possibility of utilizing their idle resources for volunteer computing and large-scale data mining tasks in the near future.

The main focus of the paper is on the implementation of backpropagation learning tasks using GPUs, which are capable of accelerating these tasks due to their ability to handle data-parallel computations. The paper outlines the backpropagation learning algorithm, the GPU implementation scheme, and provides experimental results to demonstrate the performance of the GPU implementation. It concludes by emphasizing the potential of the GPU implementation for large-scale backpropagation learning tasks and presents a future outlook for the research.
