Spatial data algorithms (SDA) are algorithms designed for processing location data, particularly geographic data, and are a fundamental component of geoinformatics, an interdisciplinary field that applies information technology to cartography and geosciences. Geoinformatics frequently involves the use of visual aids, such as maps and diagrams, resulting in students having a strong familiarity with visualization. Consequently, software visualization emerges as a natural instructional tool for teaching SDA and its applications to geoscientists.

While there has been limited recent research on the visualization of algorithms important for geoinformatics, a study focused on the Mavis algorithm visualization tool as a case example, highlighting a lack of recent progress in this field.

Common interaction methods provided by existing systems involve enabling users to view animations with varying input, with some systems allowing users to define the input freely. Additionally, these systems support the creation of new algorithm animations by implementing and visualizing custom algorithms. These interaction methods align with the viewing, changing, and constructing levels of the engagement taxonomy.

Tracing exercises, which involve tracking changes in data structures while stepping through algorithms, are widely used as a teaching method. In the context of visual algorithm simulation exercises, graphical learning environments incorporate visualizations to facilitate the tracing process, thereby alleviating the need for manual drawing of data structures. The Trakla2 learning environment employs visual algorithm simulation to deliver tracing exercises, automatically assessing solutions and providing feedback on the accuracy of the simulation.

Spatial data structures and algorithms primarily operate on geometric entities, such as points, lines, and polygons, which are stored as key values derived from their geometric properties. The spatial data element, therefore, comprises an ordered list of values (a tuple) representing a specific geometric entity, for instance, a polygon stored as an ordered list of its vertex coordinates.

A notable challenge with SDA exercises is the generation of spatial data for algorithm input. To effectively contribute to learning, generated data sets must be visually clear and appealing, with sufficient separation between geometric entities and minimal label overlap. Each exercise has specific constraints for the data, making it challenging to create a generic data source, often necessitating the use of dedicated data generation mechanisms for exercises, such as simple polygons.

Open tracing exercises involve exploratory tasks where the students are provided a goal, such as creating a specific geometric structure, and the means to achieve it. Here, students can interactively explore and modify structures, with correctness being assessed by comparing the final state with the expected outcome. The primary objective is to impart broader concepts rather than teaching specific algorithms.

An analysis of Trakla2 results between 2007 and 2008 revealed significant changes attributed to modifications in exercises offered during these periods. The removal of a challenging exercise in 2007 was followed by the addition of easier exercises in 2008. Despite these changes, the exam results remained consistent in both years.

Interviews conducted in spring 2008 with a diverse group of students highlighted the perceived benefits of the spatial exercises. Interviewees expressed that the visualizations provided by Trakla2 were valuable for learning algorithm details, albeit lectures were still deemed the most important learning method. Additionally, students emphasized the need for basic algorithm knowledge before attempting the exercises.

Notably, the learning outcomes demonstrate a strong and statistically significant correlation between Trakla2 exercises and exams in the spatial data algorithms course, surpassing the correlation in the basic data structures course. However, the small sample size on the SDA course could influence these results.

Interview feedback indicated a positive attitude towards the system, with participants expressing a preference for more exercises covering other algorithms discussed in the course. They also emphasized the enduring impact of interactive visualizations in the learning process compared to passive methods. Consequently, the interviewees advocated for exercises to complement lectures in a supporting role.

Overall, student opinions align with the perceived benefits from interactive visualizations, suggesting that such exercises engage them more effectively and contribute to longer-lasting knowledge retention.
