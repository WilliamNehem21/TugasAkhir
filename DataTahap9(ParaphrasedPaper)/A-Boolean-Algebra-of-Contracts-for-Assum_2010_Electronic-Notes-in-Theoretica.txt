The concept of contract-based design is crucial for effectively specifying programs in a modular and compositional manner. It is increasingly important in mainstream industrial computer-aided design tools for embedded system design. This paper presents a new approach for contract-based embedded system design, introducing a general-purpose algebra of assume/guarantee contracts. This algebra is based on two simple concepts: viewing assumptions or guarantees of a component as filters and defining filters as a boolean algebra, resulting in a structure of contracts that forms a heyting algebra.

The paper also proposes a component-based validation technique within a synchronous modeling framework, where components are represented by abstract views of their behaviors and processes are defined as sets of these behaviors. The article outlines a general algebra of processes and introduces contract-based validation techniques using logical devices to filter processes.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the application of the proposed model to synchronous signal language and outlines its potential for expressing safety and liveness properties. Additionally, it compares the proposed approach with similar frameworks and highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of the process-filters and contracts structure. It also emphasizes that contracts are not limited to expressing safety properties, but also encompass liveness properties, which is a distinctive feature compared to related frameworks.
