The research paper presents the development of a magnetic microsystem on a chip to showcase the enhanced performance of an integrated hall element. The limitations of the integrated hall element's performance have been addressed by incorporating a high-efficiency, integrated micro coil, which was optimized using multiphysics finite element tools. Extensive characterization of the integrated hall element has facilitated the creation of a comprehensive simulation model, applicable in both high-level system simulation and detailed circuit simulation. All findings were validated through measurements of the fabricated ASIC.

The paper explores potential sensor types for integrating magnetic field detection on a chip, including hall-effect sensors, hall elements near field micro coils, and large, integrated coils for AC field generation. The study specifically focuses on the hall element and near-field micro coil.

The temperature coefficient of the hall element sensitivity is deemed an important parameter, as it is nonlinear and heavily reliant on the manufacturing process. Moreover, sensitivity is affected by mechanical stress from the plastic package. Converting such an imprecise sensor element into a high-precision sensor system presents challenges, with the most promising approach being the calibration of sensor sensitivity using a near-field micro coil.

The primary function of the near-field micro coil is to produce a relatively strong reference magnetic field on board, suitable for either online or offline hall element sensitivity adjustment. Offline adjustment can be conducted during wafer sorting or final device testing by applying a reference current to the coil, measuring the hall element response, and trimming it to the desired value. While this method is straightforward, it does not account for temperature effects on sensitivity or variations in sensitivity due to package pressure.
