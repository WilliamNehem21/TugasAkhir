The fundamental characteristics and notable advantages of the intellectual creativity of university journal information resources provide a solid foundation for establishing a management system for these resources. In order to effectively manage university journal information resources, it is important to develop these resources in a rational manner, integrate them into scientific research and academic instruction, facilitate information dissemination, and focus on information transfer and expansion. Furthermore, fostering competitive ideas and reducing the insularity of journals while promoting information dissemination through network and diverse channels with an open and innovative mindset are crucial for this endeavor.

University journals have accumulated a wealth of scholarly information through long-term scientific research, teaching activities, and domestic and international academic exchanges. They encompass a wide variety of disciplines, carry rich knowledge content, and possess strong academic value. As a result, they directly reflect the state of development in university research and teaching. University journals are conducive to the dissemination, application, and generation of knowledge and serve as conduits for knowledge innovation. Teachers and researchers are not only consumers but also creators of knowledge, possessing nimble thinking, innovative spirit, and the ability to bridge theory and practice. The information environment within universities is characterized by intensive knowledge and information exchange, contributing to a fertile atmosphere for knowledge innovation.

University journals shoulder the responsibility of propagating innovative information and nurturing creative talents. They serve as primary drivers of knowledge innovation and are particularly sensitive and responsive to such developments. The scientific research conducted through university journals involves the creation and processing of scientific and technological information, continually stimulating research inspiration, fostering creative thinking, facilitating the exploration of new scientific principles, and guiding the trajectory of science and technology. University journals boast a cohort of high-level scholars and experts who contribute substantially to the ongoing innovation and development of the journals. Additionally, the knowledge economy provides an enabling environment for the evolution of university journals and knowledge innovation. The authoritative and comprehensive nature of university journal information furnishes robust support for educators and research personnel in consulting literature, assimilating knowledge, and continuously pursuing and innovating in knowledge-based pursuits.

The scientific management of information resources represents a complex and specialized system engineering endeavor. Information management personnel are required to possess not only a deep understanding of information but also a broad array of professional knowledge, heightened information consciousness, and professional ethics in order to effectively manage information resources. They must traverse the professional path of information, fortify information consciousness, hone information-related skills, and proactively develop and utilize information resources.

Information ability is a comprehensive competency encompassing the collection, processing, and dissemination of information, which forms the fundamental quality required of journal librarians. In the rapidly evolving landscape of contemporary science and technology, countless interdisciplinary fields and subjects have emerged, leading to a swift accumulation of literature materials, including diverse, complex, and comprehensive journal literature materials. Journal librarians contend with a wide array of professional users each with unique information needs, while the amalgamation and mutual infusion of teaching and scientific research further compound the diversity of these informational needs. Under such circumstances, possessing strong information management skills becomes paramount.

Firstly, the effective management of scholarly journals necessitates the implementation of flexible service approaches. By employing scientific library management methods for classification management, journal reference rooms can organize the multitude of university journals systematically, thus enabling teachers and students to swiftly and effectively locate the journals they require, thereby elevating the utilization rate of journal literature. Moreover, service models should exhibit greater adaptability in response to ongoing reforms in teaching and research, as well as evolving demands from teachers and students. For instance, combining services for all teachers and students with services tailored to key users, integrating information consultation services with proactive user education efforts, and fusing first-time and subsequent services can collectively enhance the convenience of accessing journal literature for teachers and students, thereby maximizing the development of journal resources.

Additionally, it is critical to conduct in-depth information research and deliver comprehensive intelligence services. As the proliferation of academic journals leads to a steep surge in literature, it becomes increasingly challenging for teaching and research staff to access the required documents and information. Thus, only through deep-level processing of documents and information, and the implementation of diverse services aimed at elucidating the contents of these documents, can the inert material be transformed into active information, thereby enhancing the utilization rate of journal data. This encompasses the provision of first-time literature and the latest information services, which involve maximizing the transformation of static knowledge into actionable information for all users, as well as promptly disseminating new arrivals of journal literature to serve teaching and research efforts. Additionally, offering second and third-time literature services, which focus on compiling high-quality, rapid responses to information needs, constitutes another crucial facet of effective scholarly journal management.

The information management consciousness of journal librarians primarily revolves around three key aspects. Firstly, they should possess a strong understanding of information systems and be driven by an insatiable thirst for information, assuming the role of organizers and builders in the literature information system. Secondly, they should appreciate the importance of information dissemination and utilization, leveraging online information dissemination as an effective means of serving teaching and research efforts. Thirdly, they should embrace an open and collaborative mindset, extending their purview to the broader university and social information systems, mining information resources, and ultimately fostering common development and sharing of information resources within a unified network.

Scientific management of information resources transcends mere information administration, and instead directly involves participating in the process of scientific research and becoming an integral component of university teaching and research. University journals, as a form of information carrier, possess professional, targeted, and extensive information, thus emphasizing not only literature management but also the provision of a myriad of services for educators and editors. Journal librarians are called upon to deliver the latest information, report on subject development trends in a timely manner, establish specialized subject databases, offer effective consultation services, and compile high-quality second and third-time literature to support editorial, teaching, and research activities.

The objective of scientific management of information resources is to promote the transfer and diffusion of knowledge and information while identifying and addressing demand. Through the systematic management of literature information, knowledge is liberated from stasis and activated, paving the way for the spatial and temporal spread of knowledge information with the aid of modern communication technology. This not only bolsters information security for educational institutions in cultivating skilled professionals but also facilitates vocational training and continuing education, ultimately enhancing the overall caliber of citizens. Additionally, cultural information can be transformed into implicit knowledge assets and then into productive forces, all through information consultation and the popularization and dissemination of information. Ultimately, these activities are instrumental in promoting the development of the social economy, thus constituting the central task of scientific management of information. This underscores the importance of embracing competitive ideologies, alleviating journal insularity, and promoting information dissemination through network and diverse channels with an open and innovative mindset.
