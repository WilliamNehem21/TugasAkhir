The utilization of virtual reality (VR) in education has become increasingly popular, yet its potential in language learning, particularly in teaching a less commonly studied language like Maltese, remains inadequately explored. Consequently, a comprehensive mixed-methods study was conducted to examine the efficacy of VR in language learning and to identify both the advantages and challenges of employing VR for teaching Maltese as a second language (ML2) with a focus on enhancing language skills. The qualitative aspect of the research involved a focus group, while the quantitative analysis utilized an online survey employing a Likert scale, with 25 Maltese instructors participating. The results indicated that younger participants were more inclined to believe in the substantial impact of VR on improving learning outcomes compared to older respondents. VR was found to effectively engage students in immersive environments and enrich the learning context with entertaining features. However, challenges related to costs, cumbersome headsets, and technical issues were also uncovered. While VR tools are not currently employed in teaching Maltese, this study explored their potential effectiveness in ML2 instruction and provided recommendations for their effective integration into language teaching. The findings provide quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of VR tools in education and their potential to facilitate ML2 learning, with most participants expressing a positive perception and emphasizing the importance of integrating VR technology into Maltese teaching practices to create more engaging and immersive learning experiences for ML2 learners.

Through simulating environments, VR affords an immersive learning experience, enabling students to engage with language learning in a realistic and interactive manner. This feature is particularly advantageous for kinesthetic learners, as it provides hands-on experiences that enhance language acquisition by allowing students to engage multiple senses, reinforcing their understanding and memory of new words and phrases. Moreover, VR offers an opportunity for students to practice and understand nonverbal communication in a simulated environment, building their confidence in real-life interactions and eliminating the fear of making mistakes when interacting with native speakers in a foreign country. In addition, VR enables an active learning experience that surpasses passive reading, as students interact and apply their language skills, leading to improved learning outcomes. Furthermore, the accessibility of VR technology allows learners to access language lessons from anywhere, overcoming geographic barriers and enabling professionals from remote locations to participate in lessons, fostering community and collaboration.

VR also provides a platform for students to engage in authentic language practice, interact with virtual native speakers, participate in realistic conversations, and navigate real-life scenarios, all of which help build confidence and fluency in the target language. Moreover, it creates opportunities for immersive and interactive language learning experiences outside the classroom, such as virtual field trips or cultural experiences, allowing students to explore and engage with the target language and culture in a more meaningful way. Additionally, VR offers a safe space for learners to interact with virtual characters and practice their speaking skills without fear of judgment and can bridge the gap between traditional and online classrooms, promoting social involvement and connectedness.

The study employed a mixed methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate the perspectives of 25 educators on the potential of using VR in ML2 classrooms. The educators exhibited varying degrees of VR experience and training, exposure to diverse VR language learning apps and tools, active engagement in professional development, practical experience with VR implementation, and exposure to international settings. Nonetheless, the lack of availability of VR resources and research in the context of the Maltese language highlights a potential gap that needs to be addressed to fully leverage the benefits of VR in Maltese language learning. Based on the findings, it is suggested that VR could emerge as one of the most effective techniques for teaching and learning Maltese in the future. Further research and efforts to expand VR resources and support in the ML2 context are recommended to harness the full potential of VR technology.
