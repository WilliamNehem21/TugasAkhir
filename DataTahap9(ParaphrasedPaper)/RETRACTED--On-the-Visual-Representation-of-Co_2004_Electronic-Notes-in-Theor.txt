Graphs are commonly used for conveying intuitive understandings and visual representations, rather than for providing rigorous proofs. Visual representations are typically employed in the context of discovery, rather than in that of justification, where empirical justifications are often relied upon instead of analytical justifications. Consequently, there are numerous errors associated with the use of graphs, one of which is the improper reliance on graphs to guide the logic in constructing proofs instead of on axioms. This suggests that the use of visual representations is a flaw within a formal system. R. Bardohl et al., Isabel Luengo, and Miller have argued that the issue lies not with graphs themselves, but with deficient semantics and syntax. Additionally, they have asserted that a reasoning system based on graphs can be developed with formal semantics, syntax, and rules of inference, and that it constitutes a sound system, meaning that no fallacies can be derived from it. Fallacies in graphs arise when incidental features of the graph are incorrectly interpreted as representing essential features. Therefore, the implementation of a system with clear syntax and semantics will help to eliminate fallacies. Furthermore, it is suggested that any row, column, or m-route within a graph may be erased, along with any section or semi-section of a row or column, and any cell that does not intersect with an m-route or both a row and column and is not on a section may also be erased. If an m-route is erased, any corresponding marking must also be erased.
