This academic paper addresses the challenge of balancing operational expressiveness, which influences the execution flow of a program, and declarative meaning in the context of logic programming. The paper presents a novel definition of correct answers and correct resultants for first-order logic, including both classical and intuitionistic logic, and demonstrates the easy incorporation of the concept of groundness within this framework. The authors assert that these definitions are broadly applicable to various logic systems with standard quantifier rules, such as linear logic or modal logic, and provide more intuitive, accurate, and cohesive theoretical foundations.

Additionally, the paper underscores the importance of addressing nondeterminism in abstract interpreters, a problem that has been extensively studied in the field of automatic deduction. It references the standard approach of utilizing unification to mitigate nondeterminism in the introduction of quantifiers and expresses the authors' intent to integrate unification into their framework without significant modifications. The authors are pursuing the development of an abstraction of proof skeletons using additional logical variables to enable automatic computation of semantics through unification.
