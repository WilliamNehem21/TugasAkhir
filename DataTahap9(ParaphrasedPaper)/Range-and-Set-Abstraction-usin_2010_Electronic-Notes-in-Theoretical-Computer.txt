The category of weakly-relational domains [15,19], and domains that more closely reflect the structure of real programs, such as symbolic decision trees that connect status flags and numerical variables, are the focus of this paper. The authors emphasize the importance of using mixed symbolic and numeric abstractions, and provide pseudo-code to illustrate this concept.

The paper proposes directly applying formulas in the analysis, similar to decision trees, without imposing a canonical representation, which helps circumvent the size issues associated with such data structures. Instead, the semantics of a block are expressed as a single propositional formula, encoding all relationships between registers and status flags at the bit-level granularity. Abstraction is then used to extract range invariants from the formula, allowing recovery of control flow. The paper also discusses imposing range information on entry to and exit from a block, in a manner similar to best transformers, but from a propositional perspective. The focus is on abstracting boolean formulas for range information, including developing techniques to refine range abstractions to partition ranges into sets based on discovered boundaries.

The paper argues that range abstraction alone cannot accurately model sets of indices and addresses, and instead proposes set abstraction. It outlines a method to compute over-approximations of sets to manage their size, and the ability to also compute under-approximations based on a given boolean function.

The paper also highlights the use of decision procedures within transfer functions for computing best transformers. It points out that existing work does not address the problem of computing range and set abstractions of bit-vector encodings.

The paper acknowledges the difficulty of control flow graph (CFG) reconstruction, citing research suggesting that industry standard disassemblers can misinterpret large portions of binary programs. It suggests the need for more robust disassembly techniques that take into account anti-reversing techniques, as obfuscation techniques are likely to remain challenging for analysis for some time.
