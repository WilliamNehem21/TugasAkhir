The literature review reveals that fuzzy filters have been widely utilized in various fields, but addressing the denoising of noisy texture images remains a significant challenge. Two primary types of noise, impulse (salt and pepper) noise and random (or Gaussian) noise, are commonly encountered. Impulse noise is characterized by its noise density, while random noise is described in terms of its mean and variance. In the case of impulse noise, a substantial portion of the original image remains unchanged, with only some corrupted samples exhibiting intense differences. On the other hand, random noise presents a more challenging problem. Therefore, effectively reducing random noise in images is deemed an essential task.

Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature to filter random noise. Although nonlinear filters such as the moving average filter excel in removing random noise, they are unable to effectively suppress impulse noise or preserve the sharp edges of an image. Consequently, fuzzy filters with membership functions based on moving average and median center have been considered for further processing.

In terms of performance evaluation, the Moving Average Enhancement Filter (MEF) achieved a classification rate of 93.27% on the Brodatz dataset and 68.50% on the STEX dataset. The Adaptive Moving Enhancement Filter (AMEF) achieved classification rates of 86.22% on the Brodatz dataset and 60.00% on the STEX dataset. The Spatially Dependent Enhancement Filter (SDEF) delivered classification rates of 89.42% and 61.00% on the Brodatz and STEX datasets, respectively.

For the MEF, a classification rate of 92.06% was obtained at m=3, and improvements in classification accuracy were observed with higher window sizes for highly noisy images. Similarly, for the SDEF, increased classification rates were attained for different noise levels at a window size of m=3. The AMEF also achieved higher classification accuracies at specific noise levels and window sizes.

Overall, the study demonstrated the potential of fuzzy filters with membership functions in effectively reducing random noise in images, while also highlighting the impact of window size and noise level on classification accuracy.
