Formal concept analysis is a technique used for analyzing data based on lattice theory. It involves starting with a set of formal objects, a set of formal attributes, and an incidence relation indicating the association between objects and attributes. By combining these components, a formal context is obtained, which allows for the computation of formal concepts. These concepts are seen as units with both a conceptual extent and a conceptual intent, a concept that can be traced back to the logic of Port Royal. The extent of a concept encompasses all the objects that share the attributes from its intent, while the intent contains all the attributes shared by the objects from its extent. The concepts are ordered according to the subconcept-superconcept relation.

In this work, we focus on a fuzzy variant of formal concept analysis where the incidence relation is substituted with a fuzzy relation to account for the vagueness of statements. The generalization of formal concept analysis to the fuzzy setting has proven to be beneficial for handling real-world data and has found applications in various fields such as social networks, managing incomplete and inconsistent data sets, non-metric factor analysis, and more.

The article presents new results that provide additional insights into the relationship between specific types of formulas and closure operators, as well as the computation of non-redundant formula sets. Additionally, the method is illustrated using a real-world data set.

Fuzzy theory has been effectively applied in both theoretical and practical contexts, and one of its significant milestones was the development of a fuzzy controller by Mamdani and Assilian. There are numerous applications of fuzzy theory, and extensive references can be found in the literature.

We introduce formulas and demonstrate their utility through an example in this section. Furthermore, we explore some fundamental properties of these formulas and develop two methods for eliminating redundancies. These techniques are crucial for effectively managing formulas. In practical applications, it is advantageous to associate verbal descriptions with the truth values of a residuated lattice to enhance user understanding.

We also discuss the computation of non-redundant bases and present algorithms for this purpose. These methods are essential as users often input redundant formulas, and having a set of non-redundant formulas facilitates convenient handling and modification.
