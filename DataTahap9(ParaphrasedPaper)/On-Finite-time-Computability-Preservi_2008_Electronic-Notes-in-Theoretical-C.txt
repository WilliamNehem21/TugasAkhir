In this type of implementation, the resulting infinite list is generated based on the input infinite list. Often, the entire output list is created using an infinite number of cons operations. However, it is also possible to generate the output list by applying a finite number of list operations, specifically tail and cons, to the input. Essentially, the output infinite list is generated by combining a finite list and a suffix of the input, both of which are derived from the input infinite list. In this scenario, it is feasible to generate the output infinite list within a finite amount of time, given that the input infinite list is provided.
