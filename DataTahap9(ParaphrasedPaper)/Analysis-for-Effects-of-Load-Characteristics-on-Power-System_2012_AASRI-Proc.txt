The load characteristics of a power system are subject to change over time and may impact the stability of system voltage. To investigate this phenomenon, the static zip load model is utilized to represent load characteristics, and the p-v curve method is employed to assess the system voltage stability under normal and contingency conditions, aiming to identify the maximum real power transfer margin. The study also examines the effects of various load compositions on the system voltage stability in a large power system, providing valuable insights for system planning and operation.

Voltage instability is often linked to gradual changes in network and load characteristics. Due to the diverse nature of power system loads, it is important to determine the composition of loads using the methods outlined by Grigsby (2007), Xu et al. (1997), and Ranade et al. (2001), who have demonstrated load characteristics from field tests.

This paper focuses on analyzing the impact of load characteristics on system voltage stability, categorizing load models into static and dynamic models. Specifically, the study employs different proportions of components within static zip load models to describe load characteristics and utilizes p-v curves to analyze system voltage stability and identify maximum real power transfer and bus reactive power margins in both normal and contingency scenarios.

The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of load characteristics on system voltage stability. By employing the p-v curve method, the study assesses the system's voltage stability under normal operation and during contingencies, aiming to determine the maximum real power transfer margin. Three distinct load characteristic models are evaluated, denoted as model 1 (high constant impedance proportion), model 2 (high constant current proportion), and model 3 (high constant power proportion). The findings indicate that under n-1 or n-2 contingencies, the transfer power margin decreases in the order of model 1, model 2, and model 3.
