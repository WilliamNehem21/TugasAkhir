The texture of an image or frame contains distinct visual patterns that can be described using texture features, which are independent of object color. For videos of flowers with significant color variations, texture features are crucial for describing the flower region. In this study, gray level co-occurrence matrix and local binary pattern are employed as texture features.

The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) provides statistical information about the texture of flowers. In this research, 14 different statistical values of GLCM are extracted from each flower region of interest (fROI) and represented as a feature vector.

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is utilized as a supervised dimensionality reduction method to enhance class separability and preserve within-class variance.

Support vector machine (SVM), a powerful tool for supervised learning, is employed for classifying linear and non-linear data by finding an optimal separating hyperplane between two classes.

The authors propose a flower video retrieval system using a deep learning approach, where similar videos to a given query video are retrieved using a multiclass support vector machine. Additionally, three different modalities—entire keyframe, segmented flower region of a keyframe, and the gradient of the flower region—are considered for feature extraction using a deep convolutional neural network.

In this study, videos containing different classes of flowers within the same duration are manually split into shots. The detection of video shot/class boundaries is proposed as an essential step to address this limitation.
