The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses lattice-ordered semigroups with the concept of apartness. In Section 3, supermetrics over this structure are defined, which represents the main original contribution of the paper. Section 4 explores the relationship between supermetrics and additive functions. Sections 5 and 6 present results related to complete lattice-ordered semigroups with apartness and their completions.

An important characteristic, denoted as (b2c), shares similarities with a property that characterizes finite-dimensional normed spaces. In this context, boundedness is determined by the lattice order. Moreover, more results can be obtained by working with an alo-semigroup satisfying (mc). By starting with an arbitrary alo-semigroup S and an increasing additive function f over S, and employing a standard completion procedure for metric spaces, an alo-semigroup S1 and a strictly supermetric can be constructed.

The paper introduces the concept of a supermetric over the underlying set of an alo-semigroup. The required properties for the distance function are expressed in terms of semigroup and lattice operations. Several results pertaining to these supermetrics are proven. Furthermore, the notion of a pseudo-supermetric over an alo-semigroup is defined, and the supermetrics are characterized as the strict, increasing additive functions from such a structure to the real numbers. Various completion notions of the structures with respect to the introduced supermetrics are investigated, demonstrating that each structure endowed with a strict, increasing additive function (corresponding to a unique supermetric) has a completion, and any two such completions are isomorphic.
