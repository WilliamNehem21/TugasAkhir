The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of relevant prior research. Section 3 details the methods and materials used, including dataset collection, the development of combined networks, and the evaluation metrics. Section 4 provides a comprehensive analysis of the results, along with relevant discussions. The conclusion of the paper is then presented in Section 5.

InceptionV3, which consists of 48 layers with skipped connections and is trained on a dataset of one million images spanning 1000 categories, is utilized to enhance computational resources. The inception module is iterated with max-pooling to reduce dimensionality.

The system's performance is assessed using metrics such as AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These evaluation metric parameters are mathematically defined, with correctly classified COVID-19 cases denoted as true positive (TP), accurately classified pneumonia or normal cases as true negative (TN), incorrectly classified as COVID-19 cases as false positive (FP), and incorrectly classified as pneumonia or normal cases as false negative (FN).

The InceptionV3-RNN network exhibits a highest training and validation accuracy of 99.98% and 99.90%, and a corresponding loss of 0.02 and 0.09 at epoch 100. Conversely, the lowest training and validation accuracy of 98.03% and 94.91%, along with a loss of 0.05 and 0.26 at epoch 100, are obtained for the InceptionV3-RNN network. Analysis of the loss curve indicates that the loss values of VGG19-RNN decrease more rapidly and approach zero faster than those of other networks.

The utilization of deep learning techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis has become crucial during the pandemic to address the limitations of medical resources. This study employs CNN with deep transfer learning and RNN to classify X-ray samples into three categories: pneumonia, COVID-19, and normal. Features are extracted using four popular CNN networks and applied by the RNN network to identify different classes. The VGG19-RNN network is found to be the most effective, achieving 99.9% accuracy, 99.9% AUC, 99.8% recall, and 99.8% F1-score in detecting COVID-19 cases. It is hoped that this approach will alleviate doctors' workload in testing for COVID-19.
