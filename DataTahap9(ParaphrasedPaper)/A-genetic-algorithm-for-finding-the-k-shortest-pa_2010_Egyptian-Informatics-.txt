The paper is centered around the concept of finding the most efficient path with the shortest possible bandwidth between two nodes in communication networks. It proposes the use of a genetic algorithm, which differs from traditional algorithms by not needing to compare every possibility, thus potentially saving time. The paper is structured into several sections: problem description and solution in Section 2, presentation of the genetic algorithm and its operators in Section 3, introduction of the proposed algorithm in Section 4, and the experimental results in Section 5.

The network is represented as g=(n, e), where n refers to the set of nodes and e denotes the set of communication links connecting the nodes. The set m includes the source to destination nodes, with n0 as the source. The genetic algorithm is described, outlining its five basic components: encoding method, initial population creation, objective function, and genetic operators (crossover and mutation).

In the context of a network g(n, e) with n nodes and e as the set of communication links, the paper considers the source node n0 and set of destination nodes u. Each chromosome is represented by a string of integers with length n, where the genes are the nodes between the source node n0 and destination node ui. The proposed genetic algorithm is applied to network topology examples, yielding results in fewer generations. This constitutes the first algorithm to use genetic algorithms for finding the k shortest paths from a single source node to multiple destination nodes.
