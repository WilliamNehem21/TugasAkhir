This article introduces a new method for discretely modeling gene regulatory networks using timed automata. This approach is original in its ability to represent discrete abstraction of gene expression with arbitrary granularity and to combine boolean logic with approximations of hill kinetics by introducing delays that change dynamically based on the current activity levels of regulating genes. The method is implemented in uppaal and is evaluated using benchmark models and a biological case study.

The primary focus of systems biology is the analysis of dynamics resulting from complex interaction networks. The foundational layer of these networks consists of genes and their interactions through transcriptional regulation, which are captured by gene regulatory networks (GRNs). These networks control gene expression dynamics on a relatively slow time-scale while determining functional modes of the cell.

The models presented are purely qualitative and discrete, as they abstract the aspect of time and the velocity of dynamics, leading to strong approximations. However, although the rates of individual processes in transcription are not known, they can be estimated synthetically to achieve behavior observed in vitro. Thus, it is important to enrich discrete models with the quantitative aspect of time by extending them with the concept of time.

The paper presents a general framework for abstracting continuous systems using timed automata, where an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of a dynamical system is rigorously transformed into a timed automaton that represents an over-approximation of continuous behavior. However, this approach is not directly applicable to GRNs, as they are modeled using higher nonlinear systems based on hill kinetics.

The article also discusses the challenges and irregularities in gene expression profiles that arise from non-deterministic generation of increase and decrease events, and provides an analysis of these issues along with extensions of the formalism that attempt to address the problem.

A comparison between boolean and Pade models is presented, demonstrating that the Pade model preserves the effect of time and protein concentration on concentration dynamics, while the boolean model provides untimed abstractions that may lead to unrealistic behaviors.

The paper further discusses constraints for various situations and proposes strategies to deal with delay uncertainty that allows both degradation and production. It introduces a tool, model-builder, to automate the process of translating models into the uppaal language, which takes an XML file describing the GRN as input and generates a uppaal timed automaton representing the GRN timed model as output.

The article also discusses the performance benchmarks for the uppaal reachability analysis and indicates that increasing the resolution of discrete levels leads to more precise results, but also presents technical difficulties in delineating proper values for time delays. Future work is outlined, including the development of a method to automate the setting of delay values with respect to rates in the Pade model, and the exploration of the use of the inverse problems method to determine constraints on delays compatible with time-series measurements on microarrays. The theoretical study of the relation of timed automata to the approximated ODE model is also proposed as a direction for future research.
