The refinement of the class diagram can be accomplished through the addition of object constraints to the classes. These constraints encompass invariants for the classes and their attributes, as well as pre- and postconditions for their operations. Additionally, it is feasible to depict the multiplicity adornments at the association ends as constraints. These constraints can be expressed formally using the Object Constraint Language (OCL). For instance, a postcondition for the server's operation "getfreeip()" might be represented as follows: Constraints are considered true if there are no inconsistencies, otherwise, the model is deemed inconsistent or incomplete. The evaluation of constraints may be contingent on the values of variables, such as attributes. If the logical expression is found to be false for every possible variable assignment, it is considered contradictory and highlights a critical issue.
