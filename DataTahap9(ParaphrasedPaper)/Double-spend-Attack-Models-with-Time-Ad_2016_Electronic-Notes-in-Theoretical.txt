This academic paper discusses the influence of time on the feasibility of double-spend attacks in the Bitcoin network, emphasizing the significance of time advantage for attackers. The paper introduces new attack models that consider time advantage and compares them with existing hashrate-based attack models. The authors demonstrate that time advantage can have a non-negligible impact on the success of double-spend attacks and assert that their models support previous claims in the literature on accurately modeling and detecting such attacks in the Bitcoin network.

The paper presents two novel double-spend attack models for Bitcoin, taking into account the advantage an attacker may have in terms of time. The first model extends an existing attack model by introducing a parameter to denote the time advantage assigned to the attacker. The second model, based solely on time considerations, assesses the times at which honest and attacker nodes last mined a block and their relative progress in terms of the length of chains already mined.

The organization of the paper includes a technical overview of the Bitcoin network, an explanation of double-spend attacks, an overview of existing double-spend attack models, the introduction of the new attack models, experimental results, and concluding remarks with suggestions for future work.

The paper explains the nature of Bitcoin accounts, the representation of balances, the role of miners in processing transactions, and the use of hash-pointers in the blockchain. Moreover, it discusses the need to prevent double spending in the Bitcoin network and the mechanisms employed to ensure the integrity of the blockchain structure.

The paper paves the way for further research by proposing formal verification of the newly introduced attack models and exploring their effectiveness in comparison with other types of attacks in the Bitcoin network.
