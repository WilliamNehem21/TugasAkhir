This study examines the use of a simplified set of Arabic phonemes in an Arabic speech recognition system applied to the Holy Quran. The research utilized the CMU Sphinx 4 to train and assess a language model for the Hafs narration of the Holy Quran. Instead of the commonly used Romanized phonemes, a simplified list of Arabic phonemes was employed to streamline the language model generation process. The experiments yielded a very low word error rate (WER) of 1.5% when all available audio data was used for training and testing. However, when 90% and 80% of the training data was used, the WER increased significantly to 50.0% and 55.7% respectively.

The paper evaluates the performance of the CMU Sphinx-trained language models using simplified Arabic diacritic letters as phonemes. The subsequent sections of the paper discuss the application of Arabic speech recognition systems to the Holy Quran, the detailed experimental setup, the results of various experiments, and the conclusions and future research directions. 

The study highlights that while speech recognition systems offer a more natural interaction method, the application of automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques to the Arabic language is still at an early stage. It also identifies challenges such as disfluencies, variations in speech pace, and elongations in the context of the Holy Quran, which present obstacles to accurate recognition.

The research demonstrates the potential of achieving promising results by simplifying Arabic phonemes using diacritic letters, with WER values consistently below 2%. It emphasizes the significance of evaluating language models on unseen data and suggests that conducting experiments with varying percentages of unseen audio files can provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance.

Overall, the study posits that simplifying Arabic phonemes using diacritic letters has the potential to achieve high word recognition accuracy. However, it underscores the need to further assess language models on unseen data to ensure their robustness and reliability.
