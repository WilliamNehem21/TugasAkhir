LR parsing is an important tool for language designers, providing a parsing algorithm that operates efficiently for a wide range of context-free grammars. It has been extensively studied and is commonly taught in courses on compiler construction. Despite advancements in parsing tools, such as modularization of parsing actions and integration of parsing and scanning specifications, the original grammar in parser specifications remains unchanged, making maintenance of large grammars a laborious task. Surprisingly, none of the parser generators currently offer a feature for introducing abstractions over grammar rules, which could simplify grammar maintenance.

One approach to addressing this issue is to introduce parameterized LR parsing, which involves using abstractions over grammar rules similar to functions, allowing for the invocation of these abstractions with specific parameters. This approach presents challenges regarding the restriction of actual parameters to maintain the power of context-free grammars.

Before delving into the theory of parameterized LR parsing, the concept of macro grammars and languages is introduced, followed by the basic definitions for parameterized LR parsing. The parsing algorithm is then defined, and attribute evaluation and a type system for parameterized nonterminals are discussed. The implementation of parameterized LR parsing is also described, expanding upon the traditional LR parsing approach.

Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing parsing methodologies, such as parser combinators and the SDF formalism, and introduces the concept of W-grammars, a parameterized grammar formalism aimed at describing context-sensitive aspects of programming languages.

The paper also presents a running example of a restricted macro grammar for a fragment of JavaScript expressions and discusses the state representation in parameterized LR parsing, which differs from traditional LR parsing.

In summary, the paper explores the concept of parameterized LR parsing as a means of addressing the challenges associated with grammar maintenance in large context-free grammars, offering a more flexible and powerful approach to parsing.
