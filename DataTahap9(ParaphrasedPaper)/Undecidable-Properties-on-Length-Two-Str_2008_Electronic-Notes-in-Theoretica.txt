This academic paper investigates length-preserving string rewriting systems, which are string rewriting systems consisting of length-two rules. The paper establishes that properties such as confluence, termination, left-most termination, and right-most termination are undecidable for length-two string rewriting systems. These findings extend to the class of linear term rewriting systems with depth-two variables allowed on both sides of the rules.

The undecidability of confluence and termination is a well-known property for both term rewriting systems (TRSs) and string rewriting systems (SRSs). Consequently, various decidable classes have been the subject of study. Confluence is known to be decidable for terminating TRSs and ground TRSs. Moreover, this result has been extended to linear shallow TRSs and shallow right-linear TRSs. Decidable classes for the termination property have also been explored and extended to ground TRSs, right-ground TRSs, TRSs composed of right-ground rules, collapsing rules, shallow right-linear rules, and the associated class of shallow left-linear TRSs.

The paper also discusses the concept of length-preserving SRSS, in which the left-hand side and the right-hand side of each rule have equal lengths. It shows that since there is a finite number of rules and a finite number of different symbols appearing in the rules, the decidability of certain properties for length-preserving SRSS can be readily established.

In sum, the paper demonstrates that confluence, termination, left-most termination, and right-most termination are undecidable properties for length-two SRSS, and these properties also extend to linear TRSs with depth-two variables allowed on both sides of the rules. However, further inquiries regarding (un)decidability results for classes of SRSS obtained by constraining the number of rules still remain open.
