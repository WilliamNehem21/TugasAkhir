Static analysis is a method for verifying program behavior without the need for actual program execution. This approach is valuable for identifying design errors in programs before they are implemented. Detecting errors early in the development process has been shown to significantly reduce the cost of fixing such errors. However, current static analysis techniques are sensitive to the size of the program being analyzed, particularly in terms of the use of concurrency constructs and the number of asynchronous processes. One major technical challenge hindering the transition of static analysis from research to practice is the state space explosion problem, which arises when reachability analysis exhaustively explores all reachable state space to detect concurrency errors. Although various techniques have been proposed to address this issue, such as state space reductions and abstraction, the state explosion problem remains a significant obstacle.

To mitigate the state explosion problem, one proposed solution involves the transition from discrete event system models, which are susceptible to state explosion due to the exhaustive exploration of reachable state space, to continuous system models described with analytic expressions. This approach allows for the analysis of analytic solutions instead of counting states, providing a potential solution to the state explosion problem.

Petri nets have been suggested as a promising approach to bridge the gap between discrete event systems and continuous systems. They offer advantages over finite automata, particularly in addressing model complexity and process concurrency. Additionally, a continuous system can be approximated by a Petri net, enabling the representation of continuous variable systems as discrete event models.

The paper also discusses the use of Petri nets for modeling the specifications of a system architecture, specifically focusing on critical race scenarios and the condition where customers must pay for gas before receiving it. To support the representation of a whole system composed of components and connectors, the concept of modules is introduced into the Petri-net model, allowing for the mapping of components and connectors into small Petri-net modules. This mapping involves the conversion of CSP operators into Petri-net transition structures, with defined conversion rules to cover common CSP operations and preserve architectural properties, such as deadlock.

Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of place/transition chains and cycles within Petri nets, and discusses the discrete nature of the Petri net obtained in the previous section, where the number of marks in places are integers. The states of each process cycle are shown to take values from [0, 1], and the change rate of state measures is calculated based on the movement of markings into and out of places. The paper also mentions further study into the efficiency of the method applied to systems involving a large number of behaviorally similar processes, such as those found in the gas station example, and how the model complements existing discrete event-based models used to handle such processes.
