In the previous section, it was demonstrated that if a partial metric induces the Scott topology on the underlying domain, then the domain possesses a measurement that induces the Scott topology universally. This finding suggests that measurements play a crucial role in establishing a concept of distance on domains. To begin, we will initiate with a conventional construction.
