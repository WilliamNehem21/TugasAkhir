Currently, many countries are working towards providing electricity to their industries and residents. With the increasing demand for electricity and rising prices of fossil fuels, along with resistance to nuclear electricity production in some regions, one potential solution to address these challenges is to boost electricity generation through renewable resources. Hydroelectric power plants, in particular, offer several advantages, as they do not cause air pollution, damage the environment through mining, or require transportation of fuels and raw materials. They are also waste-free, independent of raw material imports, and considered highly safe. Additionally, their flexible electricity production and energy storage capabilities enhance the efficiency and reliability of power networks.

However, the geographical conditions in the Czech Republic (CR) are not ideal for constructing hydroelectric facilities, as the country's rivers lack the necessary water flow and heads. As a result, the share of hydroelectric power stations in the total electricity production in the CR remains low. Similarly, wind energy also presents limited potential as an alternative energy source. While hydro power will continue to serve as an additional energy source, it may be advantageous to utilize more small-scale hydropower stations, as they can make use of local resources in addition to standard ones. Furthermore, compared to wind power, hydroelectric power is more reliable and cost-effective.

The proliferation of small-scale hydroelectric power plants in the CR has been facilitated by subsidies for purchasing renewable resources, grants, and low-interest loans. These plants typically have a maximum installed capacity of 10 MW. To further increase the output of hydroelectric power plants, modernizing existing technology and constructing new plants in untapped areas could be pursued, although many potential locations have low heads, which could impact the return on investments.

While numerous water treatment facilities in the CR utilize small-scale hydroelectric power plants, the volume of electricity they produce is not publicly available, leading to a lack of integrated statistics regarding the gigawatt-hours (GWh) generated by these plants. Based on accessible data, the electricity production from a single small-scale hydroelectric power station ranges from more than 90 MWh/year for installations in water reservoirs to up to 2.5 GWh for those installed in water treatment plants, with multiple plants often incorporated into a single water supply structure.

The production of electricity from renewable sources is actively encouraged in the CR, with laws stipulating that power distributors must connect every renewable energy source to the network. The price of electricity generated from renewable sources is determined by the energy regulatory office, and a minimal purchase price is legally guaranteed for 15 years in advance, with the potential for annual adjustments up to 5%.
