Furthermore, all entities in newly generated triggers and replicators that are not yet connected are standardized. When such an entity is required, each inherent within the relevant process term is incremented by one and then set to zero. The opposite operation occurs when the connection rule is enforced. These operations are referred to as "shift" and "unshift."
