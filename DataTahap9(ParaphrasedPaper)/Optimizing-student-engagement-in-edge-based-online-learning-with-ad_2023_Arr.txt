The internet of things (IoT) is causing numerous changes in everyday life, with its pervasive nature setting it apart from previous advancements and driving the development of intelligent and autonomous solutions. One significant strategic technology trend is the development of IoT, which involves using multiple sensors to connect physical and virtual machines. Sensors are embedded in various objects to facilitate this shift in basic assumptions. Furthermore, embedded sensors use machine-to-machine (M2M) communication to connect billions of devices to the internet. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have proven to be very effective for face detection (FD) tasks within computer vision (CV). 

Edge computing (EC) technology integrates network, computer systems, storage spaces, and application capabilities on stand-alone platforms and provides fast network service responses. It fulfills industry standards for real-time business, application intelligence, security, and privacy. The edge computer is situated between the physical subject and industrial connection, or even above the physical subject. Data processing and analysis with EC is faster than with cloud computing. 

The proposed paper introduces a training and processing pipeline in which the Embedded Biometric System as a Service (EBSAAS) model is initially trained on a face dataset within the edge device. Once trained, the system can capture images, perform face recognition, and analyze attentiveness by sending images to the edge server for processing. This pipeline enables real-time analysis of student attentiveness. 

The paper emphasizes the integration of an edge server in the EBSAAS architecture, which is responsible for processing attentiveness analysis and training the recognition classifier. By offloading these tasks to the edge server, the EBSAAS can leverage its computational capabilities and potentially enhance processing speed. 

The focus of face detection is to identify and locate faces within an image or video frame. This process primarily detects the overall face region rather than specific facial features, although certain facial features can be used as cues for locating and validating the presence of a face. Common facial features that can be applied include the eyes, nose, mouth, and face contour. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the dlib library to retrieve facial features. 

In the face detection process, many candidate windows are obtained once the test sample passes through the network's initial layer. A high number of candidate windows is filtered out, and the prediction outcomes are further improved using non-maximum suppression (NMS) and bounding box (BB) regression. 

To detect eye and mouth states, the paper divided the video dataset into images and used the dlib library to label basic facial features. This detection process involves deciding the aspect ratio of the eyes and mouth to detect signs of fatigue. 

The proposed model is shown to predict attentiveness more quickly and effectively than existing models, thereby enhancing learning outcomes and the efficiency of online learning (OL). The model determines if a student is fatigued or focused with a minimal speed of 47.23, surpassing the state-of-the-art techniques. This signifies a significant improvement in contemporary education and provides teachers with a potent tool to enhance educational approaches and ensure that students reach their full potential.

While current face detection algorithms have achieved high accuracy, there is still room for improvement, particularly in handling challenging scenarios such as occlusions, extreme poses, variations in lighting conditions, and diverse demographics.
