When a mobile node wishes to join a specific multicast group, it generates a route query packet and sends it to nearby nodes. If the mobile node already knows the route to the multicast group, it may choose not to prepare and broadcast the route query packet. However, in cases where the mobile node is unaware of the multicast group and its route, it is crucial to create the route query packet with the join flag set to 1 and the multicast group address before forwarding it to neighboring nodes. The multicast AODV protocol provides a faster adaptation to complex network constraints, limited processing capabilities, and minimal network utilization. Additionally, the protocol forms duplex direction distributed multicast trees, which facilitate connections between multicast senders and receivers. The multicast AODV routing protocol defines four messages.
