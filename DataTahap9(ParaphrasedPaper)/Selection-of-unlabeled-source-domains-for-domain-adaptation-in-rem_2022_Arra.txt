Supervised domain adaptation techniques can utilize labeled samples from both the source and target domains, with the number of labeled samples in the target domain being significantly lower than those in the source domain. Unsupervised domain adaptation methods operate under the assumption that two unlabeled domains need to be aligned. When there is prior knowledge available in the source domain but not in the target domain, and the joint distributions of the two domains are different but sufficiently related to allow the source domain information to assist in solving prediction problems in the target domain, this situation can be considered a semi-supervised domain adaptation problem.

The paper proposes a methodology involving computing various similarity metrics to identify suitable source-target domain combinations, ensemble pruning to select robust similarity metrics, implementing a voting strategy to choose optimal source-target domain combinations, and learning a regression model based on these combinations.

The study highlights that unadapted models, despite exhibiting significant deviations, still achieve acceptable accuracy levels when applied to a new domain. This can be attributed to the comprehensive set of spectral-spatial features that impose invariance in the models. However, aligning the source and target domains leads to a notable decrease in mean absolute error (MAE). The proposed additional mechanisms for selecting a suitable source domain for an aligned target domain result in an average increase of 4.7 and 4.9 percentage points in built-up density and height accuracy, respectively. It is expected that the MAEs are significantly lower when learning and applying a model within a single domain. Therefore, the difference in accuracy compared to the domain adaptation settings can be seen as an error cost associated with acquiring training data for the target domain.

The study encourages further utilization of the proposed approach for remote sensing data analysis. The modular nature of the method raises interest in adapting it for multiple image modalities, such as integrating SAR measurements with the corresponding feature set. Additionally, the goal is to incorporate this domain adaptation approach, which is independent of the learning algorithm, within supervised multitask ensemble learning models.
