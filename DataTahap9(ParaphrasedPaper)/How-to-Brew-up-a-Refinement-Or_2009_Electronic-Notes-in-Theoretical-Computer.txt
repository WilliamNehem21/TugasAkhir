The confusion arises from the colloquial use of language: while h is not physically visible at the earlier point, the attacker is not constrained to make real-time deductions. Instead, the attacker can gather a multitude of observations and analyze them at their own pace. The crucial point is that they can infer the value of h at the indicated point, even if this inference occurs later on.
