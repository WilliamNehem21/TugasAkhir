The notation used in this paper allows for easier definition of word concatenation and behaves more naturally, making it simpler to develop the theory. In contrast, Asarin, Caspi, and Maler use a different notation. It is important to note that this paper permits real-valued bounds on intervals, whereas existing literature considers integer-valued bounds on intervals. The inclusion of real-valued bounds enhances the expressiveness and is crucial for defining a useful notion of derivative for timed regular expressions. There are two open questions that require further exploration. First, can Theorem 6.2 be expanded to accommodate real-bounded intervals? Initial investigations suggest this is possible, but the specific details need to be elucidated. Second, can Theorem 6.2 be extended to timed regular expressions with other types of integer-bounded intervals? Although a variation of the proof can be utilized to obtain a version of the theorem for expressions with specific interval characteristics, the potential extension to mixtures of interval types is uncertain. Additionally, it is yet to be determined whether the approach is applicable to the extended forms of timed regular expressions described in Section 3 - sufficing to capture the complete range of languages recognized by Alur and Dill's timed automata. Notably, there has been significant study on the bisimulation of timed processes within the context of timed process algebras, and it would be intriguing to connect that work to the content presented in this paper. One distinction to recognize is that timed processes are not conventionally regarded as distributive, unlike the concepts covered here.
