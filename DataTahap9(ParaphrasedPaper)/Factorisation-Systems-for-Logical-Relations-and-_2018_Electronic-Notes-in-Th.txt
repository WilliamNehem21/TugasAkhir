The primary characteristic of our factorization construction lies in its modularity. Firstly, factorization occurs at a purely structural level, without reliance on any semantic properties such as the monad laws. Secondly, factorization is conducted on a pay-as-you-go basis, enabling the factorization of any additional data preserved by the morphism of interest. To elaborate, we initially provide a detailed description of the structures that we intend to factorize.

Up to this point, we have been operating within an arbitrary factorization system (e, m). When this system is an epi-mono factorization system, meaning it consists of a pair (e, m) in which m is composed of monos, then Theorem 2.5 holds under the milder assumption that t is a monad, while s only needs to be a monad structure. To prove this, instead of relying on the diagonal fill-in property, we utilize the cancellation property of monos.
