We propose a novel approach to quantum computing known as ancilla-driven quantum computation (ADQC), which integrates elements of both the quantum circuit and the one-way model to address challenges associated with constructing large-scale quantum computers. Instead of directly manipulating individual qubits to perform universal quantum logic operations or measurements, ADQC employs a fixed two-qubit interaction to link the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit. By measuring the ancilla, the resulting back-action on the system achieves the desired logical operations.

The underlying mathematical model is based on a new entanglement resource called twisted graph states, generated from non-commuting operators. This leads to a remarkably powerful structure for parallel computation compared to graph states obtained from commuting generators. The ADQC model is formalized within an algebraic framework similar to the measurement calculus. Additionally, we introduce the concept of causal flow for twisted graph states, based on the stabilizer formalism, to characterize determinism.

This paper focuses on the introduction of a new multipartite entanglement resource. While it has been shown recently that a limited class of multipartite entangled states is useful for universal deterministic measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), a complete characterization of such states remains an open problem, which this paper aims to address.

We present a formal operational semantics for ADQC patterns as a probabilistic labeled transition system. In addition to quantum states, a classical state is necessary to record the outcomes of successive measurements in a pattern. We define the computation state space as the set of active qubits and the set of measured qubits.

In contrast to the traditional convention of renormalizing states after measurement, we leave the states unnormalized. This choice simplifies the overall treatment and allows the probability of reaching a given state to be inferred from its norm.

The denotational semantics of ADQC patterns is then presented. Each pattern realizes a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map, and if a pattern is strongly deterministic, it also realizes a unitary embedding. The denotational semantics of a pattern is found to be a CPTP-map and is compositional.

One major difference between ancilla-driven quantum computation and MBQC is the interaction command used. In ADQC, the interaction command is distinct from that used in MBQC, which necessitates giving up the simple operator that generates the open graph state. However, despite the non-commutativity of the interaction command, we demonstrate that similar dynamic properties can be obtained. We define the twisted graph state, which serves as the underlying geometry of an ancilla-driven pattern, and show how the dependency structure can be constructed directly from this geometry.

The completion of the pattern definition involves determining the angles used to measure ancilla qubits and deciding on the dependent corrections. Conversely, each ancilla-driven pattern has a unique underlying open twisted graph state, obtained by forgetting measurements and corrections, with the edge colors dictated by a partial order of the interaction commands.

ADQC offers significant advantages over MBQC for certain physical implementations, by isolating the system memory from measurement and state preparation, simplifying the physical layout and control of the quantum computer. Candidate systems for implementing ADQC include those based on the nuclear spin of a single dopant atom in isotopically pure silicon, which serves as a memory qubit, and the electron spin, which acts as an ancilla qubit.

In conclusion, ancilla-driven quantum computation presents a new approach to performing universal quantum computing and introduces a new set of universal quantum computational resources, the twisted graph state, based upon a non-commuting generating interaction. Further study of ADQC and its generalizations could provide additional insights and potentially lead to improved parallelism in quantum computation.
