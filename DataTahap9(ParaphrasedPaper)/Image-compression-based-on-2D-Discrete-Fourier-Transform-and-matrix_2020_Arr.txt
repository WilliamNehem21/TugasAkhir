Our review of the existing literature did not yield any findings related to image compression using only the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This is due to the fact that the DFT produces two sets of coefficients (real and imaginary), which, if both sets are retained for accurate image reconstruction, preclude achieving high compression ratios. However, our implementation of the DFT, as detailed in this paper, has resulted in images of satisfactory visual quality and low compression complexity. We conducted a comparative analysis between compression ratios achieved using the DFT alone and those achieved by combining the DFT with the matrix minimization algorithm.

This study introduces a new method for compressing grayscale, color, and structured light images used in 3D reconstruction. The approach relies on the DFT and the matrix minimization algorithm. The paper emphasizes the key aspects of this method and their significance in producing high-quality images with high compression ratios.
