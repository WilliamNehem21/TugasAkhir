While numerous tools exist for creating, encrypting, and extracting data, there are limited options for ensuring data integrity, authentication, and provenance. For example, a proposed solution involves creating a certificate containing a SHA-256 hash value of the submitted media file, user details, and a timestamp, which is then verified by a digital certificate issued by a leading certification authority.

However, a challenge arises as the original file and the certification are separate entities and could potentially become detached during distribution or circulation of the file. Although enclosing the file and its certification within an outer envelope does not guarantee that they will remain together, inserting the certification into the file is considered a reliable method and is utilized by prominent companies such as Microsoft and Adobe for digitally signing office and PDF documents.

Furthermore, while the adoption of SHA-2 offered improved security and faster performance, it was initially slow to be adopted due to reasons such as lack of support on older systems, the absence of perceived urgency as no collisions had yet been found in SHA-1, and the slower processing speed of SHA-256 compared to SHA-1.

The concept of a digital authentication scheme was initially proposed by Diffie and Hellman, who introduced a method for creating a shared secret over unsecured channels to enable the use of traditional symmetric cryptography electronically. Subsequently, the RSA public/private key algorithm, developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), became known as RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman). This algorithm, based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, facilitates asymmetric encryption and the creation of a shared secret for high-speed symmetrical encryption.

Digital certificates, issued by certification authorities, serve as electronic documents for verifying the owner of a public key and are crucial for secure internet connections based on transport layer security (TLS).

In addition, the paper discusses issues related to editing and inserting metadata in JPEG and PNG images, including the potential for restructuring compression information segments and the presence of thumbnail images within JPEG files.

The paper also provides insights into the allocation and use of application segments for metadata in JPEG files, along with the development of tools such as JPEGReader and PNGReader for viewing and modifying these files.

Furthermore, the paper outlines the significance of specific tags and segments within metadata, including the challenges related to the order of tags and the presence of unknown tags in metadata specifications.

Lastly, the paper details a content signing process and the use of tools for confirming the persistence of certain file properties across different operating systems and devices.

Additionally, the paper references a related work by F. Buccafurri, L. Fotia, and G. Lax on privacy-preserving analysis of social network likes, presented at the Eleventh Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security, and Trust (PST) in 2013.
