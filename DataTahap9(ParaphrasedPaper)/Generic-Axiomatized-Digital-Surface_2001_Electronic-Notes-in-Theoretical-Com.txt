This paper focuses on digital spaces representing subsets of the Euclidean plane and other surfaces and provides an axiomatic definition for a broad class of such spaces, which encompasses spaces corresponding to various adjacency relations used in the literature on 2D digital topology. These spaces, satisfying our axiomatic definition, are termed as GADs. A significant portion of the mathematical framework in defining GADs has been previously utilized by the third author. 

As an initial step in the development of digital topology for these spaces, the paper establishes the intersection number of two paths on a GAD and outlines a proof that this number remains unchanged under homotopic deformation of the paths. This generalizes definitions and theorems proposed by the first author and Malgouyres. Furthermore, a discrete definition of planar GADs, modeling subsets of the Euclidean plane, is provided, along with a Jordan curve theorem. Notably, the paper avoids using arguments based on polyhedral continuous analogs of digital spaces, relying solely on discrete arguments.

The paper introduces the concept of singular and nonsingular vertices in a GAD, where a vertex x is considered a singularity if the set of all loops containing x is not strongly connected. It is noted that the singularity of a vertex is dependent only on the underlying complex of the GAD.

The paper also highlights that even a strongly connected PGAD may have a singularity. For instance, the PGAD derived from the torus-like PGAD in a given example has a singularity at the vertices A, B, and C but is strongly connected.

Various results from the literature pertaining to specific digital spaces have been extended to GADs, such as a homotopy invariance theorem for intersection numbers of digital paths and a digital Jordan curve theorem. The paper suggests that many other results of digital topology could also be generalized to GADs, such as those concerning simple points and boundary tracking. However, the paper acknowledges the more challenging nature of developing a 3D version of this theory.
