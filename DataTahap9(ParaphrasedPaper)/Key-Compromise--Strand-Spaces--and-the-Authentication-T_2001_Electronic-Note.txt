Some cryptographic protocols are susceptible to replay attacks, a specific vulnerability that was thoroughly examined in the Burroughs-Abadi-Needham logic. More recent operational approaches to protocol analysis have not given much attention to this type of attack. This paper aims to address this gap in the field of strand space theory.

The main focus of this paper is to address the gap in the literature on strand space theory by introducing a method to specify the behavior of a key server in order to safeguard recent keys while potentially compromising older keys. In this context, we demonstrate that the Needham-Schroeder private key protocol is vulnerable to this model, whereas the Yahalom protocol is not. A key technical aspect of our approach is providing a definition of "recency," with our proposed definition being especially suitable due to the powerful ability of the strand space method to prove the recency of events using incoming and outgoing authentication tests [5,7].

In addition to filling the gap in the strand space literature, this paper also aims to showcase the effectiveness of authentication tests in providing simple and direct explanations of protocol correctness. We offer several examples to illustrate the typical usage patterns for these authentication tests, which, despite being stereotyped, require effective combination of several components.

The paper also discusses a potential attack where a penetrator may attempt to cryptanalyze a conversation to recover a key. In such a scenario, the penetrator could start a session by resending the same unit {|a, k|}kb, and subsequently returning {|1+ nb|}k, resulting in the compromise of key k. Here, the assumption that k is still secure should expire once it is no longer considered recent.

The paper introduces terms and subterms, where the set of messages that can be exchanged between principals constitutes the terms, and the elements within this set, derived from two distinct sets - t (texts such as nonces or names) and k (keys) - are generated through concatenation and encryption processes. Additionally, the concept of the height of a strand in a bundle is defined as the number of nodes on the strand that are in the bundle.

A penetrator, as depicted in the paper, is represented more explicitly than regular principals. The paper partitions penetrator strands based on the operations they exemplify, such as encrypting (e-strands), decrypting (d-strands), concatenating (c-strands), separating (s-strands), emitting known atomic texts or guesses (m-strands), and emitting keys (k-strands). The set of initially known keys that may be emitted in k-strands is referred to as kp.

The paper highlights a key compromise attack that is less obvious than the NSSK attack since there are no overt indications in the protocol definition. The root problem lies in the inability of principal B to verify the recency of the session key k, stemming from the protocol's reliance on an unsolicited test rather than an incoming or outgoing test.

The central idea proposed in the paper is that regular strands offer a means of measuring recency. Implementers are urged to ensure that a protocol run will time out long before cryptanalysis could possibly succeed, which typically amounts to a matter of hours for any usable cryptosystem. Consequently, a principal involved in a strand will be certain that an event is recent if it occurred after an earlier event on the same strand.
