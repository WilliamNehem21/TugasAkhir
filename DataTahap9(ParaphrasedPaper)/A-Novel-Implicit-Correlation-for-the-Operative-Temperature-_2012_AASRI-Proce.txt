The electric power output of commercial photovoltaic (PV) panels is significantly influenced by their operating temperature. Accurately predicting the operating temperature is crucial for evaluating the economic and energy performance of PV systems. In this study, the authors propose a new implicit correlation that considers standard weather variables and the operating characteristics of PV panels, including their proximity to the maximum power points. The correlation was developed using data from an experimental setup and analyzed using the least squares technique. To validate its reliability, the correlation was compared with existing common correlations using data from other sources. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the panel's operating regimen and its operating temperature, and the new correlation exhibits high quality in its predictions.

The operating temperature of the cell (Tc) is a critical parameter for determining the energy conversion efficiency of PV panels, as the panel's efficiency decreases with increasing temperature. Additionally, other physical parameters such as site latitude, weather conditions, panel orientation, air temperature, and wind speed also significantly impact the performance of PV modules.

Understanding the thermal behavior of the PV system is essential for accurately estimating the heat flux across it. The heat transfer between the PV panel and its surroundings is determined by a global heat transfer coefficient that accounts for radiative and convective heat exchange processes. Empirical correlations based on common geometries and standard weather variables have been developed to model the operating temperature of PV panels. These correlations can be explicit, directly providing Tc, or implicit, involving variables that depend on Tc and requiring an iterative calculation process. Many correlations include a reference state and corresponding values of relevant variables for calculation.

The authors conducted experiments using two different types of PV panels and measured the silicon temperature using thermocouples installed at the rear surface of the panels. Data were collected and analyzed to assess the operating characteristics and thermal performance of the panels.

The authors proposed a novel implicit correlation to determine the cell temperature based on standard weather variables and the working point of a PV panel. By assuming a linear relationship between irradiation, temperature, and the relative voltage at maximum power, they characterized the panel's operating regimen using the V/Vmpp(g, Tc) ratio. The correlation parameters were determined using a large database of monitored data from two different PV systems.

The parameters of the correlation were obtained using the least squares technique, and the performance of the new correlation was compared with widely used correlations available in the literature. The comparison showed that the new correlation significantly improved the mean absolute error compared to other common correlations, indicating its superior predictive performance.
