The paper discusses simulations and their relationship to Oplax transformations, as identified by Hermida. Section 4 delves into the main topic, introducing a new model structure on 2-categories. A simulation is then explained as a right homotopy. Readers not familiar with model categories may find it helpful to refer to the first two chapters of [source] to understand the terminology. Section 5 extends the framework to cubical sets and cubical 2-categories, while Section 6 presents concluding remarks.
