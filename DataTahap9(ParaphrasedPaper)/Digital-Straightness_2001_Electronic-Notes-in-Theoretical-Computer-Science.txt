The computer representation of lines and curves has been a significant area of research for nearly fifty years, with related work dating back even further. Despite this, earlier work on the theory of words, particularly on mechanical or Sturmian words, has gone unnoticed in the pattern recognition community. This paper examines the subject of digital straightness and its connections with other fields, as well as its role within the pattern recognition literature.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of alternative definitions of digital rays or digital straight lines and specifies digitized lines by distances between tangential lines. Section 3 reviews self-similarity studies in the context of pattern recognition, while Section 4 explores the concept in the context of the theory of words. Number-theoretical results are briefly listed in Section 5, and Section 6 presents a review of recognition algorithms for digital straight segments. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

First, we demonstrate that g(u) satisfies the chord property if u is a digital straight segment (Theorem 1). Let p and q be points of g(u). The line segment pq intersects grid lines x=n that lie between p and q. Therefore, the proof shows that the algorithm is an implementation of the dss property, covering the generation of straight lines with rational or irrational slopes.

Self-similarity studies have a long history in number theory and astronomy, while the theory of words is a more recent discipline containing many interesting results on self-similarity, often with a special focus on irrational straight rays. The section on self-similarity provides basic definitions and results, including a few proofs for illustration.

Digital rays, also known as infinite words, are defined for rational or irrational slope by using the slope of the generating ray. A finite word u is balanced if it is a factor of some irrational digital ray, and any finite balanced word u is also a factor of some rational digital ray.

Various characterizations have been used for the design of dss recognition algorithms. The paper concludes with a call for a comprehensive and comparative performance evaluation of the dss recognition algorithms suggested in the literature.

In summary, digital straight lines are a complex and challenging subject, and while many interesting results are known to date, there is still a need for a comprehensive performance evaluation of dss recognition algorithms and a statistical analysis of their time complexities.
