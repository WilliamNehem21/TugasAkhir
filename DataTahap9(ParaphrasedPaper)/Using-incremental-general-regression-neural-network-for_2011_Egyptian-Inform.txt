This research paper introduces a new algorithm for determining parameters of finite mixture models (FMM) from incomplete data. The proposed algorithm outperforms a modified EM algorithm when the dimensions containing missing values are moderately correlated with complete dimensions. The paper also presents the EMH algorithm for determining parameters of a mixture of multivariate normal distribution from incomplete data under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. Additionally, a data augmentation (DA) computational algorithm for learning normal mixture models under the MAR assumption is proposed, showing promising accuracy in predicting missing values compared to the EM imputation, especially as the missing rate increases. The paper also introduces the robust mixture discriminant analysis (RMDA) algorithm for handling noisy labels in data.

Furthermore, the paper proposes the incremental general regression neural network (IGRNN) for estimating missing values in numeric data sets, demonstrating its accuracy in the presence of strong correlations among data dimensions. The proposed IGRNNEM algorithm combines the IGRNN algorithm with the EM algorithm for determining FMM parameters from incomplete data. Experimental comparisons show that the IGRNNEM algorithm produces smaller misclustering errors and more accurate estimations for missing values compared to the EMH algorithm when correlations among dimensions are moderate or strong. However, both algorithms exhibit large errors in the absence of strong correlations among data dimensions. These results align with the findings of recently published work based on local tuning of general regression neural networks.
