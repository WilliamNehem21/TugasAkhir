The study divided layers into three groups: a control group (Group 1) which received standard commercial food with certain chemical additives, an experimental group (Group 2) which received standard commercial food with an AEM solution, and another experimental group (Group 3) which received AEM-treated food and drinking water. The findings showed that Group 3, which received both AEM-treated food and water, experienced increased monthly average egg production and weight, lower mortality ratio, reduced egg wastage, and higher values for egg shell weight, thickness, yolk weight, yolk index, and Haugh index. Additionally, Group 3 exhibited higher levels of certain minerals and protein. The concentration of total cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fat was decreased, while monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats were increased in Groups 2 and 3. The total cost of the treatments was found to be Rs. 110.80, 38.00, and 52.50 for Groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The study concluded that AEM treatments in commercial layers positively impacted egg production quality and economic value.

Eggs are considered to be one of the most nutritionally balanced foods, especially for humans, and are a major product in poultry. They are composed of albumin, egg yolk, and egg shell. The quality of eggs is influenced by consumer needs and processing. The study also observed that the saturated and trans fat content decreased in AEM-treated layers, possibly due to the inhibition of an enzyme involved in the gastrointestinal tract. The cost analysis showed a significant reduction in chemical usage with AEM treatments.
