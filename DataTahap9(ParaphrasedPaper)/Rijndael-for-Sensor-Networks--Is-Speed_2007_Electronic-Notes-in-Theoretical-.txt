The wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network composed of sensor nodes that can observe various events, process the acquired data, and transmit it to a central node known as the sink. This sink acts as a base station, gathering and handling the sensed data or serving as a gateway to other networks.

Sensor nodes in a WSN are usually battery-powered, leading to significant energy constraints. Replacing batteries for numerous nodes deployed in remote areas is not practical due to cost and inaccessibility. Thus, a critical challenge in WSNs is to minimize energy consumption, leading to extensive research on energy-efficient media access control (MAC) and routing algorithms.

Current security architectures for sensor networks incorporate ciphers like RC5 or Skipjack, which are considered secure and efficient in certain environments. However, the widely accepted Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is not commonly adopted on sensor nodes due to the limited processing and memory resources, making the implementation of AES (specifically Rijndael) inefficient and slow.

Performance evaluations demonstrate that RC5 is reported to be faster than Rijndael. While AES implementation has been utilized in some cases, the authors do not provide a performance assessment. Additionally, experiments using AES assembly implementation for symmetric encryption/decryption on the 8-bit Atmel ATmega128L microcontroller platform are quantified for the energy cost of authentication and key exchange based on public-key cryptography.

The authors of the paper evaluate the performance of TinySec through experiments and assert that TinySec's energy consumption, even in its most resource-intensive and secure mode, is a modest 10%, indicating that software-based link-layer security is viable for sensor networks. However, they also acknowledge the usefulness of end-to-end security mechanisms as a complement to TinySec.

The paper also discusses different approaches for key distribution in sensor networks, such as single shared keys and per-link keys, highlighting the trade-offs between simplicity and security.

The authors propose an end-to-end security system based on Rijndael, focusing on message authentication and integrity. They emphasize the importance of preventing adversaries from accessing any information from an encrypted message and discuss the impact of the initialization vector (IV) and the mode of operation on a secure system.

Furthermore, the authors present an implementation of Rijndael, emphasizing that encryption speed is not the main constraint for a secure WSN. They plan to extend their work to define a fully implemented end-to-end solution and explore the energy efficiency of Rijndael.
