This paper presents a new verifiable secret image sharing scheme denoted as (k, n) threshold VSISS, which generates encrypted shares. The proposed method is capable of detecting dishonest participants and restoring the original secret without any loss. Additionally, it reduces the likelihood of correctly guessing one shared image. The paper also outlines a verifiable (k, n) secret image sharing scheme based on a third-order LFSR-based public key cryptosystem for verification. This verifiable secret image sharing scheme consists of three key phases: initialization, share generation, and reconstruction. The initialization phase is detailed in section 3.1, the share generation scheme is proposed in section 3.2, and the verification and recovery strategy are introduced in section 3.3. A method to reconstruct the original secret image from k or more shared images is presented in the following section. The paper emphasizes that a subset of participants can recover the secret image, and if any k participants mutually authenticate and assemble their shares, the original secret will be restored. It also discusses the issue of extra storage and distortion-free recovery, making a comparison with previous schemes (e.g., [6,7] divide one pixel into two and use extra storage), and highlighting that the proposed scheme in this paper, along with other schemes (e.g.,[9,10]), can achieve lossless recovery without extra storage. However, it notes that while the proposed scheme avoids the use of extra storage, lossless recovery is not guaranteed.
