In the realm of microseismic monitoring technology, noise reduction plays a crucial role in the processing of data. The small magnitude of microseismic signals, combined with the presence of noise in the measured data, results in a significantly lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to active source seismic events. Consequently, directly identifying arrival times and localizing events from the original observation data becomes challenging.

To mitigate noise and enhance the accuracy of arrival time identification and event localization, considerable effort has been dedicated to developing effective denoising methodologies. Traditional approaches for microseismic noise suppression have relied on domain transform algorithms and various thresholding methods, such as wavelet transform, continuous wavelet transform (CWT), short time Fourier transform (STFT), S-transform, Radon transform, and wavelet packet. These methods involve manipulating input signals consisting of 5000 sampling points, with 2000 sampling points representing the length of the signals. Data augmentation techniques included adding Gaussian noise, wind noise from field acquisition, construction noise, traffic noise, and mixed noise to the signals. Given that real noisy signals deviate from a Gaussian distribution and are more representative of field conditions, the network's generalization ability can be improved. A total of 300,000 training samples were created, with 20% of the samples utilized for validation purposes.

The average similarity coefficient of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) filtering was approximately 0.83, with an average mean square error of about 0.09. Similarly, the average similarity coefficient of wavelet threshold transform filtering was approximately 0.86, with an average mean square error of about 0.08.

We propose a signal processing approach for microseismic monitoring based on the CBDNet neural network, primarily aimed at denoising in surface microseismic monitoring. Distinguishing itself from conventional deep learning methods, the proposed approach concurrently learns Gaussian random noise, wind noise, construction noise, traffic noise, and mixed noise through residual learning strategies. This approach significantly improves SNR, exhibits enhanced universality, and ensures signal authenticity. Even when encountering various types and intensities of ambient noise in field work, the proposed method can effectively suppress certain noise, extract the signal, and demonstrate varying denoising performance in the presence of different noise types.
