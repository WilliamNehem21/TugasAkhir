This paper introduces a model for websites that is suitable for formally verifying both dynamic and static properties of the system. It defines a website as a collection of semantically connected web pages and treats external web pages as part of the system's environment. The paper also presents a logic for specifying properties of websites and demonstrates the types of properties that can be specified and verified using a model-checking tool. The model is encoded using the specification language Maude, which enables the use of the Maude model-checking tool.

The development of the internet, particularly the hypertext markup language (HTML) and the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), has played a significant role in shaping the modern information society.

The paper abstracts from the concrete contents of web pages and focuses on the structural and semantic aspects of websites. It defines a graphical model for websites, representing web pages as nodes and links as edges in a directed graph. The model captures information such as URIs, anchors, links, and semantic annotations associated with web pages.

The model allows for the verification of properties using linear temporal logic (LTL) and model-checking algorithms. The paper discusses the use of the model to verify properties related to website connectivity, navigation, and semantics. It also outlines future avenues for extending the framework, such as developing parsers for additional markup languages and incorporating real-time temporal logic for quantitative properties.

Overall, the paper introduces a precise and flexible model for formal verification of websites, with potential applications in analyzing dynamic properties and using formal methods to ensure website correctness and completeness.
