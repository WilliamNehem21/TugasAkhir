In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating renewable energy sources with the grid for power generation. Researchers are focusing on designing and developing efficient technologies to connect renewable energy sources with the grid, as integrating them directly can introduce harmonic components that might degrade power quality. This paper proposes a method to utilize a shunt active filter as an interface between renewable energy sources and the grid, incorporating a modified and efficient control scheme. The modified controller of the shunt active filter is designed to regulate the real power supplied by the grid, while also performing functions such as reactive power compensation, power factor correction, and harmonic elimination. The paper includes simulations of the proposed system under both balanced and unbalanced load conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of using a shunt active filter as the interfacing unit for grid-integrated renewable energy systems.

Literature reports various types of interfacing units used for grid-renewable energy source interconnections, including separately connected systems, microgrids, multi-port converters, and custom power devices [9, 10]. Custom power interfaces such as shunt active filters and STATCOMs are preferred due to issues such as starting transients, energy conversion efficiency, and power quality. Shunt active filters have emerged as a recent and promising topology for use as interfacing units [11, 12].

The desired fraction, which determines the amount of real power supplied by the source, is calculated based on the difference between the load current and the reference source current. The reference filter current is compared with the actual filter current using a hysteresis controller to generate pulses for the inverter.
