This academic paper introduces an interface for interactive geometry proving that combines Geogebra, a dynamic geometry software, with Coq, a proof assistant. The interface enables users to create and manipulate geometric constructions in Geogebra and then develop formal proofs interactively with the support of Coq. The system is designed to allow users to construct traditional proofs in the same style as those taught in high school, providing a set of applicable rules and tactics in Coq for each step of the proving process.

The goal of the interface is to provide a tool for students to prove geometric theorems interactively using familiar high school-level reasoning techniques. The system, called Geocoq, facilitates reasoning steps through mouse clicks and sends them to Coq for execution, with the responses sent back to the users to continue their proofs. Additionally, the interface includes automatic tactics in Coq to help users solve minor reasoning steps without delving into technical details. These tactics are formalized in Coq and can be used to check facts before proving them or as steps in constructing proofs.

The paper provides a brief description of Geogebra, the Coq system, and the communication using Pcoq, as well as a summary of the library and features provided for proofs. The authors also discuss the development of automatic tactics and their integration into the interface. Furthermore, the paper outlines the structure and content of the interface and describes the commands and windows used in the Geocoq system.

Coq is highlighted as a proof development system that allows users to define functions or predicates, state mathematical theorems, and develop formal proofs interactively. The authors emphasize that Coq is well-suited for interactively constructing proofs, as it provides a tactic language and includes tactics for automatic theorem proving and decision procedures.

The paper also touches upon the use of Pcoq, a graphical user interface for Coq, as a means of communication with Coq within the Geocoq system. The benefits of using Pcoq, such as its implementation in Java and its integration with Geogebra, are highlighted, as well as its ability to manipulate formulas and commands as tree-like structures and provide an easy access to the structure of information received from Coq.

The interface's capabilities and features, such as searching applicable rules, creating new objects in geometric diagrams, and providing appropriate tactics for reasoning steps, are detailed. The paper also discusses related work in the field and the conclusions drawn from the development and implementation of the Geocoq interface.

Overall, the paper presents an integrated approach for interactive geometry proving, aiming to provide students with a tool for constructing traditional proofs in an interactive and educational manner. The integration of a proof assistant in a dynamic geometry software is presented as a novel way to learn and understand geometry, as it allows users to have a logical view of solving geometric problems and thoroughly understand reasoning steps.
