Epilepsy is a widely recognized neurological condition that affects an estimated 65 to 75 million people globally, with approximately 10.5 million of those being children. The worldwide prevalence of epilepsy ranges from 2.8 to 19.5 cases per 1000 individuals in the general population. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent disturbances of the nervous system resulting from sudden, excessive, and disorganized neuronal discharges, leading to rapid sensory disturbances and loss of consciousness. Seizures caused by epilepsy can manifest in various symptoms, such as complete or partial loss of consciousness, loss of speech, and uncontrollable motor behavior.

In the study, after conducting docking searches, the most populated cluster with the highest binding score was chosen as the best conformation for the protein-ligand complex. Interaction analyses of the docked protein-ligand complex included examining hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions using visualization software.

The findings of the study suggest that certain physiochemical parameters, such as minhbint4, eta_alpha, and grav-5, have a positive coefficient in Model 1, indicating that an increase in these parameters will lead to higher anticonvulsant activities (ped50) of quinoxaline and thiadiazoles derivatives against the GABAAT enzyme. Conversely, descriptors like dpsa-1 and wt.eneg have negative coefficients, meaning that their decrease is associated with higher inhibitory activities of quinoxaline and thiadiazoles derivatives against the same enzyme.

Moreover, the study indicates that the physiochemical parameters eta_alpha and grav-5 are directly proportional to the inhibitory activities (ped50) of quinoxaline and thiadiazoles derivatives, suggesting that an increase in these values will result in higher inhibitory activities against the GABAAT enzyme.

The research also highlights the importance of descriptors such as dpsa-1 and wt.eneg in relation to the inhibitory activities of these derivatives against the enzyme associated with epilepsy. It is suggested that lower levels of dpsa-1 descriptor will lead to increased inhibitory activities, while a reduction in wt.eneg will enhance the binding affinity and atomic electronegativity of the inhibitors. This emphasizes the significance of considering binding affinity and atomic electronegativity in enhancing the effectiveness of these derivatives in inhibiting the activities of the GABAAT enzyme.

The study further validates the robustness and applicability of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models through internal and external validation techniques. It indicates that the dominant structural features responsible for the inhibitory activity of quinoxaline and thiadiazoles derivatives against the epilepsy-associated enzyme GABAAT are physiochemical parameters, including minhbint4, eta_alpha, dpsa-1, grav-5, and wt.eneg. Overall, the research emphasizes the significance of these physiochemical parameters in enhancing the inhibitory activities of these derivatives against epilepsy.
