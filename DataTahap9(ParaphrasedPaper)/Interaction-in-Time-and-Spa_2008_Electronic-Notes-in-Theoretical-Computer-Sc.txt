This paper explores a scenario involving a student leaving a university building and seeking transportation to a specific location, with options including a bus, a tram, and taxicabs. The student prioritizes using the bus, followed by the tram, and lastly, the cab due to the varying costs associated with each option. Additionally, the paper discusses the concept of well-typedness of processes, defined by a set of static rules that govern the behavior of processes with respect to their types. It also delves into the idea of large populations of interacting processes within an interaction field, where the interaction is described as a pair (action, reaction), and emergence properties and non-compositionality are emphasized. The paper introduces the notion of proximity to express the dynamic nature of interaction within the interaction field. Furthermore, the paper outlines the definition of a coordination pair (t, cp), where t assigns initial values to timers, capacities, and proximities, and cp consists of rules. Finally, the paper discusses timers, capacities, and proximities as elements used to control the interaction between components within timed mobile ambients, which offer a hierarchical representation of space and a more realistic description of distributed computation and mobility.
