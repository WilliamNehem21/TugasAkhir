In [21,22], an approach for enforcing security properties was presented based on the automatic synthesis of controller programs to detect and prevent incorrect actions by external agents. This paper extends the approach to a timed setting and demonstrates its capability to enforce various information flow properties under certain assumptions. The work also addresses parameterized systems. 

Numerous successful approaches for analyzing security properties have been developed over the past two decades, with recent interest in techniques for enforcing security properties, such as security automata and their extensions. The goal of this paper is to expand on previous work by defining controller operators capable of enforcing information flow properties, particularly in a timed setting, thereby enriching the range of enforceable security properties. The paper also introduces an extension of partial model checking to address parameterized systems.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the basic theory behind the analysis of timed security properties, particularly non-interference, as properties of open systems. Section 3 outlines the approach, addressing composition of properties and parameterized systems. Section 4 provides a simple example, and Section 5 discusses related work. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

The paper delves into the theoretical study of information flow in computer security, offering formal definitions for concurrent processes and discussing the non-deducibility on composition (NDC) property as a generalization of non-interference to nondeterministic systems. The paper also introduces a theory for enforcing information flow properties, specified as tbndc, and provides examples of controllers that achieve this.

The concept of a parameterized system, which describes an infinite family of systems obtained by fixing parameters, is also discussed in the paper. It is noted that previous works have focused on enforceable properties and related mechanisms, with the authors outlining the advantages of their approach, particularly in monitoring only the necessary/untrusted part of the system.

The paper also highlights the use of controller synthesis to enforce security policies and draws parallels to existing research in the synthesis of controllers in real-time. The paper concludes by discussing plans to refine the method in order to address certain issues.
