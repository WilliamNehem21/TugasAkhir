Real-world engineering and economic problems frequently involve imprecise data. This paper focuses on the generalized production planning problem with interval data, where the data are uncertain and can fluctuate within specified intervals. The study investigates qualitative and quantitative analyses of essential concepts in parametric production planning, including the set of feasible parameters, the solvability set, and the stability set of the first kind.

Production planning is necessary due to limited resources that cannot be carried over from one period to the next. Decisions need to be made regarding resource selection, capacity modeling, behavior, and costs, while also considering uncertainty associated with production functions and constraints. The problem commences with defining customer demand to be met by the production plan.

Jamalnia and Soukhakian, as well as Hax and Meal, introduced hierarchical production planning, offering a specific framework that incorporates an optimization model at each level of the hierarchy, with each model constraining the model at the subsequent hierarchy level.

In practical contexts, future demand is often only partially known and is forecasted with limited accuracy. This uncertainty can lead to unmet demand and reduced revenue. The authors propose a novel planning problem to minimize lost demands and maximize revenue. They construct a production planning problem incorporating interval numbers as uncertainty in both the objective function and constraints. Subsequently, they address the uncertainty in the objective function and constraints and introduce a parametric study for this treatment problem in section 4. Finally, they present a numerical example to illustrate their proposed approach.
