The data access facility (DAF) is a critical component of IEC61970 that aims to enhance EMS application and other systems by promoting collaborative work capabilities. Its primary objective is to provide a public application program interface (API) and service mechanism for accessing CIM public data from various suppliers. DAF is designed with the concept of offering a straightforward and user-friendly API. As an essential component of the Common Information Model (CIM) interface standard, DAF includes modules such as DAFDescriptions, DAFIdentifiers, DAFQuery, and DAFEvents, which form the core interface. DAF provides sufficient functionality for external and internal CIM data acquisition systems through these modules. This paper specifically focuses on the usage of DAFDescriptions.IDL, DAFQuery.IDL, and DAFIdentifiers.IDL.

In DAF, resources, properties, and values are utilized for querying and formulating results. A resource refers to any distinct entity, typically identified by a uniform resource identifier (URI) with an optional fragment identifier. However, for DAF inquiries and search results, a more concise resource ID of the URI is recommended. A property represents an aspect that a resource may describe. In the context of inquiries, nature is expressed through the property's type, known as PropertyID, and nature itself is treated as a resource, leading to the definition of PropertyID as a ResourceID. Each property has a domain (resource collection) and a range (value collection). Relationships between resources are established through properties, and both the domain and range represent collections of resources.
