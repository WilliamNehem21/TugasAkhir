As a result of the proliferation of digital data and communication networks, a vast array of repositories has become accessible to the public. Many tools are available for extracting information from these diverse sources, but it is crucial to do so effectively and accurately. Some researchers have proposed models and discussions that underscore the important role of integration and indexing in information mining and querying. Effective data extraction requires precise learning models for associating data and obtaining meaningful results. This task becomes particularly challenging when dealing with unstructured data distribution.

Data integration is a computationally efficient and accurate method used in data mining for categorizing data. Its main purpose is to provide reliable data from a variety of sources, especially when handling large datasets in terms of volume, dimensions, and data complexity. In real-time data from diverse domain sources, the core objective of data integration is to generate valuable and meaningful information. However, integrating information from heterogeneous data sources poses several challenges. Heterogeneity can exist at the schema level and at the instance level, making it difficult to integrate different representations of the same domain and to reconcile different ways of representing the same real-world entity. While various approaches have been proposed for analyzing heterogeneous data for integration using schema mapping, record linkage, and entity matching, challenges persist in integrating multiple sources and unstructured data objects due to the diverse nature of the information and features.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the background study, Section 3 presents the proposed integration and indexing method, Section 4 discusses the experimental evaluation and results, and Section 5 summarizes the conclusion of the proposed work.

According to a 2018 reference, data integration systems need to handle uncertainty levels in the semantic mappings between data sources and the mediated schema. Constructing effective indexing based on keywords for data access queries is essential, and this can be achieved by tagging features for schema elements. However, as per work conducted in 2019, challenges remain in understanding the reliable features and their associations for accurate integration.

All features are not equally important or distinctive as they are often correlated or redundant. This can lead to inefficiency or poor performance in conventional learning models, making it challenging to learn high-dimensional data features to improve accuracy and comprehensibility of results. Another challenge is to eliminate unrelated and repetitive features from a large volume of data, necessitating the selection of a subset of data features.

Feature selection methods are categorized as supervised or unsupervised. Supervised feature selection methods use the relationship between characteristics and feature information to select significant and relevant features, while unsupervised feature selection methods face challenges in analyzing large volumes of data due to a lack of feature information for reference. Semi-supervised feature selection has emerged to take advantage of labeled and unlabeled data, but it also faces difficulties in identifying distinctive features in the absence of labels, making it a more complex problem. In unsupervised feature selection, a subset of features is identified without labels, and these groups are based on challenging grouping or clustering criteria. The difficulties in unsupervised feature selection are often addressed using probability model methods, and several models have been proposed for global integration capabilities and unsupervised feature selection.

A 2018 bibliometric study analyzed integrated care literature and tested the usefulness of indexing literature within PubMed, which inspired an experiment with BibTeX data on a big data platform. The study compared various techniques for indexing with their pros and limitations.

In this paper, a modified feature vector selection (FVS) method, an easy tuning version of Support Vector Machine (SVM), is proposed for selecting a small number of data points for implementation. The FVR model is solved analytically, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with several SVM-based methods using twenty-six imbalanced datasets. The proposed method is also compared with SVM in integration performance analysis.

The method shows better results for a limited number of features, but it is computationally slow due to the large database. The literature review indicates that Naive Bayes has a wide scope for experimentation with big data but has not been sufficiently explored in certain combinations. Therefore, this article aims to bridge these identified gaps by experimenting with BibTeX data. The performances of PFP with Naive Bayes, SVM, and TF approaches are analyzed and measured, and the performance of the proposed F-LSA for indexing is justified by comparing it with PFP and TM with LSA. This justification is extended to different datasets such as CiteseerX, BibTeX, and Cora in the concluding section.

Data files from different technical article publishers were acquired from an Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory (IESL) to support the mining of actionable knowledge from unstructured text. The data, which includes over 4000 BibTeX files with more than 6 million article records downloaded from the internet, underwent processing to remove noise and fill in missing data. Features were then extracted for feature transformation and selection for integration, and a set of terms was constructed for semantic classification to classify article class for integration. Semantic classification computes relevance association to identify the similarity between sets of terms. Co-occurrence features can be acquired through the transfer relations between records, and the co-occurrence information of terms can be captured when Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is decomposed.

The degree of similarity in features reflects the correlation between terms, and the weight value embodies the co-occurrence information between features in the SVD space. The Java program performs integration through semantic classification of data records using knowledge patterns. Once integration is complete, the F-LSA indexing method ranks the integrated data group, and a data access visualization interface is built to evaluate the accuracy of the outcome.

Previous studies have primarily used purity metrics to measure clustering algorithm performance, and it is relatively easy to achieve purity measures when a larger number of clusters are available for integration. However, many partitions may have the same purity, particularly if they are associated with each other. Therefore, the experiment results are analyzed for integration and indexing through comparing normal outcomes with those of the proposed method, including measuring purity and NMI for the integrated data clusters against class articles.

The purpose of indexing records is to enable faster access and retrieval, and accuracy depends on feature representation. Good features result in better accuracy, and the process of semantic data relation learning (SDRL) is discussed to learn k-features related to a collection of data for effective grouping. The indexing process utilizes the latent semantic analysis (LSA) method to understand the degree of similarity between features and properly rank the correlation between terms of data records.
