In recent times, there has been a growing interest in set-theoretic categories, which are categories where objects are sets (or classes) from a universe that may not necessarily be well-founded, and morphisms are set-theoretic functions. These categories have proven to be a convenient framework for exploring the foundations of the coalgebraic approach to coinduction. Despite this, there has been relatively little attention given to set-theoretic categories among both category theorists and set-theorists, largely due to differing ideological motivations.

The paper begins by revisiting key definitions and fundamental concepts related to set theory and set-theoretical categories in Section 1, with a specific focus on set-based functors, inclusion-preserving functors, and the Aczel-Mendler final coalgebra theorem. Section 2 delves into an examination of the properties of inclusion-preserving functors, establishing a foundation for the subsequent main results of the paper. In Section 3, the paper strengthens the Aczel-Mendler theorem by demonstrating that all class-theoretic functors have final coalgebras. Section 4 investigates two categories of partially specified endofunctors on set-theoretic categories: those that are constant on objects and those that are identical on objects. Finally, the paper outlines potential directions for future research in Section 5.

The focal point of this subsection is to establish that if f is a functor with a constant set-cardinality on objects, then f is naturally isomorphic to an inclusion-preserving functor g, which is also constant. This proof relies on lemmata 4.1 and 4.2. With this foundation in place, the paper presents the main result of this section, i.e., Theorem 4.14, which is derived from an inconsistency result pertaining to fixed points in a cartesian closed category with coproducts, applied to the image category as defined in 4.7.
