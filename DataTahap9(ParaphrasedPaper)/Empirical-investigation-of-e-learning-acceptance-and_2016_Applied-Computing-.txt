The use of technology to support learning, also known as e-learning, has become increasingly important for both academic institutions and corporate training. It offers benefits such as reaching learners in different geographical locations, providing flexibility and convenience for learners, and being cost-effective in the delivery and management of courses. As a result, educational institutions and professional organizations are embracing e-learning and implementing a variety of technology-enabled platforms.

Saudi Arabia has recently called for a national plan to adopt e-learning across the country, particularly in higher education. This plan emphasizes the implementation of e-learning and distance learning, and the potential applications of these approaches. The Saudi Ministry of Higher Education has launched the National Center of E-Learning & Distance Learning, established a repository to facilitate the transition, and developed e-learning materials to support universities in quickly shifting to e-learning.

This study is based on the work of Venkatesh, Bala, and Baker, who have focused on the acceptance and adoption of technology. It aims to investigate the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning in Saudi Arabia, a country with a unique culture different from the Western cultures where the technology acceptance model (TAM) originated. The study seeks to predict technology acceptance and explore post-implementation interventions that may contribute to the successful adoption of e-learning systems in developing countries.

Mirza and Al-Abdulkareem discussed the current status of e-learning in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, highlighting drivers and barriers to e-learning adoption and ongoing developments in the region. They noted that while some educational organizations are pioneers in e-learning, many are still progressing, and some are lagging behind.

Post-implementation interventions refer to organizational and managerial activities that occur after the implementation of a system to enhance user acceptance. These interventions are important for helping users adapt to the new system and should focus on improving job performance and providing necessary resources. TAM3 suggests several post-implementation interventions, such as training, organizational support, and peer assistance.

The study employs a customized technology acceptance model based on TAM3 to investigate the determinants of e-learning acceptance and assimilation, utilizing survey research to test the model and outline outcomes, including antecedents of technology acceptance and managerial interventions for better organizational e-learning management. The goal is to provide insights into the success factors and interventions contributing to the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning systems in developing countries.
