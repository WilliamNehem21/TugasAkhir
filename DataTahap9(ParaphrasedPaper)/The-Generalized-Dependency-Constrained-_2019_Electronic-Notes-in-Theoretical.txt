The paper introduces the generalized dependency constrained spanning tree problem (g-dcst), in which the selection of an edge is subject to constraints on the number of edges chosen from its dependency set. The dependency relations between the edges of the input graph g are characterized by an input directed graph d, with the in-neighbors of a vertex in d forming its dependency set. The paper demonstrates that g-dcst unifies and extends several existing spanning tree problems that involve conflict constraints over edges or impose bounds on vertex degrees. It also establishes the NP-completeness of the feasibility version of g-dcst, even under stringent restrictions on the structures of g and d, as well as the functions defining the minimum or maximum number of dependencies to be satisfied. Additionally, the paper identifies an ln n inapproximability threshold for this problem under certain assumptions, while also presenting a polynomial case using a matroid intersection argument.

The subsequent sections of the paper delve into results related to g-dcst and g-dcmst. Section 2 establishes connections between these problems and generalized versions of spanning tree problems found in existing literature, demonstrating that g-dcst unifies and generalizes a range of known problems. Notably, it establishes a relationship between g-dcst and the conflict constrained spanning tree problem, which could be viewed as its counterpart with an undirected graph replacing the digraph d.

In Section 3, the paper analyzes the complexity of g-dcst(g, d, l, u) and g-dcmst(g, d, l, u) in terms of the input graphs g and d, demonstrating NP-completeness for g-dcst and establishing an inapproximability threshold for g-dcmst.

The paper also highlights the inapproximability of g-dcmst, l-dcmst, and a-dcmst, demonstrating an ln(n) inapproximability threshold under very restrictive assumptions in the context of the latter two problems, as presented in a theorem.

Another subsection focuses on the examination of g-dcmst(g, d, l, u, w), particularly by emphasizing the functions l and u and aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the problem's complexity while identifying cases where it can be feasibly addressed. Notably, a polynomial case for g-dcmst is identified using a matroid intersection approach.

The paper also draws a connection with the problem of finding a maximum weight common independent set of two weighted matroids, showing that this problem can be solved in polynomial time. This connection leads to a corresponding theorem regarding g-dcmst.

Lastly, the authors express their belief that the specific case of g-dcmst(g, d, l, u, w) under l = 0 holds promise for exploration, as it generalizes the recently studied problem ccmst. They outline their intention to approach g-dcmst using integer linear programming and to conduct a polyhedral study of the dependency constraints. Additionally, they plan to leverage defective coloring results to develop heuristic methods and approximation approaches for g-dcmst(g, d, l, u, w) under l = 0.
