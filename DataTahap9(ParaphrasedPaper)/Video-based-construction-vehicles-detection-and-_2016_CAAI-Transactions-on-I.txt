To the best of our knowledge, prior work has focused on vehicle detection on highways, but there has been limited exploration of intelligent monitoring systems for detecting hydraulic excavators and dump trucks on state-owned land. This paper introduces an automatic, video-based algorithm for detecting these construction vehicles. The algorithm utilizes an improved frame difference method for foreground detection, and specific strategies for detecting hydraulic excavators based on the inverse valley feature of the mechanical arm and spatial-temporal reasoning. Additionally, the paper explores dump truck detection strategies that combine structured component projection with spatial relationship analysis. Experimental results on real monitoring sites demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed system.

Protecting state-owned land is a critical responsibility, especially as rapid urbanization in China has led to frequent encroachment by developers and individuals. Illegal construction on state-owned land presents a significant challenge, and an intelligent monitoring system targeting construction vehicles is proposed to provide timely warnings for such activities. While various methods exist for land supervision, such as satellite remote sensing, vehicle video monitoring, artificial patrolling, and video monitoring, this paper argues that an intelligent monitoring system based on videos is the most practical choice.

The paper provides detailed descriptions of the foreground detection algorithm based on the frame difference, along with specific algorithms for detecting hydraulic excavators and dump trucks. In particular, the improved three-frame difference algorithm is proposed for dump truck detection, while the hydraulic excavator detection is based on the inverse-v feature and spatial-temporal reasoning. The authors also present experimental results from practical engineering projects to support the effectiveness of their approach.

The proposed system demonstrates a unique application tailored to the contextual challenges of Chinese state-owned land protection. The system's components include foreground detection and construction vehicle detection, focusing specifically on hydraulic excavators and dump trucks. The paper introduces innovative models and reasoning methods for vehicle detection, emphasizing the significance of adapting these technologies to suit local needs and conditions.
