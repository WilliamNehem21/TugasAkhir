This article introduces an efficient method for classifying a group of corn kernels that are in contact with each other. The kernels may be of good quality, defective, or contain impurities. The proposed method involves two stages: the first stage uses a segmentation network to divide the given image into individual instances, and the second stage employs a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify each instance into one of the three categories. The segmentation network is trained using synthesized images to avoid the labor-intensive and error-prone task of manual data annotation. The lightweight CNN architecture is designed to be suitable for integrated solutions and is trained using a strategy to avoid manual data annotation. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced processing time compared to previous methods. The proposed segmentation and classification approach can be easily adapted for use with other types of cereal.

Given the importance of corn in the global economy, defining standards in its commercialization processes, including quality analysis, is essential. Manual quality analysis of corn kernels is currently performed by experts, but this process is tedious, complex, and subject to human error due to the subjective nature of visual inspection.

To ensure fair trade, it is necessary to eliminate subjectivity from the quality analysis process. Recently, deep learning techniques have been proposed for the analysis of kernel quality. These approaches typically involve instance segmentation and classification. This paper presents a novel strategy to avoid time-consuming data annotation and a lightweight architecture that outperforms existing methods in corn kernel classification. The paper also presents related work, the proposed approach for classifying elements from the sample set, and experimental results and comparisons with different approaches. Finally, the paper presents conclusions and discusses the potential for adapting the approach to other grain types.

In a similar vein, Shao et al. (2021) used a semantic segmentation network to segment rice kernels on ears, followed by a watershed algorithm to identify individual instances. However, manually labeling images remains a time-consuming challenge for such approaches.

Various techniques have been proposed for corn kernel classification, including pattern recognition-based methods, Fourier transform-based approaches, and deep learning-based techniques using CNNs and other advanced models. These methods aim to differentiate between good and defective corn kernels and have different limitations and advantages.

To generate the dataset, samples of corn kernels from the three categories (good grains, defective grains, and impurities) were manually grouped to avoid additional image annotation tasks. Images of these samples were acquired using a camera under natural lighting conditions. The proposed lightweight CNN architecture was trained using a learning rate optimization strategy to generalize the model and provide faster convergence.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel segmentation and classification approach for corn kernel analysis, with experimental results demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over existing techniques. The authors also outline plans for future work, including the development of a lightweight segmentation model and the extension of the proposed solution to other grain types.
