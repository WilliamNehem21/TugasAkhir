The study investigated the pollen grains of forty species of aquatic flowering plants naturally occurring in four coastal Mediterranean lakes in Egypt. These species belong to 17 families and were categorized as floating, submerged, or emergent species. The investigation, conducted between January and August 2012, revealed that the pollen grains exhibited various morphologies, including prolate-spheroidal, spheroidal, triangular, prolate, or elongated shapes, and had different surface textures such as psilate, granulate, reticulate, or microechinate. The aperture types of the pollen grains were classified as colporate, colpate, porate, or inaperturate, with some families exhibiting inaperturate pollen grains. The study highlighted the significance of pollen characteristics, such as polarity, symmetry, aperture types, and exine sculpturing, in differentiating between pollen types from a phylogenetic and evolutionary perspective.

The identified pollen grains were conserved in the herbarium of the Botany Department at Mansoura University, Egypt, and were intended to serve as reference specimens for palynologists, ecologists, taxonomists, and other researchers interested in the northern lakes. The study emphasized the utility of palynology in obtaining valuable information from small amounts of material within a short timeframe. It also discussed the diverse applications of palynology, including the survey of atmospheric pollen, spore production, and archaeological excavation of shipwrecks.

The main objectives of the study were to contribute to the understanding of pollen morphology in aquatic plants growing in the northern Mediterranean lakes and to provide a valuable tool for plant taxonomy. The pollen grains were extracted from fresh flowers, and their sizes were determined based on measurements of the longest axis of 15 grains. The study employed various chemical preparation procedures to examine the pollen grains under light microscopy, and the findings revealed the symmetrical and apolar nature of the pollen grains, with some taxa exhibiting isopolarity and heteropolarity. The study also provided detailed descriptions of the aperture types, surface patterns, and exine textures of the pollen grains of different plant families.

In summary, the study provided a comprehensive analysis of the pollen morphology of aquatic flowering plants and underscored the importance of palynology in elucidating evolutionary and taxonomic relationships among different plant species.
