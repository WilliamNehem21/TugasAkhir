It might be contended that the paper's limitation lies in its exclusive relevance to continuous mappings, given the availability of more comprehensive fixed point theorems. However, within the realm of continuous mappings, the only plausible critique appears to be that its canonical fixed points lack the degree of canonical status that could be attained. Undoubtedly, a unique fixed point holds a more rewarding appeal than a least fixed point. 

An alternative semantic approach grounded in results such as theorem 5.3 would be preferable over a metric-based approach. This holds especially true for a model of CSP. The pursuit of estimations in line with Proposition 5.6 for nonexpansive maps presents an intriguing challenge. Notably, it would be interesting to ascertain whether the informatic derivative, which is the derivative of a map on a domain in relation to a measurement, can offer utility in this context.
