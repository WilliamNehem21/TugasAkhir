This paper presents a protocol that aims to prolong the lifespan of wireless sensor networks. Section 2 provides a review of related work, while the subsequent sections are organized as follows: Section 3 offers a detailed description of the LEACH-C protocol, which serves as the foundation for the proposed protocol. Section 4 introduces the LEACH-CS protocol and outlines its specific functionalities. Section 5 presents an evaluation of LEACH-CS, comparing it to LEACH-C through simulation results. Finally, in Section 6, conclusions are drawn, and potential future research directions are discussed.

In the proposed LEACH-CE protocol, 5% of the network's live nodes are designated as cluster heads, and the base station instructs 10% of the nodes to enter sleep mode before cluster head selection. These nodes in sleep mode neither sense data nor receive cluster head information. The base station governs the operations of all nodes and selects 5% of nodes to act as cluster heads, with the previous round's cluster heads ineligible for selection unless all nodes in the network have served as cluster heads. This model randomly chooses nodes to enter sleep mode, though this approach does not guarantee data quality despite extending the network's lifespan.

An alternative protocol is proposed, which also places a percentage of nodes into sleep mode based on their energy level, number of neighbors, and average distance among neighbors. Nodes with abundant neighbors and high energy levels are prime candidates for sleep mode, as higher neighbor counts indicate increased overlap, and lower energy levels indicate an imminent risk of node failure. Unlike prior protocols, this approach accounts for the sensed data in determining sleep mode, marking a novel aspect of this paper.

Section 4 details the functionality of the LEACH-CS protocol, a modified version of LEACH-C. Subsection A outlines the network model adopted in developing the protocol, while Subsection B describes the radio model employed in the protocol's operation. Finally, Subsection C offers a comprehensive explanation of LEACH-CS's operation.

Before commencing each round, the base station gathers energy level data from all network nodes. Using this information, the base station arranges the nodes based on their energy levels and designates 5% of live nodes as cluster heads for the round. The authors conclude that this approach represents the optimal number of cluster heads for energy minimization.
