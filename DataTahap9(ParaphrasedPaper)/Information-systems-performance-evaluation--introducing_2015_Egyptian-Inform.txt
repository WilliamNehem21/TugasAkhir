The paper aimed to introduce a novel approach to aid decision makers in the call center industry in appraising and analyzing call center performance. The technique, rooted in research on assessing the success or failure of information systems, draws on two main models: the Delone and McLean model from 1992 and the Design-Reality Gap model introduced by Heeks in 2002. This approach defines two indices, namely, the success index and the gap index, to measure call center performance. An evaluation tool has been devised to enable call center managers to systematically and analytically assess their call centers. The tool was applied to four different call centers, covering areas such as food ordering, marketing, technical support, and emergency control systems. The findings underscore the significance of utilizing information systems models to evaluate complex systems like call centers, which enable the identification of specific challenges faced by call centers and their dimensions.

The emergence of information and communication technologies, along with the affordable cost of voice and data calls, has led to the widespread use of call centers to offer new services to the public. Advancements in call center technologies, systems, and infrastructure have transformed industries and services in large enterprises and organizations, encompassing customer support, marketing, and after-sales support. Additionally, the application of call centers in real-time critical services is on the rise. In Egypt, call centers have been utilized to enhance emergency control systems, resulting in improved ambulance services during challenging circumstances, such as those encountered since the 25th of January revolution. Similarly, in India, specialized call centers have been established to provide first-line health consultations, aiming to reduce the referral of cases to primary care health units. Outsourcing critical services to specialized call centers holds potential for enhancing the quality of services offered by governments, companies, and organizations to their targeted customers.

The use of queuing theory in call center operations involves assumptions to simplify modeling and analytical complexity. These techniques, however, may not accurately reflect the realities of complex systems due to the inherent complexity and the assumptions and simplifications in the models. The paper also delves into recent literature on call center operation management, specifically highlighting new management challenges arising from emerging technologies, behavioral issues related to call center agents and customers, and the intersection of call center operations with sales and marketing.

The paper revolves around introducing a new technique to support decision makers in evaluating and analyzing call center performance, drawing from research on assessing the success or failure of information systems. It primarily adopts the Delone and McLean model to gauge call center performance, proposing a call center performance index to measure overall performance. The study outlines 43 indicators mapped to the six dimensions of the Delone and McLean model, demonstrating the potential of multidimensional modeling for call centers in analyzing individual dimensions and assessing their impact on overall performance. Additionally, weighted dimension indicators are suggested to reflect the priorities set by top management for calculating the performance index.

The subsequent sections of the paper detail the application of the design-reality gap model to call centers, the mapping of call center indicators to the dimensions of this model, the introduction of the call center gap index, the results obtained from the proposed methodology, and the effects of the proposed indicators on call center performance assessment. The paper concludes by offering insights for future work.

Potential future work includes studying specific indicators related to particular verticals, such as the financial or health sectors, to enhance the analysis of specialized call centers. Furthermore, there is a need to analyze the association of different weights for the model and to develop an automated assessment tool that can be seamlessly integrated into existing call center monitoring systems, facilitating communication and data exchange between the developed tool and the monitoring system in place.
