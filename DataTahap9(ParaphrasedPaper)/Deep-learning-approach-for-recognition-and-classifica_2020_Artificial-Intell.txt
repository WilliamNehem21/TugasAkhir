Timely identification and early management of stresses in paddy crops during the booting growth stage are crucial for preventing reductions in both quantity and quality of agricultural yield. Traditional methods for recognizing and categorizing paddy crop stresses heavily rely on human experts visually identifying symptoms, which can be subjective and prone to errors, potentially leading to incorrect stress management decisions. This paper presents a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) framework designed for automatic recognition and classification of various biotic and abiotic paddy crop stresses using field images. The study utilizes a pre-trained VGG-16 CNN model to automatically classify stressed paddy crop images captured during the booting growth stage, achieving an average accuracy of 92.89% on the held-out dataset.

Paddy crop cultivation plays a significant role in the Indian agricultural economy, ranking first in the area of cultivation with 43.92 million hectares and a production of 111.50 million tons. Despite these impressive numbers, rice production in Asia has faced increased pressure due to factors such as population growth and changing socio-economic conditions. To address this, an integrated approach involving crop improvement and resource management practices, such as nutrient management and irrigation regimes, is crucial for minimizing the crop yield gap.

The paper also highlights the challenges associated with traditional visual scoring methods, such as visual observation of leaf injury and color variation, for determining stress categories. These methods are subjective, time-consuming, and destructive, and they do not cover stresses occurring in parts of the plant other than the leaves. In light of these challenges, the paper proposes the adoption of deep learning techniques, specifically DCNN, which have shown impressive results in image classification tasks without relying on expert-designed or handcrafted features. The study aims to develop a comprehensive paddy plant stress recognition system as an effective tool for constructing crop management strategies.

The study conducts experiments in the all India Co-ordinate Rice Improvement Project (AICRIP) experimental paddy fields, situated at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, India. Five certified and popular paddy varieties are selected for the study, and the grains are sown separately in a raised bed nursery. The plants are subjected to 11 different stress types, and observations are made to fulfill the objectives of the study, achieving average stress classification accuracies of 95.08% and 90.75% for the paddy crop varieties mugad 101 and jaya, respectively.

In summary, the paper successfully demonstrates the automation of recognition and classification of paddy crop stresses using deep learning techniques, achieving promising results and opening avenues for further research to improve stress classification performance and extend the approach to other field crops. The proposed approach has the potential to address the challenges associated with traditional visual scoring methods and can be applied to a wide range of field crops. Additionally, future work will compare the performance of the VGG-16 model with other state-of-the-art models and explore various environmental factors affecting crop stress.
