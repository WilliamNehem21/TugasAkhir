This paper discusses the issue of selecting test cases for testing the conformance of a black-box implementation with a specification, specifically in the context of reactive systems. It extends the existing solutions for finite-state models to address infinite-state specifications modeled as automata with variables. The selection of test cases based on test purposes is also considered.

The paper focuses on the conformance testing of reactive systems, where the goal is to ensure that the behavior of a black-box implementation aligns with its specification. The use of formal models and methods, such as model-based testing, is advocated to automate parts of the testing process and improve its quality and cost-effectiveness. Various testing theories based on finite-state models have been well understood and have led to the development of automatic test generation algorithms and tools for industrial-scale systems.

The paper highlights the need for more powerful models that can account for complexities such as data and time. It introduces the concept of input/output symbolic transition systems (IOSTS), which are automata extended with variables, and describes a method for constructing test cases from these models. The use of symbolic execution and constraint solving in test case generation is also discussed.

The proposed test selection algorithm is based on the concept of test purpose, which specifies the intention of a test case. The paper outlines the properties related to verdicts and discusses the use of constraint solving in the test execution process.

Overall, the paper presents an approach to off-line test case selection from specification models using test purposes, which addresses the state explosion problem and produces test cases in the form of programs. It acknowledges the need for more powerful models to account for features such as time, recursion, and concurrency, and suggests potential directions for future research, including addressing partial observability and combining techniques with coverage-based test selection.
