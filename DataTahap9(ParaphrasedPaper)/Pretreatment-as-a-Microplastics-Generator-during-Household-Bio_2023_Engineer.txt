Various methods are employed to pretreat organic waste in anaerobic digestion or mechanical and biological treatment facilities in order to eliminate physical impurities such as plastics, metal, paper, glass, wood, and sand. These methods primarily rely on mechanical processes like shredding, screening, and extrusion dehydration. The effectiveness of impurity removal varies among these facilities and depends on factors such as the quality of incoming waste, technical capabilities, and product requirements. However, complete removal of plastics through mechanical means has not been widely studied.

Alessi et al. examined the efficiency of four biowaste pretreatment plants in removing impurities, but the unintentional introduction of microplastics (MPs) into the final output remains unclear. To fully understand the source, distribution, and accumulation of MPs in this process, it is essential to characterize their abundance, distribution, and chemical composition.

MPs were observed on filter membranes using digital microscopy, and particles exhibiting specific characteristics were identified as MPs. The study found that the pretreatment processes, such as shredding machines and biohydrolysis reactors, contribute to the formation of secondary MPs. The study also compared the efficiency of various methods in removing plastic debris and found that screening was the most effective, while biohydrolysis reactors and biomass crushers were more likely to generate secondary MPs.

The study identified common plastic types present in organic waste, such as food packaging bags, plastic bottles, foam boxes, and rope. It also suggested strategies to reduce the risk of MP formation, such as implementing depackaging at the source and using screening and manual sorting processes to reduce plastic debris and the release of MPs.

In summary, the study emphasizes the need for understanding and addressing the formation and distribution of MPs in organic waste treatment processes and proposes methods to mitigate the risk of MP pollution.
