This academic paper discusses the relationship between the chemical organizations of a reaction network and the chemical organizations of its fragments. The hypothesis posits that fragments that can be integrated into a feasible organization of molecules form a feasible organization of fragments. This concept is demonstrated for a specific type of reaction network with the understanding that the fragmentation can be adjusted to make the result applicable to all networks, albeit at the expense of a less coarse-grained fragment system. The paper provides examples that support the hypothesis as well as counterexamples that oppose it, and presents various illustrative examples and potential further research questions.

The paper notes that employing patterns rather than explicitly specifying all molecular species and reactions offers advantages, but also discusses the challenge of reconciling the theory of chemical organizations formulated for reaction-based models with the definition of fragments in rule-based models, and indicates that the paper will switch freely between these models when they describe the same reaction network.

It is suggested that the appropriateness of fragments implies that the fragments present in an organization found in a fixpoint also form an organization of (f, r). The conjecture is put forth that this not only holds true for organizations found in fixpoints, but for all organizations, and such a conjecture is substantiated for a certain class of reaction networks. Both a counterexample and an example are provided to show the validity and potential extension of this result.

Sections 2 and 3 briefly outline the relevant aspects of the theory of organizations and fragments, while section 4 presents a more formal version of the conjecture and its demonstration in a specific case. Section 5 offers examples, and the paper concludes by highlighting the benefits of the results and posing open questions.

The paper specifically demonstrates that, in the case studied, the set of fragments that can be integrated into a feasible organization of molecules forms a feasible organization of fragments. This case is deemed to be possibly the only situation in which a meaningful notion of organizations for the fragments can be found. Additionally, the paper asserts that the acm can always be adjusted to accommodate their results, at the cost of an increased number of fragments.
