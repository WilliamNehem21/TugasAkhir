The academic paper discusses various objective functions used in system performance evaluation, emphasizing the superiority of the integral of absolute error (IAE) objective function over other integral-based alternatives. The paper also describes a process for generating random fractals, which involves creating new particles around an initial point and using a diffusion process to enhance the search for global minima while avoiding local minima. Additionally, the paper outlines an algorithm that utilizes Gaussian random approaches to add diversification properties to this search process.

Furthermore, the paper mentions the selection of integral gains from 25 runs and the subsequent application of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control to fine-tune controller parameters. The paper then introduces a search and fine-tuning algorithm and presents the educational and professional background of the authors, Sasmita Padhy and Sidhartha Panda.
