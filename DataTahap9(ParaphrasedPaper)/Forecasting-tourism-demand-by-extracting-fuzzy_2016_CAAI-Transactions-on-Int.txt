Forecasting tourism demand has attracted significant interest due to the substantial economic impact of the rapidly growing tourism industry. While various quantitative forecasting techniques have been studied, there is still a lack of highly accurate and interpretable forecasting models. This paper introduces a new method for tourism demand forecasting that extracts fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (TES) rules from trained Support Vector Machines (SVMs). By utilizing fuzzy TES models extracted from SVM outputs, the proposed approach demonstrates high forecasting accuracy and provides understandable pre-condition parts for industry practitioners. This method is tested using tourism demand data from Hong Kong SAR, China, and is found to perform comparably with SVMs and achieve better prediction accuracy than other forecasting techniques for most tourist-generating origins. The results indicate that decision makers can easily interpret the extracted fuzzy TES rules, making the approach highly beneficial for tourism market management.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the research background, Section 3 presents the SVMRE approach for tourism demand forecasting, and Section 4 uses the tourism demand forecasting problem in Hong Kong SAR as a case study to evaluate the performance of SVMRE and compare it with other popular techniques for tourism demand forecasting.

The unique nature of the tourism industry emphasizes the importance of accurate forecasts, which call for formal scientific techniques that can unambiguously represent the relationship between demand for travel and its underlying factors. Quantitative tourism demand forecasting models, such as regression and time series techniques, have been used to estimate future values based on past performance. However, these models often face challenges in predicting changes associated with other determining factors.

This study introduces innovations in new fuzzy rule extraction models for SVMs in tourism demand forecasting, providing better generalization ability and comprehensibility compared to existing black-box models. The proposed approach yields accurate forecasting results and facilitates the interpretation of underlying regularities for industry practitioners and policy makers, contributing to effective tourism market management.

The empirical findings of the study demonstrate the applicability and practical significance of the proposed approach, offering valuable insights for policy makers and industry practitioners in the tourism sector.
