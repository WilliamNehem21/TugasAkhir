Definition 2.1 states that a doctrine is a collection of small categories. A d-limit is a limiting cone where the diagram is indexed by a category in d. Similarly, a d-colimit is a colimiting cone where the diagram is indexed by a category in d. We denote the doctrine as dop.

The connection between monoidal actions and enrichment is well-known and has been beneficial in the examination of algebraic theories and principles of computation (e.g., [10, ch. 6]). Proposition 2.7 represents the key step toward our two main theorems.

The equation c(x, y) = v(i, c(x, y)) signifies an enrichment of an ordinary category c in v. An enrichment of an ordinary category c in v is described as a v-enriched category whose underlying ordinary category is c. For instance, if v is a symmetric monoidal closed category, then the closed structure offers an enrichment of v in itself.
