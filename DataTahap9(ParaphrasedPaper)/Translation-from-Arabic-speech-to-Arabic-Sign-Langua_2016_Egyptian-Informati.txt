A significant number of individuals with disabilities live in developing countries, often facing neglect and severe poverty. This study specifically examines the experiences of people in Egypt who have hearing and speaking impairments (deaf and mute). Official statistics indicate that there are 360 million people worldwide with disabling hearing loss, with over 3 million of them located in Egypt. Many deaf individuals in Egypt lack the ability to read or write standard Arabic, and therefore rely on Arabic sign language (ArSL) for communication. However, this form of communication is not understood by hearing individuals, leading to social isolation and difficulties in forming relationships within the deaf community.

The situation in the Arabic region shows a lack of consideration for disabled individuals by the government. For instance, the Egyptian government restricts the translation of news programs into ArSL to only 10 minutes per week and does not allow legislative documents to be translated into ArSL for deaf individuals. Furthermore, assistive technologies for the deaf community in Arabic countries are limited due to the complexity of the Arabic language and ArSL.

To address these challenges, there is a need to develop an automatic machine-based interpreter that can facilitate communication between Arabic-speaking deaf individuals and the wider community. The focus of this paper is on developing a system that converts Arabic speech to ArSL. The system utilizes a set of resource files as a database and was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS) with five users, achieving an average score of 91%. However, the system has limitations, such as relying on a local database with limited storage capacity.

The system's service layer provides two main operations: converting speech to ArSL and translating text encoded in images to ArSL. The system leverages the Microsoft Advanced Technology Lab in Cairo's Arabic Toolkit Service (ATKS), which includes natural language processing components tailored for the Arabic language.

Given the focus on the Egyptian deaf community, the system addresses the challenge of translating colloquial Egyptian text into standard Arabic text to improve efficiency and manage the avatar database effectively. The system has been tested in practical scenarios, such as assisting a deaf individual in recognizing a specific building.

In conclusion, this study highlights the challenges faced by the Egyptian deaf community and presents a system for converting Arabic speech to ArSL. Despite the system's limitations, it represents a step toward addressing communication barriers for deaf individuals in Arabic-speaking countries.
