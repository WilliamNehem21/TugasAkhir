The stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) represents a significant advancement in the field of stochastic modeling of biological systems, as it serves as the basis for all current algorithms for stochastic simulation. It demonstrates that, under certain assumptions, the time to the next occurrence of a biochemical reaction follows a random variable that adheres to a negative exponential distribution. However, meeting the assumptions underlying SSA can be challenging, and modelers must contend with the ramifications of assuming exponentially distributed reactions beyond the intended scope of applicability. This presents an opportunity for exploration through the utilization of generally distributed reaction times.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of BlenX, a programming language inspired by process calculi and designed for modeling biological systems, and discusses the management of general distributions. Section 3 examines the implications of assuming abstract reactions to be exponentially distributed through several increasingly complex biological examples. Finally, Section 4 explores the potential of models incorporating generally distributed reaction times.

The Betawb framework is a computational tool that facilitates textual and visual programming with BlenX. It can be considered an in-silico laboratory where experiments can be designed (i.e., a BlenX program is written), simulated, and analyzed. The stochastic capability of BlenX ensures the quantitative aspect of experiments, akin to a continuous-time Markov process serving as the foundational quantitative model. This section introduces the visual version of BlenX and outlines the formal tools for managing non-Markovian processes.

The paper also provides a tutorial on the BlenX language, detailing its fundamental primitives and events for working with elementary reactions. Additionally, it delves into the application of process calculi theory for supporting general distributions. The challenges introduced by general distributions, which are not memoryless and require tracking the time consumed by each transition, are addressed using counters, ST semantics, and enhanced operational semantics.

Subsequently, the paper discusses the use of general distributions for modeling complex biological systems through case studies and illustrates how the inclusion of generally distributed reaction times can provide more accurate models than assuming every reaction to follow a negative exponential distribution.

Overall, the paper sheds light on the dichotomy between qualitative abstract reactions and the quantitative assumption of elementariness in simulation algorithms like SSA, and presents an extended BlenX modeling language and computational framework that supports general distributions. Additionally, the paper demonstrates how the inclusion of generally distributed reaction times can enhance the fidelity of in-silico models and their correspondence with wet-lab experiments.
