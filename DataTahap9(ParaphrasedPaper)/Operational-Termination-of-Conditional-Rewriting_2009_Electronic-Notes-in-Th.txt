The document illustrates that ensuring the operational termination of a conditional system can be achieved by transforming it into an unconditional system and demonstrating termination in the transformed context. This involves a syntactic conversion akin to that used in conventional conditional rewriting. Additionally, the paper provides methods based on dependency pairs that can be employed in conjunction with the transformation to establish operational termination. The content is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the definition of the rewrite relation, while Section 3 formally defines operational termination and establishes its equivalence with termination for unconditional systems. Section 4 introduces the transformation from conditional to unconditional systems and demonstrates that termination of the transformed system implies operational termination of the original system. The full version of the paper includes the proofs omitted here, along with multiple complex conditional systems for which operational termination can be demonstrated through the transformation presented in the paper and the termination techniques discussed.
