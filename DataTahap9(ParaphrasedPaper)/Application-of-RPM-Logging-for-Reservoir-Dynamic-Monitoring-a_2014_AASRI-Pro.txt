The research demonstrates a correlation between the measured values of ncor and fcor and the lithology and porosity of the formation. Four measured values of ncor and fcor can be acquired for boreholes and formations with pure oil and pure water, respectively. By plotting the fcor and ncor for these conditions, quadrilaterals can be defined in each case, with the width of the quadrilateral being influenced by the lithology and porosity of the formation. In general, all measurement points tend to fall within the quadrilateral area. The values of ncor and fcor are impacted by water holdup in the borehole and formation oil saturation, making the quadrilateral an indicator for determining formation oil saturation and water holdup in the borehole.

Gravel packing is a distinct well structure within offshore M oilfields, predominantly situated in the screen, casing annulus, and perforation tunnel. For instance, in the production string structure in M oilfields, the inner and outer diameters of the borehole annulus section are 15.24cm and 21.1cm, respectively. However, the instrument's detection depth is 21cm, and the logging speed in c/o mode is 0.6m/min, with a vertical resolution of 61cm. Consequently, the measured capture cross section of rpm is influenced by the gravel pack. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate formation parameters and enhance interpretation precision, it is crucial to conduct quantitative corrections for relevant factors. As a result, the author devised a volumetric model to correct formation capture cross sections.
