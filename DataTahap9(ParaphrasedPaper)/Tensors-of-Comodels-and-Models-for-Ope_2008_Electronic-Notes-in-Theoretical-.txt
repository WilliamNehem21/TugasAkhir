The final ls-comodel can be expressed as the set of states, denoted as "s," along with its canonical lookup and update structure, as implied by theorem 3.4 and corollary 3.5. Assuming the evident definition of enriched(loc,v)array, corollary 3.5 further extends this characterization routinely.

In this section, we proceed to compute the tensor for two additional examples: global state and monoid actions. Similar to the scenario of read-only state, we are interested in combinations with other theories using tensor, and with exceptions using summation. Our calculations once again extend routinely.

In the preceding sections, comodels of three primary theories - ls, lr, and lm - have been considered. However, it is possible to have more than one of these theories acting simultaneously, for example, by using triples (s, t, m) consisting of a state s, a time t, and a term m. Thus, in this section, we explore a tensorial combination of comodels and its interaction with the tensor with models.
