The anticipated operational lifespans of tangible systems such as oil and gas production networks may span several years, with the potential for hundreds of flow sources (e.g., oil production wells) and thousands of components. Analyzing numerous alternative design layouts within a short timeframe is crucial for optimizing production performance in such systems.

The transient output of the system, subjected to stochastic pruning with probabilities pk(t) at time t, is denoted as qp(t). The expected value of the transient outputs qp(t) for n stochastically pruned systems (with probabilities pk(t)) is calculated as the expected value of the momentary maximum throughput flow, obtained by dividing the accumulated sum of momentary flows by the number of stochastically pruned systems. Upon completion of each simulation trial, the flow capacities of failed components are reinstated to their original levels. The proposed algorithm is straightforward, efficient, and eliminates the need for constructing a discrete-event simulator to assess production availability.

To expedite the transfer of parameters between different edges or nodes, a copy/paste function has been provided. Additionally, functions for zooming, panning, autoarranging, and saving and loading of flow networks are available. Users can view and list attributes of edges and nodes on the screen, and easily delete or add nodes and edges to the network to achieve the desired topology.

An important use of the fast production availability algorithm and the accompanying software tool is in promptly comparing the performance of competing network topologies and selecting the topology with the optimal performance, considering factors such as number of components, spare capacity, etc., which render the throughput flow less susceptible to component failures.
