The examination conducted using existing tools indicates that even simple examples cannot be efficiently resolved, necessitating approximations to reduce the number of variables in the formulas, which is the primary cause of computational time growth. The study explores standard approximation methods based on Taylor polynomials and ad-hoc strategies to address this issue and demonstrates their effectiveness through the repressilator case study.

The paper begins by addressing the effectiveness of bounded reachability computation on semi-algebraic hybrid automata, exemplifying the type of approximations required to manage complexity. The work distinguishes between space and time discretizations, opting to leverage tools allowing approximate computations over the reals, such as rsolver and eclipse, while emphasizing the need for space approximations separating continuous variables. The importance of time discretization and Taylor polynomials in their approach is also highlighted.

The paper is structured as follows: a brief overview of the state of the art in Section 1, followed by an introduction to semi-algebraic hybrid automata and reachability in Section 2. The core of the work is outlined in Section 3, with the application of the analysis to the repressilator case study presented in Section 4. The paper concludes with a discussion in Section 5.

Semi-algebraic hybrid automata intrinsically integrate syntactic restrictions and semantic approximations. The use of Taylor polynomials to approximate a wide range of hybrid automata is discussed, along with an approximation technique proposed by Lanotte and Tini that leverages Taylor polynomials. The paper also explores the use of cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) algorithms to reason on semi-algebraic hybrid automata, underlying the abstractions and analysis techniques presented.

Hybrid automata exhibit mixed discrete and continuous behavior, represented by a graph for the discrete component and a set of continuous variables for the continuous component. For each node of the discrete graph, there are invariant conditions and dynamic laws over the continuous variables, with the dynamic law potentially dependent on the initial conditions.

As the reachability problem cannot be straightforwardly solved, the paper discusses the introduction of approximations. The use of the rsolver tool in place of qepcad b for the reachability problem is explored, with the aim of addressing the challenges outlined in a specific example. However, this approach is found to be less effective than the previous one.

In analyzing two models, it is observed that the model derived from the S-system fails to capture the oscillatory behavior of the repressilator, attributed to the introduced approximations for simulation. Conversely, the other model proves to be less sensitive to approximation, allowing the observation of protein concentration oscillations. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between the discrete and continuous parts of biological system models from the outset. Hybrid automata facilitate this distinction, ultimately leading to simpler dynamics in each discrete location, which are less susceptible to the necessary approximations for formal analysis.
