The design of product models effectively conveys semantic information to a certain degree, and the characteristics of product form play a crucial role in communicating product semantics. Users perceive products through their shape, which activates short-term memory matching the experiences and knowledge stored in long-term memory, thus forming individual perceptual intentions towards the product. However, these intentions are often vague and difficult to quantify. To address this, we introduce language as a variable in describing perceptual intentions based on fuzzy theory, converting fuzzy language information into numerical values to enable quantitative analysis.

The output results of the experiment's common degrees form are presented in Chart 2. "Initial" indicates the initial common degrees of each variable quantity, all set at a value of 1. "Extraction" represents the regenerated common degrees after factor extraction, showing the information ratios of the extracted factors. It is observed that all variables' information ratios after extraction exceed 0.5, and that eight variables' extracted information ratios are above 0.7 or very close to it.

The load value of the principal component, referred to as the correlation coefficient in the factor component matrix, indicates a higher relevance if greater than 0.5. This signifies which original variables the composite indicator better represents. By adhering to the principle that the variables represented by the two axes should not overlap, we label the horizontal axis in the negative direction for characteristics such as finesse, softness, simplicity, and user-friendliness; and in the positive direction for roughness, rigidity, complexity, and mechanical attributes. Similarly, we label the longitudinal axis in the positive direction for attributes like being public, friendly, quiet, traditional, and rustic; and in the negative direction for traits such as personality, apathy, dynamism, modernity, and luxury.

Analyzing the distribution of the dots, it is observed that the Volkswagen Beetle, represented by delicate, soft, simple, and user-friendly variables, is located at the endpoint in the negative direction of the horizontal axis. The prototype of the Beetle, designed by a German designer in the 1930s, reflects a personalized model recognized by the public. Conversely, the General Motors Cadillac CTS, denoted by the rough, cold, complex, and mechanical variables, is positioned at the endpoint in the positive direction of the horizontal axis.

The design of automobile product appearance has garnered increasing attention in our country. However, problems persist in the design process, with designers relying on their feelings rather than conducting scientific and systematic analyses of user demands, which presents an underlying challenge. This paper utilizes statistics, psychology, and social science research theories and methods to produce a perceptual image profile based on the car's morphology, constructing mental models of users. By introducing a scientific and effective product value data analysis method, it lays a foundation for future automobile appearance designs.
