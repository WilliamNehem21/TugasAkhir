Investigating multiple genes concurrently has provided profound insights into the classification of cancer. This approach has generated a substantial volume of data ripe for exploration and has found diverse applications spanning drug discovery, cancer prognosis, and diagnosis, thereby addressing a crucial need in cancer care. Additionally, it aids in understanding gene functionality and the interactions between genes in both normal and abnormal states by monitoring gene behavior, specifically gene expression data under varying conditions.

This paper introduces an effective ensemble approach for cancer classification, emphasizing that ensemble classifiers not only improve classification performance, but also enhance result confidence. The use of ensemble classifiers is motivated by their reduced reliance on specificities of a single training set and their ability to outperform the best base classifier within the ensemble.

The level of gene expression represents the quantity of RNA produced in a cell under differing biological circumstances. During the process of cell division, if cells are affected by diseases such as cancer or malignant tumors, leading to gene alterations or mutations, the uncontrollable gene behavior is inherited by daughter cells.

The substantial advancement of DNA microarray technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of gene expression levels for thousands of genes in specific experimental settings. This technological progress has enabled a deeper understanding of molecular life and the generation of large-scale gene expression data. Furthermore, it has facilitated analytical insights through rapid and accurate analysis of extensive gene data using various statistical and machine learning processes.

A standard technique involves transcribing mRNA from two cells, reverse transcribing both into cDNA, and labeling with fluorescent dyes (red for cancerous and green for benign). The labeled cDNA is distributed over the entire microarray to hybridize with their corresponding cDNA. The resulting hybridization serves as an indicator of gene presence. The slide is then scanned to obtain numerical intensities of each dye, which can be manipulated using image processing techniques. By comparing intensity levels for a gene under different experimental conditions, gene expression can be monitored.

The preprocessing module readies the dataset for manipulation, involving essential procedures such as filtering, thresholding, logarithmic transformation, and data normalization before actual classification takes place. This reduces error estimation variance and sometimes bias. Unlike cross-validation, bolstered resubstitution error makes use of the entire available data by generating artificial test samples based on the training set, proving to be more accurate and faster than traditional estimation techniques.

The proposed system employs three different feature selection algorithms for selecting gene subsets: wrappers, filters, and embedded methods. Lastly, the ensemble classification process culminates in the majority voting module, which combines predictions made by ensemble member classifiers to produce a final decision.

In conclusion, this work presents promising results when tested against benchmark cancer datasets, showing improved error rates, Bayesian credible intervals, and area under the curve (AUC) measurements compared to existing approaches.
