This paper focuses on the practical and innovative aspects of support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, particularly in the context of transductive learning. The study highlights the continuous development of SVM and emphasizes the need to address complex classification problems in the context of finite samples. The proposed algorithm, named transductive support vector machine based on spectral clustering (TSVMSC), aims to improve classifier performance effectively by leveraging transductive learning principles.

The article discusses the development of a new transductive learning algorithm, building upon existing methods. It introduces a TSVMSC algorithm that is designed based on the characteristics of SVM classification and leverages spectral clustering to cluster similar non-labeled samples. The algorithm then assigns the same label to samples within the same cluster and utilizes transductive learning to carry out classification. The utilization of spectral clustering allows for the effective extraction of priori distribution information from the unlabeled samples, resulting in improved performance of the TSVMSC algorithm.

Section 2 provides an overview of transductive learning and outlines the TSVM classification algorithm presented by Joachims. The paper then presents the TSVMSC algorithm, detailing the processes involved, and subsequently presents experimental results and analysis in section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests further research directions.

The TSVMSC algorithm's approach involves clustering similar unlabeled samples based on spectral clustering, labeling samples within the same cluster, and applying transductive support vector machine learning on all samples. The algorithm is shown to avoid the need for initial estimation of the ratio between positive and negative labeled samples and effectively leverages the spectral clustering algorithm to mine priori distribution information. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy achieved by the TSVMSC algorithm.
