A hybrid cloud infrastructure refers to the combination of two or more distinct clouds, such as private, community, or public clouds, which are interconnected using standardized or proprietary technologies to facilitate data and application portability. For example, this may involve using cloud bursting for load-balancing between different clouds.

Additionally, Tap-as-a-Service (TaaS) extends the functionality of the OpenStack networking service (Neutron) by providing remote port mirroring capabilities for virtual networks used by tenants. This service is designed to assist tenants or cloud administrators in debugging complex virtual networks and gaining visibility into their virtual machines by monitoring the associated network traffic. TaaS respects tenant boundaries and allows mirror sessions to span across multiple computing and network nodes. It is a crucial infrastructure component that can provide data to various network analytics and security applications.

To establish the parameters for our simulation model, we referred to existing literature which discusses the causes of latency in optical fiber metro networks and various techniques for reducing latency. This includes the use of different chromatic dispersion compensation methods, low-latency amplifiers, optical fibers, and other network elements. The paper evaluates the performance of the networking environment, specifically in the context of the widely used cloud infrastructure management platform, OpenStack. It provides insights into how OpenStack handles multitenant network virtualization and assesses the performance of its main network components by measuring packet throughput in an experimental testbed. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the integration of software-defined networking (SDN) solutions and OpenStack, considering the architecture of the OpenStack networking module (Neutron), communication plugins for SDN, and different types of SDN controllers. The paper also presents an experimental model of SDN-OpenStack integration and measures various characteristics of this solution, such as delay and the maximum amount of UDP and TCP flows. The impact of virtual networks on latency in a public cloud based on OpenStack is measured by assessing the throughput of virtual machines while simultaneously capturing their packets on hosts.

The chosen modeling approach is based on a modular multiformalism modeling technique, utilizing Petri nets (PN) and queuing networks (QN). The high-level model involves the composition of functional blocks with internal behaviors and input and output ports, which may be connected to multiple output and input ports from other blocks using connectors. The semantics of connectors and ports allow for the convergence of packet traffic from multiple connectors on an output port to a single input port. Further details about this modeling approach are beyond the scope of this paper.
