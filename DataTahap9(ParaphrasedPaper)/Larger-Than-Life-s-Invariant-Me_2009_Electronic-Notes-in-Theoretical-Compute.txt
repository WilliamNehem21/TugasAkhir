Can a rule be identified that has the property where any seed growing on a background of 0's will either shrink and eventually vanish or grow indefinitely, filling the entire designated area with 1's or a pattern of 1's with less than full density? Several rules with these characteristics have been tentatively identified through empirical observation, but further evidence is needed to confirm whether they truly exhibit these properties.
