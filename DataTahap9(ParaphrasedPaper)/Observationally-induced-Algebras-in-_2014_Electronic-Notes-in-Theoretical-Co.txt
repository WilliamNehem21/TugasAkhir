In this study, we explore the use of the observationally-induced free algebra approach to build computational monads in the classical domain theory categories. Our investigation demonstrates that the free algebra construction is applicable to all finitary algebraic signatures and computational prototypes. Additionally, we analyze the classical powerdomain constructions within the observationally-induced approach. We find that the hoare, smyth, and probabilistic powerdomain constructions can be retrieved using established results, while the plotkin powerdomain presents some challenges. Specifically, we show that the classical plotkin powerdomain cannot be obtained using the obvious prototype algebra, known as Heckmann's algebra A.

We then proceed to investigate the extent to which the observationally-induced approach can recover the classical powerdomain constructions. We begin with the hoare, smyth, and extended probabilistic powerdomains. The results for the hoare and smyth powerdomains have been previously developed in a topological setting (as described in [3,4]), and the proof strategy remains consistent for the cases under consideration. Consequently, we omit the proofs, assuming that readers can refer to the original sources for details. Regarding the extended probabilistic powerdomain, the necessary technical aspects are largely derived from the work of Tix, and we provide brief hints for the corresponding proofs in this scenario.
