Throughout the remainder of this paper, we will outline the underlying physical principles that underpin this research (section 2), provide a straightforward hybrid thermostat model as an illustration of our approach (section 3), employ informal mathematics to elucidate the key concepts in our model's analysis (section 4), use the Coq theorem prover to conduct a formal analysis of the model (section 5), and conclude the paper with a summary of our findings (section 6).

While the act of applying a heat pulse when the temperature falls below a threshold represents a relatively simple thermostat behavior, we interpret it as an example of digital control logic integrated with physical dynamics, which could be extended to more intricate scenarios. Even this uncomplicated thermostat embodies the difficulties previously highlighted: establishing a well-posed causal form for modeling the cyber-physical system and accommodating uncertainty in analog-to-digital conversion.

In our context, the integral component for tj > ti disappears due to the causality-enforcing step function in g, and the function q refers to the thermal forcing term, which in our case is a summation of heat pulses. Per our convention, any discrete forcing event precisely at time tj should be included in the integral, as it is not already accounted for in t(tj). Thus far, we have taken advantage of the linearity of the thermal dynamics concerning q when considered as an external forcing.

The proof incorporates a four-way case analysis, as described in section 4, with each case resolved through the application of a supporting lemma (e.g., the heating at time n keeps the temperature above). The statements of the four lemmas (provided below, with the proof details omitted) correspond to the conditions outlined in the informal proof.
