Most current simplified mathematical models of photosynthesis address various aspects of the entire process, particularly focusing on the dynamics of light reactions and the transfer of energy from light to the cell through interactions within protein complexes. To facilitate the development and practical application of advanced formal methods in this field, we have established an online repository for mathematical models of photosynthesis, prompting the exploration of diverse levels of available models and the challenge of representing them in a single expressive formalism.

In our practical work, we utilize the bionetgen language (BNGL) and related tools to implement the models, automating the reduction procedure with Python. By applying reductions to the considered models, we showcase the capability of a process-algebraic framework to compactly represent complex systems of light reactions. While rule-based modeling has numerous applications, it is scarcely utilized in the context of photosynthesis. We introduce a rule-based approach for modeling chlorophyll a fluorescence induction kinetics, including a stochastic simulation algorithm that accounts for the diverse context in which context-free rules apply. This approach is particularly valuable as it reflects the modulation of electron transfer rates by aggregation of protein complex modifications within the photosystem.

In the BNGL framework, molecules are specified similarly to the simplified kappa, with rules described using the "lhs->rhs" notation. Additionally, we explore the elimination of rules from a model and the process of systematically searching for compressed models through syntactic operations. Photosynthesis, being adaptable to heterogeneous environments and fluctuating light conditions, presents a challenge for modeling. We demonstrate the unsuitability of traditional reaction-based modeling approaches for capturing the full mechanistic complexity of photosynthesis and advocate for the use of rule-based modeling to avoid oversimplifying assumptions.

Furthermore, we present a case study where we succeeded in significantly reducing the size of models by employing intuitive syntactic operations. This reduction resulted in models that are more representative of the original ideas and are easier to modify and extend. Importantly, our work highlights the advantages of rule-based modeling in representing the intricate processes of photosynthesis without relying on simplifications.
