This paper is situated in the context of natural computing, specifically focusing on the investigation of cells as living organisms capable of processing and generating information. Building on this foundation, the literature highlights two distinct disciplines within natural computing: membrane computing and brane calculi.

In recent years, various models of p systems have been introduced, with a particular emphasis on cell-like membrane structures facilitating communication between adjacent membranes. A common feature among these models is the presence of nested membranes, forming a tree-like graph of neighborhood relations.

A key area of interest in this field is the exploration of the computational capabilities and efficiency of p systems. Notably, different variants of these cell-like p systems have been effectively deployed to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, leveraging parallelism to simultaneously evaluate multiple candidate solutions. Modeled after biological processes observed in living cells, the generation of new membranes in cell-like p systems is abstracted from two sources: mitosis (membrane division) and autopoiesis (membrane creation). These processes have led to the development of two corresponding p systems models: p systems with active membranes, where new workspace is produced through membrane division, and p systems with membrane creation, where new membranes are generated from objects.

While both models are computationally universal, they are technically distinct and currently lack a theoretical proof demonstrating their mutual simulation in polynomial time. Under the assumption of the complexity class P/NP=P, Zandron et al. have delineated the constraints involved.

Additionally, this paper delves into another category of p systems known as tissue p systems, named for their membrane structure. Unlike the hierarchical arrangement of membranes in cell-like p systems, tissue p systems position membranes at the nodes of a graph. This variation draws inspiration from two biological mechanisms: intercellular communication and cooperation between neurons. A common mathematical model for both mechanisms involves a network of processors managing symbols and communicating them along predetermined channels. The communication between cells is governed by symport/antiport rules, where symport rules transport objects across membranes in one direction, while antiport rules move objects in opposite directions.

Since the seminal definition of tissue p systems, several research directions have emerged, leading to the development of various related variants. Notably, a noteworthy variant of tissue p systems, combining features from tissue p systems and p systems with active membranes, was presented in a previous paper.

As customary in the framework of membrane computing, rules are applied in a maximally parallel manner. In each step, an object in a membrane can only be utilized for one rule (chosen non-deterministically if multiple possibilities exist), and every object capable of participating in a rule must do so, resulting in the application of a maximal set of rules. There is one restriction on the application of rules when a cell is divided: the division rule is the exclusive rule applied for that cell in that step, and the objects inside that cell do not evolve during that step.
