Various mechanisms, such as gear boxes, chains, and screw couplings, enable precise control to be achieved, making linear motors a common choice for high-performance CNC machine tools. The vector control system of permanent magnet synchronous linear motors provides not only high-precision control and dynamic performance, but also offers the convenience of speed adjustment, attracting increasing attention from scholars worldwide. An experiment was conducted to build a model of the vector control system of PMSLM using Matlab software, which can aid in designing and operating the actual system effectively.

To evaluate the validity of the simulation model, a simulation experiment was carried out using Matlab 7.1 software. Due to the presence of nonlinear components, the experiment utilized the ode23td algorithm, which is a variable-step method, with a relative error and absolute error set at 0.001. The parameters of the PMSLM were as follows: phase resistance (r) = 3.2, axis inductance (Ld) = 8mH, q-axis inductance (Lq) = 8mH, and the flux of the permanent magnet.

In an AC servo control system, speed, accuracy, and stability are the primary performance indices for assessing efficiency. Simulation results indicate that when a speed command is given, the PMSLM can achieve the desired speed by adjusting the speed loop and current loop, and the rate response curves in the time domain show favorable outcomes. The speed loop simulation system operates smoothly and demonstrates excellent dynamic and static performance. The experiment fully validates the correctness of the PMSLM mathematical model and the feasibility of the control algorithm, providing insights for further design and adjustment of the direct drive system.
