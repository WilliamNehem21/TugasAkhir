The core idea behind the K framework is the recognition that computation naturally lends itself to rewriting. K draws inspiration from the rewriting logic semantics project, which aims to unify algebraic denotational semantics and operational semantics by treating them as different perspectives on the same object. Specifically, denotational semantics views the rewriting logic specification of a language as a designated model, while operational semantics focuses on the execution of the same specification.

In Section 2, the paper introduces an infrastructure for the K specification of analysis and verification methods for pushdown systems. It discusses the K representation of pushdown systems, leveraging it for deriving the analysis and verification infrastructure. Additionally, the paper proposes the consideration of pushdown systems and their K specifications.

The research language, introduced in prior work, incorporates several bisimilar semantics. The paper presents the K specification of one of these semantics, which emphasizes the versatility of K in algorithm formulation.

Next, the paper outlines a technique for specifying pushdown systems in K through abstraction. It establishes a framework for the K specification of finite pushdown systems and explains how to transform an infinite pushdown system into the K specification of a finite pushdown system through abstraction.

Building on previous results, the paper discusses infinite paths in finite pushdown systems, highlighting lasso-shaped paths and outlining the use of predefined K sorts and cells to guide rewriting and execute a breadth-first strategy. The paper emphasizes the need for fairness conditions to ensure the monotonicity of the fixpoint iteration.

The paper then considers the K specification for the semantics of a language and a program, emphasizing the stack-like behavior of K-cells and the control location maintained by memory and program cells. It notes restrictions such as the requirement for matching in the K cell to always occur at the top.

The finiteness of pushdown systems produced for a program with a K specification is discussed in relation to analysis and verification methods. The paper explains that infinite pushdown systems can be handled using abstract interpretation and finite projections to achieve the desired results. It describes how control locations of a pushdown system can be coerced into a finite frame through a meta-operator, aligning with the perspective of abstract interpretation for state abstractions.
