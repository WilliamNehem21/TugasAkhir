In pa, the leave-function should be executed for all profiles, and in pb, the enter-function should be executed for all profiles. An additional consideration of the overhead of the real-time operating system (RTOS) due to context switches, denoted as wos, is added. With this in mind, the definition for the worst-case execution time (WCET) for reconf(ca, cb) can be expressed.

In the realm of dynamic-priority scheduling, various scheduling algorithms allow for task parameter adjustments during runtime. Many of these algorithms focus on modifying a single resource, such as CPU utilization, by adjusting task periods. For instance, elastic scheduling treats tasks as springs with specific elastic coefficients to better adapt to actual load conditions. In rate-based scheduling, the earliest execution time of a task can be altered at runtime. The scheduler is built upon a generalized real-time scheduling model known as resource allocation/dispatching (RAD), which separates the management of resource allocation to each task from the timing of resource delivery. Our flexible resource manager employs a similar internal separation, where constraints on resource allocation amount and timing constraints are independently verified.
