Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are extensively utilized in a variety of applications, including medical treatment, battlefield operations, industrial monitoring, and threat detection. However, a significant issue in WSNs is the maintenance of sensor nodes, as most of them rely on battery power. These sensor nodes are often deployed in challenging and hard-to-access environments, resulting in limited battery life. Additionally, the deployment of a large number of wireless sensing devices for purposes such as temperature and humidity sensing necessitates the need for efficient energy management techniques such as energy harvesting.

The second section of the paper discusses previous research on techniques to prolong the lifetime of sensor nodes and enhance long-range charging in WSNs. Section 3 outlines the design of a drone model based on magnetic resonance coupling (MRC). Section 4 introduces the MRCRLB architecture and its technical specifications. The results and discussion following the implementation of the proposed model on various modulation schemes are presented in section 5. The paper concludes in section 6.

Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the choice of an appropriate modulation scheme depends on the specific application and parameters in WSNs. Furthermore, the paper proposes the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on magnetic coupling for recharging and load balancing to extend the lifetime of sensor networks. The MRCRLB model offers the advantages of power regeneration and load balancing. The paper suggests that the proposed model, when tested on real-world scenarios, could enhance the lifetime of WSNs. The feasibility of the proposed model with different modulation schemes, such as BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM, was examined. Simulation outcomes in NS2 indicated that the 64QAM modulation scheme is not suitable for rechargeable sensor nodes, while QPSK is the optimal solution for the average delay parameter in small network sizes. However, as the network size increases, BPSK and 16QAM become more efficient. Additionally, the paper suggests that the choice of modulation scheme for wireless rechargeable sensor networks should be based on the network size and the specific parameter being considered. Notably, BPSK appears to be the best fit for both small and large network sizes, particularly in terms of the number of packet drops.
