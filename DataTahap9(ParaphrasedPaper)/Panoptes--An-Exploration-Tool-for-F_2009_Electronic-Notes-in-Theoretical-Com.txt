Proof assistants assist users in proving mathematical theorems by handling the intricate reasoning details. Typically, their user interfaces display proof information as text, which can become challenging to comprehend as the proof size increases. However, Panoptes is a software tool designed to address this issue. It enables users to explore graphic representations of formal proofs created by the IMPS interactive mathematical proof system. Panoptes automatically presents IMPS deduction graphs as visual graphs that users can easily manipulate. Its features include target zooming, floating information boxes, node relabeling, and collapsing of substructures.

Named after the all-seeing giant of Greek mythology, Panoptes is a software system for examining the proof structures generated by the IMPS interactive mathematical proof system. These proof structures are specific types of graphs called deduction graphs. Panoptes automatically displays IMPS deduction graphs as visual graphs that can be manipulated by the user. While Panoptes is tailored to work with IMPS, it emphasizes features that would be beneficial for various other proof assistants. This paper outlines the functionalities provided by Panoptes and provides an overview of its implementation.

Panoptes offers "target zooming," enabling users to zoom in and out on specific parts of the graph by pointing with the mouse and holding a button, a departure from the standard zooming process that often causes user confusion and disorientation. It also maintains a comprehensive history of operations applied to a deduction graph, allowing users to easily revert to a previous graph arrangement and preserve the effort made in rearranging the graph between proof steps, as IMPS only adds new nodes but never removes nodes from the deduction graph.

The tool provides automatic layout and the ability for users to manually rearrange the deduction graph. Upon startup, Panoptes provides an initial graph layout that fits the screen space and minimizes edge crossings. Users can drag and drop graph components to improve or modify the layout, with the program automatically preserving connections between nodes. Additionally, Panoptes performs automatic labeling and numbering of repetitions, with repeated nodes, collapsed inference nodes, and grounded nodes displayed in distinct colors for better visualization.

Moreover, a Java-based interactive symbolic visualization system offers formal proofs produced by the ACL2 theorem prover as cone-shaped three-dimensional graphs, allowing users to rotate the visualization to view all angles and open detached information windows about the nodes using colors to differentiate between nodes rather than labels.
