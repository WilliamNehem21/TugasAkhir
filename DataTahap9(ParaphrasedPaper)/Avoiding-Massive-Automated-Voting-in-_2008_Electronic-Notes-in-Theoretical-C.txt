Nowadays, the significance of internet polls is increasing, and they are being utilized on a large scale. One of the most challenging issues in web surveys is ensuring the security of the polls. This paper introduces an innovative approach that enhances the security of internet polls and the reliability of their results by distinguishing between votes cast by humans and those cast by machines. The method used to achieve this goal, its security properties, and the testing results on a functioning prototype are outlined. Additionally, a public challenge is proposed to further assess the performance and robustness of the solution from a security perspective.

Online polls are web-based surveys used to gather public opinion on specific topics. As with other web applications, online polls are vulnerable to various attacks, with the most significant concern being the manipulation of poll results through automated voting programs (bots) that simulate human users to cast multiple votes.

To address these security concerns, a novel approach is proposed that presents poll voting options into a runtime-generated and heavily degraded image in different rows. This order-based method offers greater security compared to cookie-based methods and is less restrictive than IP locking schemes. However, it has been noted that textual captchas have security weaknesses, and it is possible to bypass the protection scheme by focusing on the different lengths of choice strings rather than extracting the full text from the image.

The inadequacy of captcha-based protection schemes in distinguishing between humans and computers has led to the development of a new technique based on human ability to recognize objects depicted in previously unseen images. By leveraging this ability, the proposed approach effectively differentiates between humans and automated programs, thereby preventing unauthorized alteration of poll results.

The envisioned scheme is designed to be inclusive, allowing multiple human users sharing the same IP address to participate in a poll. Each voting session is treated separately, enabling simultaneous voting by multiple users using the same workstation. However, if a voter repeatedly fails the test, their IP address is locked, preventing access to the poll. The scheme also accommodates visually impaired individuals by offering an audio security challenge.

The scheme utilizes a large database containing a wide variety of images belonging to numerous categories, making it difficult for automated programs to classify the database content. The system applies various transformations to selected images, such as resizing, rotation, and color modifications, to thwart attacks based on image recognition.

In addition, the approach associates multiple categories with a single picture, ensuring that users are presented with different images when asked to recognize a specific object. A sophisticated similarity-based attack, which relies on exploiting visual image similarities to guess the correct category, is countered by the proposed approach.

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, a prototype was developed and subjected to extensive testing, including simulations of common voting bot attacks and a wider internet open challenge. The scheme, embedded directly within the poll page, is based on the inability of modern computers to accurately recognize concepts expressed by images and audio streams.

In summary, the picture-based scheme is a novel solution aimed at preventing automatic and mass manipulation of internet poll results, addressing security concerns associated with existing protection methods. Its fairness, robustness, and resistance to image classification make it a promising approach for ensuring the integrity of online surveys while facilitating integration into internet portals and web pages for enhanced visibility and accessibility.
