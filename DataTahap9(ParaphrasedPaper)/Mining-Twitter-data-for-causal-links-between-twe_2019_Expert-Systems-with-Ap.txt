Identifying customer feedback has the potential to help business decision makers comprehend the feedback contributing to positive or negative consumer experiences. Researchers such as Chang, Chou, Wu, Wu (2017) and Lim, Tucker (2017) have highlighted the significance of customer feedback extraction from textual data, which is an emerging area of study. For instance, Wang, Youn, Azarm, and Kannan (2011) have proposed a systematic method to extract customer data from web-based user-generated content for product design selection. Additionally, Yan, Xing, Zhang, and Ma (2015) have introduced a novel method for ranking candidate terms in online customer reviews to automatically identify enterprise attributes that capture customer interest. Furthermore, Zhou, Jiao, and Linsey (2015) have put forward a sentiment analysis and a case analogical reasoning model for extracting enterprise attributes and latent customer needs from online consumer reviews.

In a related context, Nguyen, Shirai, and Velcin (2015) have conducted an analysis of sentiment in topics extracted from social media networks using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) for the purpose of stock market prediction. Similarly, Ho, Damien, Gu, and Konana (2017) have investigated the potential dynamic relationship between sentiment expressed on social media networks and future stock returns to predict product market adoption and product sales.

Moreover, in this work, Liu and Bahadori (2012) have emphasized that time series are stationary in each sub-interval, as detailed in section 3.2. The research does not set the time lag (l) to zero, considering that it is established that there is a time delay in enterprise outcome responses, such as stock price responses to news or events (Hou & Moskowitz, 2005). This is relevant to the study's goal of predicting future enterprise outcomes.
