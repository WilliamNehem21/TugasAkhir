The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the fundamental concepts underlying the definition of the language, while Sections 3.1 and 3.2 introduce the syntax and the operational semantics. Section 4 elaborates on the detailed model of osmosis, and Section 5 presents final conclusions and outlines potential future research directions.

To accurately model passive or active transport, it is necessary to calculate the rate at which molecules enter or exit the cell or membrane, which is dependent on the concentration and pressure. These quantities are determined by the concentration of different substances inside and outside the membrane, requiring the incorporation of context-dependent rates in the model.

In the development of a calculus for membranes and cells, volume is a critical parameter that can impact reaction rates. Cells are known to alter their volumes during processes such as the cell cycle or when taking in or losing water from the environment, but there is a physical limit to volume variation within cells.

In the communication primitives, inputs are binding operators on the arguments, such that the name y is bound in the process local n(y).p and not accessible from outside p. Similar considerations apply to other inputs in the communication primitives. The definition of free names of channels in p, denoted as fn(p), and bound names of p, denoted as bn(p), is standard, taking into account the only binding operators are inputs and restriction. The notation p{y/m} is used to represent the substitution of every occurrence of the name y by m in p, and similarly, p{a/q} denotes the substitution of every occurrence of the process a by q in p.

A specific functional form for the rates was not provided in the preceding discussion. Rate functions can vary from simple constant functions to highly complex functions of the environment, and they are determined by the programmer in accordance with the model under study, offering significant flexibility to the language. The subsequent section will illustrate this flexibility through an exploration of osmosis.

The general functional form of rates equips the language with the capability to integrate analytic information in a process-based calculus, which has been leveraged in the context of osmosis to create a more realistic model of water flow. This feature has straightforward applications in the modeling of ion transportation into and out of a cell, and it can also be used to abstract certain aspects of the model by describing them in the functional rates. For instance, the kinetics of a simple enzymatic reaction can be abstracted, neglecting the formation of the substrate-enzyme complex, using a Michaelis-Menten form for the rate.
