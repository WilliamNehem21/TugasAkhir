The task involves determining the key and encrypting message m using this key. The resulting ciphered message cm(k) is intended for transmission through a network. The aim is to understand the security guarantees when injecting cm(k) into the network, particularly in the context of timed-release mechanisms.

Weighted timed automata, an extension of timed automata that incorporates costs associated with locations and transitions, were introduced in prior work. The objective was to provide a performance measure for the finite outcomes of timed automata. In this model, the cost of staying at a location per unit of time and the cost of taking a discrete transition are represented as the weight of a location and the weight of a switch, respectively. Consequently, a cost is assigned to each run as the sum of the costs of the taken switches and the time spent in each location. This enables the association of a linear-cost function of time with each run, reflecting the visited locations and transitions.

A network can be naturally represented as a timed automaton, with nodes as locations and message sending and receiving actions as transitions. Time-related aspects of network behavior, such as traffic delay and processing time, can be captured using clocks, resets, and clock constraints. Moreover, weights can be utilized to express the computational speed of each node. The minimum time required to reach a specific target location was addressed in previous work, along with the computation of lower and upper bounds on time delays. Minimum-time reachability and the related minimum-time control problem were also investigated. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the main concepts of timed-release cryptography and introduces the security problem at hand; Section 3 provides a recap of weighted timed automata and presents the relevant notation; Section 4 presents the proposed solution to the time-bounded reachability problem for weighted timed automata; and finally, Section 5 offers some concluding remarks.

The solution involves reformulating the problem as a decision problem for a particular class of automata, known as time-cost bounded reachability, and developing an algorithm with exponential time complexity. Given the computational complexity of reachability in standard timed automata, it is improbable that this problem has a sub-exponential solution since it is proven to be PSPACE-hard. In certain scenarios, it is assumed that the message recipient can only control a subset of network nodes and consequently routes the message to these specific nodes rather than others. This scenario can be modeled using a two-player game on a weighted timed automaton to identify a winning strategy for the recipient.
