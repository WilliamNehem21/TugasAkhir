Indicators across technological, economic, governmental, and institutional domains of global integration are impacted by wireless communications. Given the growing demand for wireless communication services, it is essential to ensure seamless coverage and capacity, which in turn necessitates the integration of alternative spectrum due to congested radio frequencies caused by technological advancements and increased population density. Moreover, the provision of infrastructure for high-speed wireless communication becomes imperative as demand rises.

In the realm of visible light communication (VLC), the transmission of signals in the visible spectrum presents unique challenges that require innovative processing and channel estimation techniques, particularly in the context of dimming controls. Notably, the history of dimming control technology is explored in order to ensure clear communication in dimly lit environments. Analogue dimming, which employs continuous current reduction (CCR) technology, is used to modulate LED lighting, although it results in alterations to the chromaticity and potential noise interference.

Efforts have been directed towards addressing these challenges, with the development of novel solutions such as digital pulse-width modulation (PWM) and pulse-position modulation (PPM) to facilitate consistent communication links in dimly lit settings. Additionally, techniques such as discrete cosine orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) have been applied for dimming control in VLC. New modulation technologies, such as reduced power offset OFDM (RPO-OFDM), have been proposed to address issues related to dimming control, offering high power efficiency and improved distribution of power which make them suitable for conventional approaches.

Moreover, simulations were conducted to study the impact of dimming controls on bit error rate (BER) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with findings demonstrating the superiority of RPO-OFDM in terms of power efficiency and distribution compared to other modulation schemes such as ACO-OFDM and DCO-OFDM. Furthermore, it was found that with a PWM duty cycle of 35%, the RPO-OFDM modulated data required a 14 dB higher SNR to achieve a BER of 10-3 compared to a 50% PWM pulse. These results highlight the potential of RPO-OFDM as a promising solution for addressing the challenges of VLC dimming control.
