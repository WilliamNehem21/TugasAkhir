It is not universally true that the simplicity of l0 is greater than that of l in all modal logics. For example, it is established that the minimal modal logic k and its closed fragment k0 are both pspace complete (see [3, corollary 4]). The same holds true for the modal logic k4 of transitive frames.

Moreover, if we were to establish that il is in pspace, we would achieve pspace completeness. While it is generally believed that the complexity of full il is pspace-complete, no formal proof has been presented so far. It came as a surprise to the authors that there are currently no known complexity results in the context of interpretability logics. Therefore, this brief note could potentially serve as a starting point for future investigations into various interpretability logics, addressing fundamental complexity questions in an otherwise well-established field of interpretability logic.
