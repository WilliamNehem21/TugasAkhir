Carbone and Maffeis introduced matching systems to explore the expressive capabilities of the pi-calculus with polyadic synchronization. We extend their definition to examine matching systems for CCS, the pi-calculus, and mobile ambients. Our research reveals, among other findings, that the asynchronous pi-calculus with matching cannot be encoded in CCS with polyadic synchronization at all finite levels under certain conditions.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we provide definitions for the calculi under consideration. Sections 3 and 4 delve into weak and strong matching systems, respectively, while the final section presents conclusions and avenues for further research.

To demonstrate the converse direction, we rely on Lemma 3.2, which implies that it suffices to prove that CCSN does not possess a weak matching system of degree n+1. Assuming, for contradiction, that (c, s, x1,..., xn+1) forms a weak matching system of degree n+1 in CCSN, we aim to illustrate a scenario where a combination of clients and servers does not include a match, yet erroneously yields success.

Our study demonstrates that the calculus of mobile ambients features weak matching systems of all finite degrees. Furthermore, MA does not exhibit replicated strong matching systems of degree two or higher. Our research leaves unresolved the question of whether MA has a strong matching system of degree two or higher, and we hypothesize that the answer is negative.
