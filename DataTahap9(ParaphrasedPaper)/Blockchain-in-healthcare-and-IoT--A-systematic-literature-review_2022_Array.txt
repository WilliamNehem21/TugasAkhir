This academic paper discusses the possibilities and challenges of integrating blockchain technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) in various application domains. It explores different integration approaches and mechanisms based on existing literature. Additionally, it highlights the benefits and contributions of combining blockchain and IoT, particularly in the context of healthcare and data security.

The paper emphasizes the need for comprehensive reviews in the literature on access control and data integrity in blockchain-based systems, as well as the integration of blockchain and IoT. It also categorizes different P2P network topologies and consensus mechanisms used in blockchain technology. Furthermore, it delves into the significance of smart contracts, privacy-preserving techniques, and the use of blockchain in specific sectors such as healthcare, financial systems, and digital rights management.

The review identifies the challenges facing IoT devices, such as limited resources and susceptibility to attacks, and discusses how blockchain technology can address these issues. Additionally, it analyzes the use of blockchain in health information technology (HIT) and examines the challenges of system integration and data interoperability. The paper also addresses the potential applications of blockchain in smart cities and the drug supply chain.

In addition, the paper discusses the methodological approach for conducting the literature review, including the criteria for selecting relevant publications. It emphasizes the pervasive nature of blockchain and its potential impact on various sectors, especially healthcare and IoT. Finally, it highlights the authentication, data processing, dissemination, retrieval, and storage strategies used in blockchain-based systems and emphasizes the need for further research in these areas.
