By clearly distinguishing the infinitary directed join structure of frames from the finitary distributive lattice structure, it is hoped that a better understanding can be gained of the similarity between proper and open mappings. This is based on the observation that the finitary structure is dualized while the infinitary structure remains consistent. As a result, a single pullback stability result is obtainable for locale maps with triquotient assignments, which in turn applies dually to the established pullback stability results for proper and open maps.

The significance of the Townsend/Vickers result lies in its provision of an external depiction of the portion of locale theory that remains constant under this duality. This has potential implications for the axiomatization of continuity. Furthermore, by expanding the study to include geometric morphisms, this work may provide additional insights into the parallels between proper and open mappings within topos theory.
