To simplify the creation of indicators, we have introduced an Ice Index ranking system that evaluates 24 aspects grouped into three dimensions: localization, specialization, and collaboration. These dimensions further classify the 24 aspects into seven level-2 indicators, providing insights into global Chinese language education. After conducting a thorough literature review and considering data availability, these indicators rank Ice in 153 countries.

The importance of international education for various languages, such as English, French, Spanish, Japanese, and Portuguese, has gained attention from governments, language policy makers, educators, researchers, and stakeholders worldwide. Among the six official languages recognized by the United Nations, Chinese language education has seen significant growth, with its presence observed in over 150 countries. Approximately 80 countries have integrated Chinese into their national education systems, and more than 200 million individuals are learning Chinese as a foreign language. Over 4000 educational institutions worldwide offer Chinese language courses as part of their curriculum. This trend is linked to the increasing recognition of Chinese as a crucial language for individuals' material success and the economic development of nation-states. However, comprehensive studies examining international Chinese education (Ice) on a global scale have been limited in scope and number.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Ice development by gathering extensive datasets from 153 countries. Our objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the status of Ice worldwide and contribute to the ongoing examination and discussion in this field. To achieve this, we introduce a novel Ice Index ranking method that utilizes three categories of 24 indicators.

The paper further reviews relevant literature related to the assessment of Ice and the ranking problem. It introduces the design of the Ice ranking system, dataset, and methodology. The ranking results are presented, and a correlation analysis is conducted to provide an explanation for our ranking results. The paper concludes by summarizing key findings and implications.

This study utilizes weighted ranking aggregation methods for Ice Index ranking, addressing the unsupervised nature of the problem due to the lack of consensus on indicator definitions and a ground-truth ranking for Ice. Several challenges and practical considerations need to be addressed in this context, including the development of Ice within a country and its collaboration with resources from China.

The paper presents a comprehensive Ice ranking system with clearly defined 3-level indicators and attempts the combination of four weighting methods with preference matrix ranking aggregation to build the rankings in Ice. The results show that the U.S., U.K., and Thailand rank in the top three in the Ice Index, with several other countries also ranking in the top ten.

The study sheds light on the relationship between data completeness and Ice ranking of different countries, revealing a positive relationship between data completeness of most countries and their Ice ranking. Countries with higher data completeness have a relatively higher Ice ranking, while those with lower data completeness also demonstrate outstanding performance in certain aspects, indicating the potential for development in Ice.
