An interest can be seen as a request or inquiry that specifies the desired information from the inquirer's perspective. A gradient can be considered as a response path pointing toward the neighboring node from which the interest is received. The data message represents the description of the event. The path reinforcement process refers to the mechanism through which the sink can utilize multiple paths established during the gradient setup phase to access higher quality events by increasing its data rate.

Lifetime, in this context, denotes the duration (measured in seconds) from the deployment of the network until the network partitioning occurs. This includes the point at which the sink no longer receives data due to the disconnection of all paths to the sub-monitored area, isolation of all paths to the sources in this sub-area, or the cessation of these sources themselves.

Average end-to-end delay refers to the mean ripening time of each piece of information at the sink for each timestamp. Specifically, it represents the average time of the arrival of the third source reading for each data sample of an object, averaged across all sensed objects throughout the network lifetime. This time is calculated by subtracting the sample timestamp from the arrival time of the last source reading, with a maximum of three readings considered if the sink received three or more different readings about the object in that timestamp.
