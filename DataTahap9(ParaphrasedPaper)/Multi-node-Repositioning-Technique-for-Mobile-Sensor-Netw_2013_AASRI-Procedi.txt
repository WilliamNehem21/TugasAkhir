The importance of inter-sensor connectivity in mobile sensor networks cannot be overstated, as the failure of a sensor node can lead to loss of connectivity and the division of the system into disjoint portions. While several strategies have been proposed to address node failure and restore connectivity, these strategies often overlook the potential lack of coverage in certain areas, whether due to the failure itself or the limited concentration of the recovery process. This paper aims to address both connectivity and coverage issues simultaneously by introducing a multi-node repositioning algorithm. In this algorithm, each neighboring node temporarily relocates to replace the failed node one at a time before returning to its original location. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated using performance parameters such as distance moved, and it is worth noting that the algorithm effectively improves system connectivity.

Furthermore, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a crucial role in facilitating data processing and transmission among sensor nodes through radio communication. WSNs not only reduce costs and delays in development but also enable deployment in environments where wired sensor networks are impractical, such as deep oceans, space, and battlefields. Sensor nodes are widely utilized in various domains including healthcare, household applications, and military operations, thanks to their rapid performance, self-organization, and fault-tolerance capabilities. In healthcare, sensor nodes can be used for patient monitoring and assisting disabled individuals, while in industry, they are useful for inventory management, product quality monitoring, and disaster response.

Additionally, addressing the occurrence of redundant nodes in the network is an effective approach to improving coverage and connectivity, as these nodes can serve as replacements in the event of node failures. To accomplish this, we utilized the model proposed by Rabinar Heinzelman et al. (2000) and Bhardwaj et al. (2001).
