In biological modeling, it is often the case that the interactions' structure and effects are known, but the rates of these interactions are not known and cannot be easily determined through experiments. This paper focuses on the estimation of rate parameters for reaction networks in a general and abstract setting, particularly when the phenomenon being studied is stochastic and suitable for modeling using continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC). Additionally, it assumes that the evolution of the system cannot be continuously observed, and observations are made at discrete sampling points, with a large number of reactions potentially occurring between these points.

The parameter estimation of stochastic reaction networks often involves applying the principle of maximum likelihood. This paper describes how the expectation-maximization (EM) method, a technique for maximum likelihood estimation in the case of incomplete data, can be adapted to estimate kinetic rates of reaction networks. In particular, due to the large state space of the underlying CTMC, the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) method, which utilizes simulation for model analysis, is a convenient variant of the EM approach. The paper demonstrates that the application of the MCEM method results in an efficient and straightforward estimation procedure, especially for systems involving mass action kinetics. It provides examples to illustrate the approach's characteristics and its applicability in systems of reactions involving multiple species.

The studied phenomena can be highly complex, with multiple reagents interacting through numerous reactions. Moreover, it is often impractical to consider the process as perfectly and continuously observable. Measurement techniques are typically limited to providing observations of the system state at specific time intervals, with a significant number of reactions occurring between consecutive observations. Consequently, the optimization problem that arises involves incomplete data. The EM method is introduced as a technique for maximum likelihood estimation in these cases, involving the reconstruction of missing data in expectation and parameter optimization to maximize the probability of the reconstructed complete data. In situations where exact data reconstruction is challenging, the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) method, proposed by Wei and Tanner, can be employed, utilizing simulation to complete the data.

The continuous-time Markov chain represents system states and transitions occur based on reaction intensities dependent on the state of the system. The paper assumes that the intensities are in a specific form and incorporates them throughout the analysis.

Given the observed samples and the large state space of the CTMC, multiple simulations are needed to connect the observation time instants. Due to the divergence between the current set of parameters and the true parameters, a single simulation run is unlikely to exactly match the observed states. Therefore, the E-step of the MCEM method consists of two phases to address this issue.
