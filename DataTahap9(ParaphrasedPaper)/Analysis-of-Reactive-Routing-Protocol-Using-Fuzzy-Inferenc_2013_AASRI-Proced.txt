Past research in the field of routing protocols has predominantly focused on a single constraint, such as finding the shortest path between a source and destination. However, it is important to consider other factors, like handling packet drops during network congestion or finding alternate paths in case of link failures, in order to make routing decisions more efficient. Recent efforts in this area have aimed to incorporate multiple constraints into routing decision-making. The fuzzy inference system is one approach that allows for the integration of uncertain and imprecise input constraints. This study intends to evaluate the performance of AODV and DSR routing protocols using a fuzzy inference system, and to analyze the behavior of these protocols with and without the integration of the fuzzy inference system.

Dr. Lotfi Zadeh of the University of California introduced the concept of fuzzy logic in 1965, which emulates the natural thinking process based on human cognition, including imprecision and ambiguity. The operation of a fuzzy inference system involves identifying relevant input and output variables, assigning linguistic labels to these variables, which are expressed as fuzzy sets, and selecting appropriate membership functions for input and output variables. Additionally, a set of if-then rules are constructed to guide the system's behavior based on expert knowledge, and these rules can be adjusted to optimize system functionality.

Over the past four decades, numerous routing protocols have been developed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. No single protocol has been found to be universally superior in all conditions. To analyze the behavior of AODV and DSR routing protocols under different circumstances, we have evaluated these protocols using a fuzzy inference system and assessed their respective merits and drawbacks.

The integration of fuzzy inference system into AODV and DSR routing protocols has been found to enhance performance in real-time applications by introducing new metrics and making minor adjustments to their operation. Future research could explore the application of fuzzy logic with other reactive routing protocols as well.
