The estimation distribution algorithm (EDA) is an evolutionary algorithm that utilizes probabilistic models to generate potential solutions. Previous studies have proposed various hybrid methods to prevent the premature convergence of EDA. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of different hybridization approaches within EDA, focusing on the descriptive statistics of the objective values.

The Single Row Facility Layout Problem (SFLP) is categorized as an NP-complete problem, requiring a heuristic method to produce an approximately optimal solution. The Enhanced Facility Layout Problem (EFLP) is an extension of SFLP that includes installation cost and safety constraints. The experiments in this study demonstrate that solutions for several instances of EFLP could be further improved. As a result, a new variant of EDA, named Adapted EDA (AEDA), is proposed to address this issue. This research evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm in solving instances of EFLP.

The key contributions of this study include a comparative analysis of EDA hybridization, the introduction of the new AEDA variant, and the application of the algorithms to EFLP datasets. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews previous studies, Section 3 describes the problem, Section 4 presents the methodology, including AEDA, EDA hybridization, and genetic algorithm (GA) with tabu search (TS), Section 5 provides the experimental results and comparative study, and Section 6 discusses the outcomes and draws conclusions.

EDA, originally introduced by Baluja, initially consisted of a single probabilistic model. However, current research suggests that the efficacy of EDA depends on the accuracy of the probabilistic model in capturing population information. Thus, this study explores the use of two probabilistic models—ordinal and dependency—in EDA. Furthermore, hybridization of EDA with other techniques, such as differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA), has been employed to address various optimization problems.

SFLP, which considers material handling and rearrangement costs, has been tackled using simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GA), and their hybridizations. Similarly, various algorithms, including DE and neighborhood search, have been explored to solve SFLP. However, there is currently a lack of research comparing the quality of hybridized EDA solutions, making it an area for further exploration. Furthermore, the application of EDA to SFLP and EFLP has received minimal attention in recent years, highlighting the need for comparative studies in this domain.

The proposed AEDA algorithm initializes a group of candidate solutions and calculates their cost. Subsequently, main phases of AEDA are executed, including tabu search (TS), which updates a swaplist containing facility move information, and elitism procedures to record the best solutions across generations.

The concept of EDAGA combines genetic algorithms (GA) with the structure of EDA. EDAGA has been applied to scheduling problems and flow shop scheduling problems, leveraging the diversity-maintaining ability of GA and the solution-exploiting capabilities of EDA.

In addition, the research introduces EDA hybridization with tabu search (TS) as a robust optimization approach, particularly in solving combinatorial problems such as job shop scheduling. The proposed genetic algorithm with tabu search (GATS) is established as a benchmark against AEDA and is described in detail.

The implementation of all algorithms was conducted using MATLAB on a PC with an Intel i5 processor and 12 GB of RAM. The results of the algorithm implementations are presented and analyzed in this section.

The comparative study of hybrid algorithms in this research is expected to guide future studies in determining the most effective methods. The data and results provided can serve as benchmarks for further research in EFLP. Future studies may focus on enhancing algorithm performance or exploring alternative use cases.
