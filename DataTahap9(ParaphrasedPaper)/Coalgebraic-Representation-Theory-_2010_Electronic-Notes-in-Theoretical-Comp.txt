The method of obtaining an infinite stream over a set of two elements, {0, 1}, is exemplified in this paper. From this specific example, a general principle is derived: the fractal structure of a particular shape enables the symbolic representation of the shape using infinite streams. The main focus of the current paper is to formalize this principle.

In example 3.1, the module mi for the unit interval involves identifying two points, one from each copy. This process is formally defined as the module mi specification for the unit interval i, which is informally described as the union of two copies of itself. In related work, what we have referred to as a combinatorial specification is known as a self-similarity system, and the resulting coalgebraic fractal is called the solution of the self-similarity system. However, the symbolic and combinatorial nature of these concepts is not emphasized in the previous literature.

The directions of further development also differ. In this paper, the focus is on a metric extension that relates a coalgebraic fractal to a metric fractal induced by a specification similar to an iterated function system (IFS). In contrast, Leinster primarily pursues a topological extension, endowing a coalgebraic fractal with a canonical topological structure. In his work, Leinster presents recognition theorems that determine whether a given topological space is a solution of a certain self-similarity system.
