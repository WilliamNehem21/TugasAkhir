Both wired and wireless technologies are utilized for monitoring and controlling, and in the future, wireless sensor networks and mobile communication may become essential due to their adaptability, ease of deployment, and cost-effectiveness. Wireless sensor nodes typically include a computational module, communication module, power supply, and suitable sensing system, and they do not require the use of messy and cumbersome cables, as evidenced by prior studies [16, 17, 18, 19, 26].
