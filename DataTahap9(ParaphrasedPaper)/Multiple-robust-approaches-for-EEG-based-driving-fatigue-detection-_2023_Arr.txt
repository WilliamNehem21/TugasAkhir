Remaining vigilant is crucial in numerous occupations such as driving, construction, and night shift security. Driver drowsiness is a leading cause of accidents worldwide, particularly prevalent in long-distance transportation. Various factors contribute to fatigue-related accidents, including journey length, weather conditions, road uniformity, driving history, time of occurrence, and driver health. Alertness is key to preventing drowsiness-related crashes. Factors such as consuming heavy meals, medication, inadequate sleep, and stress can contribute to drowsiness. Age, gender, smoking, and health issues also impact drowsiness. Reduced alertness due to drowsiness can impair performance and cognitive functions, measurable through EEG signals.

In strategy 4, preprocessing is followed by implementing correntropy spectral density and the Lyapunov with Rosenstein algorithm, computing multi-distance signal level difference, analyzing the geometry of spd matrices, and calculating geodesic minimum distance to the Riemannian means. Finally, the data is mapped to the tangent space before classification using machine learning algorithms.

In strategy 5, preprocessing is followed by computing the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and the hilbert marginal spectrum, selecting features using the black hole algorithm, and finally classifying with the cascade Adaboost classifier. The algorithms were selected based on a detailed study of their individual properties.

MFA is used to explain intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in the preprocessed EEG signals by constructing intrinsic graphs. The proximity degree of same-class samples is assessed using the internal product distance measurement technique. Additionally, domain adaptation is employed to learn a mapping matrix for the features of both strong and weak classes, enhancing testing using machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Adaboost.

ANFIS is utilized to learn dataset features and adjust system parameters based on error criteria, improving generalization. The classifiers are trained using backpropagation gradient descent and least squares methods, and fuzzy rule architecture is designed using a generalized bell-shaped membership function.

The reconstructed dynamics from a single time series are analyzed using the method of delays. The essential features are chosen using the black-hole algorithm, considering its ease of implementation and absence of tuning parameter issues.

The performance of the selected features is assessed using ANFIS, while the black-hole selected features are fed to the cascade Adaboost classifier. The proposed strategies achieved high classification accuracy using a publicly available EEG dataset, collected from 16 healthy subjects using a brain cap with 32 electrodes during driving simulation.

The study was supported by multiple grants and funding sources. For future work, efforts will continue to focus on developing more effective classifiers for EEG signal analysis.

The study concluded with the proposed classification strategies demonstrating high accuracy rates, with the CS
