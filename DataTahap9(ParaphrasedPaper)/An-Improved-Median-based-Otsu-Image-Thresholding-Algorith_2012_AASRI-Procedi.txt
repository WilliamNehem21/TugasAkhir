The robust and automatic thresholding of gray level images has been widely used in the fields of pattern recognition and computer vision for the purposes of object detection, tracking, and recognition. While the Otsu scheme is a commonly employed image thresholding technique that delivers satisfactory results for segmenting a gray level image with a unimodal distribution in the gray level histogram, it yields poor results for non-bimodal histograms. To address this limitation, an improved median-based Otsu image thresholding algorithm is introduced in this study to enhance the performance of the Otsu algorithm. Extensive tests were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields more satisfactory outcomes compared to the original Otsu thresholding algorithm.

Image segmentation of gray level images is a fundamental and challenging task in the fields of pattern recognition, machine learning, image processing, and computer vision. Various algorithms have emerged for gray level image segmentation, with thresholding being a widely recognized technique in this area. Among these algorithms, Otsu's method is particularly well-known and widely utilized. However, Otsu's algorithm tends to produce poor thresholding results for images with long-tailed distributions. To address this issue, this paper presents a median-based Otsu method that achieves more satisfactory results compared to the original Otsu algorithm.

The proposed median-based Otsu algorithm replaces the means of the foreground, background, and entire gray level image in the original Otsu method with the respective medians. This modification addresses the shortcomings of the traditional Otsu algorithm for images with skewed distributions or noise, resulting in accurate and satisfactory thresholding results.
