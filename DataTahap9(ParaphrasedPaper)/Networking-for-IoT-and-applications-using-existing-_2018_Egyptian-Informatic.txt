The combination of mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) with wireless sensor networks (WSN) in ubiquitous smart environments presents new opportunities for monitoring large-scale urban areas and establishing a new communication platform for various applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Sensors utilized for IoT applications detect environmental data and transmit it to a gateway node, which then sends the collected data to the MANET node, primarily used for data harvesting. This paper focuses on two IoT applications monitored by wireless sensor nodes. The primary challenge of this work is to create a platform by integrating the sensor network with the MANET network, as nodes exhibit varying power levels, heterogeneous protocols, and the potential for co-channel interferences. A comprehensive solution is proposed, encompassing network protocols, spectrum distribution, node deployment, MANET routing, mobility patterns, and the implementation of IoT applications. The performance and feasibility of these applications are simulated using the OMNeT++ simulator and demonstrated.

The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized communication, allowing various objects in daily life, such as smartphones, sensors, and network-enabled devices like RFID, to communicate and become part of the internet. The goal of IoT is to make the internet more pervasive and inspiring by connecting a wide array of heterogeneous devices and enabling easy accessibility. IoT applications are being employed in diverse domains, leveraging the vast amount of data generated by connected devices to make crucial decisions for industries and to control these devices. IoT finds wide-ranging use in domains such as medical aids, home automation, industrial automation, and mobile.

Wireless sensor networks (WSN) play a pivotal role in IoT, facilitated by advancements in communication and microcontroller technologies. These tiny, low-cost sensor nodes can sense various environmental parameters, store data temporarily, and communicate with other electronic devices using communication technologies such as IEEE 802.15.4 or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Another useful IoT device is the RFID tag, used to identify objects attached to the tag.

The organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses related works on IoT; Section 3 delves into architecture and protocols; Section 4 presents two IoT applications considered in the research; Section 5 provides simulation and results; and Section 6 concludes the study.

In a smart city, various services such as structural health monitoring of buildings or bridges, noise pollution monitoring, air pollution monitoring, waste management monitoring, traffic management, smart parking, and energy consumption monitoring are essential. The authors propose an architecture for a sensor-based IoT network that continuously senses building conditions and transmits the data to the internet for further processing to assess infrastructure health. Waste management is another critical service in a city. The proposed IoT-based waste management service optimizes resource use, such as trucks and roads, by connecting all vehicles through IoT networks to collect and process data, effectively managing resources. Additionally, the paper discusses an IoT network architecture using GPRS-based sensors deployed throughout the city to monitor greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, IoT applications in a smart city include noise monitoring, traffic management, and smart car parking, using special sensors to automate congestion control and inform people in advance about parking slot availability through IoT applications.

Traditional web applications, mainly XML-based, are not suitable for constrained devices such as sensors or RFID devices. To address this, web-based applications using CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) in the application layer are being developed for IoT. The paper proposes CoAP, demonstrated in a constrained RESTful environment (CoRE) and combined with the Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) format.

While previous studies are based on conventional IoT architecture where different heterogeneous networks communicate directly with the internet through their own gateways, this paper proposes a different IoT architecture consisting of four hierarchical levels combining MANET nodes, infrastructure-based WLAN, WSN nodes, and the internet to efficiently support various IoT applications.

The conventional IoT approach involves connecting WSN (data source) to the internet, resulting in inherent limitations in terms of area coverage, network delay, energy consumption, and IoT applications. This paper introduces MANET to bridge the technical gap between WSN and the internet, enhancing the existing technologies and applications.

In large urban infrastructures, numerous sensor nodes are deployed to collect valuable data on building and bridge conditions, temperature, pressure inside a factory, etc. These nodes transmit sensed data to a predefined gateway sensor node. In this proposed model, a backbone of mobile ad hoc nodes moves through urban area roads, collecting data from sensor gateway nodes and forwarding it to the internet gateway. Additionally, if available, gateway sensor nodes may transmit received data to the internet through WLAN access points. The architecture uses three protocol layers for data transmission to the internet, including the use of web servers for end-users to access device information.

Converging WSN with the internet presents challenges due to differences in energy levels, data packet size, and transmission power, which are mitigated by incorporating MANET nodes in between. The proposed model enhances efficiency, as demonstrated in a comparative qualitative and quantitative analysis presented in the simulation section, validating its effectiveness.

The hierarchical architecture ensures proportional energy distribution across all nodes in the IoT system, demonstrating energy-efficient operation. Furthermore, the paper presents two IoT applications and the implementation aspects of the proposed model, highlighting solutions for network architecture, protocols, communication technology, and mobility models for wireless sensor devices.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed a paradigm called Representational State Transfer (REST) to extend web services to IoT. This paradigm aids in the integration of traditional web knowledge in IoT web-based services through the use of CoAP, which allows REST-based communication among energy-constrained devices in IoT networks, employing an efficient XML interchange (EXI) and CoAP at the application layer.

In summary, this paper offers a comprehensive exploration of leveraging MANET and WSN for IoT applications, encompassing architecture, protocols, and implementation aspects, along with a demonstration of its effectiveness through simulation and analysis.
