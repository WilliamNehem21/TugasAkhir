The short-term power forecast for a single wind farm can be modeled using a physical approach. Wind speed at the wind farm is forecasted based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), and an energy transfer model is constructed to account for factors such as surface roughness, topography, and wake effects on wind energy capture.

As of June 2012, there were 41 wind farms integrated into the grid with a total capacity of 4187 MW, mainly concentrated in the ZJK and CD regions with capacities of 2935 MW and 1088 MW, respectively. Out of these, 26 wind farms with a capacity of 2652 MW have implemented a wind power forecast system for more than 6 months. This study certifies the grid-scale forecast method based on these data. The NWP data has a time resolution of 5 minutes, and wind power data was acquired from SCADA per second and then processed into 5-minute intervals to align with the NWP data.

The study calculated the relative gain factor (RGF) and root mean square error (RMSE) of each representative farm based on measured and forecasted wind power data from January to March 2011. The weight coefficients were then determined using a specific formula based on this data.

Using the grid-scale data as well as data from individual farms, the study then calculated weight coefficients and enforced a fixed maximum wind output of the entire grid (2687 MW). The forecast result for the grid scale was obtained through a corresponding formula.

The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method presented in this paper. It was found that the forecast accuracy of grid scale is consistently better than that of single farms, largely due to the regional smoothing effect. The grid-scale forecasting accuracy meets the requirements of applications and exceeds industrial standards.
