Contemporary advancements in security science exploit these discrepancies to regulate access to restricted areas, a key challenge within the security domain. The growing demand for heightened security measures has spurred the development of advanced and effective authentication systems. Traditional methods of identification, such as keys or passwords, have proven insufficient in various practical contexts due to their susceptibility to being forgotten, stolen, or breached. Consequently, contemporary security research is turning its attention to automated identification systems.

The iris recognition system (IRS) stands out as a highly precise verification technology and a valid biometric approach for personal identification. Widely studied and applied, the IRS is particularly prevalent in security-related domains, with many countries leveraging it to bolster security in settings such as airports and government buildings. While the concept of iris identification dates back to earlier research, significant recent advancements have drawn inspiration from the works of John Daugman.

The segmentation process involves isolating the iris ring from the iris image, while the normalization process aims to generate an invariant iris area by transforming the circular iris region into a fixed dimensional rectangular region. Although both the inner and outer boundary can be approximated as circles, these circles are not co-centric. Daugman introduced the use of the integro-differential operator to identify the inner and outer boundaries.

In order to extract pertinent information from an iris image, a novel feature extraction method is proposed, inspired by the local binary pattern (LBP) approach. Several enhancements have been implemented to better capture local information and characterize iris texture. This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines our proposed method for analyzing iris texture, while Section 3 presents experimental results. Section 4 provides the conclusion of this study.

Experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed neighborhood binary pattern (NBP) method, with an accuracy of 76.25%, surpasses that of the traditional LBP method, which achieves an accuracy of 58.75%. This finding is attributed to the fact that, unlike the LBP method, the NBP approach describes each pixel based on its relationships with neighboring pixels. The results demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the proposed NBP method by emphasizing the importance of capturing relevant information between neighboring pixels.
