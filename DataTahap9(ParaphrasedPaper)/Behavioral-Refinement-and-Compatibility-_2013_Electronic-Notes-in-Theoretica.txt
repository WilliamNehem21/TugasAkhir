This study examines the concepts of refinement and compatibility for system models and their variants represented as statecharts. The basic idea is to start with a base model and incrementally add small features by introducing new states and transitions. The study explores whether the old behavior is preserved when extending a system and focuses on compatibility in the sense of substitutability, i.e., whether a refined system can be used in any place where the original system was used and behaves in the same way.

The existing definitions of refinement and compatibility are shown to be orthogonal when they include an interface extension. The study then delves into the concept of extended compatibility, which refers to the system returning to a compatible behavior after some time, even when the newly added features are used. The authors introduce a new refinement concept that eliminates the effect of newly added features by removing elements from the input and output behavior, thus achieving extended compatibility.

The study also explores the relationship between refinement and compatibility in the context of observable traces of input and output behavior. It presents a precise definition of elimination and demonstrates under what conditions the behavior is preserved under such elimination. The authors emphasize that their novel concepts of elimination and extended compatibility cover practical examples where new features use existing input and output events, scenarios that are not addressed by existing abstraction and refinement concepts.

The paper discusses related work on statechart refinement, UML modeling, and interface automata, highlighting how their concepts of refinement under elimination are novel and cover a practical class of examples where new features use existing events. It is noted that earlier work on statechart refinement does not consider extended compatibility, and the concepts developed in this study complement and extend existing knowledge in this area.

In summary, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the concepts of refinement and compatibility for system models represented as statechart diagrams. It introduces new refinement concepts that address scenarios where new features use existing events and demonstrates their applicability in various practical cases. The study's results contribute to the understanding of system model refinement and compatibility, particularly in the context of extended compatibility and elimination of newly added behavior.
