This academic paper discusses the use of AI-enabled data pipelines in agriculture, highlighting the various applications of IoT and AI technologies in this field. It emphasizes the importance of data retrieval from databases in formats like CSV, Excel, and images, followed by data pre-processing involving activities such as cleaning and normalization. The paper also underscores the significance of supervised algorithms and the division of data into train, validation, and test sets for effective data analysis.

The paper describes the widespread use of mobile and web applications in communicating information to farmers and enabling them to control farm activities through mobile platforms. It also elaborates on the monitoring and performance improvement of tractors through the use of in-built navigation systems, sensors, and IoT technologies.

Furthermore, the paper delves into the application of drones in agriculture, particularly for pesticide spraying and weed control using AI-based classification models. It also discusses precision livestock farming (PLF) systems for monitoring and decision-making to ensure the health and well-being of livestock.

Additionally, the paper highlights the potential of AI and IoT technologies in enhancing cattle reproduction management and the evaluation of micro-climatic conditions in greenhouses. It emphasizes the need for efficient data processing and management, the use of cloud-based architectures, and the challenges and opportunities associated with the growth of AI and IoT systems in agriculture.

Finally, the paper touches upon the expected contributions of 5G technology in revolutionizing the potential of IoT in agriculture and the overall transformative impact of digitization and automation in farming activities.
