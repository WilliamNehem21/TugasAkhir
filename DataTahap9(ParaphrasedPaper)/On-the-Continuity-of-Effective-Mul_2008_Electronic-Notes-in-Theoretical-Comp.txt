This paper extends a certain approach to multifunctions, which are commonly found in applied mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science. It discusses various methods of coding sets and introduces effective versions of several continuity concepts for multifunctions. The paper also presents an indexing system for sets that demonstrates the effectiveness of multifunctions with specific witness functions, thus characterizing multifunctions that are effectively continuous according to the considered continuity notion. The paper highlights important special cases where such witnessing functions always exist.

The paper illustrates numerous examples that demonstrate the prevalence of multifunctions in mathematical practice and their successful application in various branches of mathematics, logic, and computer science, as evidenced by existing extensive literature.

In the context of the applications discussed in the paper, there exists a canonical relation between descriptions of basic open sets (or their code numbers), which is often stronger than set inclusion and is recursively enumerable. The paper assumes that the topological basis "b" is numbered and that a relation exists between the codes.

Previous sections of the paper have examined effectiveness properties in T0 spaces by encoding essential objects such as points and basic open sets. The subsequent section delves into methods of assigning indices to subspaces, noting that not all subspaces can generally be given an index due to cardinality considerations.

The paper also derives an analogue to a previously discussed theorem for the case of upper semi-continuity by applying theorem 5.9. It further recalls that, according to lemma 4.4, a complement exhaustion index can be computed from any covering index and demonstrates that every compact-valued multifunction that is effective with respect to complete covering indices and has values in an effectively given metric space is effectively lower and upper semi-continuous.
