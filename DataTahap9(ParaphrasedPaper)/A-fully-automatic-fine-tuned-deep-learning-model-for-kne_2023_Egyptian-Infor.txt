The ease of bone movement is facilitated by osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that results from the breakdown of protective cartilage, leading to increased joint pain and stiffness when the bones rub against each other. OA commonly affects the knee, hip, and hand joints, and its diagnosis typically involves symptom evaluation and plain radiograph assessment, a method that may be prone to errors.

In Western nations, OA contributes to a loss of productivity and increased healthcare costs, amounting to up to 2.5% of the national product's growth. Recent research suggests that the global aging population will lead to at least 130 million people being affected by knee osteoarthritis (KOA), which has resulted in over 20 billion dollars being spent on KOA treatment.

A study comparing various feature selection algorithms found that a random forest (RF) classifier achieved a classification accuracy of 73.55% on a set of 21 selected risk factors. McCabe et al. proposed two validated models for diagnosing and predicting the onset of radiological knee osteoarthritis, with the diagnostic model showing an AUC of 67% for validation data and 75% for test data.

Liu et al. utilized the region proposal network (RPN) and fast R-CNN to classify knee joint images, achieving sensitivity above 78%, specificity above 94%, and a mean average precision of nearly 0.82. Additionally, they employed a novel loss function and addressed issues related to object matching in X-ray images.

In a separate study, a full-scale model was developed and fine-tuned to achieve optimal network parameters for grading and localizing KOA severity. The model's training accuracy was above 90%, and the validation accuracy ranged between 85% and 90%.

Furthermore, several pre-trained models, including InceptionResNetV2, achieved high accuracies in predicting KOA images, with InceptionResNetV2 correctly predicting 1254 images and other models predicting similar numbers. Additionally, for predicting moderate and severe KOA classes, various models showed accuracies ranging from 77% to 88%.

Finally, there was extensive focus on evaluating the performance and accuracy of different pre-trained models in predicting KOA severity, with accuracies ranging from 82% to 95% across different models and severity classes.
