The termination of term rewrite systems (TRSs) is a problem that has been proven to be undecidable. Despite this, modern algorithms, while incomplete, have demonstrated the ability to effectively prove the termination of many rewrite systems, as evidenced by the International Termination Competition. In 2004, Kurihara and Kondo were the first to encode a termination method in propositional logic, and in 2006, the first tools (Jambox 6 and Matchbox) utilized SAT-solving techniques in the competition, surprising the community with their significant gains in power and speed. Their success was largely attributed to the so-called matrix-method, which can be efficiently implemented using SAT solvers. Furthermore, recent developments in the SAT community have led to much faster implementations of even simple and longstanding methods such as the lexicographic path order (LPO) and the Knuth-Bendix order (KBO) compared to previous years. This is noteworthy, as KBO orientability is known to be decidable in polynomial time, whereas SAT is NP-complete. Essentially, the advanced algorithms for solving the computationally harder (unless P = NP) SAT problem surpass the dedicated methods for KBO. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar outcome exists when translating the NP-complete SAT problem into the undecidable termination property of TRSs. However, our experiments indicate that, at least for our translations, the results are expected. When it comes to the transformation from SAT to termination, the dedicated SAT approaches demonstrate superior performance. Moreover, only the most straightforward propositional formulas produce TRSs that can be proven to terminate by state-of-the-art termination provers. Hence, the translations can be utilized to automatically generate a large set of challenging termination problems.
