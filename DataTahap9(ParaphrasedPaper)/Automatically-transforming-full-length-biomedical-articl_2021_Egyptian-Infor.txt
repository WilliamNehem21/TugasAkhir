The internet, particularly the World Wide Web, has become a vast source of medical and health information, including medical resources, bibliographic databases, and blogs. Physicians increasingly rely on this information in diagnosing patients, but they often encounter difficulties in effectively accessing and retrieving relevant research articles due to the complex technical content and structure of biomedical articles. These articles are typically lengthy, posing challenges for information retrieval systems in capturing the essence of a topic. Consequently, the retrieval of biomedical articles differs significantly from conventional web search.

This paper presents a comparison of various search features extracted from biomedical articles, such as words or noun phrases from different fields, with different weights applied. The experiments demonstrate that words and noun phrases from the introduction field are more effective than those from the title or abstract field in generating queries for retrieving biomedical articles. Furthermore, combining different features significantly improves retrieval performance over using single features.

The paper also proposes two query reformulation techniques for medical professionals to retrieve relevant information from medical literature. The first technique involves unsupervised query expansion and pseudo relevance feedback, focusing on health-related terms. The study also reviews recent advancements in the genetic dissection of genetically inherited chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) and related syndromes, and explores the conversion of full-length article queries into efficient search queries.

The work also considers multiple factors in transforming a biomedical article into an effective search query, including the selection of appropriate features, the use of retrieval functions, and the method of measuring the importance of words or phrases. It provides an algorithm for this transformation, which is detailed in Algorithm 1. The study also investigates the combination of different types of features and tests the approach in both the biomedical and patent retrieval domains. In the context of the latter, the task of prior-art search in patent retrieval involves identifying previously published patents related to a given topic. This is a common task for patent examiners and attorneys when assessing the novelty and technical conflicts of new patent applications.
