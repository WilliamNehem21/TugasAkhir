To minimize error rates, multiple duplicates of the signal are generated, providing greater opportunities for the data to reach the receiving antenna without being affected by fading. Furthermore, the use of a novel parasitic decoupling structure sharply restricts interference from existing frequency bands within the UWB spectrum, including the 5G sub-6 GHz, WLAN band, and satellite downlink band.
