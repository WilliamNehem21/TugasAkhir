The 14 model variables are measured in units of molecules per 10^8 units of proteic mass, where one unit of proteic mass corresponds to one amino acid polymerized within a protein. The model represents four classes of genes, with half of the cell's proteic mass consisting of housekeeping proteins, denoted as q, whose function is not explicitly represented in the model. This relatively constant expression level is achieved through negative auto-regulation of their gene expression. Ribosomes, denoted as r, are essential for protein production and are required for replicating the mass.

Cell resource allocation varies depending on the growth medium, such as in bacteria where ribosomal content increases as the medium becomes more conducive to growth. However, this reallocation of resources to different functions is not immediate due to constraints. It involves competition between different mRNAs for ribosomes, and since mRNAs have non-zero lifetimes, rewiring mRNA production to one cellular function does not promptly lead to a direct update of mRNA distribution to different cellular functions. Living systems utilize post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms that can act directly at the translation level rather than solely tuning transcription.

Default values were applied unless otherwise specified. Parameters that have been fitted to the model's data are denoted with an asterisk (*). We use "aa" to represent the protein precursors, amino acids, or "a" in the growth model.
