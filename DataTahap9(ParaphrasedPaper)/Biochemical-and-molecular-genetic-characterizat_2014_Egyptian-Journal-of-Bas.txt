All gels were photographed and analyzed using the Bio-Rad video documentation system model Gel Doc 2000. The presence or absence of each band was considered as a binary characteristic in a data matrix (coded as 1 and 0, respectively). Data analyses were carried out using the Systat version 7.0 program.

The findings indicated that the primer yielded a total of 12 bands, with bands of molecular sizes 830 bp and 370 bp observed in all studied taxa. Additionally, bands of molecular sizes 600 bp and 680 bp were exclusively present in Lavatera cretica, suggesting that these bands could serve as positive molecular markers for L. cretica. A band of molecular size 700 bp was recorded in all taxa.

Furthermore, the primer produced 12 bands across ten accessions of six studied taxa, with molecular sizes ranging from 310 to 2500 bp. A band of molecular size 1500 bp was only observed in M. parviflora collected from Menia El-Kamh El-Sharkyia, indicating its potential usage as a positive molecular marker for this accession. Moreover, a band of molecular weight 590 bp was observed in all taxa except for two accessions of S. alba.

The molecular size of the PCR products varied from 230 bp to 850 bp. Bands of molecular sizes 680 bp and 420 bp were detected in all accessions of the studied taxa, except for A. theophartis and two accessions of H. trionum.

The primer demonstrated five polymorphic bands and two common bands with molecular sizes of 420 bp and 680 bp. A band of molecular size 330 bp was found in all studied taxa except for H. sabdariffa collected from Nabrooh Eel-Dakahlyia Governorate. Similarly, a band of molecular size 550 bp was exclusively present in M. parviflora collected from Nabrooh, potentially serving as a molecular marker for this accession.

The PCR products exhibited molecular sizes ranging from 200 to 2900 bp, yielding seven polymorphic bands and four common bands with molecular sizes 200 bp, 850 bp, 990 bp, and 2900 bp. A band of molecular size 500 bp was specific to M. parviflora collected from Nabrooh, while a band of molecular size 1680 bp was unique to H. sabdariffa collected from Menia El-Kamh El-Sharkyia Governorate. Additionally, a band of molecular size 620 bp was observed in all studied taxa except for H. sabdariffa collected from Talkha El-Dakahlyia Governorate, suggesting its potential usage as a negative molecular marker for the latter. Furthermore, a band of molecular size 1380 bp was detected in all taxa except for M. parviflora collected from Menia El-Kamh.

A band of molecular size 1320 bp was exclusively present in H. sabdariffa collected from Talkha El-Dakahlyia Governorate, indicating its potential as a molecular marker for this accession. The primer also yielded four common bands with molecular sizes 530 bp, 660 bp, 780 bp, and 1750 bp.

The PCR products ranged in molecular size from 315 bp to 1650 bp, generating three common bands with molecular sizes 315 bp, 490 bp, and 620 bp, along with eight polymorphic bands. A band of molecular size 590 bp was only observed in H. trionum collected from Elriyad Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, serving as a positive marker for this accession.

Moreover, the primer produced a total of 12 bands, consisting of six common bands and six polymorphic bands. A band of molecular size 3100 bp was exclusively detected in S. alba collected from Menia El-Kamh, indicating its potential usage as a positive marker for this accession.

Additionally, the primer yielded ten bands, including three common bands and seven polymorphic bands. A band of molecular size 740 bp was only present in S. alba collected from Menia El-Kamh and could serve as a molecular marker for this accession. 

The PCR products exhibited molecular sizes from 220 bp to 1500 bp. The primer OPB-17 generated seven polymorphic bands and four common bands. Bands of molecular sizes 420 bp and 340 bp were specific to H. sabdariffa collected from Menia El-Kamh El-Sharkyia, potentially serving as positive molecular markers for this accession.

Biochemical and molecular techniques provide effective approaches for assessing genetic diversity in plants, offering independence from the plant's developmental stage. Biochemical evidence, such as seed storage protein electrophoresis and isozyme polymorphisms, is convenient for evaluating genetic relationships.

The electrophoretic analysis of the ten accessions of the six studied taxa revealed a total of eighteen bands. The highest number of bands (15) was observed in H. sabdariffa collected from Menia El-Kamh, El-Sharkyia, and the two accessions of M. parviflora. The molecular weights of these bands ranged from 11.3 to 115.3 kDa, while the lowest number of bands (11) were recorded in H. trionum collected from Talkha El-Dakahlyia Governorate, with molecular weights ranging from 11.3 kDa to 115.3 kDa.

Proteins and isozymes as electrophoretic markers have been utilized to some extent in many crops. However, their major limitation lies in the lack of sufficient polymorphism among closely related cultivars. To address this, DNA-based genetic markers have been integrated into various plant systems and play a crucial role in molecular genetics and plant breeding.
