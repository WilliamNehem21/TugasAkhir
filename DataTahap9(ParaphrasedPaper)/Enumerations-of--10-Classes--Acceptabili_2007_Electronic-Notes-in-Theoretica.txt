In his construction of computably enumerable (c.e.) sets without repetition, Friedberg utilizes the concept of one c.e. set following another, so that eventually the constructed set will be the one to be followed. We adopt a similar terminology here, but in the context of one tree following another.

Distinct pairwise at level 2i, at stage i, initially some of the si will be marked (ki = m), and in this case, si will continue to follow t(si,m) indefinitely. If si is not marked (ki = n), we then determine whether si should be marked. If marking is necessary, we establish a tree t(si,m) for si to follow thereafter. Otherwise, each si continues to follow t(si,n), and the stage is considered complete.
