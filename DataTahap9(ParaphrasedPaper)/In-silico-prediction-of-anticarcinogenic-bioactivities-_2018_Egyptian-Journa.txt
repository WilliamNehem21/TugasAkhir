Computer-aided prediction studies in drug design, which utilize activity spectra for substances (PASS) database, help in the identification and treatment of diseases using novel biomarkers. The PASS database, which comprises 46,000 biologically well-known active drugs, is used to screen substances before conducting in vitro experiments. The database provides important bioactivity information for chemical compounds, distinguishing between probable activity (PA) and probable inactivity (PI) values. Compounds with PA values higher than 0.7 are likely to be active in experiments, while PI values indicate their inactivity possibilities. Additionally, the ADMET-SAR chemoinformatics tool is employed to predict the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of specific compounds, thus aiding in lowering the risk of negative in vitro experiment results.

Furthermore, the clc-pred tool is utilized to predict the cytotoxicity of tumor cell lines based on structure-cell line cytotoxicity relationships crafted by special training sets within the PASS database. This approach exhibits an accuracy rate of 96% when compared to in vivo experimental results, enabling the identification and optimization of compounds with potential anti-cancer properties. Predicted cytotoxicity results against various human cell lines are indicated by PA values greater than 0.5, signifying considerable probability of action, while PI values indicate inactivity.

In order to determine common medicinal treatments for specific ailments, the study considers the individual with the most use-reports. The use-reports collected from ethnic people are used to calculate the use value (UV), which underscores the usage priority, importance, recommendation, and sharing of medicinal knowledge about particular species among informants. The study highlights the use of Abutilon indicum (L.) Sweet, Lawsonia inermis L., and Lycopersicon esculentum Mill as wound healing agents, as well as their potential in cancer treatment based on traditional reports. Notably, Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, Butea monosperma, and Tribulus terrestris exhibit predicted cytotoxicity activity that significantly correlates with the literature survey. Compounds derived from these plants demonstrate significant anticancer activity according to clc-pred prediction and PASS tools. This study presents noteworthy evidence of the relationship between anti-inflammatory plants and cancer, illustrating the potential to develop new pharmaceutical drugs based on ethno-pharmacological therapies and accelerate the interpretative analysis of ethnic anti-inflammatory plants in the development of anti-cancer drugs.
