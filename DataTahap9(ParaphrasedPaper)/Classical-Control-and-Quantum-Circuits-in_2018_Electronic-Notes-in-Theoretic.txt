This academic paper discusses categorical models of a circuit-based quantum functional programming language, emphasizing the role of enriched categories. The paper explores the use of enriched categories in interpreting the quantum functional programming language within a more powerful host language, and considers the integration of high-level features such as higher-order functions and recursive types with quantum computation.

The paper also examines the connection between physics and higher-order quantum functions, highlighting the potential impact on quantum algorithms. It introduces a higher-order host language that includes a special type for circuits and proposes a categorical model for the embedded circuit language in terms of enriched categories.

The paper includes examples of categorical models for quantum computation and qwire, as well as a discussion on the relevance of set-enriched copowers to quantum algorithms. It also presents an operational semantics and proposes the use of w*-algebras and dcpos to provide a denotational semantics to the quantum Fourier transform.

Finally, the paper acknowledges the contributions of various individuals and organizations to the research leading to these results and the funding received for the project.
