The ability to provide high-quality services is now achievable, as an increasing number of devices are being connected to the internet, with an estimated 10 billion devices in use in various industries. The role of Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Networks (CRWSN) in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to be substantial in the future. Ongoing research and development efforts are focusing on wireless sensor networks (WSN) for issues such as energy efficiency, load balancing, and congestion control, with recent publications available [33,34].

This paper proposes a node clustering protocol for CRWSN, utilizing evolutionary game theory in the design process. Various characteristics of CRWSN, including node mobility, available communication channels, residual energy of nodes, and geographic locations, are taken into account as input parameters for the clustering algorithm.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work and the background of this study. Section 3 outlines the system model, while Section 4 presents the proposed protocol. The theoretical analysis of the protocol is discussed in Section 5, followed by the presentation of simulation results related to the performance evaluation of the proposed protocol in Section 6. The paper concludes in Section 7.

Several papers related to game theory-based node clustering for wireless sensor networks and CRWSN are highlighted. These include proposals for game theory-cluster-based routing protocols, a game theory-based clustering algorithm, and an evolutionary game-based routing protocol for wireless multimedia sensor networks.

In addition, various spectrum-aware clustering approaches and network stability aware clustering protocols have been proposed for CRWSN, taking into account factors such as power consumption, spectrum dynamics, and network stability. Furthermore, the paper discusses the deployment of nodes in inaccessible and hostile environments, considering energy consumption models and the formation of clusters in CRWSN. Evolutionary game theory and its relevance to the selection of cluster head nodes are also described.

The paper presents evidence of its unique approach, including the use of evolutionary game theory in the selection of cluster head nodes and the comparison of performance with existing protocols such as LEACH. Furthermore, the paper outlines the criteria for evaluating the quality of selected cluster head nodes based on energy levels and geographical distribution.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the significance of CRWSN in the context of the Industrial Internet of Things, and the potential impact of evolutionary game theory in optimizing the performance of wireless sensor networks.
