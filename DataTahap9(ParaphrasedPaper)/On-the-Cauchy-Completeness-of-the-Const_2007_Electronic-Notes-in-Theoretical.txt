In each instance, counterexamples are developed as part of the methodology. These counterexamples can be represented using either topological models or Kripke models. Despite some known connections between topological and Kripke models, it is unclear to the author whether the natural models in the given cases are actually identical. While the family resemblance is evident (compare the definition of jmax), there is an open set k containing sup j0 such that r is bounded by sup k. Since r is also bounded below by sup j0, r (specifically, rng(r\q0)) is contained within k. Given (q0, k) h f(n)= m, r|= f(n)= m.
