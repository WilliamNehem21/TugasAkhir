The physiological indicators of human well-being, such as heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), respiration rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), are crucial for monitoring the health of individuals. Heart rate, which is central to the cardiovascular process, reflects the body's cardiac output and is therefore essential for health monitoring. Heart diseases, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, heart attack, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, heart valve disease, and heart infection, have been the leading causes of death in recent decades, highlighting the importance of monitoring vital signs.

Biofeedback practices focus on controlling cardiac dynamics, with HR and HRV being key metrics. While HR measures the average number of heartbeats per minute, HRV assesses the specific variations in time between successive heartbeats, which is important for analyzing the behavior of the autonomic nervous system, particularly in diabetic and post-infarction patients. A comprehensive understanding of these vital signs is crucial for detecting potential cardiovascular disorders.

The paper proceeds with a review of contact-free vital sign monitoring in Section 2, followed by the introduction of the proposed Mibinet in Section 3, along with pre- and post-processing techniques. Section 4 presents the numerical results, and Section 5 provides a discussion of the findings, limitations, and strengths of Mibinet. Notably, the paper introduces a novel approach allowing for adaptability and versatility, particularly in addressing irregularities in heart rate and other cardiac conditions, which is essential for real-world applications.

The authors identify challenges related to training deep learning-based models due to significant variations in the distribution of inter-beat interval (IBI) values in the training and test sets. To address this, they propose a novel data augmentation approach. Additionally, the paper describes techniques for adapting neural networks to handle the dimensions of the input and output data, emphasizing the need for flexibility in accommodating radar data that may not adhere to predefined constraints.

The proposed CNN architecture, Mibinet, aims to balance computational efficiency and high prediction accuracy for estimating IBI values, thereby offering a lightweight and efficient real-time heart rate monitoring solution. Experimental data analysis evaluates the system's performance using the Pearson correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) as metrics, comparing it with state-of-the-art methodologies.

The paper further demonstrates the robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach through evaluation on datasets containing ECG, PCG, and PPG signals. Notably, the performance of Mibinet was found to be superior to that of hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM) across all modalities. The introduction of a novel weighted regression loss function and an IBI augmentation technique led to significant performance improvements, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
