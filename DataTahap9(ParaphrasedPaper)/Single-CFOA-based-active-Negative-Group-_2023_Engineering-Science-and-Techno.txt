In this paper, we introduced nine novel ngd circuits based on second-order single current feedback operation amplifier (cfoa), which were designed using a computer-aided design approach. These circuits have potential applications in communication and control. Section 2 provides an overview of the ngd circuit theory, introduces the cfoa, reviews existing literature on active ngd topologies, and presents the newly developed circuits. Section 3 outlines the circuit design methodology, while section 4 presents a study on the non-ideal aspects of a specific ngd circuit. Section 5 focuses on the simulation and experimental validations of the circuits, and section 6 includes a performance comparison with existing solutions. Finally, the study is concluded in section 7.
