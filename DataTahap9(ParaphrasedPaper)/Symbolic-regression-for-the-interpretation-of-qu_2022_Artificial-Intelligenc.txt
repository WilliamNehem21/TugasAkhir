Symbolic regression (SR) is a technique used to identify mathematical expressions that can describe a given training dataset. Essentially, an SR expression is composed of a combination of arithmetic operators, mathematical functions, and variables or numerical constants. Unlike the fixed functional form used in multiplicative/divisive engineered features in machine learning regression (MLR), SR expressions do not rely on a predetermined form. This gives SR the potential to represent explicit expressions for nonlinear quantitative structure-activity relationships/quantitative structure-property relationships (QSARs/QSPRs) without prior knowledge of the expression's functional form. Due to the vast search space of expressions and their intrinsic complexity, interpreting even the simplest SR expressions visually can be challenging. Even worse, such expressions may fail to effectively explain the training data. For instance, an expression comprising two arccos and two arctan functions, where the number of aliphatic heterocycles (NALIHC) appears in multiple terms, proved difficult to interpret visually and, ultimately, did not adequately explain the training data. Conversely, the most complex expression achieved an R-squared value of 0.98 for the training dataset, indicating a strong fit to the training data.
