In this paper, we propose a time series model for analyzing China's foreign direct investment (FDI) trends using wavelet analysis, intervention analysis, and time series analysis. The aim is to provide the government with an effective tool for monitoring economic variables and developing informed policies. By employing wavelet analysis, our model reduces noise interference to improve the accuracy of FDI trend prediction. Additionally, the ARIMA-GARCH-M model is used to describe autocorrelation and time-varying volatility in the financial time series. The simulation results indicate that our model effectively captures the dynamic structure of China's FDI trends.

FDI plays a crucial role in acquiring advanced technology and knowledge, mitigating financial constraints in economic development, and facilitating technology and talent transfer. Therefore, understanding the quantitative rules of FDI, accurately predicting and controlling risks, and maximizing benefits hold significant practical value for the government. We propose further study into nonlinear and time-varying fluctuations of FDI to better forecast its future development.

Our research builds upon previous studies by Jing Ma and Guoqing Zhao (2009) and Chunlin Li and Huiyan Wang (2011), who examined chaotic attractors in China's FDI using logistic and intervention-ARIMA models, respectively. By leveraging wavelet theory and intervention models, we aim to effectively eliminate random fluctuations and noise interference in FDI prediction.

Using data from 1985 to 1997, we employ wavelet threshold de-noising to decompose and reconstruct FDI signals. This method limits the threshold for wavelet coefficients after decomposition to minimize noise interference and enhance predictive accuracy.

While our study focuses on the actual changes in FDI, it is important to consider other influencing factors such as foreign trade structure. Multivariate time series analysis will be a key area of focus in future research to improve the accuracy of FDI trend prediction.
