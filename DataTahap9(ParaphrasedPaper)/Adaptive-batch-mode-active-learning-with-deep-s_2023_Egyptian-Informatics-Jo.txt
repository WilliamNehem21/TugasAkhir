Due to the scarcity of labeled data, many active learning algorithms have focused on identifying the most relevant data from a set of unlabeled instances. These algorithms typically choose one instance at a time to query an expert, and repeat this process until the desired accuracy or labeling budget is achieved. The key challenge for algorithms with limited budgets lies in the selection of instances, as a tendency towards homogeneity in the selected instances can lead to wasted expert input. Therefore, diversity is an essential aspect of active learning in addition to information retrieval.

However, existing batch mode active learning (BMAL) algorithms mainly confront two issues. Firstly, the measurement of similarity between instances significantly impacts the algorithm's performance, with some algorithms exhibiting less diversity than others. Our research aims to design an effective batch mode active learning algorithm that can enhance the performance of classifiers when labeled data is scarce and label costs are high. We need to overcome two key challenges: finding a better way to measure similarity, and developing a strategy for selecting instances that are both informative and diverse. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive BMAL method that uses deep neural networks to learn similarity and balance exploration and exploitation.

In our proposed method, a convolutional neural network is employed to classify instances. The penultimate layer of the network provides the learned instance feature representation, and the inner product of feature vectors is used to measure the similarity between instances. The training process of our neural network has two objectives: to improve the accuracy of training models, and to enhance the accuracy of similarity measurement between instances.

Our proposed approach makes novel contributions that have not been explored in previous research. We aim to develop a multi-class active learning method to automatically label video data and to address several practical sample selection strategies while advancing active learning to handle multi-class problems. Additionally, our method focuses on overcoming the limitations of existing algorithms by selecting informative and diverse instances in a more efficient way.

In summary, our work presents an adaptive batch mode active learning algorithm with deep similarity that effectively integrates with deep neural networks to address the challenges of maximizing information while minimizing redundancy in a proactive manner. We propose a strategy that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation to select informative and diverse instances, ultimately reducing the workload of manual annotation and ensuring classifier accuracy.
