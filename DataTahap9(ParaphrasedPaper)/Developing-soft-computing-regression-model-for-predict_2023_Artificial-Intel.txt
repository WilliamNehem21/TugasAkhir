This study investigates several dimensionless parameters, including the anisotropic strength ratio, dimensionless eccentricity, load inclination angle, and adhesion factor to the bearing capacity factor. A novel model is also proposed to predict the bearing capacity factor for undrained footings on anisotropic clay using an advanced data-driven method (MOGA-EPR). This model takes into account anisotropy, eccentricity, and load inclination, and can be used confidently in routine shallow foundation designs under undrained conditions with consideration of clay anisotropic strengths.

However, there is still a need to study the bearing capacity factor under eccentric loading while considering the anisotropy of the clay. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of undrained strength anisotropy on footing bearing capacity under eccentric and inclined loading. The study employs numerical analysis using the upper and lower bound FELA framework. Additionally, the study disregards four input dimensionless parameters related to the horizontal force on the footing, resulting in reduced influence of the adhesion factor on the bearing capacity. This means that the adhesion factor plays a less significant role when the horizontal force is negligible compared to the vertical force. Furthermore, an increase in anisotropic strength ratio leads to a higher bearing capacity factor due to the isotropic clay properties, while an increase in eccentric length results in a lower bearing capacity factor, as higher eccentricity often reduces the effectiveness of the force imparted to the footing.
