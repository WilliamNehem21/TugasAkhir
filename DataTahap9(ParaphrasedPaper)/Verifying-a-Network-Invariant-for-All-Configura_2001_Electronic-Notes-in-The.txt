This paper presents a network invariant applicable to all configurations of the futurebus+ cache coherence protocol, derived using the Pax tool and verified using a model checker. By leveraging this invariant, the authors successfully demonstrate the correctness of a cache coherence specification for an arbitrary number of components on a single bus within the system. They also extend this proof to tree-shaped systems, providing what they believe to be the first uniform proof of the protocol with multiple data buses. 

Previous efforts to verify the IEEE Futurebus+ protocol have not uniformly proven its correctness for all instances of the parameterized network, or have only verified a subset of the cache coherence specification. The authors' approach builds upon methods described in earlier works and utilizes a model based on weak second-order logic of one successor (WS1S) to describe the dynamic behavior of the parameterized network. The paper provides a detailed description of the method and outlines the steps involved in constructing the network invariant.

The authors note the challenges involved in minimizing the model of the system while ensuring the accuracy of the verification process. The paper discusses the construction of the network invariant and its adaptation to the synchronous parallel composition. Furthermore, it describes the cache coherence protocol and the various states and transitions involved in the system's behavior.

The work also includes a discussion of the role of the bus-bridge and its interaction with the individual components within the system. The authors highlight the significance of the results obtained and establish the network invariant for the single-bus case. The paper concludes by comparing their work to related research and emphasizing the utility of their semi-automatic verification method in enhancing confidence in the established proof.

Overall, the paper underscores the significance of their approach in demonstrating the correctness of the Futurebus+ protocol and its potential applications in effectively verifying complex systems.
