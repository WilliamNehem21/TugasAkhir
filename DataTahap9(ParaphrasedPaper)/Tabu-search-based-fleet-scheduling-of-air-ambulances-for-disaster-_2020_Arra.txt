Efficient scheduling of air assets is of paramount importance, particularly in emergency medical service (EMS) systems, where poor scheduling can have life-or-death consequences, especially during hospital transfers and disaster scenarios. This issue is further exacerbated in the context of air ambulance operations, due to the vast distances and dispersed populations involved, along with limited resources. While there are established methodologies for scheduling missions, the computational burden increases significantly with larger problem spaces. In this study, a specific integer linear programming model was formulated using known coordinates of air and health facilities, and implemented and compared against custom algorithmic solutions using Gurobi. Two methods, based on neighborhood search and tabu search, were developed, with the latter outperforming the former in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, parallel variations utilizing CUDA did not significantly improve computation time for larger problem instances.

In disaster scenarios, the effectiveness of an EMS system, particularly in the case of air ambulances, is pivotal, as these vehicles must operate over extensive distances in areas with dispersed populations. Efficient scheduling is crucial for managing these challenges and ensuring the timely and effective transport of patients. This study builds upon prior research into the optimization of air asset staging and positioning and is part of a broader effort directed at air ambulance management. While previous exact methodologies have been proposed, the NP-hard nature of scheduling makes finding optimal solutions time-consuming, hence the value of near-optimal metaheuristics.

The paper is organized as follows: it reviews related work in Section 2, outlines the problem modeling in Section 3, presents algorithmic solutions in Section 4, showcases the results in Section 5, and concludes in Section 6. Additionally, a study by Repoussis et al. employed a hybrid multi-start local search approach for scheduling and routing large casualty disasters, achieving a reduced response time and minimized resource utilization.

Scheduling of air ambulances involves predetermined base positions and time-sensitive considerations, such as patients arriving at specific periods due to urgent incidents or specialized care transfers. The scheduling problem addressed in this study focuses on a subset of bases with assigned vehicles, aiming to minimize total travel time.

Due to constraints, a random initialization approach may not always yield a valid solution. Therefore, an algorithm was developed to find an initialized organization for optimization, with an emphasis on guaranteeing the existence of a solution. Moreover, parallelism was integrated into the algorithm using CUDA, leveraging concurrent thread organization to expedite computations.

Another algorithm was devised to minimize the total travel time by organizing missions and bases efficiently. This algorithm aims to move missions to new bases to optimize travel time and is designed to be performed through multiple instances to approach near-optimal results.

A further algorithm, a modified version of the previous one, incorporates a tabu list to prevent re-exploration of recent neighborhoods and mitigate the risk of becoming trapped in a local minimum.

Eight datasets based on known air and health facility coordinates were utilized to test the algorithms, employing the Numba library to optimize program performance through just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The programs were tested on a system with 128 GB of RAM and a 24-core Intel Core i9-7920X X-series processor, with CUDA versions making use of a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics card.
