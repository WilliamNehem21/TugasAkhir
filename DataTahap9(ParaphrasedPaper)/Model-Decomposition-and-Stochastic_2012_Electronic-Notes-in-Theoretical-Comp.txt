This paper presents a technique for breaking down, simplifying, and recreating the stochastic behavior of rule-based systems with a conserved number of agents. The process involves abstracting by counting fragments rather than species, allowing for the decomposition of the rule-set into smaller units. These smaller units exhibit dynamics that, when combined, accurately reflect the species-based dynamics of the original larger system. The paper also explores how to reconstruct the transient species-based dynamics given certain initial distributions. It is demonstrated that for reversible rules, reconstruction of species-based dynamics is always possible at the stationary distribution. The method is illustrated through a case study of colloidal aggregation, showcasing its ability to exponentially reduce the state space compared to a standard species-based description.

The study highlights the complex internal relationships within signaling proteins, emphasizing the challenge of analyzing models that are based on full molecular complexes. The authors propose a bottom-up approach to determine the effective dimension of the state-space, identifying the effective degrees of freedom of each agent.

The paper begins by explaining the encoding of rule-based models and the assignment of stochastic semantics to them. It then delves into the fragment-based abstraction, rule set decomposition, and their relationship in more detail. A model of colloidal aggregation is used to illustrate the state space reduction potential of the method. The practical aspects of using the fragment-based abstraction are reviewed, particularly the reconstruction of probability distributions over the species-based system from the fragment-based abstraction for certain initial distributions. The conditions for a valid abstraction are also discussed, known in the literature as weak lumpability or uniform backward bisimulation. The concept of interpreting states and lumped states in terms of variable valuations is explored within this context.

The paper also provides an overview of the dynamics of a rule-based model and its application to a reaction mixture, along with a formalization of agent identification. The site graph and set of variables associated with the rule set are described, along with the stochastic fragments.
