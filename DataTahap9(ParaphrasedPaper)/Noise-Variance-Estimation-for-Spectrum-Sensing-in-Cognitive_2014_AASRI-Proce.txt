Spectrum sensing is utilized in cognitive radio systems to identify vacant spectrum bands for secondary utilization. Commonly used spectrum sensing techniques, such as energy detection and eigenspace analysis based on random matrix theory (RMT), encounter challenges in accurately estimating the noise variance, thereby impacting their performance. In this study, we propose a novel method for assessing the noise variance, aiming to overcome the limitations associated with existing schemes. This method estimates the noise variance using a set of measurements obtained from either noisy signals or noise-only signals. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in assessing the radio spectrum.

Spectrum sensing is an active approach used in cognitive radio systems to discover underutilized spectrum bands for opportunistic access. Various spectrum sensing approaches exist, depending on factors such as the hardware used for sensing, sensing entities, sensing dissemination, and sensing techniques. The reliability of a sensing technique relies on its ability to accurately ascertain the presence or absence of licensed user signals in the target frequency band. The primary signal detection hypotheses can be categorized as transmitter detection, interference-based detection, and receiver detection.

Our paper presents a noise variance estimation technique that aims to address the limitations of current blind spectrum sensing techniques. Both energy detection and eigenvalue-based techniques rely on noise variance in their hypothesis testing, making them susceptible to inaccuracies in noise variance estimation. This uncertainty can significantly impact their accuracy, potentially resulting in missed detection of spectrum opportunities or interference with primary users. Our proposed method for noise variance estimation can be utilized to set decision thresholds for energy detection-based spectrum sensing and to calculate upper and lower bounds of eigenvalues using the Marchenko-Pastur law.

The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through extensive simulations, demonstrating its efficiency in estimating the noise variance. Various signals are considered in the simulations to evaluate the proposed scheme. In the subsequent section, the scheme's performance is further assessed through extensive simulations, and the mean error in estimated noise variance is evaluated by varying parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of measurements, and number of samples per measurement.

To address the noise estimation challenge, we consider multiple sets of measurements (denoted as "m") from the same portion of the radio spectrum, each comprising "n" samples. A single measurement set of the signal is represented as "sm(n)," where "m" signifies a distinct measurement and "n" denotes the number of samples for the measurement. By employing this approach, we aim to effectively address the noise estimation problem and enhance the accuracy of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems.
