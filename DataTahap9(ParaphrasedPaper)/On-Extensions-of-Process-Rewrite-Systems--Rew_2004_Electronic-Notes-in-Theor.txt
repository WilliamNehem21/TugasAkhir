The paper provides a review of fundamental definitions and characteristics of PRS and FCPRS in sections 2 and 3. It introduces weak unit PRS (WPRS) and mentions state-extended PRS in section 4. Section 5 demonstrates the relationships between the new classes and existing ones, as well as the hierarchical structure of PRS and relevant classes of extended PRS.

Furthermore, the proof shows that the application of a PAD rewrite rule can only alter one live ready parallel component, indicating that it is impossible to deadlock more than one live ready parallel component with a single application of a PAD rewrite rule.
