The absence of bioinformatics tools for rapid evaluation of protein conformational and topological features prompted the creation of an integrated and user-friendly R package, Fiscore. The package incorporates a pipeline for Gaussian mixture modeling, thus facilitating the accessibility of machine learning methods to non-experts. This is particularly important as probabilistic machine learning techniques can enhance the understanding of complex biological phenomena and aid in the elucidation of various structural features relevant to protein function. Fiscore is built upon the mathematical formulation of protein physicochemical properties with potential applications in drug discovery, target evaluation, and relational database construction. Additionally, the package offers interactive environments for exploring various features of interest and aims to engage structural bioinformaticians in the development of more robust and freely available R tools to assist researchers outside of the field. Version 0.1.3 of the Fiscore package is freely distributed via CRAN and GitHub.

Moreover, the package employs the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale to identify hydrophobic regions in proteins, enabling the detection of regions with positive (hydrophobic) and negative (hydrophilic) values. The hydrophobicity analysis is valuable in engineering proteins for different expression systems, as it can aid in determining the likelihood of a protein region or domain being solvent exposed or preferring hydrophobic environments. For example, this tool can assist in selecting terminal sites for tagging and has broad applications in drug discovery studies involving protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and membrane association events based on physicochemical characteristics.

Furthermore, the package allows users to test additional clustering options beyond the automated Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) output. It is crucial for users to assess the BIC output to decide on the model and cluster number to explore. The package also incorporates 3D visualization of dihedral angle distribution for every residue and provides density plots for evaluating the separation of protein structural elements and the quality of protein structure based on dihedral angles, B-factors, or Fiscores. Through scoring and machine learning methods, Fiscore enables the identification of shared and functionally related features in proteins, streamlining the process of protein structural data mining and classification without the need for extensive visual inspections. The interactive analytical and visualization tools provided by Fiscore are poised to be particularly relevant in pharmaceutical research and drug discovery studies, where the assessment of complex targets and protein-protein interactions requires a streamlined approach. These analytical principles can be instrumental in accelerating target classification, target-ligand studies, and the integration of machine learning in therapeutic development.

In summary, Fiscore was developed to simplify complex analytical steps for researchers without extensive backgrounds in structural bioinformatics or machine learning, enabling their use for various analyses, such as protein engineering, protein assessment, and data storage based on specific target sites. The translation of structural data into parameters through Fiscore could expedite target classification, target-ligand studies, and the integration of machine learning, thereby improving our ability to assess new targets and develop better therapeutics.
