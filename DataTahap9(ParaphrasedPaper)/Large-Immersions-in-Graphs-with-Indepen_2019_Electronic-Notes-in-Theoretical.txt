The minor order and immersion order are distinct and cannot be directly compared. For instance, the group of planar graphs, which does not include k5 as a minor, does contain all cliques as immersions. Conversely, the group of graphs with maximum degree at most 3, which does not include k4 as an immersion, does contain all cliques as minors.

However, despite their differences, both relations share significant similarities. Both are well-quasi-orders, as demonstrated by Robertson and Seymour. Moreover, if a graph g contains a graph h as a topological minor, then g also contains h as both a minor and an immersion. This observation has led to the formulation of a conjecture by Lescure and Meyniel, as well as by Abu-Khzam and Langston, possibly inspired by these shared similarities.

The remainder of this extended abstract is dedicated to proving Theorem 1.5. The proof of Theorem 1.6 is based on similar ideas, but is more complex. Interested readers are referred to elsewhere for the proof of Theorem 1.6, as well as for the proof of Theorem 1.7.
