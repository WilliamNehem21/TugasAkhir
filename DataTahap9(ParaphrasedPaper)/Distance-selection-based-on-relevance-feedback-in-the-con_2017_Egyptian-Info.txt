The paper discusses the challenges in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems and the need to bridge the semantic gap problem to improve user satisfaction. It highlights the discrepancy between user relevance perspective and system relevance in CBIR, stressing the importance of reducing this gap. The proposed approach involves using 18 different matching measures, such as distances, similarities, quasi-distances, and divergences, and employs the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) algorithm with one round and relevance feedback to identify the best matching measure for a specific query. The study aims to enhance the distance-selection paradigm in CBIR and demonstrates promising results in terms of precision, recall, and utility value. Sections 2, 3, and 4 detail the approach, experimental setup, and results, respectively. Overall, the paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenges in CBIR systems and offers valuable insights for improving retrieval precision and user satisfaction.
