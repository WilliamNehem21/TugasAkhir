The automatic classification of lung diseases in computed tomography (CT) images is an important tool for computer-aided diagnosis systems. This study presents a new technique for extracting features from lung CT images to classify different lung diseases. The proposed method combines Gabor filters and Walsh-Hadamard transform features using a novel fusion approach with median absolute deviation (MAD) technique, which offers advantages of both models. The system consists of three stages: preprocessing and feature extraction using the fusion technique, feature selection using genetic algorithm, and classification using decision tree, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) classifiers. The system achieved a classification accuracy of over 90% with the MLP-NN classifier using a total of 400 datasets for training and testing, including bronchitis, emphysema, pleural effusion, and normal lung images. The proposed system showed promising results in classifying lung diseases in real CT images.

In recent years, medical CT images have been widely used for clinical diagnosis, enabling accurate detection and localization of pathological changes. CT images can distinguish different tissues based on their gray levels, and they play a crucial role in patient diagnosis, therapy, and medical reference. The digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standard allows storing textual descriptions along with the images, making it a valuable breakthrough in diagnostic radiology. CT imaging has advanced in terms of speed and resolution, becoming a valuable tool for lung imaging. Previous studies have suggested CT lung image classification with correction for perfusion gradient.

Preprocessing techniques, such as median filtering and morphological smoothing, were applied to remove noise and enhance the quality of images. Feature extraction involves creating new features by combining existing ones to distinguish regions of interest. The study extracted texture features and pixel coefficient values to analyze textures present in medical images using statistical methods. Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) was used to extract features such as sum, mean, min, max, and median from the images. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, a typical instance-based prediction model, was employed to classify samples based on the majority class of their k closest neighbors using the Euclidean distance. Furthermore, precision, recall, and F-measure were calculated for the J48, KNN, and MLP-NN classifiers.

The study proposed a novel fusion-based feature extraction method and utilized genetic algorithms for feature selection. The classification was performed using J48, KNN, and MLP-NN classifiers based on texture and pixel coefficient features. The system demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting lung diseases, achieving a classification accuracy of 91.53% for the proposed feature extraction method. The results support the use of the fusion approach with the genetic algorithm and classifier, indicating its potential for further development to classify various types of lung diseases. The developed classification system has the potential to provide valuable diagnosis for physicians and can be extended by incorporating additional feature extraction and selection methods for classifying more lung diseases.
