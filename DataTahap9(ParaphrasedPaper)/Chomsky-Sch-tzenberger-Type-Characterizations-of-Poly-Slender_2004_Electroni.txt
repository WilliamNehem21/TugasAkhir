Motivated by issues encountered in cryptography, the concept of "slender languages" is introduced in this paper, referring to languages that have a limited number of words of any length. Specifically, the paper focuses on the Richelieu cryptosystem, which involves encrypting a plaintext using a key of length n to produce a ciphertext of the same length as the encryption key. The intended recipient can easily decode the original text if they possess the key. However, challenges arise when transmitting all possible keys to the recipient. To alleviate the complexity of decoding, the keys should be drawn from a slender language, enabling the recipient to test only a limited number of keys for each ciphertext. Readers seeking more detailed information are encouraged to refer to additional sources.

The paper also discusses the concept of bounded languages, defined as those that are "k-bounded" for some non-negative integer k, and introduces the notion of "k-poly-slender" languages, which have a number of words of length n that grows no faster than O(n^k). Additionally, the paper presents the concept of a "k-dyck loop" and explores the closure properties of families of k-poly-slender context-free languages under homomorphisms.

Furthermore, the paper presents a theorem that suggests the existence of a homomorphism between alphabets, as well as a corresponding slender regular language, for every poly-slender context-free language over a given alphabet. This result has implications for the fundamental properties of k-poly-slender context-free languages.

Lastly, the paper introduces a new symbol "#" and defines an operation for transforming words in order to devise a mechanism for addressing the issues discussed in the context of the cryptography problems.
