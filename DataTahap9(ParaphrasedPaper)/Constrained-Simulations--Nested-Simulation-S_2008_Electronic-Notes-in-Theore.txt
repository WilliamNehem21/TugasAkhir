The paper explores the various semantics proposed for assigning formal meanings to processes within the context of process algebras. Due to the broad applicability and diverse uses of process algebras, there is no single prevailing notion of semantics, but rather a range of proposals stemming from different approaches, contexts, and applications.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents preliminaries, notation, and basic definitions, while in Section 3, the authors introduce constrained simulations that lead to general results, such as the existence of a conditional axiomatization for any member of the family of semantics. Section 4 further elaborates on the classic nested simulation semantics, while Section 5 delves into a generalization of nested simulation semantics using constrained simulations. Section 6 introduces a bisimulation-like game for the (generalized) nested simulations semantics, termed the counting bisimulation game. Finally, the paper concludes in Section 7, discussing some avenues for future research in the field.

The paper also demonstrates that other semantics can be characterized with bisimulations up-to, as seen in the case of the n-nested simulation semantics. However, due to the lack of a finite unconditional axiomatization for the n-nested simulation semantics, the authors propose a coinductive characterization of the nested simulation semantics based on counting bisimulations and bisimulations up-to in Section 6.

Building upon the results presented in Section 3, the paper proposes a parameterized generalization of the definition of nested simulations in Definition 4.2, which retains the nesting of simulations but is now parameterized by any behavior preorder r.

The primary tool utilized for developing most of the results in the paper is the concept of constrained simulations, which is a generalization of the ready simulation explored in previous research by the authors. Several results for constrained simulations are presented in the paper, including the existence of a conditional axiomatization that can be applied in a broad setting.

In continuation of their previous research, the authors address the problem of finding a coinductive characterization for the nested semantics by introducing the counting bisimulation game, which, when combined with the bisimulation up-to technique, allows for the characterization of the (generalized) nested simulation semantics. The counting bisimulation fills the gap between simulation and bisimulation semantics.

The paper also outlines future plans to extend the results to the framework of nested trace semantics, with the ultimate goal of achieving a coinductive characterization for every semantics in the linear time-branching time spectrum. This endeavor is expected to be more challenging due to the less elegant definition of nested trace semantics and the use of traces instead of single actions in their transitions, as well as the distinction from the nested trace simulation semantics laid out in Section 5.
