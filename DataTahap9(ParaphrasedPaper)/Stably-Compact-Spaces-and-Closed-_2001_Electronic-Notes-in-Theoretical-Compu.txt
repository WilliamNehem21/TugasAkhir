Our second motivation arises from the intention to address some of the challenges associated with traditional domain theory. It is well documented that in order to construct a cartesian closed category of continuous domains, one must confine the study to a subcategory of fs-domains. Unlike general continuous domains, there is no straightforward characterization of fs-domains through their stone dual. Due to the relative limitations of our tools for studying fs-domains, fundamental questions about them remain unresolved, such as whether they are equivalent to retracts of bifinite domains or if the probabilistic powerdomain can be restricted to this category.

Subsequently, we explore the stone duality of closed relations. The morphisms between the lattices of open sets that correspond to closed relations are shown to be preframe homomorphisms, preserving finite meets and directed suprema. While similar studies have been conducted in the past (refer to [26, prop. 11.2.5]), the duality with relations appears to be a novel contribution.

This work extends the traditional scenario of functions between stably compact spaces (or, more broadly, locally compact sober spaces), as outlined in [10, remark 1.3]. Considering that the stone dual of a function has an upper adjoint, perfectness in this context can be further characterized by the adjoint being Scott-continuous (loc. cit.). According to Corollary 3.7, we establish that a continuous function between stably compact spaces is perfect in the classical sense if and only if the corresponding relation given by the hypergraph is perfect in our sense.
