The study involved training four neural networks and analyzing the co-activation patterns of their nodes. The co-activation rates were calculated using a test set to identify rare co-activations and categorize the inputs as correct, incorrect, or untrained. The findings suggest that rare co-activations could be useful in detecting drift in incoming data and identifying inputs from untrained classes. However, distinguishing between correctly and incorrectly predicted inputs based solely on rare co-activations may be challenging and requires further investigation.

The study utilized fashion-mnist dataset, and while it is widely used, its application in an industrial network would strengthen the generalizability of the results. The study aims to contribute to understanding how rare co-activations can be used to detect errors and promote fault tolerance in neural networks.

In conclusion, the findings suggest that rare co-activations are more prevalent in untrained inputs than in inputs the network was trained to handle. Monitoring rare co-activations could be instrumental in detecting drift in incoming data. However, detecting single incorrect predictions solely based on rare co-activations may not be feasible. Further research is needed to identify the most indicative rare co-activations for incorrect predictions. Additionally, applying the approach in an actual industrial setting would provide greater insight into the practical utility of the findings.
