The logop coordination model, which builds upon the linda model, enables a single coordination operation to dynamically address multiple possibly distributed tuple spaces. This design raises important issues relevant to the coordination and distributed systems engineering fields, particularly in the context of supporting coordination laws involving multiple physically distributed tuple spaces. Such an infrastructure must carefully handle aspects related to synchrony, atomicity, locality of interactions, and global interpretation of coordination rules.

In this paper, we investigate logop, a coordination model that extends basic linda by enabling coordination primitives involving more than one tuple space simultaneously. This feature allows coordination rules to be defined on-the-fly by forming extended scopes of visibility through the joining of different and possibly distributed tuple spaces. The significance of this model lies not only in its enhanced expressiveness and flexibility, but also in the critical issues it raises regarding governing interactions in distributed systems, which are of general interest in the coordination and distributed systems engineering domains. The expression of coordination laws involving physically distributed tuple spaces necessitates careful consideration of synchrony, atomicity, locality of interactions, and global interpretation of coordination rules. These issues are pivotal in the broader context where the infrastructure consists of a distributed coordination space populated by mutually interacting coordination abstractions.

While linda is widely recognized as the first and most successful coordination model, its balance between simplicity and expressiveness has made it a core model for various extensions addressing concerns raised by modern applications. These extensions include features such as programmable behavior (respect), transactions and expiring tuples (javaspaces), prolog-like features (shared prolog), scalability (swarmlinda), and mobility (lime).

The xor operator, similar to the or operator, allows for operations on a specified list of tuple spaces, ensuring that the tuple is inserted, read, or withdrawn from only one tuple space at a time. This operator is useful when the client requires assurance that no more than one tuple is retrieved or removed from the specified tuple spaces. The and operator enables processes to consider all tuple spaces in a list, allowing for the storage of a tuple in a list of tuple spaces in a single step.

To address these issues, a coordinated system is explicitly modeled as being divided into a coordinated space (where entities subject to coordination reside), an interaction space (where communication events occur reflecting the dynamics of coordination), and a coordination space (where coordination media such as tuple spaces reside and interact to provide the coordination service). This framework views coordination as an interactive service provided by coordination media, thus focusing on the interactive behavior of coordination media.
