This academic paper introduces a new tool called mlsolver, which is designed to support satisfiability and validity checking for various 1 modal fixpoint logics. Additionally, it can serve as a model checker for these logics, although it is not intended to compete with specialized model checkers for logics like CTL, LTL, etc.

The paper also discusses the problem of solving a parity game, which involves determining the player who has a strategy to win every play starting at a given node. It is established that this problem is well-defined, meaning that exactly one of the players wins at each node.

Furthermore, the paper highlights the challenge of propositional reasoning, which is not explicitly demonstrated by the benchmarks presented. It explains that it is feasible to create formulas that represent binary counters, and that the construction of parity games essentially transforms them into significantly larger disjunctive or conjunctive normal forms. Making decisions about these formulas becomes difficult solely due to the size of the games.
