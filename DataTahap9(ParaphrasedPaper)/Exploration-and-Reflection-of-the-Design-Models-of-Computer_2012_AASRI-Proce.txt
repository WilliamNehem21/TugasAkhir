In 2004, the Guangdong province introduced a computerized English test for college entrance examinations. Subsequently, in 2009, colleges and universities in the province administered the CET band-4 and band-6 exams, and reformed the English listening and speaking tests. Furthermore, in 2011, an online annual exam for over 60 national higher education adults applying for graduate studies was conducted.

The computerized exam primarily involves the use of input devices such as a keyboard and mouse, and also encompasses other devices like touch screens, fluorescence pens, trackballs, and microphones for oral responses. The level of interactivity in these exams varies, with some being non-interactive, where candidates make selections by clicking on the mouse, and others being highly interactive, incorporating multiple steps and branch functions.

Scoring methods are employed to quantify the responses of examinees, and various automatic scoring software, such as PEG, e-rater, intelligent essay assessor, and inQuizit, apply different standards, ranging from shallow characteristics to advanced computational linguistics and methods. After participating in routine tests, candidates move on to an optimizing test, in which the computer estimates their abilities and selects the most optimized test items for each candidate.

The degree of difficulty reflects each candidate's ability to answer all questions correctly. In the error control test mode, there are three variations involving the selection of projects based on candidates' performance. Different methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation, are utilized to estimate students' abilities. There are also considerations for examination venues, including the number of seats and computers, security, test data storage and transmission, and software consistency across all venues for the same exam.
