The paper introduces a policy-based encryption scheme which allows for messages to be encrypted based on a credential-based policy expressed as a monotone boolean expression in standard normal form. Only users possessing a defined set of credentials for the policy are able to decrypt the message. The authors revisit the formal definition of policy-based encryption and present a scheme based on bilinear pairings that improves on existing schemes in terms of the size of the ciphertext while preserving computational efficiency. The paper also explores the use of policy-based encryption for secure establishment of ad-hoc communities. The formalization of the policy-based encryption primitive, including the policy model and notation, is discussed, and a precise definition for policy-based encryption schemes is provided. The security analysis of the proposed scheme is supported by formal security arguments.

Additionally, the paper addresses the concept of policy-based cryptography and its application in various contexts, such as oblivious access control, trust negotiation, and cryptographic workflow. It also discusses how statements about users, such as attributes and privileges, are checked and certified by trusted entities called credential issuers through a digital signature procedure.

Furthermore, the paper leverages a policy-based security framework to demonstrate how policy-based encryption can facilitate the creation of secure ad-hoc communities while adhering to the privacy principle of data minimization. The authors provide an overview of a comprehensive approach for establishing trust within ad-hoc networks and propose security protocols to govern access to services and manage community membership.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of policy-based encryption and its application in securing ad-hoc networks, and it presents a novel encryption scheme based on bilinear pairings that improves on existing schemes. The security analysis of the proposed scheme is detailed, and the paper demonstrates the applicability of policy-based encryption in facilitating secure and privacy-enhanced communication within ad-hoc communities.
