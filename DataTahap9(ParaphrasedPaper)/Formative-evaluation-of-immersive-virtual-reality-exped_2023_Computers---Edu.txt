According to Sheng (2011), virtual reality (VR) enables learners to engage with learning objects in a virtual world, providing a sense of presence and allowing them to interact with these objects without being influenced by physical environmental conditions. Educators are currently exploring the use of VR technologies and applications in various educational settings. Students can benefit from the visualization of abstract concepts and rules, which can facilitate their understanding. Additionally, the importance of VR mini-games in providing opportunities for learners to interact with real-life problems and achieve significant learning goals has been emphasized in the literature.

Considering that the developed prototype is user-centered, Research Question 1 (RQ1) is relevant and motivated by Smutny et al. (2019), who reviewed studies on the use of VR in areas such as safety, travel, history, and engineering education, but not specifically in problem-solving and computational thinking (CT) education. Therefore, this study aims to examine how users perceive the usefulness of the developed VR application in terms of interface, aesthetics, and functionality, facilitating interaction between learners and learning objects in VR.

In Research Question 3 (RQ3), the study seeks to evaluate whether the developed intervention successfully fosters CT education and problem-solving skills. Despite the application of VR in various domains highlighted by Smutny et al. (2019), limited research exists on the specific domains investigated in this study.

Furthermore, Segura et al. (2020) presented a VR game called VR-OCKS, which aimed to teach programming principles to young learners. The evaluation of VR-OCKS revealed that group learners performed better in understanding programming concepts, such as loops and conditional structures.

The study also delves into the essential concept of recursion in CT, wherein learners can address complex problems by formulating solutions and iteratively applying them. This concept has been studied in the context of higher education, revealing that students' prior knowledge and motivation affect their understanding of recursion.

Similarly, the study examines algorithms as a key concept in problem solving, highlighting that students may complicate problems by constructing incorrect models of recursive processes. While previous studies have shown efforts to integrate CT education, interventions often involve course design and computer-based applications, which may provide limited engagement for learners. Thus, the study suggests that an immersive VR game-based approach could make CT learning more engaging and interactive.

The study also discusses the concept of educational games and their potential for efficient learning. It emphasizes the rise in studies promoting the development of educational games for enhanced learning experiences.

The "iThinkSmart" VR application was developed with the Unity game engine, C#, and Firebase cloud resources, with the intention of delivering affordable and accessible education to learners.

The study engaged participants, including those with no background in virtual reality mini-games and who were novices to CT concepts. The targeted users of the "iThinkSmart" VR expedition are early university entrants in Africa who have little or no prior knowledge of computer science or programming.

In addition, the study employed a similar approach to qualitatively evaluate learning experiences and collected feedback to improve the VR application, similar to the approach used by Aloweni et al. (2021).

The study also discusses the importance of interaction and representational fidelity in VR applications, and how these aspects enhance usability. Participants commented on the features of VR mini-games that enhance their usability, such as contextual sound in the virtual world.

The study revealed areas of improvement for the VR expedition mini-games based on participant feedback, including aesthetic aspects, game elements, challenge level, navigation, and speed.

Finally, the study discusses the motivating aspect of the VR expedition mini-games, highlighting the positive impact of motivating learners within a technology-mediated learning environment.

Overall, the study addresses the use of VR in education, particularly in the context of CT and problem-solving skills, and presents findings from the development and evaluation of the "iThinkSmart" VR application.
