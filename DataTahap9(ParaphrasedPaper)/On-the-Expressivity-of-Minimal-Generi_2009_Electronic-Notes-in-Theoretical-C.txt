The absence of any established structural rule within the generic context often appears overly restrictive. There are also issues with the design of the induction rule. Consequently, the interplay between minimal generic quantification and fixed points in linc lacks expressivity, leading to the inability to derive theorems that should logically hold.

At present, the provided automation is limited, exemplified by the tactic "prove" which conducts a focused proof search. While it does handle fixed points as described, it falls short in inferring invariants and is therefore restricted to unfoldings. However, ongoing efforts in this direction hold the promise of significantly enhancing automation in these basic developments. Specifically, simple heuristics could automatically establish instances of all properties proven in this paper. For example, when constructing a derivation with the induction rule in our proofs, the invariant can be deduced from the conclusion. This approach would alleviate the need for bureaucratic lemmas such as strengthening of generic quantification, as well as more nuanced considerations outlined in the subsequent example.

This formulation gives rise to new branches compared to the customary proof method. Nonetheless, these branches are easily handled, and the overall proof does not become more complex than with more traditional contextual concepts. Furthermore, the resulting theorem is marginally more robust than the traditional one, as it allows for richer contexts.
