Many errors in software systems may not be apparent until the system is in operational use, posing severe consequences for users by denying access to the intended services. The conventional approach to addressing such errors involves reporting the issue to the system's producer, investigating and rectifying the error, and issuing a patch or updated release. However, there are several drawbacks to this approach.

One potential source of fatal errors is infinite recursion, which can lead to stack space exhaustion. To address this, our technique limits the stack size and terminates any recursion attempts that exceed this limit. While this may prematurely terminate recursions, it effectively eliminates otherwise fatal infinite recursions.

Memory leaks can also cause a program to fail by depleting its address space. Our memory leak elimination algorithm allocates a fixed-size buffer for potential memory leaks and cyclically allocates data from this buffer. While this may overlay live data, it effectively eliminates any memory leaks at the site.

Another issue is invalid addressing, which can lead to fatal address space corruption or attempts to access invalid parts of the address space. Our invalid addressing elimination technique, also known as failure-oblivious computing, performs bounds checks to discard out-of-bounds writes and generate arbitrary values for out-of-bounds reads. While this may result in the program being unprepared to operate with the manufactured read values, it effectively eliminates out-of-bounds accesses as the immediate cause of fatal errors.
