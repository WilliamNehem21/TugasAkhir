The bioambients model is a versatile framework for representing various aspects of cellular behavior, offering a wide range of operations for molecule movement and interaction. The richness of this model has inspired the exploration of its dialects and comparisons with other computational models. In this study, we investigate the boundary between decidability and undecidability of the reachability and spatial reachability decision problems within semantic and syntactic fragments of bioambients, focusing on movement capabilities and merge. Our findings illustrate the significant impact of merge on properties like reachability compared to other movement operations in bioambients, and establish connections between bioambients and other computational models such as associative-commutative term rewriting and petri nets with transfer arcs.

This paper specifically concentrates on the reachability and spatial reachability decision problems for pure public bioambients with a weak reduction semantics for replication (PBaW). Pure public bioambients (PBA) is a subset of bioambients with only movement capabilities and merge. Unlike the standard semantics, the weak reduction of replication in PBaW only allows the generation of copies of a process. The reachability problem involves determining if a process P0 can be reduced to a process P1, while the spatial reachability problem entails confirming if a process P0 can be reduced to a process P3 with the same ambient structure as P1, and such that each ambient in P3 contains at least the same collection of local agents as the corresponding ambient in P1. Spatial reachability was originally introduced for mobile ambients. Our objective is to explore the boundary between decidability and undecidability for these two decision problems by making different assumptions about the syntax of PBaW.

The plan of this paper is as follows: Section 2 defines pure public bioambients, Section 3 defines TUCM and discusses the decidability result for spatial reachability, Section 4 presents an encoding of reachability in PBA in TUCM, Section 5 outlines decidability and undecidability results for fragments of PBA, and Section 6 offers concluding remarks.
