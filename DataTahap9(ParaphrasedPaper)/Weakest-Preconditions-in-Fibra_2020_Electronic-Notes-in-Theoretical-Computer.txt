The paper demonstrates the connection between algebras of different endofunctors over a slicing object and fibered functors between domain fibrations, simplifying the exploration of cartesian liftings of monads along such fibrations. It also establishes the relationship between strongest postcondition predicate transformers and wppts, and discusses their availability in domain fibrations. Furthermore, the paper extends this correspondence to the cartesian liftings of composite monads and pairs of Eilenberg-Moore monotone algebras with an additional coherence law. This provides a systematic approach to computing cartesian liftings of composite monads.

The research presented in the paper enables the definition of liftings of monads (including wppts) from their algebras and the definition of transformers for composite monads by combining individual algebras. The authors illustrate this by defining predicate transformers for various monads, such as the maybe monad, the non-empty powerset monad, the counting monad, the distribution monad, and the indexed distribution monad. They then demonstrate how these can be combined to recover well-known predicate transformers from the literature, such as the expected runtime transformer by Kaminski et al. and the higher-order moment transformer by Kura et al.
