However, even in cases such as online banking, it is necessary to securely transmit confidential data between trusted parties through secure channels, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized third parties. The paper's primary example centers around access keys for a private network (e.g., a banking institute's intranet), and it is crucial to prevent these access keys from becoming publicly accessible.

From a more theoretical perspective, when considering the state of a system, some parts are accessible to the public while others remain secret. In process calculus, the open part corresponds to the free names of a process, while in graph transformation systems utilizing the borrowed context approach, the open part is determined by a sub-graph within the overall system state.

The paper has not yet delved into the specific type of graph used in this encoding. Initially, the focus is on working with appropriately labeled graphs. To highlight that the set of public nodes is indeed a complete sub-graph of the entire process graph, later on, marked graphs will be utilized. This choice is motivated by the fact that the notion of a sub-graph allows for a categorical generalization, unlike labels. Marking of objects can be viewed as an abstract labeling mechanism.

After introducing the protected links calculus to lay the groundwork for the concept of marked graphs, the paper proceeds to elevate this notion to an abstract level, specifically the category of reflected monos. This is followed by recommendations for utilizing category theoretical language to describe secrecy-related concepts, culminating in discussing the potential for verifying secrecy properties at this abstract level.

Consequently, the stage is set for discussing the concepts of secrecy and secret at an abstract level. To elucidate this proposition, the paper revisits example 2.4 and explores the discussion of secrecy vulnerabilities in systems modeled using the pi-calculus.

Drawing on the recently proposed reflected monos-construction, the paper examines potential formal abstractions of secrecy-related concepts for reasoning about secret-keeping in systems that are faithfully modeled by transformation systems in categories of reflected monos. Additionally, it is established that the reflected monos construction preserves weak adhesivity and that this may eventually lead to automatic verification of secrecy properties at the abstract level of weakly adhesive categories.
