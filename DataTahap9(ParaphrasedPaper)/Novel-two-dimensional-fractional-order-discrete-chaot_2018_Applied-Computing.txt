A novel discrete chaotic map, known as the fractional two-dimensional triangle function combination discrete chaotic map (2D-TFCDM), is proposed in this paper, utilizing discrete fractional calculus. The paper discusses the numerical analysis of chaos behaviors in the fractional-order difference and presents bifurcation diagrams, the largest Lyapunov exponent plot, and phase portraits. The discrete fractional map is then converted into an algorithm using keys produced by elliptic curve in finite field, and is applied to color image encryption, thereby introducing a new image encryption method.

Public-key cryptography, specifically elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), is widely recognized for its efficiency and security. The Menezes-Vanstone elliptic curve cryptosystem (MVECC), based on ECC, is a well-known technique for ensuring data security. The paper adopts this technique and tailors it to image encryption and security applications.

The paper consists of several sections, starting with an introduction of elliptic curve in finite field and a description of the Menezes-Vanstone elliptic curve cryptosystem. This is followed by the presentation of the fractional 2D-TFCDM and standard map on time scales derived from the discrete integral expression. The application of the fractional 2D-TFCDM with the Menezes-Vanstone elliptic curve cryptosystem in image encryption is then detailed, with subsequent analysis of the results and conclusions.

Furthermore, the paper includes the parameters of a specific elliptic curve defined over F(p), demonstrating the selection and utilization of the elliptic curve for secure purposes. The fractional 2D-TFCDM is derived from the 2D-TFCDM, leading to the discovery of new chaotic dynamics behaviors within the map. The study demonstrates that the discrete fractional calculus is an efficient tool for generating discrete maps and predicts that fractional calculus methods will enhance our understanding of discrete fractional dynamics in the future. Additionally, it highlights the lack of prior research on the information security of fractional difference, emphasizing the novelty and significance of the findings.
