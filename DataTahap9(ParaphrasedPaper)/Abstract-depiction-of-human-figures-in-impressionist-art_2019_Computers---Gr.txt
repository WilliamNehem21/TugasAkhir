Numerous researchers have conducted work on portraiture, with Rosin et al. recently presenting a collection of benchmark photos for evaluating non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) portraiture algorithms. While the state-of-the-art algorithms they feature can generate commendable abstracted representations of the photos, their level of abstraction falls short of what is demonstrated in this study.

The largest disparity between the upper and lower quartiles in the sample of character heights is observed in the character Lola in "I Will Be Especially Very Careful". Despite this, the illustrators use collage, and all original images of Lola are of the same dimensions. The variations in this book, as previously noted, are evident in the photographic reproduction. This instance highlights a key challenge in this analysis: recognizing that the drawings are not scaled differently across different pages. We utilize the quality of fine-level detail (texture, brush stroke size, line width) as evidence that, when the artist has used pens or brushes, the images within a given book have been created at the same scale and all reduced photographically by the same proportion.
