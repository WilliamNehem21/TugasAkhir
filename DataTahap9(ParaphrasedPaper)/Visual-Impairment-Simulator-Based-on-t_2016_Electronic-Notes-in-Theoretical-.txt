For most people with normal vision, blindness and visual impairment may seem remote issues. The everyday struggles experienced by individuals with these conditions are difficult to comprehend for those who take their sight for granted. Common activities, such as accessing information, moving around, navigating, interacting with the environment and people, pose significant challenges for people with visual impairments. Few sighted individuals have ever contemplated what it would be like to have a visual impairment. The potential to experience such a disability and confront its challenges would undoubtedly lead to a deeper understanding of visual impairment.

Five young adults (3 men and 2 women) who were undergraduate students at Panamericana University volunteered to take part in the experiments. The only criterion for their selection was having good vision without the need for glasses, with the sole purpose of not impeding the use of the VR headset. Their ages ranged from 19 to 24 years, with an average age of 21.2.

The experiment involved reading a 180-word text aloud using the prototype, which simulated diabetic retinopathy, hemianopsia, central scotoma, and tunnel vision. Three different texts of 180 words each, with Times Roman font size 14, were used during the test to minimize the effects of sentence repetition and text memorization. The reading time was recorded for each participant under each of the low vision conditions.

The system comprises three modules: a video camera, a computer, and a VR headset. Real-time image processing techniques are applied to the video captured by the camera, and the resulting image is projected onto the VR headset. By using the Hadamard product and a set of masks, the system can simulate the eight most common causes of visual impairment.

The simulator was evaluated experimentally with a group of five sighted volunteers through a task involving reading texts. The data from this experiment allowed the researchers to determine the impact of these impairments on the task. The results obtained suggest that reading speed is dependent on peripheral vision, in line with prior findings.

The primary purpose of the system is to educate and raise awareness among individuals with normal vision about low vision and the daily challenges faced by those with visual impairments. This is particularly beneficial for professionals in the field, such as special education teachers, braille teachers, psychologists, orientation and mobility specialists, low vision specialists, and vision rehabilitation therapists. A secondary goal is to create a wearable technological platform that can simulate low vision conditions for individuals with normal vision, which would be useful for developing and evaluating new concepts of assistive devices.
