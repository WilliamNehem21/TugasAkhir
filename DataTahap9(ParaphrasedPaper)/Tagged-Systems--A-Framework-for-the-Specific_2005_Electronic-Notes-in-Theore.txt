On the contrary, certain security attributes cannot be demonstrated solely by examining the current state. This is evident in the case of properties that are dependent on previous actions. An example of this occurs when a process requires prior authorization to access a resource.

In such cases, proving these properties is not feasible because errors do not arise from a single state but from the entire sequence of computations. The most logical approach to conducting the necessary trace analysis involves retaining the information needed to identify the specific type of error throughout the computation, effectively tagging the processes with this information. Previous studies in this field, such as [author's name], have defined an augmented semantics in an ad hoc manner, failing to establish an explicit link with the original semantics and thus mandating specific, non-reusable proofs for the association between the original and augmented semantics.

This paper introduces a systematic approach for addressing these errors, which commences by defining a labeled language and a unary relation on labeled processes. We characterize these labeled languages as divisions of the reachability tree defined by computations of the original language. Consequently, it can be concluded that the property characterized by each labeled language is indeed a property of the original language. This framework allows for working within a unified system without the need to define a custom semantics for each property. Additionally, a type-based analysis can be utilized to ensure that no incorrect labeled states are ever attained during the computation.

The first condition refers to the correctness of labeled systems: they do not introduce new transitions, meaning that all their transitions originate from unlabeled ones. The second condition pertains to completeness: each original transition has a unique labeled version. Furthermore, the uniqueness condition stipulates that different aspects of the same historical event cannot be separately recollected.
