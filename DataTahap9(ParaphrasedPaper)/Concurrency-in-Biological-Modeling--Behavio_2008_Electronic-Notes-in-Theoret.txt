The paper suggests that the pyramid model of biological systems can be extended in both directions. By zooming in, gene expression and protein activity can be modeled using mathematical and computational tools. By zooming out, upper levels can be added to model concurrent interactions between different organisms within a population. The interactions between cells and their environment play a significant role in the function and development of an organ. This is formalized by representing the surrounding environment as a 3D grid, with objects regulating concentrations of factors in grid-cubes. Cells interact with these factors and cooperate to form and drive the behavior of the organ over time.

The execution of the model involves creating instances of cells in their initial positions and activating concurrent components of their statecharts. As the simulation progresses, cells respond to events by changing their active states, leading to the loss of uniformity in the population. Analysis of the models revealed emergent properties that correspond well with biological phenomena, such as endocrinic clusters in the pancreas and competitive behavior between T-cells in the thymus.

The paper also introduces the "gemcell" system, which contains a generic statechart model of cell behavior coupled with a database of biological specifics to model specific cellular systems. The paper emphasizes decomposing a natural system into its concurrent components, modeling and reassembling them to form comprehensive simulations. This approach allows for the specification of behavior for concurrent elements and the analysis and execution of the specifications using reactive engines to observe the effects of concurrent execution of basic elements as a population.
