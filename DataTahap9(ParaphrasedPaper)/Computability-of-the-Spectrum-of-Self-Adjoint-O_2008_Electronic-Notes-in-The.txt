In this section, we present a uniform version of the first two elements of the second main theorem of Pour-El and Richards, along with corollaries derived from this result. The proof of the main result is deferred to subsequent sections due to the need for certain technical prerequisites.

We have previously established this result, even for normal operators and real Hilbert spaces. However, the previous result only provided information about the spectrum. The present result demonstrates that we can also obtain information about the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator in complex Hilbert spaces.

There are still several intriguing questions concerning the computability of the spectrum of linear operators. Pour-El and Richards also provided a version of the second main theorem for bounded normal operators and for unbounded closed self-adjoint operators. In our work, we have formulated our results not only for normal operators on complex Hilbert spaces, but also for self-adjoint operators on real Hilbert spaces as well as normal operators on complex Hilbert spaces. It remains an open question as to whether a uniform version of the results of Pour-El and Richards pertaining to normal and unbounded operators can be established, i.e., whether it is possible to obtain information about the eigenvalues from a program of the operator in these cases.
