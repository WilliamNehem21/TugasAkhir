Parasites infect over 200 million people globally, and long-term infestations can cause inflammation, leading to cancer and death. Infections from parasitic worms and protozoa are the main cause of illness and death in humans and wildlife in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Plasmodium species, the protozoa responsible for malaria, is the leading cause of illness and death, particularly among children, accounting for approximately 1 to 2 million deaths annually. Similarly, diseases such as schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, ascariasis, enterobiasis, and onchocerciasis, caused by helminths and nematodes, are common health concerns in most tropical and sub-tropical countries. In endemic situations, these protozoa and worms coexist in humans and animals, leading to severe infestations and death. In such cases, mass drug administration is often recommended as the most effective treatment strategy for clearing these parasites.

While mass drug administration can have both positive and negative effects, it is important to evaluate the potential harmful effects of administering mass drugs during protozoa and worm co-infections in order to prevent possible health consequences. This is particularly important given the well-documented harmful effects of drugs, including liver damage, bone marrow toxicity, carcinogenesis, and fetal developmental anomalies. There is concern that combined drug administration for malaria and parasitic worm co-infections may have toxic effects due to drug-drug interactions. Studies of individual drugs, including artemether-lumefantrine (A-L), albendazole (ABZ), and ivermectin (IVR), have shown that these drugs can induce various toxicities in biological systems. For example, artemether treatment has been found to induce necrosis in gastric cancer cell lines and apoptosis in human lymphocytes, while albendazole has been shown to induce cytotoxicity in the livers of treated rats and ivermectin has been found to induce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in treated mice and Chinese hamster ovary cells. These reports indicate that A-L, ABZ, and IVR can be potentially harmful to biological systems and may cause severe tissue injury, organ failure, and death if overdosed.

The liver, as the most sensitive predictor of chemical-induced toxicity due to its role in metabolism, detoxification, and storage of drugs and their metabolites, is an important target organ for drug-induced injury in mammals. Similarly, the bone marrow, where blood cells are produced, may be susceptible to drug-induced toxicity during acute and chronic exposure. Given the extensive and widespread use of A-L, IVR, and ABZ as broad-spectrum anti-nematode, anti-helminthic, and antimalarial drugs, it is crucial to understand the potential mechanisms of liver dysfunction and bone marrow cell toxicity (genotoxicity) resulting from the combined treatments of these drugs in mammalian systems, particularly as this is related to the formation of reactive oxygen species.

It is important to thoroughly evaluate the health effects of these drug combinations as their uncontrolled use due to ignorance of their toxicity may endanger human and animal health. Additionally, it has been observed that IVR can induce the activation of neutrophils and bursting of eosinophils in human peripheral blood, supporting the cellular inflammatory actions of the drugs. Inflammatory cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes function by destroying invading microorganisms and removing cellular debris caused by drugs and other foreign substances. This process is usually associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via autoxidation, which can lead to cellular inflammatory actions. Alterations in antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation status further support these cellular inflammatory actions.

The administered drugs, particularly A-L, IVR, and ABZ, may lead to liver injury, indicated by an increase in the activities of liver enzymes and alterations in oxidative stress markers in treated animals. Drug-induced liver injury is often associated with the release of cytoplasmic enzymes into the circulatory system, leading to changes in serum biochemistry. Furthermore, histological analysis indicated that the drug combinations induced liver necrosis, hyperplasia of Kupffer cells, and congestion of hepatocytes by inflammatory cells in treated animals. These lesions could be attributed to drug-induced liver injury. Additionally, the drug combinations were found to induce oxidative stress, leading to DNA damage and increased micronucleus formation in bone marrow cells in treated animals, a result consistent with the findings in cyclophosphamide-treated rats.

In conclusion, the combination of A-L, IVR, and ABZ could induce harmful effects in biological systems, including liver injury, cellular necrosis, inflammatory cell production, and bone marrow cell toxicity. These effects are likely to be mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species and the alteration of antioxidant enzyme activities, ultimately leading to cellular and DNA damage. Understanding the potential deleterious effects of these drug combinations is crucial for protecting human and animal health.
