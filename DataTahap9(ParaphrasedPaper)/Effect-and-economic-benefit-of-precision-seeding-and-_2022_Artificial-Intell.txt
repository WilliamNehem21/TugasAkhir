There is limited research on the field evaluation of water-saving irrigation facilities in China. The potential impacts of precision agriculture (PA) application on yield, quality, and farm incomes have not been fully demonstrated, which is a significant constraint to its widespread adoption.

The economic analysis accounted for all inputs, including service charges for cultivation, seed costs, fertilizer, pesticide expenses (with free irrigation water), and farm management costs. The labor inputs were included in paid services provided by agricultural and farmers' cooperatives.

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) parameters from March to May can effectively estimate the condition and yield of winter wheat in the North China Plain. Precision seedling and laser land leveling (PSLL) aim to produce uniform seeding and growth, reducing spatial variability and accelerating crop growth compared to conventional farming.

Soil nitrate and ammonium nitrogen residues after harvest pose risks of nitrogen leaching losses. PA technologies have been found to increase nitrogen utilization efficiency and reduce soil nitrogen residues, although some studies suggest that they may add to production costs. Agricultural policies can influence farmers' decisions, and government policies that encourage social services, such as subsidies for PA technologies, can promote their wider application in China.

Compared to local conventional large-scale farming, both precision seeding and the integration of precision seeding and laser land leveling increased the yield of winter wheat, with the latter being more effective and significantly reducing spatial variability. Additionally, PA methods had no adverse impact on the grain protein content of the in-season wheat crops.
