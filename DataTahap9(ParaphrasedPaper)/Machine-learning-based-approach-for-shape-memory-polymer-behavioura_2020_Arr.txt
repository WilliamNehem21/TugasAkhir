Similarly, in the analysis of the thermal video, features based on vision techniques were utilized in the thermodynamic modeling of the shape memory polymer (SMP) foil. A multi-point temperature detection method, based on feature points, was employed to capture the thermodynamic behavior of the SMP when subjected to constant heating. By observing the temperature readings associated with the extracted feature points, a comprehensive distribution of the thermodynamic changes occurring along the SMP body during heating was obtained. This unconventional approach was used to obtain insights into the thermodynamic characteristics of the SMP.

Conversely, the temperature readings from these key feature points were used to create a distributed thermodynamic profile across the foil structure, which was then utilized to train a model. In this phase of modeling, a simple Bayesian ridge regression (BRR) model was employed. The input for training this model consisted of the multi-point temperature profile of the SMP foil, while the training target was the set of polynomials derived from the video analysis.

The idea, experimentation, and machine learning modeling were conceptualized and executed by RD, DR, CC, and DL, who also contributed to the manuscript.
