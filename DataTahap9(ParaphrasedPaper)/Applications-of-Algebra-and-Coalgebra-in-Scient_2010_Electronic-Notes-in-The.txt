This academic paper discusses the challenges faced in the field of ecological modeling and proposes leveraging tools from theoretical computer science to address them. It aims to extend the methods used in scientific ecological modeling by incorporating techniques originally designed for logic, control, and computation systems. The paper presents two dual modeling paradigms without taking sides in the ongoing debate about their relative applicability. Additionally, it highlights the potential impact of coalgebra in formalizing a model paradigm implicit in ecological practice. The logistic map is used as an example to illustrate the application of symbolic dynamics and coalgebra in ecological modeling. The paper suggests that coalgebraic modeling, departing from the traditional state-based perspective, can offer a formalized approach for representing ecological systems' behavior and may provide a framework for formalizing models of sustaining ecosystems.
