Expanding upon prior work [4,19], our study begins by detailing our component model using a suitable metamodel and subsequently defining it precisely through an algebraic approach. We categorize components into simple (i.e., basic) components, component assemblies (i.e., network structures of components connected via their ports), and composite components, which constitute large-scale components by encapsulating assemblies. To formally represent behaviors, we employ input/output (i/o)-transition systems based on interface automata, utilizing explicit i/o-labelings to discern between input, output, and internal actions. The behavior of an assembly is also represented as an i/o-transition system, derived from the composition of observable behaviors of the connected components.

The secondary objective of our study is to facilitate the efficient construction and behavioral analysis of large-scale component systems. Within the context of component-based systems, this typically involves the construction and analysis of assembly behavior, commonly referred to as the state explosion problem. While there exist approaches such as compositional reachability analysis (CRA) and methods focusing on the efficient analysis of safety and liveness properties, these primarily center on the analysis of assembly behavior. In contrast, our focus lies in constructing the observable behavior of a composite component encapsulating an assembly. We propose the concept of behavioral neutrality to identify components within an assembly that do not impact the observable behavior of the composite component. By adopting the notion of behavioral neutrality, we aim to streamline the computation of the observable behavior of composite components.

Our approach leverages the fact that components are connected via ports, with ports possessing simpler behavioral protocols. Component behaviors are expected to conform to the behavior of their ports, thus enabling streamlined neutrality checks between connected components. We demonstrate that checking for neutrality in the behaviors of connected ports with weakly deterministic behavioral protocols suffices, yielding a reduction in the cost of neutrality checks.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines definitions, operators, and facts for i/o-transition systems. In Section 3, we present our component model using a metamodel and an example, supplementing the description with a precise algebraic definition. Section 4 delves into our key findings regarding the simplified computation of observable behavior in composite components and the significant role of ports in efficient neutrality checks. Section 5 provides a detailed discussion on related work, and finally, Section 6 summarizes our approach and outlines future work.

In our component framework, behaviors are derived using operators on i/o-transition systems, including hiding, relabeling, and the formation of products, with these operators being generalizations of those used in various process algebras. We then illustrate our component model using the compressing proxy system, emphasizing the utilization of an additional component for compressing graphical data.

The compressing proxy system features both simple components and a composite component with port declarations and assembly connectors, allowing us to illustrate the dynamic behavior of these components in the context of the system's intended functionality. We conclude by providing an algebraic description that formally defines the concepts and behaviors mentioned earlier, employing algebraic structures and i/o-transition systems.

Based on the concept of behavioral neutrality, we outline a reduction strategy for assemblies, demonstrating that a component at the edge of an assembly topology is behaviorally neutral for the subsequent component attached to it, allowing for the reduction of the assembly by removing the neutral leaf component. Additionally, we present criteria to optimize our method, emphasizing the use of port behaviors, particularly weakly deterministic port behaviors, to avoid composing full behaviors of components and instead compose smaller transition systems.

In summary, our study contributes to the understanding of composite components and their observable behaviors within a metamodel that differentiates between various behaviors relevant for constructing and analyzing hierarchical systems using port-based components. We offer conditions for efficiently computing the observable behavior of composite components using syntactically reduced assemblies, with a focus on neutrality between component behaviors. Our approach is particularly advantageous for rooted composite components with acyclic assemblies, where it may be the case that only the root component remains in the reduced assembly.
