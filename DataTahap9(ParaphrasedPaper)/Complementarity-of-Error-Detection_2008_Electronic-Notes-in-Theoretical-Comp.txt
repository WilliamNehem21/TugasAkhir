The paper examines various error detection techniques, such as depth-first search, directed search, random walk, and bitstate hashing, and argues for the importance of finding a complementary set of techniques rather than one best technique. The study involves implementing and evaluating nine diverse error detection techniques across a large set of models, comparing their speed, the lengths of reported counterexamples, and achieved model coverage. The results demonstrate that the set of techniques studied complement each other in several ways.

The objective of the research is to identify a set of complementary error detection techniques for safety properties, with a focus on plain reachability analysis. The study encompasses techniques lying between explicit model checking and testing, including breadth-first search, randomized depth-first search, bitstate hashing, directed search, random walk, and under-approximations based on partial order reduction. The specific contributions of the paper are detailed, emphasizing the comparison of a large number of different techniques, as well as the evaluation of their ability to detect errors, the length of counterexamples, and model coverage.

The paper also discusses related work, such as studies focusing on single error detection techniques or randomized techniques. It presents the building blocks of error detection techniques, provides an overview of specific techniques used in the experimental evaluation, and reports on the results of the experiments, highlighting the complementarity of the techniques in terms of their performance on different models and with respect to error detection, counterexample length, and model coverage.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the absence of a dominant technique and the importance of focusing on the complementarity of techniques, as well as advocating for the use of parallel independent runs of multiple techniques to leverage their strengths. It also suggests the potential for implementing a globally controlled parallel run using the discussed techniques.
