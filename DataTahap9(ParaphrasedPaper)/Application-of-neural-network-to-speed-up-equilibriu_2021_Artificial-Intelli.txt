The application of neural networks in predicting CO2 solubility in ionic liquids involved the development of a solubility model using 728 experimental data points from 14 different ionic liquids. This model was based on the critical properties of the pure components, pressure, and temperature. The neural network correlation coefficient (r2) was 0.9336, outperforming the correlation coefficients obtained using PR-EOS (Robinson and Peng, 1978) (r2 = 0.7323) and SRK-EOS (Soave, 1972) (r2 = 0.6989). Baghban et al. (2016a, b) also used neural networks to develop models for predicting air dew point, hydrate formation, and the enthalpy of vaporization of pure substances. Neural networks have also been employed for training artificial intelligence in reservoir modeling to create faster proxies for production optimization and uncertainty evaluation through Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, deep learning techniques have been utilized to estimate multiphase flow rates in producing wells based on production history, enabling real-time monitoring. Furthermore, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) can be used for meshless reservoir modeling to address higher dimensional problems. Wang et al. (2019a, b) developed a neural network model for predicting the bubble point of hydrocarbon mixtures, leading to a 30% reduction in total reservoir simulation time. This was achieved by replacing the stability test algorithm with the comparison between cell pressure and the bubble point predicted by the neural network. The use of the Wilson correlation for high pressure estimates may result in divergence when applied directly in the flash algorithm, indicating a discontinuity in the calculations. Moreover, gas injection as a hydrocarbon recovery method introduces complexity to numerical simulations due to mass transfer effects, necessitating stability tests during each time step to account for phase changes and pressure variations.
