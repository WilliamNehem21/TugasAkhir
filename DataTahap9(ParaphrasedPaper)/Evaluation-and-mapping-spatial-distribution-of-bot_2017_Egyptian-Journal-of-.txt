The sediments in aquatic environments are a significant reservoir of metals and a source of contaminants. Industrialization and urbanization have led to the enrichment of heavy metals in the sediment of coastal areas globally. These sediments not only act as scavengers of heavy metals but also serve as potential sources of heavy metals for the ecosystem. This research was conducted in a specific location, the eastern side of the Rosetta branch of the River Nile, where a lake receives a large volume of water annually from multiple drains and a freshwater canal. The drainage system collects agricultural drainage water from a large catchment area and discharges it into the lake.

The study found that copper (Cu) had a low significance correlation among different habitats, with the lowest concentration at lake islets and the highest concentration in the drains. Lead (Pb) showed varied contamination factors (CF) at different locations, with significantly high contamination at one of the islets. Cobalt (Co) also had fluctuating contamination factors, with significantly high contamination at specific locations. Cadmium (Cd) showed a moderate pollution degree in most locations, with high significance at certain sites. Similarly, zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) showed moderate pollution degrees at certain locations.

The sediments in different parts of the lake varied in texture and composition, and the studied heavy metals in Burullus Lake sediments were found in the following order: iron (Fe) > zinc (Zn) > chromium (Cr) > copper (Cu) > lead (Pb) > cobalt (Co) > cadmium (Cd). Iron, in particular, plays a crucial role in the biochemical processes of plants and animals and was found in high concentrations in specific areas, likely due to agricultural and sewage wastes.

The maximum concentration of copper was found at a drain due to agricultural drainage, while the lowest concentration was observed in a lake islet with sandy soil. The highest concentration of zinc was found next to a drain, attributed to agricultural wastes, and the lowest concentration was recorded at a lake islet with a different soil texture. The maximum concentration exceeded the limit set by the European Union, likely due to anthropogenic activities.

The results indicated that cadmium was the most enriched and abundant element resulting from anthropogenic activities, likely attributed to phosphatic fertilizers, untreated wastewater, and the application of pesticides. According to previous research, the metals found in sediments can be divided into two groups: those associated with sediment characteristics and mineralogical structure and those related to anthropogenic activities, which can pose risks to living organisms when present in high concentrations.
