The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the data preparation and pre-processing tasks. Section 3 offers an overview of the svm classification framework. Section 4 presents the results and compares them with those obtained in a previous study by Candelieri et al. (2013). Finally, the paper concludes with some findings and outlines future planned work.

This article examines a previously developed decision support system for evaluating the structural health of helicopter fuselage panels using hierarchical artificial neural networks. While this system was found to be sufficiently reliable, the authors have explored the potential advantages of employing an svm classification framework to carry out two specific tasks within the diagnosis process: detecting possible damage and identifying the affected component (bay or stringer).
