A new automated approach for adding color to grayscale images by referencing example color images is presented in this research. The proposed method involves segmenting both grayscale and color images using the unsupervised segmentation technique, Jseg. By analyzing the histogram of the grayscale image, the merging of segments in Jseg is controlled. The methodology involves the extraction of maximum fitting square patches from each segment in linear time, discarding some patches to minimize errors, and matching the segments between the grayscale and color images using dual tree complex wavelet transform. The colors between matched segments are then transferred using a simple mean and standard deviation approach, and the remaining image is colorized using an optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of this automated approach.

Colorization, the process of adding color to grayscale images, has various applications such as enhancing old photos, marking regions of interest in medical images, and re-coloring or modifying color images. Jseg, an unsupervised segmentation framework for natural images, is used for segmenting grayscale images and has been found to produce good results. The segmentation involves quantizing the image into 16 levels using peer group filtering (PGF), resulting in a class map. A region growing method is then applied to segment the image into over-segmented regions, which are subsequently merged based on their similarity. The merging threshold used is determined adaptively for grayscale images by analyzing the peaks in their histograms.

The color image is segmented using default scale parameters, and a merging threshold is applied. For grayscale images, an adaptive merging process based on histogram analysis is implemented. The histogram is analyzed to determine the distribution of the image, and peaks in the histogram represent major areas of interest. A scale for merging is chosen based on the percentage of the area represented by the peaks in the histogram.

Feature vectors for each square patch are calculated using complex wavelet transform, and these feature vectors are used for matching square patches between grayscale and color images. Once the matching is achieved, the colors from the color patches are transferred to the grayscale segments based on mean and standard deviation values. An optimization process is then used to determine colors for any remaining small grayscale segments in the image.

Overall, this approach offers a novel and automated method for colorizing grayscale images based on example color images, with promising results demonstrated through experiments.
