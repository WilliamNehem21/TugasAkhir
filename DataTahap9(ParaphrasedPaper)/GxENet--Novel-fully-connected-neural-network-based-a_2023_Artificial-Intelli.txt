The production of food crops is facing imminent challenges in satisfying the needs of the global population due to factors such as population growth, reduced agricultural inputs, and the impact of global climate change. These challenges have resulted in widespread food insecurity, with around 85 million more people experiencing severe food crises in 2021 compared to 2016. This crisis has been exacerbated by a combination of human-made and natural events including domestic food price inflation, conflicts, and pandemics. To tackle this issue, there is a need to enhance food production using limited resources by developing improved crop varieties that can thrive in diverse environments.

The genetics of a crop organism, known as its genotype, plays a crucial role in determining its traits. When creating a new variety with improved traits, it is essential to consider the genetic makeup of the lines and how they interact with the environment in which they are grown. This interaction, known as genotype by environment interaction (GxE), implies that a variety may perform differently in different environments, even if it produces desired traits in one environment. Therefore, any tools developed for crop breeding should incorporate genetic and environmental information to account for GxE. This study aims to build computational tools that can estimate a crop trait before the crop is even sown.

The study employs deep learning models, specifically artificial neural networks, to address the challenges of predicting crop traits based on genetic and environmental data. The weather data used in the study is collected from the CIMMYT Dataverse and includes various weather variables from 1990 to 2018 for multiple locations in the International Wheat Improvement Network (IWIN). The study also incorporates additional data such as fertilizer usage, disease development, and soil conditions for each trial cycle. However, the authors note that not all information in this dataset can be verified as being collected before sowing.

To train the models, the study applies different partitioning strategies for the training and test sets, creating scenarios where some locations and lines may be unobserved in the training data. Additionally, the study explores the importance of genetic markers in predicting crop yield and demonstrates the use of feature selection methods to identify markers that contribute significantly to yield prediction in different environments.

The proposed architecture includes separate models for learning representations of genotyped data and environmental variables, which are then combined to predict both average and environment-specific crop yield. The authors also experiment with variant models to capture the interaction between genotype and environment, observing the impact of environmental variables on average yield prediction over the growing season.

The study also investigates the impact of different environmental variables on crop yield prediction and assesses the performance of the developed frameworks in predicting yield in various scenarios. The results indicate that the framework that combines line-specific and environment-specific average yield predictions outperforms existing models and shows promise for accurately estimating environment-specific yield for specific crop lines.

Furthermore, the study suggests that future work should focus on incorporating soil information and more granular weather data into the models to improve yield estimation accuracy. Additionally, the authors emphasize the importance of continuous research to enhance the models' prediction capabilities and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
