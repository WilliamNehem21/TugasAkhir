In this academic paper, we introduce two tools, mpath2pn and cometa, as part of an ongoing project aimed at representing and comparing metabolic pathways using Petri nets. The mpath2pn tool is designed to automatically convert metabolic pathways from major biological databases into corresponding Petri nets using the input formalisms for Petri net tools. Meanwhile, cometa is developed to compare metabolic pathways from different organisms by utilizing their Petri net representations generated by mpath2pn. Specifically, cometa utilizes data from the KEGG database and takes into consideration both the homology of reactions and behavioral aspects of pathways represented by the t-invariants of the underlying Petri nets during the comparison.

Metabolic pathways are essential subsystems responsible for specific functions within a biological organism's chemical system, generating amino acids, sugars, lipids, nucleic acids, and energy necessary for life. Comparing these pathways across different species can provide valuable insights into evolution and aid in understanding associated functions, which is crucial for studying diseases, drug design, and industrial applications. This paper presents two tools developed as part of an ongoing project to represent and compare metabolic pathways using basic Petri nets.

Petri nets are a well-studied formalism that offers various tools for visualization, simulation, and analysis, making them suitable for modeling metabolic pathways due to the natural correspondence between Petri nets and biochemical networks. They have been widely used for qualitative and quantitative modeling and analysis of metabolic pathways, as places in Petri nets represent molecular species, transitions correspond to chemical reactions, and input and output places represent reactants and products, respectively. The paper introduces mpath2pn as a tool to automatically translate metabolic pathways into Petri net models, providing support for different databases in input and various formats for Petri net tools in output. In addition, cometa is described as a tool for automatically comparing metabolic pathways from different organisms using their Petri net representations and considering both the homology of reactions and functional aspects of pathways represented by the t-invariants of the Petri nets.

The paper also discusses the representation of reactions and boundaries in the Petri net models generated by mpath2pn, including the handling of reversible reactions and the option to produce either isolated or open Petri net models. Furthermore, ongoing work to validate the cometa tool and its distance measure is highlighted, along with plans to extend both mpath2pn and cometa through new translations and explorations of the KEGG database.
