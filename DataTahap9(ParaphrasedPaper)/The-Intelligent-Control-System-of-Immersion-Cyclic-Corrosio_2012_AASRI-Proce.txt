This academic paper introduces an intelligent control system designed to address the issue of weathering steel corrosion testing. The system encompasses a straightforward temperature expert controller and a humidity fuzzy controller utilizing the correction factor method. The methodology has proven effective in conducting weathering steel corrosion tests and has yielded favorable outcomes.

The pulse-type humidifier is utilized to regulate the humidity within the test chamber. By employing a humidifier pulse signal trigger control to generate steam for humidification, this method results in uneven humidity fluctuations within the chamber. The presence of various interferences and uncertainties makes it infeasible to establish a mathematical model for humidity control.
