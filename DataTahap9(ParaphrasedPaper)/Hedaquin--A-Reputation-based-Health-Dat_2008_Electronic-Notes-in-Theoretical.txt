Numerous applications using personal health records (PHRs) are emerging in the healthcare and wellness field, offering patients control over their health data. PHRs can receive health data from patients, wellness providers, and healthcare providers. Although healthcare providers may use PHRs to provide medical care, the quality of the health data cannot always be ensured, especially when non-professionals such as patients and wellness providers supply the data.

In response to this challenge, this paper introduces Hedaquin, a system designed to provide healthcare professionals with an assessment of the quality of health data in a PHR. This assessment is based on the reputation of the data supplier and on metadata provided by measurement devices. The proposed reputation system emulates the way trust in health data and their suppliers is established in the real world.

Unlike health data in electronic health records (EHRs), the quality of health data in a PHR can vary due to the varying medical knowledge of the data suppliers. The goal of this paper is to enable healthcare providers to use health data created by patients and wellness providers, leading to reduced costs and improved quality of care.

Because quality is a subjective measure, the paper presents a reputation system, Hedaquin, to gauge the quality of health data in a PHR. In this approach, the reputation of the user is employed as an indicator of the health data quality, taking into account the user's credentials, ratings, and metadata from measuring devices. The system leverages a beta reputation system as a starting point and also calculates a measure of uncertainty, which is communicated to the healthcare provider to support informed decision-making.

Hedaquin utilizes a series of functions to weigh ratings, incorporating time dimensions, similarity in scope, and interaction patterns. Additionally, the system can automatically calculate ratings for health data and uses certificates such as diplomas in reputation calculation. Hedaquin aims to empower healthcare providers to make informed decisions about the quality of health data supplied by patients and wellness providers, with minimal overhead for these data suppliers.
