In this study, we assessed the energy usage in the context of unknown service demands by comparing three different policies: task assignment based on estimated job size (tags), the shortest queue strategy, and random allocation in a uniform environment. We utilized performance evaluation process algebra (PEPA) to model these policies and obtain numerical solutions. Our findings indicate that the tags policy results in higher total energy consumption compared to the other policies. However, in contrast to random allocation, tags consume less energy.

The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 focuses on the analysis and modeling of tags using the Markovian process algebra PEPA; Section 3 presents the numerical results for evaluating performance metrics; Section 4 introduces the energy model and the corresponding energy consumption outcomes; and finally, Section 5 provides a discussion of potential future work and concludes the paper.

The random allocation policy randomly assigns arrival jobs to a queue without considering the current queue capacity, leading to potential overflow in some queues while others remain underutilized. This can result in a high probability of job loss when a job is sent to a full queue. The shortest queue strategy addresses load balancing issues by directing jobs to the queue with the fewest waiting jobs, thus reducing the likelihood of queue overflow. However, it may also lead to delays for short jobs when they get stuck behind long jobs.

The tags policy, introduced to address the issue of long service demands delaying short jobs, allocates jobs to a series of server queues with increasing timeout durations. This approach successfully reduces the chance of both queues becoming full, but it incurs higher energy consumption.

Our evaluation of energy consumption under exponential and hyper-exponential service demand distributions revealed that the tags policy consumes more energy than the other two policies in terms of total energy consumption. Energy consumption per job followed a similar trend under the exponential distribution, while under the hyper-exponential distribution, tags consumed less energy per job than random allocation when the arrival rate was high. The shortest queue strategy emerged as the optimal policy in this scenario.

In conclusion, our primary focus in this paper was to compare and evaluate energy consumption by different policies, without introducing trade-offs between energy consumption and performance metrics. We recommend developing a cost function that considers performance and energy consumption to facilitate decision-making regarding policy selection. Additionally, future research should take into account variations in server specifications and processing capabilities, as well as the potential benefits of utilizing a multi-scheduling approach that combines different policies to evaluate energy consumption.
