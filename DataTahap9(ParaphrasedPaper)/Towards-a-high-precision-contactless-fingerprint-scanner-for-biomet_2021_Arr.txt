In a world at risk of disease transmission, there is a growing need for non-contact biometric authentication devices to promote hygiene and safety and prevent the spread of contagious infections. Although fingerprint biometrics is commonly used for identification and authentication due to its convenience, reliability, and accuracy, it poses a high risk as a potential agent for transmitting infections. This drawback has become particularly pronounced in light of the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.

In the past, the emphasis in biometric technology development was on creating higher-resolution fingerprint scanners, without much concern about hygiene. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for well-resolved and robust contactless fingerprint scanners to help contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining security and safety.

This paper outlines efforts to improve the accuracy of contactless fingerprint scanners and reduce false positive errors. The developed device is compared with existing technologies to underscore its unique and innovative features. Major contributions of the proposed method include achieving precise contactless fingerprint scans, higher correlation factors due to high-precision fingerprint acquisition, and an efficient and convenient fingerprinting architectural technique.

To identify different fingers, the system stores and processes scanned images using image recognition algorithms similar to those used in face recognition. Each image file is converted into a binary file and analyzed pixel by pixel. The system then searches the database for a match when a finger is scanned, and the more samples of a particular fingerprint stored, the more reliable the scan results.

Recognizing that white light and longer wavelength radiations are absorbed by the skin, blue light (at 500 nm) is used as a substitute, as it is less absorbed by the skin. The impact of blue illuminating light on the correlation factor was found to enhance the fingerprint images, yielding a correlation factor as high as 97.51%.

This project's high-precision contactless fingerprint biometric scanner addresses the challenge of positioning the target finger at a fixed point during scanning without direct contact. Unlike previous technologies that used finger placement guides, which risked physical contact and infection transmission, the developed setup utilizes infrared-proximity sensors and an electronic logic-controlled microcontroller to achieve non-touch alignment of the target finger in a fixed constant position away from the camera, overcoming issues such as motion blur and inconsistent fingerprint image resolutions encountered with unconstrained acquisition setups.
