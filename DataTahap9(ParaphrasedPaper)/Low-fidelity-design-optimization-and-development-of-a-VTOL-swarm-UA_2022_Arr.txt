Furthermore, inexperienced designers and undergraduate students encounter challenges in acquiring comprehensive resources for learning and refining their design skills. This issue is particularly pronounced in the domain of aircraft design, which involves complex relationships across multiple disciplines. Commercial tools are limited in their ability to facilitate learning and customization, whereas open-source tools and customizable libraries enable individuals to build their skills from the ground up. The development and utilization of such tools have never been more accessible than they are now.

Moreover, the completion of a comprehensive end-to-end solution for aircraft design, from conceptualization to autopilot testing, is infrequently achieved in academic settings due to constraints such as limited funding and tight research timelines. Addressing the challenges inherent in designing, developing, and testing swarm-capable UAVs through a comprehensive document can greatly benefit the emerging field of unmanned aerial systems and swarm robotics. This paper aims to address these challenges by presenting a robust methodology using entirely free tools and in-house code, with a primary focus on assisting students and upcoming researchers in developing feasible designs for student competitions or learning aircraft design.

The interconnectedness of disciplines in aircraft design presents difficulties in avoiding locally optimal designs developed through intuition, making multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) an essential tool for aerospace designers. The approach outlined in the subsequent sections is not a comprehensive MDO solution, but rather a novel, low-fidelity attempt at design exploration, with human involvement at all stages to guide the design and perform validation checks.

With regard to the specific design objectives, the aircraft is intended to maintain a speed of 25 m/s without compromising its vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, while adhering to a standard mission profile involving cruised flight, surveillance and target detection, payload delivery, and vertical landing. Considering the potential use of multiple similar UAVs in a collaborative swarm, a concept of operations for the entire mission profile has been envisioned and a corresponding video has been included in the supplementary material.

Furthermore, current trends in aircraft design necessitate a minimum thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.5 for hovering and 0.75 for cruise maneuvers. To meet these requirements, the thrust distribution and optimization of the aircraft's motors were carefully considered, with a focus on ensuring optimal performance during cruising while maintaining safety and efficiency.

Taking into account modern trends in electric propulsion, lithium-ion battery packs were identified as offering the best energy density, despite their drawbacks of limited current discharge. A thorough evaluation of the current draw for all flight segments confirmed that lithium-ion batteries could adequately meet the aircraft's energy requirements.
