The academic paper follows this structure: the next section discusses our proposed method, followed by a presentation and fair comparison of experimental results in section 3, and concluding remarks in section 4.

The left segment of the gray scale indicates that the proposed method demonstrates the highest PSNR values and lowest MSE and AMBE values. Additionally, it is evident that PSNR values decrease as we move away from the left of the gray scale, while there is an increase in the MSE and AMBE values.
