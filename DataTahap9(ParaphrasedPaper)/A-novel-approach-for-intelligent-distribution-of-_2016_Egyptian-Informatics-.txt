The continuous expansion of data has led to advancements in data storage systems, progressing from flat file systems to RDBMS, data warehousing, and distributed data warehousing systems. This paper proposes a novel distributed data warehouse model, called intelligent and distributed data warehouse (IDDW), which is designed using a top-down hierarchical approach. The model facilitates the intelligent distribution of data warehouses and allows for the building of a data warehouse at any location as per the specific requirements. The IDD architecture ensures unique user identification, location-independent operations, and data transfer between data warehouses. The paper also discusses related work, the proposed IDD modeling, architecture, data model, internal organization, construction of the hierarchical structure, a case study, experimental setup, observations, and analysis of the IDD model.

The advantages of IDD over other distributed data warehouses using top-down design include the flexibility to build data warehouses at any location, unique user identification, location-independent operations, and data transfer. The construction process involves the modeling of IDD, designing the data model, internal organization, and using algorithms for constructing different hierarchical levels. The last level of the IDD generates unique user identification numbers without building any data warehouse.

A case study demonstrating an 8-level hierarchical structure in an educational system in India is built, using MySQL 5.0.45 database and specific hardware configuration. The architecture allows for the input of real-time data intelligently stored within the data warehouses. Observations from the case study reflect on the IDD's availability, adaptability, reliability, and scalability. The paper also discusses future research directions, such as intelligently placing and mining data within IDD and implementing a parallelization approach for data placement and mining tasks.
