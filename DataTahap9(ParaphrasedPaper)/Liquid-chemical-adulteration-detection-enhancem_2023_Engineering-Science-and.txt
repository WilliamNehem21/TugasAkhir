In today's world, fuel and oil stand as the most widely used energy sources globally. Most fuels, such as gasoline, diesel, oil, and natural gas, are obtained from natural sources, either extracted from the ground or processed from crude oil. The role of fuel in the global economy is indispensable, but some individuals are exploiting this by adulterating pure fuel. Particularly concerning is the increasing practice of mixing impurities with gasoline at petrol stations for adulteration purposes. To improve fuel quality, certain industries and gas stations engage in blending kerosene with gasoline or diesel, posing significant risks due to the drastic reduction in fuel lubricity. This adulteration has far-reaching consequences for various sectors, including automotive, chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries, as machinery using contaminated fuels is prone to damage. Moreover, the mixing of natural items could have harmful effects on a wide range of organisms and ecosystems.

The paper introduces a microwave sensor for liquid characterization employing a compact and highly sensitive mu-negative metamaterial, with the main focus on achieving miniaturization and enhancing sensitivity. The dielectric sensor for determining the concentration of ethanol and pentano is acknowledged to have relatively low sensitivity, with the q-factor remaining uncomputed.

The boundary condition is based on the assumption that the conductor being dealt with is an ideal conductor with negligible electrical resistance, enabling the complete reflection of incident electromagnetic waves. Conversely, the z-axis is set as an open boundary, allowing electromagnetic waves to propagate freely in that direction, devoid of constraints or reflections.

The measured results and simulated outcomes are in agreement, although discrepancies between simulated and measured data may arise due to the mutual coupling effect of the waveguide port, manufacturing tolerances, and measurement error. Additionally, the mutual resonance between the transmitting and receiving terminals of two waveguide ports can influence the measurements, resulting in slight discrepancies in both data sets.
