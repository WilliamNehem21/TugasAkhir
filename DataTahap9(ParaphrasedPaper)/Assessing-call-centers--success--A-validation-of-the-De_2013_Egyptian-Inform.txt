The business process outsourcing (BPO) industry has witnessed significant growth in the 21st century and has become a major contributor to the global economy. This growth has been facilitated by advancements in telecommunications, the emergence of free trade agreements, and evolving cultural behaviors in many developing countries. BPO services, particularly those based on technology, encompass a wide range of activities such as call center operations, marketing, sales, remote diagnosis, and technical support.

One approach to analyzing the data from different dimensions and call centers is to model the main outcomes, namely user satisfaction and net benefits, as functions of input dimensions. This involves using multiple regression to model user satisfaction as a function of system quality, information quality, service quality, and usage. Similarly, net benefits are modeled as a function of these input dimensions along with user satisfaction.

Emphasis was placed on system quality and service quality dimensions, and decision makers in call centers can employ this tool to adjust the weights and meet organizational objectives. Multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to derive linear formulas for user satisfaction and net benefits, allowing for the prediction of values for these dimensions based on other dimensions.
