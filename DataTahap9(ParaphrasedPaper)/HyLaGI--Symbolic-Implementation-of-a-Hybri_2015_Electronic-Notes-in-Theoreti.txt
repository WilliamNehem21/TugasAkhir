The paper discusses the language HydLa, which is designed for modeling hybrid systems and can handle model uncertainties effectively. Its implementation, Hylagi, is described as well. Hylagi employs symbolic formula manipulation to calculate trajectories, thereby avoiding errors associated with floating-point arithmetic. Additionally, Hylagi features a non-deterministic simulation algorithm to compute various qualitative trajectories of models with uncertainties.

While prior work, such as the hybrid cc[2,5] precursor, did not provide complete result correctness guarantees, an alternative approach called CLP(f) aimed for rigorous simulation and managed interval constraints. However, its control structure differed significantly from that of HydLa.

The paper introduces Hylagi 2 as an implementation of HydLa, which computes trajectories of given HydLa programs. It is written in C++ and utilizes Mathematica as its backend solver. Hylagi ensures error-free results by computing trajectories through symbolic formula manipulation, outputting symbolic representations of state variables at each time point and interval to handle qualitative differences resulting from simulation errors.

Hylagi's simulation algorithm involves both point and interval phases, where maximal consistent sets of modules are calculated based on guard conditions. This includes solving ODEs and minimization problems during interval phases. The paper also discusses the dynamic management of dependencies between constraints using bipartite graphs and the identification of minimal sets of related constraints during the simulation process. Additionally, the paper describes the development of a frontend system that provides visualization capabilities for Hylagi simulation results using two-dimensional plots and animations. This feature is particularly important for hybrid systems, as simulation errors may lead to qualitatively different outcomes. This emphasis on symbolic trajectory calculations distinguishes Hylagi from other rigorous tools for hybrid systems, which tend to rely on numerical methods or theorem proving.
