The objective of this research is to investigate the maintenance of regularity in innermost rewriting and to identify a category of term rewriting systems (TRS) for which better outcomes can be achieved using the innermost strategy as opposed to plain rewriting. The study focuses on shallow TRS, where all variables occur at a depth of 0 or 1 in the terms of the rules. While shallow TRS do not preserve regularity under plain rewriting, the addition of certain linearity restrictions enables the decidability of properties such as reachability, joinability, confluence, and termination, which are otherwise undecidable for shallow TRS. Therefore, from a theoretical perspective, the shallow case presents a boundary for decidability when considering classes of TRS defined by syntactic constraints.

The conventional method for proving the preservation of regularity involves augmenting the automaton recognizing the starting language with additional transitions to simulate rule applications and recognize all reachable terms. However, this completion technique, which works well for standard term automata, does not apply to general shallow TRS due to the inability to simulate innermost rewriting using automaton transitions. Instead, an alternative approach is required.

To streamline the characterization of innermost-reachable terms from a regular language, the study aims to characterize the set of terms innermost-reachable from a single constant by adding the inverse of the transition rules of an automaton recognizing the language to the rewrite system. Subsequently, the study demonstrates that innermost strategy can be utilized to generate terms starting from the final states of the automaton and using its transitions applied in a backward manner.

The section establishes the closure of regular languages under innermost rewriting with TRS whose right-hand sides of rules are shallow. The findings reveal that regularity is preserved by innermost rewriting with linear right-shallow TRS, but not by innermost rewriting with right-(linear and flat)(non left-linear) TRS. The first result was also independently demonstrated in a separate study.

In summary, this work investigates the preservation of regularity in innermost rewriting and identifies a class of term rewriting systems for which enhanced results can be achieved under the innermost strategy. The study focuses on shallow TRS and explores the decidable properties of reachability, joinability, confluence, and termination when certain linearity restrictions are applied. Additionally, the study introduces a new approach to streamline the characterization of innermost-reachable terms from a regular language and presents findings on the closure of regular languages under innermost rewriting with TRS.
