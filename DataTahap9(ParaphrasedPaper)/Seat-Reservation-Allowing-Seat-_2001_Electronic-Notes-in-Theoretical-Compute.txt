The paper discusses the problem of seat assignment in a passenger reservation system, where the goal is to maximize ticket sales revenue while ensuring fairness. Specifically, the study considers a seat reservation system that allows passengers to change seats a fixed number of times during their trip. Two pricing policies - proportional pricing based on trip length and uniform pricing - are examined.

The paper introduces definitions related to intervals and seat changes, and discusses the concept of merging intervals during seat assignment. It also describes the construction of sets representing legal seating options and analyzes performance ratios for different algorithms.

In summary, the paper investigates the trade-off between maximizing revenue and ensuring fairness in seat assignment, and provides theoretical analysis and algorithms for addressing this problem.
