The slow modes of proteins reflect important functional movements, while the fast modes are indicative of local structural irregularities. The fluctuations associated with fast modes result in a greater decrease in entropy compared to slow modes. Consequently, residues involved in fast modes are considered to be dynamically active and play a critical role in maintaining the stability of the protein's tertiary structure.
