This paper focuses on the practical application of epilepsy classification using real clinical data to identify three phases of absence seizure: pre-seizure, seizure, and seizure-free. The study employs artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVMs) with supervised learning algorithms, as well as k-means clustering (K-MC) with unsupervised techniques to classify the seizure phases. The paper also explores the use of different techniques for multiclass classification and compares the performance with traditional methods such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and naive Bayes classifier (NBC). The findings indicate that SVM-based classifiers outperform traditional methods in terms of recognition accuracy and robustness, especially when the original clinical data is distorted with noise. Additionally, the paper concludes that the SVM-based classifier with one vs. one (OVO) provides the highest recognition accuracy, while the ANN-based classifier demonstrates the maximum accuracy in the presence of noise.

Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting approximately 1% of the general population, with its causes often unidentified. Seizures caused by epilepsy can pose a higher risk of injuries, especially in children, due to the unpredictable nature of the seizures. Early prediction of the pre-seizure phase could potentially mitigate the risk by providing an early warning system. Absence seizures, being one of many forms of generalized epileptic seizures, are characterized by brief episodes of impaired consciousness and can be identified using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings.

The use of SVM involves mapping non-linear and inseparable data from an input space into a higher-dimensional feature space to achieve linear separability. The concept of kernel functions is utilized to accomplish this task, leading to the maximization of the margin and the search for an optimal hyperplane, thus earning SVM the name of maximal margin classifier. Despite being computationally time-consuming and complex, SVM exhibits good generalization ability, helps prevent overfitting, and performs well in high-dimensional feature spaces. The paper's structure includes sections on digital data acquisition from epilepsy patients, feature extraction, and the operation of the computational intelligence techniques (SVM, ANN, and K-MC). The paper concludes with a discussion of classification results and the performance of the classifiers, along with concluding remarks.

In conclusion, the paper presents supervised (SVM and ANN) and unsupervised (K-MC) learning algorithms for classifying epilepsy seizure phases. The computationally intelligent techniques of ANN and SVM show promise in recognizing and classifying complex patterns in EEG signals, outperforming traditional methods like NBC and KNN. Both ANN and SVM demonstrate robustness in their performance, even in the presence of noisy input data. The paper also introduces a feature extraction method capable of capturing rich signal information at a moderate feature vector dimension. Additionally, the study suggests that in the future, further exploration of classification methods based on neural networks, such as self-organizing maps and deep learning architecture, could lead to improved performance in both noisy and noise-free cases.
