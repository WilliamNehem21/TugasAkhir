In the context of colored graphs, we define a multicolored cluster graph h as containing a colored graph f if it includes a copy of f where the color of each edge in f is within the list of colors for the corresponding edge in h. More broadly, if f is a graph with a color pattern p, we say that h contains (f, p) if it includes a colored copy of f with a pattern that is isomorphic to p. Based on this definition, we can derive the following embedding result, the proof of which is obtained from arguments similar to those in the proof of the key lemma.
