This paper demonstrates the application of hierarchical reasoning to validate properties of intricate systems. It employs chains of local theory extensions to model a simplified scenario based on the European Train Control System (ETCS) standard, focusing on testing invariants and bounded model checking. The study presents a method that reduces the verification process to checking the satisfiability of ground formulae over a base theory. The case study involves a communication device responsible for managing a segment of railway track, addressing the control of train speeds and movement. The structure of the paper includes a description of the theoretical foundations, the case study, the proposed method for invariant and bounded model checking, and conclusions. Additionally, the paper explores a method for checking the satisfiability of linear constraints over the real numbers, which may streamline automated verification for various problems in which simple, disjoint, and exhaustive premises in a specific theory guard the axioms.
