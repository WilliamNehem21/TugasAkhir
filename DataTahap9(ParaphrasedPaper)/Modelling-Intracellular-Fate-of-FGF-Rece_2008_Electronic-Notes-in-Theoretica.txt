We have altered the model by randomly generating both fgf and fgfrs, each at its own unique rate. Over time, the model demonstrates that a majority of fgfr4s ultimately end up in the cell membrane. While our model's lack of knowledge about the rates of fgfr4 creation may limit its realism, it does highlight the potential for excessive production of fgfr4s given specific rates. Further sensitivity analysis is crucial for documenting diverse realistic scenarios.

Although the bioambient model is not comprehensive, it captures the primary dynamics of fgfr sorting. Future improvements could enhance its accuracy by adding new components. Our work is an abstraction in relation to reality; it does not aim to fully represent all biological system details, but rather focuses on signaling activation/deactivation in different compartments and component relocation. Additionally, we do not aim to accurately model the chemical reactions involved in the endocytic pathway. This sets our work apart from other studies that extensively consider the chemical reactions in the early stages of fgf and fgfr binding.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the syntax and semantics of bioambients, while we define the stochastic semantics in line with previous work. Section 3 reviews the fgf endocytic pathway as described in the literature and presents a bioambient model. In Section 4, we discuss the results of different simulations and the predictive capacity of our model, followed by our conclusions. The paper concludes with an appendix that provides detailed information about the experiments we simulated and their quantitative findings.

In many cases, growth factors bind to multiple receptors, and the distinct roles of these receptors in signal transduction are often unclear. Studies on the intracellular trafficking of ligand-bound receptors for fgfs were conducted to explore whether modulating the signaling is possible through intracellular sorting of ligand-receptor complexes.

Additional experiments were conducted to evaluate the degradation rates of the ligand and receptors. The results revealed two distinct intracellular movement pathways, contingent on the receptor to which fgf1 had bound. Specifically, fgf1 internalized by fgfr1-fgfr3 is typically routed to the lysosomes for degradation, while fgf1 internalized by fgfr4 is mainly routed to the recycling compartment.

As the fgf:fgfr complex enters the sorting endosome, we assume that they remain bound. Existing literature indicates that the complex decomposes in the early endosome and follows the recycling route. We do not directly model the unbinding process, but rather the movement of fgfr in other cell compartments.

Recent findings suggest that if the fgf:fgfr complex does not decompose in the sorting endosome, it recycles directly back to the cell surface. Future work will build on our model to incorporate these new findings and explicitly model the biological switch responsible for the unbinding of the fgf:fgfr complex. The model presented in this paper serves as a foundation for understanding the behavior of fgfrs, whose overproduction is considered to play a crucial role in cancer development.

This research draws from the work of Muffy Calder, Stephen Gilmore, and Jane Hillston on modeling the influence of RKIP on the ERK signaling pathway using the stochastic process algebra PEPA, as presented in the proceedings of the BioConcur Workshop on Concurrent Models in Molecular Biology, London, England, August 2004.

The method involved labeling fgf1 with a fluorescent dye, while EGF (epidermal growth factor) and transferrin were labeled with different colored dyes. Previous experiments indicate that EGF moves to the lysosomes and transferrin to the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) from the late endosomes. By examining overlaps in the dyes of fgf1 and either transferrin or EGF, we could determine the compartment to which the different receptors move. These experiments were allowed to run for two hours.
