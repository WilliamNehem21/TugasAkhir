In recent years, many-objective optimization problems have gained significant attention. However, as the number of objectives increases, the difficulty of solving these problems grows exponentially, leading to a more serious imbalance between convergence and diversity. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of three-way decision and redesigns the environmental selection strategy to propose a many-objective optimization algorithm based on three-way decision. The algorithm uses the distance from an individual to the ideal point to measure convergence and the minimum distance from the individual to other solutions to measure diversity. It then combines these measures to select individuals with good convergence and diversity. Additionally, the study presents a dynamic threshold acquisition method to further enhance the algorithm's performance. Through extensive testing with different datasets, the algorithm is shown to effectively balance convergence and diversity, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies for selecting high-quality individuals.

The three-way decision approach, developed based on rough set theory by Yiyu Yao, is employed to make decisions about acceptance or rejection by considering the level of information available. Specifically, in environmental selection, individuals with good convergence and diversity are accepted, while decisions about individuals with poor convergence or diversity are postponed. This decision-making model is found to be more consistent with human cognition and efficient in addressing the optimization problem at hand.

Various optimization algorithms based on Pareto domination and grid sorting are also discussed, and their limitations in addressing the convergence and diversity imbalance are highlighted. The study then introduces the concept of dynamic threshold acquisition methods to enhance the algorithm's scalability and performance. Furthermore, the proposed many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on three-way decision (MAOEA-TWD) is detailed, along with its dynamic threshold acquisition method.

The time complexity of the MAOEA-TWD algorithm is analyzed in detail, considering its main steps such as population initialization, selection, crossover, mutation operations, non-dominated sorting, and decision strategy. Additionally, the algorithm is evaluated against different test sets and compared with classical algorithms, demonstrating its superior performance in balancing convergence and diversity in the population.
