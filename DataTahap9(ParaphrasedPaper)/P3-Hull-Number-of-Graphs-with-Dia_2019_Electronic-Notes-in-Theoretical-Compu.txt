The graph g includes a cycle of length six that contains the vertices a, x1, b, x2, c, and x3, and given that the set {a, b, c} is independent, and g does not include an induced cycle of length six, the subgraph induced by the vertices {x1, x2, x3} contains an edge between x1 and x2. Since the set h(s) is not a dominating set, the vertex x1.

Next, we shift our focus to strongly regular graphs, which are a specific type of diameter two graphs. We begin our analysis by examining strongly regular graphs of the form g(n, k, b, c) when c equals 0. In this scenario, each such graph consists of disjoint complete graphs.

A strongly regular graph with c greater than 0 is a connected nontrivial k-regular graph that is not a complete graph. The result of Theorem 2.10 applies to biconnected c6-free diameter two graphs. We can provide an upper bound for strongly regular graphs in general when c is greater than 0.

Theorem 2.13 offers a precise bound for strongly regular graphs but does not take into account the parameter c. There exist graphs for which the relationship between the parameters k and b does not yield a precise bound. For instance, consider the graph gq(3, 9) with parameters (112, 30, 2, 10) in relation to the bound provided in Theorem 2.13.

When the size of h(sj) exceeds k, according to Proposition 2.5, we can conclude that h(sj) is a dominating set. Hence, we aim to determine the maximum number of iterations when this condition is met. We establish an upper limit for this number in the subsequent results.

The maximum size for strongly regular graphs is [logc+1(k.c+ 1)+ 1. Finally, it has been proven that the p3-hull number for biconnected c6-free diameter two graphs is at most 4, enabling the computation of the p3-hull number for this subclass in O(n^4) time.
