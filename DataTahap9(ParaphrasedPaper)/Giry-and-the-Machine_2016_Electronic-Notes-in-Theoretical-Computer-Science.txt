We introduce a general approach using machinery to analyze and describe natural transformations between well-known functors in the category of polish spaces, pol. This method involves a thorough examination of the structure of pol and a set of categorical conditions on the domain and codomain functors. We apply this approach to analyze transformations from the giry and positive measures functors to combinations of the vietoris, multiset, giry, and positive measures functors. Additionally, we establish the definition and properties of the multiset functor within pol. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for certain combinations of these functors, there can be at most one natural transformation between them. Notably, we show that the giry monad has no natural transformations to itself, except for the identity transformation. Lastly, we demonstrate the construction of the Dirichlet and Poisson processes using this approach.

Traditional tools in probability theory do not accommodate compositionality, particularly in compositional approximation. Despite this, there have been notable advancements in the development of techniques based on structural approaches to probability theory. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a global solution to this issue, by combining structural insights of pol with classical tools of probability theory and topology in a functorial form. This results in the creation of the "machine," an axiomatic reconstruction in category-theoretic terms of prior developments. Through this approach, we achieve a simpler and more conceptual proof of our previous results and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. Additionally, we establish that natural transformations between giry-like functors are fully characterized by their components.

It is important to note that while this compactification is not universal, we demonstrate that polcz is a reflective subcategory of polb. Furthermore, we show that the wallman compactification makes polcz into a reflective subcategory of polb. The extension of a natural transformation from polcz to polb can be viewed componentwise as a restriction of the natural transformation to a space embedded into its compactification, which is constructed using intersections.

Rigidity is an unexpected mathematical result of our structural decomposition of pol. While the machine allows the proof of the existence of natural transformations, rigidity allows for proving uniqueness and is somewhat complementary to the former. We anticipate that the concept of the isotropic element will have applications beyond the scope of this research.
