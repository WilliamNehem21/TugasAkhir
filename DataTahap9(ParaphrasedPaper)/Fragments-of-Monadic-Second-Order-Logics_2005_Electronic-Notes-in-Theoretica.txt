In the realm of finite graphs, R. Fagin demonstrated that the existential fragment of MSO is significantly less expressive than MSO itself. This discrepancy between the two classes is illustrated by the well-known problem of directed graphs connectivity, which serves as a distinguishing factor for these classes (see [13, 5]).

In the subsequent section, we introduce the enhanced monadic second-order logics that will be the focus of our study in the following sections. We assume that the reader has a basic understanding of monadic second-order logic and its existential fragment; more detailed definitions can be found in [5, 13, 21]. We also review certain descriptive complexity results that are pertinent to the subsequent separation results.
