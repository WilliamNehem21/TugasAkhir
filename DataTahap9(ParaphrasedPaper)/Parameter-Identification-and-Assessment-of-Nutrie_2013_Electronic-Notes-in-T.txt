The paper's structure is as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the cwc framework. Section 3 outlines the goal programming methodology. Section 4 demonstrates the nutrient transport model in am symbiosis. Section 5 presents the analysis results, elaborating on the methodology. Section 6 briefly examines related literature, while Section 7 concludes the paper.

Sucrose uptake occurs when plant-derived carbon, likely in the form of sucrose, is released into the periarbuscular space and then cleaved into hexoses, which are obtained by am fungi[37,38]. Hexoses are transported across their membrane via as yet unidentified hexose transporters, likely proton cotransporters such as the gpmst1 described for the glomeromycotan fungus geosiphon pyriformis.

The acidity of the periarbuscular space is controlled by plant/fungal h+ ATPases and other mechanisms[21,4], which provide the energy for h+-dependent transport processes. To accurately model chemical reactions at different pH levels, it was crucial to include a formulation for h+ capable of attaining and maintaining the correct concentration in the PAS. The plant and fungus h+-ATPase pumps are modeled by reactions (18) and (19), where a special function is used to determine the rates, increasing the ions into the PAS when their concentrations are below a certain level.

A comparison was made with the well-known ammonium transporter in lotus japonicus (LjAMT1;1). This transporter retrieves the NH4+ ion from the periarbuscular space, deprotonates it after transport across the plant membrane, and releases it in its uncharged NH3 form into the plant cytoplasm. This biological model is identical to the one described in Section 4, with the exception that reaction (16) has been replaced by a different one.
