The study aims to develop an automated visual inspection system for circular objects using cameras and image processing techniques. The paper primarily focuses on pattern analysis of circular objects through image analysis. The authors introduce a computational method based on global symmetry to detect objects and propose a symmetry measure using distance, phase, and intensity weights. This measure is capable of locating the centers of circles, even when they have low contrast against complex backgrounds. The authors also test the measure for similarities among arbitrary circular objects and report promising experimental results.

When observing objects with poor quality, such as damaged edges or contaminated surfaces, humans can easily identify abnormalities based on their natural ability to detect symmetry. This paper suggests that symmetry detection holds great potential for computer-vision-based applications, although it has been underutilized.

While classical methods exist for finding circles in images, they may fail when objects have weak gradients compared to their backgrounds. The proposed method describes different types of symmetries, such as intensity, structural, and directional symmetries. It identifies the extreme point as the center of circular objects, enabling efficient noise filtering in cluttered backgrounds.

Overall, the paper introduces a systematic approach for robustly inspecting circular objects. The proposed symmetry measure can be used to inspect circular objects with symmetric patterns and also locate arbitrary circular objects in uncertain backgrounds. After locating the objects, a content-based descriptor is employed to carry out the inspection task.
