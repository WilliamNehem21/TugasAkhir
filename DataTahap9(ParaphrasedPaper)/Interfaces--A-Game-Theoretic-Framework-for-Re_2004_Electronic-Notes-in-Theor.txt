This paper presents an introductory tutorial on interfaces, focusing on automaton-based interfaces and timed interfaces. It discusses the concept of component-based design and the benefits it offers in terms of complexity management and reusability. The composition of interfaces is explored, emphasizing how the input assumptions and output guarantees of composed interfaces are combined. The paper also introduces the concept of interfaces as games, modeling interfaces as a game between output and input players. The compatibility and composition of interface automata are discussed, along with the organization of the paper, which includes sections on interface automata, timed interface automata, and the composition of timed interfaces.

The paper extends the concept of interface automata to include timing constraints, resulting in timed interface automata. It explains the syntactic and semantical differences between timed automata and timed interfaces, as well as the turn-based nature of timed games due to the asymmetrical causality relation between inputs and outputs in composition.

The composition of two timed interface automata is elaborated, focusing on input strengthening to avoid error states. The paper also presents a result indicating that the composition of two well-formed and compatible interfaces results in another well-formed interface. This signifies that composing useful interfaces yields another useful interface, particularly in the untimed case.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of interfaces, interface automata, timed interface automata, and their composition, shedding light on the fundamental concepts in this domain.
