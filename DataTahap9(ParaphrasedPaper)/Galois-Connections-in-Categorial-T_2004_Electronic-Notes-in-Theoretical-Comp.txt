The proof is conducted through a sequence of steps based on the complexity of the cut inferences. Presented below are the main situations of the cut elimination transformation: instances where a cut on a complex cut formula is substituted by a cut on its subformula, resulting in reduced complexity. The remaining situations follow similar principles.

In instances (7) and (8), isotone cuts (c1; c3) on the complex formula a0 are replaced by antitone cuts (c4; c2). This same substitution is applied to cuts on 0a as well. (We denote the instantiation of the premise that makes a logical rule applicable using double lines.)

Based on this comparison, the following conclusions can be drawn: (i) there may be circumstances where both ppi and api are appropriate (e.g., conditionals and modal operators); (ii) non-veridical operators may exist that do not permit polarity items (e.g., in Italian fci are not authorized in conditionals); (iii) there are potentially other types of polarity items that are sensitive to these as well as to other forms of non-veridical expressions.
