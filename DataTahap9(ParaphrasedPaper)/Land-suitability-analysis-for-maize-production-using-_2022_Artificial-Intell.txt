In Ethiopia, the low maize yield is attributed to the failure to effectively utilize available technologies for yield development, leading to food shortages. Maize cultivation in Ethiopia encompasses highland, midland, and lowland agro-ecological zones, having been introduced in the late 17th century.

Previous studies in Ethiopia have considered climate (rainfall and temperature), soil, land use, and elevation, but they did not account for land surface temperature (LST) as a determining criterion in physical land suitability assessment. Therefore, the current research aims to include LST as a key factor for land suitability assessment.

The study area in Ethiopia is characterized by a diverse range of soil types, with haplic alisols being the most dominant, covering 61.0% of the area, and rhodic nitisol being the least dominant, covering 7.5% of the area.

To obtain annual rainfall data for the study area, climate data from four stations were interpolated using inverse distance weighting (IDW) techniques. In this study, LST data was retrieved from the thermal bands of Landsat OLI/TIRS of 2020 using the mono window algorithm, and the soil data were obtained from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation Engineering, converted to raster format, and reclassified for overlay analysis.
