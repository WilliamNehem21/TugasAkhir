The initial foundation of our work is the distributed temporal logic (DTL), which is primarily concerned with expressing properties from the localized perspective of individual agents. We have extended this logic to also accommodate the expression of global properties. Our choice of this logic is motivated by several factors. Firstly, it is well-suited for specifying and reasoning about communicating agents in distributed systems. Secondly, its temporal dimension enables effective formalization and reasoning about interleaved protocol executions. Lastly, its distributed dimension, featuring explicit agent identifiers, facilitates the elegant formalization of various security goals that protocols aim to achieve, such as different forms of authentication and secrecy.

The logic we have introduced serves as a tool at the object level, enabling the specification and reasoning about specific protocols and the properties that these protocols are intended to establish. By employing this logic, it becomes possible to outline a protocol-independent distributed communication model, upon which protocols can be formally defined and analyzed. However, our primary objective is not solely the ad hoc analysis of specific protocols; instead, we aim to employ this logic as a metalevel tool for the comparative analysis of security protocol models and properties. By establishing modeling and analysis simplification techniques, our logic provides a basis for rigorously investigating general metalevel properties of different protocol models, contributing to the sound design of effective protocol validation tools.

We anticipate several applications of our work, including a rigorous account of different widely used simplification techniques, as well as the development of appropriate partial-order techniques that may reduce the potentially infinite state-space exploration involved in model-checking protocol properties. Although the model can be extended in various ways, such as incorporating other message constructors or additional actions and state propositions, our current formulation suffices to abstractly formalize and reason about the properties of communication between principals executing security protocols.

In summary, our approach is underpinned by communication and distribution, and through the selection of different signatures and axioms, we can define theories for formalizing and reasoning about various application domains, particularly in the context of security protocol models and their properties. Our logic provides not just a language for describing models but also a logic for reasoning about them. It is simple and robust, as formulas are invariant with respect to different linearizations, and we have utilized this characteristic in the proofs of both the one-intruder and predatory intruder reductions. Ongoing and future work includes further applications of our logic for reasoning about protocol composition and the development of a calculus for the logic.
