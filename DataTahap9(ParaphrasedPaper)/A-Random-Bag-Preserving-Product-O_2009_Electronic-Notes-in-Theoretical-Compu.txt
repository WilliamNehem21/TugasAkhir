The basic concept of random bag preservation enables the systematic tracking of data and the distribution of data states during MoQA computations, allowing for the (partially) automated determination of the average cost of operations. The paper focuses on the MoQA product operation, while acknowledging that the broader introduction of the MoQA language is outside the scope of this paper and will be covered in a separate book. The implementation of the language has commenced, with ongoing work to automatically derive the average cost of data structuring underway. 

MoQA is a high-level, domain-specific language with robust programming capabilities, including for-loops, recursion, and conditionals, facilitating the development of a wide range of data restructuring algorithms, including sorting and searching algorithms.

The incorporation of traditional labeled data structures, such as heaps, unordered lists, and sorted lists, into random structures is discussed, demonstrating that random structures can represent all possible data states for a given partial order.

The paper also introduces the concept of random product, a fundamental MoQA data structuring operation that combines two data structures into a larger one. The authors aim to illustrate that a random bag-preserving product operation can be achieved and provide a proof of this result.

Further research at CEOL is exploring alternative versions of the product and conducting efficiency comparisons. The paper outlines standard techniques for verifying random bag preservation and presents a specific example to illustrate the satisfaction of this property by the most common version of the product.

The paper concludes by discussing the extension of the unary random product to operate on random sub-structures of a given random structure, increasing the versatility of the operation within the MoQA language. The formal definition of an isolated subset is omitted due to space limitations, and the reader is directed to a comprehensive discussion for further details.
