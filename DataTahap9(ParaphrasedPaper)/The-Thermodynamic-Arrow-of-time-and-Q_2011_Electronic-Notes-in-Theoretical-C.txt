The author of the academic paper provides an explanation of the thermodynamic arrow-of-time, specifically the concept of increasing entropy over time, from a quantum mechanical perspective. They address the Loschmidt paradox by demonstrating how an irreversible macroscopic behavior can emerge from reversible microscopic dynamics. The argument presented posits that, in accordance with reversible dynamics, both entropy-increasing and entropy-decreasing transformations occur, but the latter do not leave any discernible evidence of their occurrence, making them indistinguishable from not happening at all. Consequently, the second law of thermodynamics is essentially reduced to a tautology: observable transformations are those in which entropy does not decrease. However, the author notes that typicality arguments may preclude this reasoning from being a comprehensive solution to the arrow-of-time predicament, suggesting that it may still be necessary to postulate a low-entropy initial state for the system in question.

Additionally, the author addresses potential objections about an observer's knowledge of entropy value, asserting that there is no practical method for an observer to exclude the possibility of any box being correlated with an unknown system unless the state of the entire universe is known. Consequently, an observer is compelled, by necessity, to assume that no correlations exist unless specifically known. The author dismisses the idea of defining thermodynamic entropy based on all potential correlations with other systems in the universe as impractical in practice.
