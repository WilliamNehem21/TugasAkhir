The LTE turbo encoder comprises two concatenated convolutional encoders connected by an interleaver, with a code rate of 1/3 and generator polynomials g0 and g1. The use of a quadratic permutation polynomial (QPP) for the interleaver was chosen to enhance system throughput. This conflict-free parallel turbo coder offers maximum flexibility for parallelism support in LTE, with a QPP inverse polynomial interleaver value of 4. The rate matching algorithm selects bits for transmission through puncturing or repeating from the 1/3 rate output of the turbo coder to achieve a desired effective code rate (ECR).

Lower order modulation schemes with lower data rates result in increased symbol pulse-width and decreased signal bandwidth, leading to improved bit error rate (BER) performance. As the number of bits per symbol decreases, so does the data rate, leading to a better BER performance due to the wider symbol pulse-width.

As the quantity of channel quality indicator (CQI) feedbacks increases, there is a penalty in terms of enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements. Higher CQI values indicate higher modulation orders and ECRs, resulting in higher bit rates and increased signal bandwidth and overlapping. Thus, at low channel SNRs, higher CQI feedback values result in worse BER performance compared to lower CQI feedback values.

The LTE system takes advantage of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in downlink transmission, which reduces inter-symbol interference (ISI) at high data rates, resulting in insignificant BER differences between different channel bandwidths. Additionally, the use of turbo coding, interleaving, and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) retransmissions helps maintain low BER levels within the system.
