As noted earlier, the limited size of the dataset makes it impossible to accurately draw conclusions considering all the predictors. Consequently, various dimensionality reduction techniques were employed to identify the top predictors defining the nutrient concentration in the aquaponic solution. Predictors exhibiting zero variance were removed from the dataset, and a correlation matrix was constructed for the remaining predictors. Subsequently, predictors deemed less than 5% important were eliminated to minimize the dataset's size to five primary chemical predictors and two categorical predictors. This process was carried out using recursive feature elimination with an xgboost classifier, resulting in a dataset comprising 143 observations with 7 predictors.

Phosphorus, with importance values of 4.51% and 4.44%, as well as pH, SAR, and charge balance with importance values of 1.2%, 0.93%, and 0.93% respectively, were removed. The final list of chemical predictors used in the analysis consisted of potassium, boron, bicarbonate, sulfate, and chloride concentrations in the solution (all measured in ppm). It is important to note that the 2 categorical predictors appended to the dataset captured the month and location of the observations. Thus, the dataset used for designing classification rules and drawing inferences consisted of 143 observations with 7 predictors.

Given the low sample size, there is a high risk of overfitting the data. To address this, bolstered error estimators were introduced, and their performance was evaluated with linear classifiers like LDA and linear SVM, along with non-linear classifiers such as CART (depth=2) and 3-NN. For the decision tree, a depth value of 2 was chosen to avoid overfitting, and the value of k for the k-nearest neighbor was determined to be 3 using the elbow method based on the optimal mean cluster distance on the training dataset.

The primary goal of this approach is to develop a recommendation system for users of hydroponic setups to maintain optimal nutrient concentrations for maximum yield. The recommended methods include specific rules devised from the pre-recorded observations, along with guidelines for maintaining the solution's hardness within prescribed limits to prevent eutrophication.

This study represents the first instance of leveraging AI to optimize nutrient concentrations in aquaponic solutions, marking a significant advancement over conventional methods. The proposed approach emphasizes quantifying nutrient regulation and routine monitoring based on the season in which crops are grown. By employing feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques, the study identified the five most crucial chemical parameters from an initial set of 20, resulting in a 75% reduction in nutrient costs. Furthermore, the AI model developed is scalable and can be implemented across various aquaponic operations, offering benefits such as overestimation of potential toxicity, improved produce quality, and reduced labor costs.

Nevertheless, several limitations of this approach need to be considered. The sparse data presents challenges in applying Bayesian statistical methods, which could be addressed by expanding the dataset in future studies. Additionally, the model's robustness could be improved by incorporating data from geographically diverse locations with varying weather conditions.

In conclusion, the semi-bolstered resubstitution error estimation technique was found to work best with linear SVC as the classifier, with a penalty parameter set to 1. The paper provides detailed recommendations for each predicted class and discusses their impact on plant and fish growth in a single system. Future research may focus on analyzing the effects of heavy metal concentrations on plant growth in aquaponic environments and extending the presented classification technique to other data-limited domains.
