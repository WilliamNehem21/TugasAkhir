Abstract

In order to avoid the problems of existing methods, a numerical simulation method for two-dimensional airflow over complex terrains is developed in this paper for the engineering use of flight dynamics. Based on the potential flow theories, the effects of terrains on the wind field are considered by a serial of two-dimensional vortexes, whose strengths are solved by combining with the ground boundary conditions. Numerical examples are studied by the proposed method, and the method is also evaluated by comparing the results with ones from the existing method. The result shows that the two- dimensional profile of complex terrains could be described by a cubic spline curve precisely. The computation procedure proposed in this paper is very simple and efficient, and it could provide a result of wind field with considerable accuracy. Therefore, this method could be used for flight principle evaluation and flight simulators.

Introduction

During take-off and landing, aircrafts are always affected by the atmospheric disturbances at low-altitude. The disturbances will also have a great influence on the flight characteristics of aircrafts that are executing the missions like low-altitude manned penetration. The techniques of wind field modeling and simulation are very important for both of the flight safety and flight dynamic response analysis. As the complex terrain is the main

reason that induces disturbances at low-altitude, and it is also an important element to establish the low- altitude flight environment in a simulator, so it is necessary to develop a numerical method for the low-altitude wind field simulation which could consider the influence of complex terrains.
There are mainly three different types of low-altitude wind field simulation methods at present. The first one is developed by the atmospheric dynamics theory, which could consider the variation of atmospheric parameters, such as the temperature, energy and pressure. Terry L. Clark[1] and Peng Hu[2] simulate the three-dimensional airflow over mountains by using this method, then compare the results with ones from observation and wind tunnel test and get a good match. However, its computation progress is very complex, which is not suitable for the engineering application of flight dynamics analysis. The second one is the engineering simulation method based on the potential flow theory of fluid dynamics. The assumption of the ideal gas has been adopted, and the temperature variation has been neglected. Guanxin Hong[3] and Gang Liu[4] simulate the two-dimensional airflow over the mountains by the airflow over a cylinder, which could be represented by a fundamental solution of potential flow, one of the streamlines has been chosen as the shape of the terrains. It has a simple process, and could describe the airflow over mountains clearly. But there are only limited kinds of mountain shapes, and need a lot of manual parameter adjust works. The last one is the table lookup method, which means all the data is measured and stored in the computer. It is close to practice, but requires a huge amount of data storage space, and costs a lot of labor and resources.
Based on the potential flow theory of aerodynamics and the boundary conditions of terrain shapes, a numerical simulation method has been proposed according to the engineering application requirements. This method could simulate the wind field at low-altitude that influenced by arbitrary terrain profiles. Moreover, numerical examples have been studied, and the results are compared with the ones mentioned in reference [3] and [4].

Theory

Complex terrain modeling

The Cartesian coordinate system Oxy is used to describe the terrain shape and wind field, where, the origin O is an arbitrary point, the x axis represents the horizontal distance, and the y axis represents the altitude. For the two-dimensional cases, the complex terrains could be represented by a complex curve in plane Oxy (as shown in Fig. 1). In this paper, the terrain curve is simulated by a cubic spline curve. If the cubic spline curve passes through a number of predefined points (xi, yi), where, j=1, 2, …, m, and m is the number of the points. Then the cubic spline curve could be described by a serial of third order polynomials

], j

(1)

j	j	j	j	j	j 1

where, aj bj cj	dj are the fitting coefficients of the jth section. All of the coefficients could be solved by using the coordinates of the predefined points and the continuity conditions of cubic spline curve.

Wind field modeling

Similarly to the solving approach of vortex lattice method in aerodynamics, the curve that describes the terrain is divided into a number of straight line elements, and the number is n. A two-dimensional vortex is arranged at the quarter point of each element. Choose the three-quarter point of the element as the colocation point. At this point the actual boundary condition is implemented. Therefore, the effect of the terrains on the wind field could be represented by the sum of induce velocities of all the vortexes at any arbitrary point in the wind field. Use the uniform free stream to represent the wind field without terrains, the stream function is,

0 v0 x  u0 y	(2)

where, u0 and v0 are two components of the uniform free stream velocity V, and V= [u0 v0] T.
For the ith element, assume that the vortex strength is i. The coordinates of vortex is (xvj, yvj), which could be obtained by cubic spline function eq.(1), also does the coordinates (xcj, ycj) and normal vector ni of the collocation point. Based on potential flow theory, the stream function of ith vortex is



i ln
i	2
(3)


where, P(x, y) is an arbitrary point in the wind field. Therefore the velocity that induced by the ith vortex at point P could be expressed as

( y  yvi )

Pi	2r 2	i
(x  x )
(4)

 	vi  
Pi	2r 2	i

where, r= [(x-xvi)2+(y-yvi)2]½ is the distance between P and the ith vortex. So the induced velocities of all the collocation points could be represented as

 Wx 
 W 	(5)

where u, v are the vectors that represent the induced velocity components of all the collocation points along the x axis and y axis, respectively; Wx, Wy are their influence coefficients matrixes; and  is vortex strength vector of all the vortex elements.
To search for a singularity distribution that creates enclosed streamlines, the Neumann boundary condition
[5] is used. For the collocation point of the ith vortex element, there is


(VVi )ni  0
(6)


where, Vi is the induced velocity at the ith colocation point, Vi= [ui vi]T. ni is the normal vector at ith element, ni=[nxi nyi]T. Then expanding eq. (6) yields



ui nxi
 vinyi
u0 nxi
 v0 nyi

Express the boundary condition equations of all the collocation points by matrix,


AAIC  A0
(8)


where, AAIC is influence coefficient matrix of the normal induced velocity; A0 is constant coefficients vector that relative to the normal direction of the elements and the free stream velocity. Then the strength of the vortexes could be solved as

Superposition of the effects of uniform free stream and two-dimensional vortexes, the stream function of the wind field with complex terrains could be represented as

The wind velocity at any arbitrary position could be solved by eq. (10).

Numerical examples

Several numerical examples have been studied in this paper, including the examples that proposed by reference [3] and [4].

Mountain shape simulation

In reference [3], the airflow over a single mountain is simulated by the ideal flow around a cylinder. One of the streamline has been chosen as the shape of the terrains, a factor S is used to get different mountain shapes. And reference [4] simulates the airflow over multiple mountains by superposition of the ideal flow around multiple cylinders. Because of the inherent property of the method, the kind of terrain shapes that could be modelled is limited. Moreover, all the parameters need manual adjustment, in order to get a much more approximate result of the mountain shape.
The flow around a cylinder could be solved by superposing two fundamental solutions of potential flow, which are the doublet and the uniform free stream. Write the speed of uniform free stream as V, which is along the x axis. The number of doublets is l, coordinate of ith doublet is (xi, yi), and the radius of the relative cylinder is Ri. Therefore, the stream function of the wind field is,

Fig. 2 ~ Fig. 5 indicates that, the methods mentioned in reference [3] and [4] could only get the symmetrical terrain models. Compared with the analytical results, the numerical results obtained by the proposed method match it very well, the errors of the velocity magnitudes are all less than 1%. And the absolute values of the error of the velocity direction are about 5%. And the error could be decreased by increasing the elements number.

Wind field over arbitrary terrains

Because the ideal flow over a cylinder has a fixed type, the terrain shapes that could be simulated by this method are still limited, even the shape factor is used. Therefore, a lot of parameter adjusting work will be needed for the multiple cylinders superposition method to simulate an arbitrary terrain as shown in fig.1, and it has a pretty low efficiency.
For the terrains shown in fig.1, the sea level range is x  [-, 0], with a gentle slope at x  [0, 1000], it transfers to the complex terrains at the range of x  [1000, 4000]. The plain range is x  [4000, +]. The wind field is defined as x  [-2000,6000] y  [0,2000]. Velocity of uniform free stream is still 5 m/s. Using the straight line and cubic spline curve to describe this complex terrain shape, and the curve of terrain is divided into 400 elements. Fig. 6 and Fig.7 shows the results of wind velocity and streamlines over the complex terrain.

Complex terrain is represented by the combination of the straight lines and cubic spline curves, which could be defined by several predefined pass through points. The two-dimensional profile of complex terrains could be described by this method precisely.
Compared with the analytical results of the airflow around a single cylinder and multiple cylinders, the numerical results obtained by the proposed method match the analytical results very well.
As a lot of parameter adjusting work will be needed for the multiple cylinders superposition method to simulate an arbitrary terrain, the computation procedure proposed in this paper is very simple and efficient, and could provide a wind field with considerable accuracy, which fits the requirements of engineering application very well. It could be used for flight principle evaluation and flight simulators.
