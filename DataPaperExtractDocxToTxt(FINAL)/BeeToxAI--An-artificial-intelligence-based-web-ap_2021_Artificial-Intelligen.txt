Chemically induced toxicity is the leading cause of recent extinction of honey bees. In this regard, we developed an innovative artificial intelligence-based web app (BeeToxAI) for assessing the acute toxicity of chemicals to
racy ∼91%) through the combination of Random Forest and molecular fingerprints to predict the potential for Apis mellifera. Initially, we developed and externally validated QSAR models for classification (external set accu-
nally validated regression QSAR models (𝑅2 = 0.75) using Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs). Afterward, the chemicals to cause acute contact toxicity and acute oral toxicity to honey bees. Then, we developed and exter-
best models were implemented in the publicly available BeeToxAI web app (http://beetoxai.labmol.com.br/). The outputs of BeeToxAI are: toxicity predictions with estimated confidence, applicability domain estimation, and color-coded maps of relative structure fragment contributions to toxicity. As an additional assessment of BeeToxAI performance, we collected an external set of pesticides with known bee toxicity that were not included in our modeling dataset. BeeToxAI classification models were able to predict four out of five pesticides correctly. The acute contact toxicity model correctly predicted all of the eight pesticides. Here we demonstrate that Bee- ToxAI can be used as a rapid new approach methodology for predicting acute toxicity of chemicals in honey bees.





Introduction

Pesticides play an essential role in protecting plants and reducing large-scale agricultural crop losses from insects and pathogens [1,2]. However, several harmful effects of pesticides on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems have been described in the literature, particularly towards non-target species such as fishes, earthworms, birds, and bees [3,4]. In the past few years, there has been increased concern regarding the im- pact of pesticides on bees [5–9]. During foraging or nectar, pollen, and
water collection, bees inadvertently may be contaminated with a wide array of pesticides [10]. Very often, contaminated bees carry these haz- ardous chemicals back to the hive, potentially inducing sub-lethal or lethal effects for the entire colony [10,11].
The drastic extinction of bees is a serious threat to global food secu- rity and planetary ecosystem stability [12,13]. For this reason, scientific advisory bodies and government agencies have employed standardized protocols to test the acute toxicity of active pesticide ingredients against adult honey bees (Apis mellifera) [14–17].

provides both a short and long-term strategy to assess the risks posed against honey bees by pesticides [16]. These animals can be exposed to pesticide residues by indirect contact on plant surfaces, via oral intake with contaminated water or food, or by direct contact during their ap- plication in standard farming practice. If the proposed use pattern of a pesticide indicates a possible exposure of honey bees, acute contact and oral toxicity studies are necessary for pesticide registration [16].
The acute toxicity tests examine the effects of a pesticide after a short-term exposure (24–96 h) using the median lethal dose that in- duces death in 50% of the population (LD50). The predominant exposure routes are through contact (i.e., direct spray) or oral incubation (i.e., consumption of nectar and pollen). Both the contact and oral toxicity
tests report toxicity values as 𝜇g/bee. If a pesticide’s active ingredient
is classified as highly or moderately toxic (LD50 <11 𝜇g/bee), it would
require complementary studies to determine acute oral toxicity and fo-
liage test using the final product [18]. The US EPA estimates that studies required for pesticide registration cost around $ 13,400 for honey bee acute toxicity, with a semi-field study on honey bees reaching $133,300 per chemical [19].
Understanding the costly and time-consuming characteristics of ex- perimental assays, in silico models have emerged as a practical solu- tion to be employed as screening tools and within integrated testing strategies to avoid animal testing as well as reduce cost and chemical waste [20]. Computational strategies comply with the “3R’s” principle of replacement, refinement, and reduction of animal testing [21]. The more simplistic approaches are based on the concept that compounds sharing structural similarity (read-across)[22] or certain substructures (structural alerts) [23] have increased probability to share the same tox- icological properties [22]. However, there has been a growing concern that structural alerts disproportionally flag too many chemicals as toxic, which questions their reliability as toxicity markers [23]. Therefore, their use in regulatory toxicology has been hampered by the lack of transparency and interpretability [23].
Consequently, Quantitative Structure-Activity/Toxicity Relationship (QSAR/QSTR) models have been developed as alternative methods to experimental tests and rule-based methods. QSAR modeling reveals re- lationships between structural properties of chemical compounds and corresponding biological/toxicological properties [22–24]. These char- acteristics confer more accurate predictions of the toxicity of untested chemicals from their chemical structures [23]. Currently, the most modern QSAR methodologies are developed using artificial intelligence methods, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algo- rithms [25,26]. ML is a growing field of artificial intelligence that uses different statistical techniques to enable computers to learn from chem- ical and biological or toxicological data without being explicitly pro- grammed for this task [27]. These algorithms are capable of capturing the complex nonlinear relationships between the relevant descriptors (i.e., mathematical representations of molecules’ properties) and the ob- served properties/toxicities [26,28].
Although QSAR is widespread in the ecotoxicology field, there are few freely available QSAR-based tools with a graphical interface to as- sess the oral and acute contact toxicity of chemicals to honey bees [29,30]. Similarly, no QSAR model has been reported to assess acute oral toxicity of chemicals to honey bees. In addition, a critical analysis reveals that the vast majority of the published models do not comply with the OECD principles [31], as well as best practices for data cura- tion[32–34] and QSAR modeling [35]. The main drawbacks of previous QSAR studies includes: (i) lack of evidence on data curation and dupli- cate analysis [29,36–38]; (ii) use of an undefined or confusing endpoint
[29]; (iii) lack of AD estimation [29,37,39]; and (iv) lack of mechanistic interpretation [29,36–39]. For example, although the models developed by Wang et al. [29]. and implemented in the BeeTox web app have sat- isfactory predictive performance, estimates of the applicability domain (DA) and mechanistic interpretation of the predictions were not pro- vided. In addition, we found more than 60 duplicates in its dataset, which can lead to overestimation of the model. Thus, their reliability
for assessing chemically-induced acute toxicity for honey bees is not as- sured.
Hence, this manuscript describes the development and application of an easily accessible, open-source, public-facing web application (Bee- ToxAI: http://beetoxai.labmol.com.br/) to democratize access to these predictive QSAR models for a wide range of stakeholders, including reg- ulators, regulated industry, research scientists, and the public. BeeToxAI is the first web app for the prediction of acute contact and oral toxicity in honey bees fully compliant with the stringent predictive modeling practices [35] and OECD guidelines [31].

Material and methods

Datasets

A dataset of compounds containing experimental acute toxicity data for honey bees (A. mellifera) was collected from the scientific literature [40–52], as well as the US EPA’s Ecotox database [53], EFSA’s Open- FoodTox database [54], and Online Chemical Modeling Environment (OCHEM) database [55]. Data integration resulted in an uncured dataset consisting of 2543 pesticide and pesticide-like compounds representing different classes (e.g., insecticides, herbicides, fungicides) and with a wide spectrum of toxicity mechanisms. Then, compounds with a me-
dian lethal dose (LD50, 𝜇g/bee) for adult honey bee recorded after 48 h
were categorized into toxic and nontoxic using a threshold of 11 𝜇g/bee
as described in the US EPA test guidelines [16]. Compounds were di-
vided into two independent datasets according to honey bee exposure type (contact and oral). A brief description of the datasets is presented below:
Contact exposure dataset (File S1): 615 compounds with LD50 data
pounds with LD50 ≤11 𝜇g/bee and 386 nontoxic compounds (LD50 for contact exposure of honey bees. It consisted of 229 toxic com-
>11 𝜇g/bee).
Oral exposure dataset (File S2): 211 compounds with LD50 data
pounds with LD50 ≤11 𝜇g/bee and 118 nontoxic compounds (LD50 for contact exposure of honey bees. It consisted of 93 toxic com-
>11 𝜇g/bee).

Data curation

All chemical structures and correspondent LD50 data were carefully standardized using Standardizer v.16.9.5.0 (ChemAxon, Budapest, Hun- gary) according to the protocols proposed by Fourches and colleagues [32–34]. Briefly, explicit hydrogens were added, whereas salts, mix- tures, polymers, and organometallic compounds were removed. In addi- tion, specific chemotypes such as aromatic rings and nitro groups were normalized. Then, we performed the analysis and exclusion of dupli- cates. Distinct criteria were employed, as follows:
Classificatory QSAR models: (i) if duplicates presented discordance in toxicological outcomes (e.g., toxic vs nontoxic), both entries would be excluded; and (ii) if the reported outcomes of the duplicates were the same, one entry would be retained in the dataset and the other excluded. After duplicate removal, the contact exposure dataset had 382 compounds (toxic: 112, nontoxic: 269), while the oral exposure dataset had 169 compounds (toxic: 71, nontoxic: 98).
Regression QSAR models: (i) duplicates were inspected visually, (ii) if duplicates presented discordant potencies, both entries would be excluded; and (iii) if the reported potencies were similar, an aver- age of the values was calculated, and one entry was retained in the dataset. Subsequently, the LD50 values were converted to negative
logarithmic (−log) units (pLD50) at μM range. At the end of this pro-
cess, the contact exposure dataset had 218 compounds, while the
oral exposure dataset had 142 compounds.



Chemical space analysis

The chemical space formed by toxic and nontoxic compounds for A. mellifera and 2044 commercial pesticides (untested against A. mellifera) collected from Pesticide Product Information System Database [56] was analyzed by plotting a similarity map and was generated using OSIRIS DataWarrior software v.05.02.01 [57]. The similarity map uses a Rub- berbanding Forcefield approach, which translates similarity (vertices) between compounds (nodes). The approach involves the following steps:
(i) randomly positioning all compounds in 2D space; (ii) calculating the similarity matrix between all compounds using Tanimoto coeﬃcients (Tc) and FragFP descriptors; (iii) location of most similar neighbors (Tc
>0.8) to be considered for every compound; and (iv) stepwise relocation
of all compounds to ensure similar molecules were located close to each
other [57].

Classification models

The models were developed in Python v.3.658 following best prac- tices for QSAR modeling [35], and are fully compliant with OECD prin- ciples for validation of QSAR modeling for regulatory purposes, i.e., a
The prior distribution is combined with the likelihood function P(D1: t |𝑓 ) of overserving D1∶𝑡 given model 𝑓 multiplied by the prior probability of P(𝑓 ). In doing so, Bayesian optimization finds hyperparameters that
maximize the objective function (G-mean score) by building a surrogate function (probabilistic model) based on past evaluation hyperparame- ters of the objective [66,67]. The geometric (G)-mean was selected as the scorer since it measures the balance between classification perfor- mances on both the majority (nontoxic) and minority (toxic) classes.

Threshold-moving
The QSAR models were calibrated using a threshold-moving ap- proach implemented in Scikit-learn v.0.24.2 [65]. This approach uses different probability thresholds in the range of 0 to 1 obtained via the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to find the threshold with the largest G-mean value. Thus, it is easier to predict the minority class examples accurately. To use the G-mean value as the model bound- ary class, we implemented a Python class to overlay toxicity prediction and its probability in the Scikit-learn framework. Subsequently, prob- ability values were scaled to estimate the confidence of predictions as follows:
  𝑥 − min(𝑥) 

defined endpoint, an unambiguous algorithm, a defined domain of ap- plicability, appropriate measures of goodness-of-fit, robustness and pre-

dictivity, and a mechanistic interpretation if possible [31].

Molecular fingerprints
Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) keys, Morgan (ECFP-like), and FeatMorgan (FCFP-like) fingerprints were calculated in the open-source cheminformatics software RDKit [59] with a diameter of 4–8 and bit vector of 2048 bits [60]. ECFPs are circular fingerprints that captures highly specific atomic information enabling the representation of a large set of precisely defined structural features [61], whereas FCFP finger- prints captures functional features (i.e., hydrogen-bond donor and ac- ceptors, aromatic, halogen, and basic and acid groups) [62].
Dataset splitting and 5-fold cross-validation
The general flowchart for splitting contact and oral datasets of com- pounds is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Initially, datasets were split into modeling sets (80% of compounds) and external sets (20% of com-
where min(𝑥) denotes the minimum of the range of your measurement,
max(𝑥) denotes the maximum of the range of your measurement, and
𝑥 ∈ [min(𝑥), max(𝑥)] denotes your measurement to be scaled. Proba- bilities 𝑥 are on the interval [0,1], with 𝑥 = min(𝑥) mapped to 0 and
𝑥 = max(𝑥) mapped to 1.

Assessment of model performance
The internal and external predictive performances of QSAR mod- els were evaluated using accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Matthews correlation coeﬃcient (MCC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). These metrics were calculated as follows:

pounds) using the random distribution approach. The modeling sets were used to generate QSAR models through a 5-fold external cross- validation (5FCV) approach, while the external sets were used to assess the predictive power of models. The structural diversity of the mod- eling and external set compounds was evaluated using the similarity maps. These plots show that external set compounds occupy the same chemical space as the modeling set compounds. The modeling sets were subjected to 5FCV approach where five subsets of equal size were gen- erated. Together, four subsets (80% of the modeling set) were used to build the QSAR models (training set) and the remaining subset of 20% (test set) was employed to evaluate the robustness of the QSAR model.

QSAR modeling and hyperparameter optimization
QSAR models were developed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) [63] and Random Forest (RF) [64] algorithms implemented in Scikit-learn v.0.24.2 [65]. Since the performance of ML is closely related to its hyperparameters, the models were optimized using a Bayesian ap- proach implemented in Scikit-Optimize v.0.7.4 [66]. Details of hyper- parameters explored in this work are available in the Supporting Infor- mation. The Bayesian optimization may be defined as follows:
where N represents the number of compounds, TP and TN represent the number of true positives and true negatives, and FP and FN represent the number of false positives and false negatives, respectively.

Applicability domain (AD)
Any QSAR model needs to demonstrate not only good accuracy but also characterize the reliability of external predictions. To address the
latter, the AD of models was estimated using Dice similarity (D𝑆 ) be-
tween a compound under prediction (A) and the training set compounds
(B) [69]. The Dc is calculated by the following equation:
sualize the fragments and atoms contributing to acute contact and oral toxicities. Here, the "weight" of an atom was considered as a predicted- probability difference (classification models) or pLD50 difference (re- gression models) obtained when the bits in the fingerprint correspond- ing to the atom are removed. Then, the normalized weights were used to color the atoms in a topography-like map in which green indicating negative contribution for toxicity (i.e., predicted probability or pLD50 in- creases when the bits are removed), and red indicating a positive contri- bution for toxicity (i.e., predicted probability or pLD50 decreases when the bits are removed) [73].

Model implementation

The BeeToxAI web app was implemented on a multiplatform frame-

the set, i.e., the number of bits (fingerprints) in that set. The ∩ is used where a set with vertical bars on either side refers to the cardinality of
sets). Then, an AD threshold (DT) was defined to estimate the reliability to represent the intersection of two sets (bits that are common to both
of external predictions:
DT = ȳ + Zσ	(14)
where ӯ is the average D𝑆 of the compounds under prediction and train- ing set compounds, 𝜎 is the standard deviation of D𝑆 , and Z is an arbi-
of this parameter Z at 0.5. If the compound distance exceeds the DT, the trary parameter to control the significance level. We set the default value
prediction may be considered less trustworthy [70].

Regression models

Then, regression models based on Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) were developed using Keras (https://keras.io/), and Tensorflow (www.tensorflow.org) as backend. Initially, the datasets were split into modeling sets (80% of compounds) and test sets (20% of compounds) using the random distribution approach. Then, regression models were developed using ECFP4 fingerprints and pLD50 values at μM range. The architecture of the FNNs was optimized according to the following com- binations: layer type (dense), number of hidden layers (3–7), activation functions (ReLU, Elu, Selu), output layer function (sigmoid), model op- timizer (Adam). The “mean squared error” was used as a loss function. The “mean absolute error” was used as a parameter to judge the per- formance of the models. The following hyperparameters were used for further FNN training: the number of epochs (1–200), dropout (0.001), and batch size (5–30). Baseline comparison of models was performed using Support Vector Regression (SVM) [63] and RF [64] algorithms implemented in Scikit-learn v.0.24.2 [65]. The predictive performance
of regression models was evaluated using correlation coeﬃcient (𝑅2),
root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) [71].
These metrics were calculated as follows:
work with technology ready to support large-scale demands on mi- croservice serverless and Kubernetes environments [74]. The backend serving makes deploying new algorithms and experiments easy while keeping the same server architecture and the APIs. The APIs work with JSON infrastructure and permit out-of-the-box integration with other computer software (e.g., KNIME or a custom front-end). The main li- braries integrated are Python [58], RDKit [59], Scikit-learn [65], uWSGI [75], JavaScript [76], Flask [77], Matplolib [78], and Seaborn [79]. BeeToxAI also includes the JSME molecule editor written in JavaScript [80], which is supported by the most popular web browsers. Java or Flash plugins are not required to use the app. Also, our back and front- end use GitLab [81], CI/CD for Continuous integration (CI), Continu- ous Delivery (CDE), and Continuous Deployment (CD). The application’s code base is hosted in a Git repository[82] and, to every push, runs a pipeline of scripts to build, test, validate, and deploying your application to production.

Results and discussion

In the present study, we integrated and carefully compiled the largest collection of compounds with acute toxicity data (LD50) for adult A. mel- lifera. The compounds were divided into “contact” (File S1) and “oral”
mental acute toxicity assays. A threshold of 11 𝜇g/bee was used to cat- (File S2) datasets according to the type of bee exposure during experi- egorize compounds into toxic (≤11 𝜇g/bee) and nontoxic (>11 𝜇g/bee)
as described in the US EPA test guidelines [16].
Subsequently, we carefully curated contact and oral datasets using standard protocols [32–34]. Data curating represents a crucial step for building predictive QSAR models. It has been recognized that genotype differences among the 26 recognized subspecies of A. mellifera can di- rectly impact the response to chemicals [83]. Unfortunately, subspecies information is not provided for most chemicals deposited in public do- main databases. In addition, considerable differences often appear when toxicity tests are performed by different laboratories [84] and when dif-

times in the modeling and external sets. QSAR models built with datasets containing duplicates will have low accuracy if toxicity outcomes are dissimilar or overoptimistic performances if outcomes are identical [34]. Despite this, data curation procedures have not been uniformly applied to the development of some QSAR models [29,36–38].

datasets were further divided (Fig. S1) into modeling (80%) and exter- nal (20%) sets. So, 305 compounds of the contact dataset were used for the model development while the remaining 77 compounds (20%) were used to validate the models. Similarly, 135 compounds of the oral

The overall quality of dataset splitting is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, which indicated that exter- nal set compounds are relatively distributed in all regions of the chem- ical space of modeling set compounds.
On the other hand, for the datasets to develop regression models, af- ter data curation and duplicate removal, the contact exposure dataset had 218 compounds while the oral exposure dataset had 142 com- pounds. After splitting the datasets into modeling (80%) and external (20%) sets, 174 compounds of the contact dataset were used for the model development and 44 compounds were used to validate the mod- els. In the same manner, 114 compounds of the oral dataset were used for model development and 28 compounds were used to validate the models.

Chemical space analysis

The analysis of chemical space was performed by using contact and oral exposure datasets and 2044 pesticides collected from the Pesti- cide Product Information System Database [56]. The analysis has been performed by plotting both datasets separately against the pesticide database using similarity maps (Fig. 1) [57].
As shown in Fig. 1, both datasets are structurally diverse, contain- ing smaller clusters of similar compounds (black circles), and covers all regions of the chemical space of pesticides. This finding correlates well with our previous observation that a broad range of chemical categories (drugs, industrial use, pesticides, cosmetics) have similar structures and that a property of a compound depends on its chemical structure and not on its industrial class [86].
When analyzing the outcomes of the contact dataset (Fig. 1a), it was found that most of the toxic and nontoxic compounds do not share the same clusters, and similar characteristics were observed in the oral dataset (Fig. 1d). This analysis shows that both datasets have few toxicity cliffs (i.e., structurally similar compounds with a large dif- ference in toxicity) [87–89]. Representative compounds of clusters 1–3 from the contact dataset are shown in Fig. 1b. Cluster 1 contains toxic pyrethroids; cluster 2 – toxic organothiophosphates; cluster 3 – non- toxic sulfonylureas. The representative compounds of clusters 1–3 from the oral dataset are shown in Fig. 1d. Cluster 1 contains toxic phospho- nothioates; cluster 2 – toxic pyrethroids; cluster 3 – nontoxic azoles.

Performance of classification models

A total of 20 classification models were developed by a combina- tion of two ML methods (RF and SVM) along with three fingerprint sets: MACCS, FCFP and ECFP (diameter 4: FCFP4, ECFP4; diameter 8: FCFP8, ECFP8). The statistical characteristics of the QSAR models devel- oped for acute contact toxicity and acute oral toxicity are summarized
SE = 0.64–0.82; SP = 0.81–0.98, 𝜅 = 0.58–0.74; and MCC = 0.59–0.75. in Tables S1 and S2. Briefly, ACC values ranged between 0.81–0.89;
developed for acute oral toxicity (ACC = 0.88; SE = 0.86; SP = 0.90; and 𝜅 = 0.76), suggesting that this model has a higher accuracy to sort
the toxicological potential of new compounds.




Threshold-moving calibration for imbalanced classification

To increase prediction confidence without losing data, i.e., without needing to balance the data, we tried threshold-moving calibration of probability estimates [90]. Mechanistically, classification models also output a continuous value as the probability of a given case belonging to a output class. The probabilities can be interpreted as the likelihood or confidence of a given case belonging to each class. Here, classifi- cation models were trained independently using acute contact and oral datasets to distinguish toxic vs. nontoxic compounds. Usually, predicted probabilities values less than 0.5 are assigned to the class of nontoxic compounds and values greater than or equal to 0.5 are assigned to the class of toxic compounds. However, QSAR models developed for classifi- cation using imbalanced data usually provide poor probability estimates
(<0.5) for the minority class [91,92]. In view of this, different proba-
bility thresholds in a range between 0 and 1 were explored to find the
optimal threshold that reflects the best performance. Details of statis- tical performances of calibrated models for acute contact toxicity and acute oral toxicity are summarized in Tables S3 and S4, respectively. In general, the threshold-moving led to significant improvements in statis- tical performance of these QSAR models (Fig. 2a). As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2a, changing the threshold from 0.5 to 0.32 improved the ACC
(+4%), MCC (+14%), and 𝜅 (+16%) of the FCFP4 + SVM model devel-
oped for acute contact toxicity. Based on this, the adjusted probability
threshold obtained for this model was kept as the final model for the prediction of acute contact toxicity of new compounds.
The performance of the acute oral toxicity models was also investi- gated after threshold-moving calibration, although they were generated using a dataset with a similar ratio of toxic and nontoxic compounds (1:1.4). The statistical characteristics of calibrated models developed for acute oral toxicity are shown in Tables 2 and S4. According to the radar plot (Fig. 2b), the threshold-moving calibration did not lead to ap- parent improvements in the internal and external performances of these models. Consequently, threshold-moving calibration was not used as ad- justing parameters for predicting acute oral toxicity of new compounds. From the statistical point of view, our modeling approach enabled the development of externally predictive classification models. How- ever, building QSAR models trained with small datasets of compounds must always be considered delicate, since it may suffer from various deficiencies like inconsistent classifications for chemicals outside AD. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretation of these models may be chal- lenging given the sum of a plethora of toxicological mechanisms, each involving different biochemical pathways concurring to the final effect.

Performance of regression models

Following the results from the former section, we developed regres- sion models using FNNs aiming to predict pLD50 values for acute contact and acute oral toxicities on honey bees. We evaluated the combination of different FNN configurations and hyperparameters for both acute con- tact and acute oral datasets. The best performance was determined based
on the best balance between 𝑅2 and RMSE. The tested hyperparameters
and their respective influence on model performance are shown in Fig. 3.
Initially, we assessed different number of hidden layers for each dataset, since depth has a large impact on the model complexity and can lead to overfitting of models. As we can see in Fig. 3a,b, five hidden layers showed the best results for the acute contact toxicity model, while six hidden layers improved the performance for acute oral toxicity model. In addition, ReLU activation function showed the best results among all tested functions (Fig. 3c,d). In addition, batch sizes of 20 and 15 showed the best performances for the acute contact and acute oral models, re- spectively (Fig. 3e,f).
dictive acute contact model (𝑅2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.39, and MAE = 0.32) After the finding of the best combinations, we found that most pre-
was generated using five hidden layers, decreasing the number of neu- rons in the subsequent hidden layer [512, 256, 128, 16, and 4, respec- tively (Fig. 3g)], the ReLU activation function, batch size of 20, and
199 epochs. On the other hand, the best acute oral model (𝑅2 = 0.75,
RMSE = 0.68, and MAE = 0.53) was generated using six hidden lay-
ers, decreasing the number of neurons in the subsequent hidden layer
[512, 256, 128, 64, 32, and 16, respectively (Fig. 3h)], the ReLU activa- tion function, batch size of 15, and 142 epochs. We also trained RF and SVR methods using ECFP4 fingerprints as baseline models to examine dataset modelability. SVR algorithm advantages in modeling nonlinear
problems [63], whereas RF attracts much interest in QSAR studies be- cause it is not sensitive to the hyperparameters [64]. For both acute tox- icity endpoints, regression models based on optimized FNNs (R2 ≥ 0.75) showed superior performance over RF and SVR (R2 ≤ 0.41) models, indi- cating that modeled datasets do not have easily distinguishable patterns and are not biased.

Comparison with publicly available models

Classification models
Several classification methods have been developed to assess chemical-induced acute toxicity on honey bees, and thus a comparison of their statistical performances is shown in Table 3.
Overall, the classification models reported in this study (ACC = 0.91,
MCC = 0.78) showed higher performance compared with those gen- erated by Como et al. (ACC = 0.84, MCC = 0.67) [37], Venko et al. (ACC = 0.77, MCC = 0.48) [38], Wang et al. (ACC = 0.83, MCC = 0.59)
[29], Li et al. (ACC = 0.90, MCC = 0.76) [39], and Singh et al. (ACC = 0.87 and 0.89 for classification and multi-class classification,
respectively) [36]. On the other hand, our model showed statistical per-
(ACC = 0.90, MCC = 0.78). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that these com- formance comparable with QSAR developed by Carnesecchi et al. [93].
parisons should not be interpreted rigorously, as different compositions and sizes of the training and test sets were used to build models. In ad- dition, Carnesecchi et al. [30]. developed externally predictive QSAR models to assess the acute contact toxicity of mixtures to honey bees
(𝑅2 = 0.89), and the nature of combined synergic/non-synergic toxicity
(ACC = 0.96, MCC = 0.90). Although these models may contribute to
fill part of the gaps in toxicological assessment in honey bees, it is not
suitable to compare them with our active ingredient-based models, since

they were developed using a small dataset (n = 120) of binary mixtures
[30].

Regression models
A comparison of predictive performances of our regression models with publicly available models is shown in Table 4. Again, a rigorous comparison with previous models reported in the literature is not fea- sible due to different compositions of the training and test sets. De- spite that, the best model developed for acute contact toxicity presented lower error on test set compared to the model developed by Hamadache
et al. (RMSE = 0.71) [94], Carnesecchi et al. (RMSE = 0.71) [93], and
Toropov and Benfenati (RMSE = 0.68) [95], while the best model de-
veloped for acute oral toxicity presented comparable statistical perfor-
mance with them. On the other hand, the best model developed for acute contact toxicity showed comparable statistical performance with
the models developed by Devillers et al. (RMSE = 0.39) [96] and Singh
et al. (RMSE = 0.33) [36], Although our models presented higher errors on the test set compared to the model of Dulin et al. (RMSE = 0.218),

The BeeToxAI usage

The most predictive classification and regression models for acute contact and oral toxicity were implemented in the BeeToxAI web app (http://beetoxai.labmol.com.br/). The BeeToxAI has an intuitive user interface (Fig. 4), in which the user may draw a compound of interest in the “molecular editor” box or directly paste the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification (SMILES) string of the queried chemi- cal structure. After hitting the “Submit Analysis” button, the user will receive the classification outcomes (e.g., toxic, nontoxic) using the best classification models developed for acute contact and oral toxicities. Are

After hitting the “Submit Analysis” button, the user will receive predicted values and LD50 for acute contact and oral toxicities, predicted probability values, AD estimates, and color-coded maps of fragment contributions to toxicity.

also showed predicted probability values, which are useful for estimat- ing the confidence of classification outcomes [70]. When a compound is classified as toxic by acute contact or oral toxicity classification model, then the prediction by the respective regression model is activated and the predicted LD50 is displayed on the screen. All predictions are fol- lowed by the AD estimates and mechanistic interpretation using color- coded maps of fragment contribution [72,73]. For the maps, atoms or fragments promoting positive toxicity contributions are highlighted in red, while structural moieties decreasing the toxicity are highlighted in green. Also, the predicted pLD50 is shown on the respective contribution map.
Case study using BeeToxAI

In order to carry out an additional statistical validation of the Bee- ToxAI app, we compiled and prepared a list of 8 additional pesticides (not included in the QSAR datasets) with honey bee contact and/or oral LD50 data used in the United States from 1992 to 2014 (Table S5). Then, we used BeeToxAI to predict these pesticides’ contact and oral toxicity potential to honey bees (Figs. 5 and 6).
According to the results of BeeToxAI (Figs. 5 and 6), the acute oral toxicity classification model correctly classified four out of five pesti- cides (three of the listed pesticides did not have experimental data on acute oral toxicity) and the acute contact toxicity classification model correctly classified all of the eight pesticides. The pesticide incorrectly classified by the acute oral toxicity classification model was correctly predicted by the respective regression model. These results corroborate with the high external predictive power reported above. On the other hand, two compounds were erroneously predicted by the acute contact toxicity regression model. Most of the incorrect predictions were out- side of the model AD. Therefore, the analysis of predictions using Bee- ToxAI should be cautious when considering chemicals outside the DA, since the classification and regression models were trained using small datasets.
All predictions are accompanied by color-coded maps of fragment contributions to toxicity (Figs. 5 and 6). These contribution maps esti- mate the weight of single fragments or atoms to toxicity by removing them from the structure and calculating the difference between the pre- dicted values for the initial structure and the structure with a removed fragment. This enables estimation of the contributions of whole frag- ments (functional groups, scaffolds, linkers) as well as their combined

effect if two or more groups are removed simultaneously from the struc- ture [73].
Overall, contribution maps from BeeToxAI allow the user to analyze the individual contribution of each fragment for acute oral toxicity and contact toxicity. In addition, the AD and prediction probabilities pro- vide further context to the model outputs that allow for estimates of overall confidence. Other existing models do not provide this degree of mechanistic interpretation [29,36–39,93]. Mechanistic interpretation of predictions reported here can lead to such additional benefits as (i) elic- itation of structural alerts; (ii) insights on the mode of action; and (iii) utility to chemists who want to modify the molecule [99,100]. BeeToxAI indicated the significant contribution of several fragments for toxicity, including phosphinates (see fenamiphos acute oral toxicity map, Fig. 5) and phosphonates (see oxydemeton-methyl and phosphamidon maps, Fig. 6). In view of this, we overcame an inherent trade-off between pre- dictive performance and interpretability that has been traditionally as- sumed [101], implementing highly predictive and interpretable QSAR models in BeeToxAI.

Conclusion

In this work, we developed and rigorously validated classification and regression QSAR models that accurately predict acute contact and oral toxicities of chemicals to honey bees. Benchmarking with existing computational tools demonstrated superior or comparable performance. In addition, we implemented a visual algorithm that facilitates model
interpretation. These models were implemented in the BeeToxAI web app – a fast, reliable, and user-friendly tool for the assessment of acute chemical toxicity to honey bees. Users can make predictions using rigor- ously and externally validated computational models that fulfill all the OECD principles for developing and validating QSAR models for regu- latory purposes. The web app does not require any prior knowledge of programming or computational skills for its utilization. The predictions for a single compound take only a few seconds.
Furthermore, BeeToxAI provides the user with the following out- comes: (i) toxic/nontoxic classification for acute contact toxicity and acute oral toxicity honey bees endpoints; (ii) confidence of the pre- dictions; (iii) applicability domain estimation; and (iv) color-coded contribution maps illustrating the relative contribution of chemical fragments for toxicity. The web app, designed to openly share the aforementioned predictive models, is freely available to the public at http://beetoxai.labmol.com.br/. We propose these models as a valu- able contribution to the scientific community that enables regulators and regulated companies to rapidly evaluate the risk of chemical harm to honey bees (Apis mellifera) for the registration of the new pesticides. Future directions of the BeeToxAI include the implementation of Quan- titative Activity-Activity Relationships (QAAR) [102], Mode of Action (MoA) predictors, multi-task (species) models, and read-across (nearest neighbors) [23]. In this context, the ongoing BeeToxAI project aims to implement new predictive models to assess the acute toxicity of active ingredients and mixtures [30] against multiple stages (adult and larvae) of honey bees and bumble bees.
