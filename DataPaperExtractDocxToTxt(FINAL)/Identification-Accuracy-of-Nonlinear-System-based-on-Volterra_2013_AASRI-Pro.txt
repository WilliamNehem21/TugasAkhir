Abstract

The accuracy of the interpolation method for identification of nonlinear dynamical systems based on the Volterra model in the frequency domain is studied. To highlight the n-th partial component in the response of the system to the test signal the n-th partial derivative of the response using the test signal amplitude is found and its value is taken at zero. The polyharmonic signals are used as test ones. The algorithmic and software toolkit is developed for identification processes. This toolkit is used to construct the informational model of test system. The model is built as a first, second and third order amplitude–frequency characteristics and phase–frequency characteristics. The comparison of obtained characteristics with standard is given.

Introduction

It is necessary to consider technical conditions of the communication channels (CC) operation for effective data transfer. Changes in environmental conditions cause reducing the transmission data rate: in the digital CC- up to a full stop of the transmission, in analog CC - to the noise and distortion of the transmitted signals.

The new methods and supporting toolkit are developing to automate the measurement of parameters and taking into account the characteristics of the CC. This toolkit allows obtaining the informational and mathematical model of such nonlinear dynamic object, as the CC [1], i.e. to solve the identification problem. Modern continuous CCs are nonlinear stochastic inertial systems. The model in the form of integro-power Volterra series used to identify them [2–5].
The nonlinear and dynamic properties of such system are completely characterized by a sequence of multidimensional weighting functions – Volterra kernels).
Building a model of nonlinear dynamic system in the form of a Volterra series lies in the choice of the test actions form. Also it uses the developed algorithm that allows determining the Volterra kernels and their Fourier-images for the measured responses (multidimensional amplitude–frequency characteristics (AFC) and phase-frequency characteristics (PFC)) to simulate the CC in the time or frequency domain, respectively [6].
The additional research of new method of nonlinear dynamical systems identification, based on the Volterra model in the frequency domain is proposed. This method lies in n-fold differentiation of responses of the identifiable system by the amplitude of the test polyharmonic signals. The developed identification toolkit is used to build information model of the test nonlinear dynamic object in the form of the first, second and third order model [8].

Interpolation Method of Volterra Kernels Computation

An interpolation method of identification of the nonlinear dynamical system based on Volterra series is used [7–8]. It is used n-fold differentiation of a target signal on parameter–amplitude a of test actions to separate the responses of the nonlinear dynamical system on partial components yˆn (t) [9].
ax(t) type test signal is sent to input of the system, where x(t) – any function; |a|1 – scale factor for n-th order

In [10] it is defined that during determination of multidimensional transfer functions of nonlinear systems it is necessary to consider the imposed constraints on choice of the test polyharmonic signal frequencies.

The techniques of test object identification

The main purpose was to identify the multifrequency performances characterizing nonlinear and dynamical properties of nonlinear test object. Volterra model in the form of the second order polynomial is used. Thus, test object properties are characterized by transfer functions of W1(j), W2(j1,j2), W3(j1,j2,j3)  by Fourier-images of weight functions w1(t), w2(t1, t2) and w3(t1, t2, t3).
Structure charts of identification procedure – determinations of the first, second and third order AFC of CC are presented accordingly on fig. 1.


The weighted sum is formed from received signals – responses of each group (fig. 1). As a result the partial components of CC responses y1(t), y2(t) and y3(t) are got. For each partial component of response the Fourier transform (the FFT is used) is calculated, and from received spectrum only an informative harmonics (which amplitudes represent values of required characteristics of the first, second and third orders AFC) are taken.

The first order AFC |W1(j)| and PFC argW1(j) is received by extracting the harmonics with frequency f
from the spectrum of the CC partial response y1(t) to the test signal x(t)=A/2(cost).
The second order AFC |W2(j,j(+1))| and PFC argW2(j,j(+1)), where 1=  2=+1, was received by extracting the harmonics with summary frequency 1+2 from the spectrum of the CC partial response y2(t) to the test signal x(t)=(A/2)(cos1t+cos2t).
The third order AFC |W3(j,j(+1)),j(+2))| and PFC argW3(j,j(+1)),j(+2)), where 1=,
2=+1 and 3=+2, was received by extracting the harmonics with summary frequency 1+2+3
from the spectrum of the CC partial response y2(t) to the test signal x(t)=(A/2)(cos1t+cos2t+cos3t).


The results (first, second and third order AFC and PFC) which had been received after procedure of identification are represented in fig. 2–4 (number of experiments for the model N=4).
The surfaces shown on fig. 5–8 are built from subdiagonal cross-sections which were received separately. 1 was used as growing parameter of identification with different value for each cross–section in second order characteristics. Fixed value of 2 and growing value of 1 were used as parameters of identification to obtain different value for each cross-section in third order characteristics.

Conclusions

The method based on Volterra model using polyharmonic test signals for identification nonlinear dynamical systems is analyzed. To differentiate the responses of object for partial components we use the method based on composition of linear responses combination on test signals with different amplitudes.
New values of test signals amplitudes were defined and model were validated using the test object. Excellent accuracy level for received model is achieved as in liner model so in nonlinear ones. Given values are greatly raising the accuracy of identification compared to amplitudes and coefficients written in [12]. The accuracy of identification of nonlinear part of the test object growth almost 10 times and the standard deviation in best cases is no more than 5%.
Interpolation method of identification using the hardware methodology written in [13] is applied for constructing of informational Volterra model as an APC of the first and second order for UHF band radio channel.
Received results had confirmed significant nonlinearity of the test object characteristics that leads to distortions of signals in different type radio devices.
In the further researches the received frequency characteristics of the CC will be used to decrease level of nonlinear distortions in telecommunication systems taking into account its nonlinear characteristics.
