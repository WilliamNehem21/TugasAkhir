Adequate voltage stability margin needs to be obtained through the appropriate scheduling of the reactive power resources [1].
Asynchronous wind turbines have simple structure and easy interconnection, but need to absorb reactive power from system in running state, there is no excitation device and capability of voltage regulation[2]. Currently, the most common technology used is the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), which is able to provide reactive power support. A large variety of control strategies can be used in the operation of DFIG
The author in [3] has proposed a wind turbine control strategy in which the converters of grid side and rotor side are reserves of each other. In [4], a method to calculate the reactive power limit of system with DFIG considering grid-side converter reactive power limit is proposed, and the DFIG wind farm are used for reactive power compensation. [5] focused on including the reactive power capability of the DFIG turbines directly in the optimization formulation, and proposed a multiobjective reactive power planning strategy for WF and transmission system devices.
In this paper, we focus on the reactive power optimization of distributed system with distributed wind power, asynchronous wind turbines, adjustable compensating capacitor and DFIG technology is considered, and the reactive power capability of converter also taking into consideration.

Mathematic model of wind turbine generator

Mathematic model of Variable Speed Constant Frequency Wind Turbine Generator

The DFIG has two set of windings including rotor winding and stator winding. The stator winding is connected directly to the grid through grid-side converter, GSC. The DC side voltage is controlled by GSC, and the power factor is adjusted according to the demand of grid.
The value is set to positive when rotor and stator generating active power and inductive reactive power into grid. Then the power injected to the system by DFIG can be written as:

Pe  Ps  Pr
Qe  Qs  Qr
(1)
(2)

There are two main operating mode for DFIG: Constant power factor and constant voltage. Where Qr can be neglected, then we have Qe  Qs . When the stator side voltage of wind turbine is constant, its reactive power adjustment range is influenced by the thermal limit current of stator winding and rotor winding, and the
maximum current of converter. The maximum current of converter is the main impact factor. The rotor


current range is determined by the converter current range. Let the maximum converter current be I	, which

is usually 150% of the rated current[6], then we have:

Reactive power limit of GSC

The essence of GSC is a voltage type PWM rectifier, the AC side has the unique characteristics of a controlled current source, it can run in four quadrant. The GSC usually run in unit power factor condition, if
Pc and Qc are active power and reactive power of GSC input from system, then Qc  0 , capacity selection of
GSC only need to consider the maximum slip-active power of DFIG.
According to the wind power system with the maximum slip-active power to design power size of GSC, line loss and breaker loss are taking into consideration. If Pc max is the maximum active power of GSC, the reactive power of it emits or absorbs calculate as equation (5)-(6):

Where P is the active power output, V is output voltage, x  x1  x2 .

The reactive power optimization model of power distribution system with distributed wind turbines

Mathematical model

The objective of reactive power optimization model is to reduce the loss of system, reactive power optimization is defined as the minimization of reactive power losses by controlling a number of control variables:

24
min	Qloss
i 1
(8)



h(u, x)  0, k  1, 2,..., n
s.t.g(u, x)  0, k  1, 2,..., n

(9)

Where h is equality constraint, namely power flow equation, g is inequality constraints, including the branch power restriction, the node voltage constraints and upper and lower limits of control variables; u and x represent control variables and state variables respectively.

Power flow model of distribution power system based on depth search

The benefit of the power flow calculation methods based on depth search is that could ignore the specific network in radial topology, only need to know the base information of the node structure and the branch structure. In this paper, choose the voltage deviation as the termination condition of power flow calculation:

max( U j  U j1 )  ε
(10)

Where ε is constant, ε =10-5. Then compute injection current of non-end nodes piecewise according to the level attribute, more details in [7]. Nodal attributes including:

infi  {i, pi , qi , l, lmax , a}
(11)

Where i is node number,
pi is nodal active power, qi
is nodal reactive power, l is hierarchy number,

lmax
is the maximum hierarchy number, a is node type.

Solution procedure based on differential evolution algorithm

Classic differential evolution involves two stages: initialization and evolution. Initialization generates an
initial population P0 . Then P0 evolves to P1 , P1 evolves to P2 , … ,until the termination conditions are
fulfilled. While evolving from Pn to Pn1 , the three evolutionary operations, namely, differential mutation, crossover and selection are executed in sequence.

Termination conditions: when
Qloss less than the threshold, algorithm terminates. The whole solution

procedure is given in Fig.1. The threshold of reactive power loss employ the average reactive power loss of network without WT, and considering the termination condition can not be satisfied, set the maximum number of iterations to avoid endless loop, maximum number is 500.


Reactive Power Optimization and Verification With Distribution WT

Access form of distribution WT

In this paper, chose a distribution power system as test case, bus voltage is 1.05(p.u.), reference power is 100 MVA, reference voltage is 10 KV. The chosen network is radial topology including three lines contain
424 nodes, which the line 1 has 224 nodes, the line 2 has 119 nodes and the line 3 has 81 nodes.
There are 6 access points which all in frontier nodes, shown in Table 1. Because the WT output power fluctuate, given the wind speed random in the case, according to the wind power characteristic curve to ensure the WT output.
