Abstract

Permanent magnet (PM) machines have become prevalent in very high-speed applications due to its simple structure and high power density. Permanent magnets is the most mechanically vulnerable rotor part, and can not withstand the large centrifugal forces during high-speed rotation. Therefore, the magnet must be contained in a non-magnetic enclosure shrink-fitted onto the PM, which would limit stresses in the magnet and ensure the transfer of torque from the magnet to the shaft at elevated speeds. The strength analysis methods of enclosure for high-speed PM rotor by means of analytical method as well as finite element non-linear contact analysis are introduced. As an example, the strength analysis results for a high speed PM rotor at speed of 60000r/min are presented. The analysis results show that the theoretical calculation value meet the requirements of protecting the permanent magnet in high rotation speed.

their better efficiencies, power factors, and utilization factors in comparison to the other types of high-speed electrical machines. But, on the other hand, high-speed PM machines have a much more complex rotor construction in comparison to the other types of high-speed machines. High-speed PM machines have permanent magnets and a retaining enclosure on the rotor. Nowadays, the sintered neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) material is used in most of PM machines. This material exhibits poor mechanical characteristics: a low value of Young's module and brittleness, Therefore, it is necessary to use a nonmagnetic alloy enclosure to protect the PM. Many authors have studied properties of the enclosure and its influence on the magnetic field. Binder et al. [1] showed advantages of using surface-mounted magnets for high speed and also the validity of analytical mechanical modelling for the case of magnets without pole spacers. Larsonneur [2] observed the existence of an optimal interference fit between the magnet and the enclosure for maximum permissible speed. Zwyssig et al. [3] considered not only the enclosure's strength, but also the compatibility of its thermal properties with the permanent magnet.
The most important task of the rotor design is the reliable operation of the high-speed PM rotor. With the increase of rotor speed, the interference fit between the PM and enclosure will decrease. On the other hand, the interference fit between the PM and enclosure could be changed due to the different temperature expansibility of PM and enclosure. The contact pressure between the PM and enclosure must be large enough over the whole speed range in order to guarantee the PM withstanding compressive stress.
This paper aims to determine the fitting and mechanical stress of enclosure as well as permanent magnet in a high speed rotor, while also considering rotational speed and operating temperature. Starting with a presentation of analytical method of mechanical stress and fitting in the rotor based on thick walled theory, in the second step the interference fit between enclosure and PM for a high speed PM rotor at speed of 60000r/min is determined, in the last step a 2D finite element model based on the finite element non-linear contact is introduced to perform the strength analysis for the high speed PM rotor.

Theoretical Backgrounds

A high-speed PM rotor will be represented as a compound of three adjacent cylinders which correspond to the shaft, magnet and enclosure. The cross-section of the PM rotor is shown as Fig.1.
The enclosure shrink-fitted onto the PM can be classified as thick-walled cylinder with internal pressures, while the PM can be classified as thick-walled cylinder with external pressures. Considering the variation of speed and temperature, the interference fit between the enclosure and the PM can be determined by the thick- walled cylinder theory.

The interference fit and stress consideration temperature

Under the sistuation of the temperature increase, the magnitude of the integral sintered NdFeB expansion in the direction of parallel magnetizing is equal to shrinkage in the direction of vertical magnetizing, so the displacement of the PM due to the influence of temperature increase can be ignored.
Considering the influence of temperature, the displacement of the enclosure is determined as follows


u t (r)  r T	r
 r  r
(6)


Considering both the rotating and temperature conditions, the total interference fit between the PM and enclosure will be

Thus, the analytical expressions for radial and tangential stress in the PM rotor under operating mode are obtained. Influences of static pressure (fitting), centrifugal force (rotation) and temperature increase on the stress can be clearly distinguished in the expressions which can be expressed in the following way:

Determination of the interference fit between enclosure and PM


Fig.2 Flow chart for theoretical calculation of interference fit

The interference fit between the PM and enclosure has important effect on the reliable operation of the PM rotor. If the interference fit is very low, the enclosure will be loose and the PM will be destroyed because of the enormous tensile strength during the increase of speed and temperature. If the interference fit is very high, then the electromagnetism performance of the high-speed PM machine will be subjected to impact. Fig.2 gives the theoretical calculation process of interference fit.

Interference fit betwen enclosure and PM/mm
Fig.3 The interference fit versus stress between enclosure and PM considering temperature and speed
Fig. 3 shows the interference fit versus stress between enclosure and PM considering temperature and speed. The Von stress in enclosure increase with the increase of the interference fit, while the tangential stress in PM decrease. When the interference fit is more than 0.08mm, the Von stress in enclosure exceeds the permissible tensile strength. When the interference fit is less than 0.02mm, the radial stress in PM exceed the permissible tensile strength. While the interference fit is 0.05mm, the stresses in enclosure and PM are all meet demand and more reasonable.


Finite-Element Model

Finite element modelling was performed using ANSYS structural analysis, the FE model is shown as Fig.
The model used PLANE183 elements for 2D structural modelling while the contact area between the magnet and enclosure was modelled using CONTA172 and TARGE169.

(d) Tangential stress in PM; (e) Radial stress in PM; (f) Contact pressure Fig. 5 static stress and contact pressure in PM and enclosure


Fig. 5 shows the static stress and contact pressure in PM and enclosure. The tangential stress in enclosure is 218244 MPa, radial stress is -25.90.065 MPa, Von Mises stress is 194238 MPa which is below half the permissible tensile strength 500MPa. The tangential stress in PM is -144-118 MPa, radial stress is -26
-0.084 MPa, Von Mises stress is 106145 MPa, which is much less than the compressive strength limit 800MPa. The contact pressure between the enclosure and PM is 26MPa. Maximum equivalent stress in the enclosure is at the inner surface and the equivalent stress decrease with the increase of enclosure's thickness.

Fig. 6 shows the rotating stress and contact pressure in PM and enclosure. When the rotor rotate at the speed of 60000rpm, the rotating tangential stress in enclosure is 384438 MPa, rotating radial stress is -
25.40.12 MPa, rotating Von Mises stress is 342410 MPa which is still below half the permitted tensile strength 555MPa. The rotating tangential stress in PM is -13.8-1.17MPa, rotating radial stress is -25.5 0.009MPa, rotating Von Mises stress is 5.821.8 MPa, which is less than the compressive stress. The contact pressure between the enclosure and PM decrease to 25.6MPa. Under the action of centrifugal force, both the PM and the enclosure produce strain, the interference fit and stress at the contact surface decrease, thus the PM endure tensile stress partially, and the rotating Von Mises stress in enclosure increase.

Fig. 7 stress and contact pressure in PM and enclosure with 150  temperature and 60000rpm speed

When temperature heated up, due to the effect of thermal expansion and contraction, the interference fit between the enclosure and PM further decrease, the compressive stress in PM further decrease certainly. Figure 7 shows the stress and contact pressure in PM and enclosure with 150  temperature and 60000rpm speed ,the tangential stress in enclosure is 303347 MPa, radial stress is-160.024 MPa, Von Mises stress decrease to 431469 MPa which is still below the permitted tensile stress. The tangential stress in PM is
29.651.7MPa, radial stress is -160.01MPa. The contact pressure between the enclosure and PM decrease to 16MPa.

Results comparison

Results are given in Table 2 including three models that represent still rotor and the rotor rotating at the target speed of 60000 rpm at both room and maximum temperature. It can be seen that the FEM result is generally in good agreement with analytical result.
The radial compressive stress in the PM decrease with the increase of rotating speed and temperature, but the contact pressure between magnet and enclosure is maintained throughout the whole speed range. To the


enclosure, the state of rotating at 60000rpm and under room temperature is the critical stage, while to the PM, the state of rotating with maximum speed and with maximum temperature is the critical stage. Both the PM and the enclosure satisfy an intensity request at their critical stage.
