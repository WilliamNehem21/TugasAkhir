The agriculture sector is no exception to the widespread usage of deep learning tools and techniques. In this paper, an automated detection method on the basis of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models is proposed to identify and classify paddy crop biotic stresses from the field images. The proposed work also pro- vides the empirical comparison among the leading CNN models with transfer learning from the ImageNet weights namely, Inception-V3, VGG-16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121 and MobileNet-28. Brown spot, hispa, and leaf blast, three of the most common and destructive paddy crop biotic stresses that occur during the flowering and ripening growth stages are considered for the experimentation. The experimental results reveal that the ResNet-50 model achieves the highest average paddy crop stress classification accuracy of 92.61% outperforming the other considered CNN models. The study explores the feasibility of CNN models for the paddy crop stress identification as well as the applicability of automated methods to non-experts.

Introduction

India is a rice-growing country with a wide range of rice varieties adapted to wide spectrum of agro-climatic conditions. As a result, the crop has become a host for a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses, all of which have a negative impact on crop productivity and survival. Realizing the economic losses caused by them, efforts have been made to comprehend the importance of integrated and automated paddy crop management for the timely intervention and mitigation of the stresses. Furthermore, experts and politicians are also concerned about improving paddy production and yield. The agricultural experts identify the stress categories by the visual inspection of individual paddy plant leaf which is subjective and tedious in nature. The paddy

crop stresses have a complicated composition, and their presentation in different paddy crop varieties is very similar, making classification challenging. The goal of quickly identifying crop stress has various advantages for potential farmers and agriculture science researchers. Crop yields can be effectively increased by intervening early and miti- gating stress-related issues using suitable crop management strategies that take advantage of technology. This necessitates ongoing study in agriculture science and technological adoption.
In agriculture, emerging technologies such as Big Data, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things have been widely used to improve all parts of rice production processes, ushering in a new era of smart farming. Significant gains in agricultural tasks have been noticed as a result of innovations in AI-based deep convolutional neural networks. Plant disease recognition, crop/weed separation, fruit grading, and land stat classification are just a few examples of agricultural applica- tions where CNNs achieve human-level accuracy. Several improve- ments have been made in the architecture of CNN with the gradual increase in the number of layers to make CNN scalable to multiclass problems. The most popular CNN models are GoogLeNet, AlexNet, Inception-V3, VGG-16, DenseNet-128, and ResNet-50. One of the appli- cations under consideration in this work is the processing of images of

paddy plant leaves using the various leading transfer learning CNN models. Literature searches have been conducted in this regard to learn about recent deep learning applications in the core topic of the current research.
A pre-trained VGG-16 model is deployed for automatic recognition and categorization of diverse paddy crop biotic and abiotic stresses using field images. To illustrate the technological viability of applying the deep learning method, researchers have used 30,000 field images from five different paddy crop varieties with 12 different stress classifi- cations. An average classification accuracy of 92.89% is achieved (Anami et al., 2020b). An upgraded VGG-19 model which was pre-trained on ImageNet public image dataset is deployed for the classification of five categories of paddy crop stresses using leaf images. The augmented image dataset is used in the experimentation. An average accuracy of 92% is obtained (Chen et al., 2020). Different CNN models are employed for the identification and classification of plant diseases. The VGG-16, Inception-V4, ResNet, and DenseNet models have deployed to experi- ment on the PlantVillage image dataset which includes 38 different categories of diseased and healthy leaf images from 14 different plants. It is reported that DenseNet provides a better classification accuracy score of 99.75%, outperforming the other architectures (Yakkundimath et al., 2022). Four prominent CNN models are used to construct an auto- mated wheat disease diagnosis system. There are 50,000 labeled images of healthy and afflicted wheat crop leaves in the image dataset. The greatest average recognition accuracy of the VGG-16 model is 97.95% (Lu et al., 2017a). The LeNet-5 and AlexNet models are employed for paddy crop disease identification using an image dataset containing 500 images of stable and diseased rice leaves and stems. An average identification accuracy of 95.48% is achieved using the AlexNet model. The work has also showed that the stochastic pooling technique improves the CNN model's generalization ability and avoids over- fitting (Lu et al., 2017b). The field images are used to identify 12 categories of biotic and abiotic paddy crop stresses using conventional image classifiers such as Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k−NN). The maximum average classification accuracy achieved by the BPNN classi- fier was 89.12% (Anami et al., 2020a).
The usefulness of pre-trained deep learning CNN models for constructing non-destructive and cost-effective systems to automate the identification and classification of rice crop diseases can be seen with a literature review. Using traditional image processing techniques, significant attempts have been made to automatically identify and clas- sify paddy crop diseases from individual leaf images (Huang et al., 2015; Mohan et al., 2016; Mohanty et al., 2016; Orillo et al., 2014; Pugoy and Mariano, 2011; Phadikar et al., 2012; Phadikar et al., 2013; Sethy et al., 2020). The literature survey reveals the potential of pre-trained deep learning CNN models in the recognition and classification of paddy
crop diseases from the public image datasets (Hughes and Salathé, 2015; Saleem et al., 2020; Yakkundimath et al., 2022). This has stimulated interest in developing a sophisticated paddy crop stress rec- ognition system for use in developing crop management strategies.
There are four sections to the paper. The proposed methodology is presented in Section 2. The classification results of the considered CNN models are described in Section 3. The work's conclusion is presented in Section 4.

Proposed methodology

The overall methodology for the study is depicted in Fig. 1. The first step is to select an image dataset that depicts various biotic diseases on rice crop leaves. The next step is to label or annotate the training dataset. The learned CNN models' performance is then assessed on the testing image dataset. The hyper parameters are adjusted to improve the CNN models' performance. Finally, the different CNN models' classification performance is compared.

Image dataset

For dataset preparation, five popular paddy crop varieties, namely, Jaya, Abhilasha, Mugad Suganda, Mugad 101, and Mugad Siri are considered. The images were captured in the field under natural light condition near solar noon which is the period with the most consistent illumination using a Nikon D3300 Digital SLR camera having a resolu- tion of 60 megapixels. Some of the stressed paddy crop images are imported from PlantVillage image dataset. The PlantVillage is an openly and publicly available dataset that includes 54,306 images and 26 dis- eases affecting 14 different plants. The image dataset comprises a total of 3355 images, among which 523 images of Brown Spot symptom, 565 images of Hispa pests, and 779 images of Leaf Blast symptoms. The remaining 1488 images are from a healthy paddy crops. Fig. 2 shows some images of paddy crops that are affected by various stresses. The original image dataset comprising a total of 3355 paddy crop im- ages are enhanced to 26,840 using various classical image augmentation techniques such as translation, arbitrary rotations, shearing, scaling and flipping. The images collected from the dataset are of different sizes. The image size is reduced to 400 × 400 pixels for minimizing the computa- tional time required for further processing and their storage on the medium. The dataset is partitioned into three sub-datasets: 70% for training (18,788 images), 20% for validation (5368 images), and 10% for testing (2684 images). The details of the final image dataset used in the work are depicted in Table 1. The images collected from the dataset are of different sizes. The image size is reduced to 400 × 400 pixels for minimizing the computational time required for further
processing and their storage on the medium.

CNN classifiers

The present work has considered five high potential and commonly used transfer learning models namely, VGG-16, Inception-V3 (Szegedy et al. 2016), ResNet-50 (He et al. 2016), DenseNet-128 (Huang et al., 2017), and MobileNet-28 (Howard et al., 2017) which are pre-trained on ImageNet dataset (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2019). The description of transfer learning mechanism is available in literature (Yakkundimath et al., 2022). The descriptions of individual CNN models are available in literature (Too et al., 2019). There are around 1.2 million images and 1000 class categories in the ImageNet dataset. The steps
involved in training the considered CNN models on the prepared dataset are given in Algorithm 1.

Experimental results and discussion

The paddy crop biotic stress classification experiments are con- ducted using the Deep Learning Toolbox provided by MATLAB 2021b programming platform. The considered pre-trained CNN models are imported and prepared them for transfer learning by editing suitable layer properties using Deep Network Designer application. In all the models, the last learnable layer and output or classification layer are re- placed to match the classes in newly constructed paddy crop biotic stress image dataset. All the CNN model training and testing operations are performed on a single workstation running on Windows 10 operat- ing system, configured with Intel Core i7–11,700 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and NVIDIA GPU with 12 GB memory. To get control over model training, the significant training options such as initial learn rate, valida- tion frequency, number of epochs, and mini-batch size are initialized to 0.0001, 10, 30, and 32 respectively. All hidden layers are activated using the ‘ReLu’ function, while the output layer is activated with the ‘softmax’ function. The network is fine-tuned using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with a categorical cross-entropy logarithmic loss func- tion. Batch normalization is applied to improve overall accuracy and faster learning.
The customized CNN models are trained and validated using the augmented image dataset as depicted in Table 1. The individual CNN model training progress, validation accuracy, loss, and other details of
The performance comparison results of all the considered pre-trained CNN models are graphically shown in Fig. 9.

Conclusions

The effectiveness of contemporary transfer learning models such as Inception V3, VGGNet with 16 layers, ResNet with 50 layers, DenseNet with 121 layers and MobileNet with 28 layers in the classification of paddy crop biotic stresses on five paddy crop varieties is explored in the present work. Fine-tuning and evaluation of state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network models are utilized to determine the best model. In the classification of four categories of paddy crop stresses, including the healthy crop category, the RestNet-50 model outperformed all other models with the highest average classification accuracy of 92.61% by learning over 26,840 images. The ResNet-50 and DenseNet-128 models have nearly identical classification results. How- ever, when training and testing times are taken into account, the ResNet-50 model is effective. Since the work considers a larger number of CNN models for the task of image-based paddy crop biotic stresses classification, the results are promising. But, work needs to be carried out as future research is in improving the computational time. In the present work, there is a scope for adding new stress categories as well as enhancement of existing dataset with significant number of stressed paddy crop images. The work can be empowered with the sensor
