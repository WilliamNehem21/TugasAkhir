This paper proposed a Trust based Admission Control Model (TACM) for P2P network, and implemented a P2P social network system TrustP2PNet based on TACM. The TrustP2PNet is composed of application layer proxies with P2P structure. Additionally, a admission control model based on recommendations from trustable friend in social networks is proposed to prevent malicious peers fromthe TrustP2PNet. Both the simulation results and the practical application of TACM in the system TrustP2Pnet show that, with our model, it can not only effectively protect the system from malicious peers but alsopossessvery good scalability.

1. I troduction and Related Work

The Internet brings us great benefit[1][2][3] for work, studying, life and entertainment etc. Ideally speaking, you can get accessed to anyplace that is willing to provide information for you. However, for some reasons, such case is not always true[4][5][6]. We can tolerate that the website with bad content such as sex and violence are banned for the common good of society, but it may be a big pity that some websites with academic disputations are banned so not reachable only for political reason. Moreover, one path may be broken down resulting in some websites not available to certain people, but actually they can still visit the

webs after many attempts of trying other way only if the websites have other paths. In addition, sometimes though the websites are still available to us, we can always find a best way, i.e. with the highest speed to use.
In one word, we need a put up way which can make the accessibility of Internet more robust with better performance. P2P systemis answer we find. In a typical P2P system, there is not any center server, and only a register server generate identifications for the nodes who want to join the system, but not one is responsible for monitoring the behaviors single nodes. When strange nodes come to certain nodes and request for service, the requested nodes make their own opinions on response positively or negatively, according to their knowledge of the coming nodes.
The P2P work style bring huge advantages to the system. First of all, the Internet is more accessible for the users. Those banned websites to certain people for political or technical reasons may now be available to them. Only if the websites have links with nodes in the system, there is hope that they can be visited hence make useful information be shared by more people. Secondly, no central node which is responsible for the authentication or data transferring of all nodes exists in the system, hence avoid the bottleneck. The maintenance of central server always costs heavy economical and technical load and affects the performance of the system when large data in running. Thirdly, all the nodes in the system are of the same importance and function, hence have good robust for no of the broken down of single node can cause disasters to the system. Even no disaster happens, when more than one path exists, the nodes can find a better way to enjoy better performance.
As to the problem that how the nodes join the system, currently popular P2P software does not put up an effective way. A common way as BitTorrent adopts is to let all nodes join in the system only if they wish. They do not care whether a certain node is honest or malicious in the beginning. They put up sets of methods to evaluate and stimulate the behaviors of nodes   sometimes the stimulation is too weak to make sense, and
such mechanism shall cause delay between the coming of malicious nodes and the finding of them. There is no effective mechanism to make sure the good identification of nodes hence cause hidden insecure trouble to the system.
And on the other hand, for the nodes within the system, when they want to demand some service, they may not know the better choice. The ones with the highest evaluation in the system do not necessarily mean the best service provider for every node. They may even been not available to some of them.
In order to solve the two problems mentioned above, we put up the trust system based on social networks to work.

TrustP2PNet

Here, the TrustP2PNet which we proposed is proxy working in the application layer overlaid above the physical networks of Internet. It is consist up with the nodes and their available parts of the Internet. When a node wants to visit some place inaccessible for him, he pack the destination in the datagram and sent to the nodes who might reach the destination. When another node receives the datagram, he picks up the destination and transfers the data for the original node.
The TrustP2PNet works as a typical P2P system without the intervention of center server. Only a register server generate identifications for the nodes who want to join the system, but not one is responsible for monitoring the behaviors single nodes. When strange nodes come to certain nodes and request for service, the requested nodes make their own opinions on response positively or negatively, according to their knowledge of the coming nodes.
The TrustP2PNet and its P2P work style bring huge advantages to the system. First of all, the Internet is more accessible for the users. Those banned websites to certain people for political or technical reasons may now be available to them. Only if the websites have links with nodes in the system, there is hope that they can


be visited hence make useful information be shared by more people.

The maintenance of central server always costs heavy economical and technical load and affects the performance of the system when large data in running.

Even no disaster happens, when more than one path exists, the nodes can find a better way to enjoy better performance.
In order to solve the two problems mentioned above, we proposeda trust system based on social networks which run on the application layer.

Trust based Social Networks

The area of trust and reputation in P2P systems has been a hot subject.However, so far away they do not have favorable mechanisms. Most of their solutions are based on an accumulative credit system. They don not refuse any peers, honest or malicious, to join in the system, but confine their behaviors according to their score. This way necessarily causes delay between malicious nodes. Moreover, such mechanism often deploys a center server to record and update the credit score of the peers. It introduce more risk of attacks on the center server for the malicious peers want to rise their scores to gain more service. If the system is totally distributed, they may have to conquer many of the other peers to realize their aim, however now they only have to attack one server. Compared with the huge benefits they may gain, such energy is worth.
In order to overcome such disadvantages listed above, we proposed the trust system based on social networks. We suppose that people can always trust their friends who they know well, and can rely on their opinions of unknown people. Experientially people always believe in themselves better than others, but when they have no idea of something, the knowledge from their friends is better than just guessing out of all reason. The initial users of the system are always honest until malicious peers join in to generate the unfairness. And when people in system find malicious peers they are willing to inform their friends to erase them. Based on these common senses we proposed our model as follows.

Trust based Admission Control Model (TACM)

Before discuss the model, we define two basic concepts: Trust Value TV and Recommendation Value pqbetween node P and node QTVpq is theprobabilitythatreflects the degree of how node Ptrust node Q. thevalues of TVpqvary from 0 to 1. For the most trustable node (say M)of P and P itself, the Trust value can be equal to 1, i.e. TVpm = 1, and TVpq = 1; And for a node N which is stranger for P, the trust value is 0, i.e. TVpn = 0. The Recommendation Value RVpq reflects the trust degree that node P recommends node Q to other nodes. Here we restrict the Recommendation Valuebetween 0 and 1.For node P itself and nodes M with very high Trust Value TVpm, the Recommendation Value RVpmto 1, i.e. RVpm = 1. And for some node Mwith whom we do not familiar, the RecommendationValue RVpmwill be small. And for node Q whom we do not
recognize or do not trust, the RecommendationValue RVpmwill be 0, i.e. RVpm = 0.
Initially, all the nodes in the system are supposed to be honest. And at the beginning, only those who know each other directly can construct Trust relationship and recommend for each other. Here define some 0<TV∆<1 as the trust threshold. If TVpq ≥ TV∆, we say that node Q is trustable for node P, and if TVpq < TV∆, then node Q is not trustable to node P. Here the above assumption is just used to simplifystructure of our trust model. For any two nodes A and B that do not exist any direct connection, we set TVab = 0and RVab = 0.
The nodes with Recommendation to each other construct the initial system. When a new node N comes and tries to join the system, N has to find at least one node in the system already to trusts and recommends it,


we called it becomes the friend of the node in the system, otherwise it can only be anisolated node out of the system. And once it gainsthe trust of somenode, it can be regarded to join in the system successfully.
Then when a new node X comes to node P and ask for its permits to join in, P can make two choices:
ifP knows X well and regard it believable, then set:
TVpx = 1 
RVpx = 1 
ifP does not know X well, the trust value TVpx is calculated via recommendation: P ask for its friends forX’s credit:
TVpx = θ · TVpx +μ · Σi𝜖FP TVpi · RVix
P
Where, i stands for the set of all the friends for node P, and RVix is the Recommendation value that node i recommends x. TVpx is theinitialtrust value that node P trust node X. 0<θ < 1, 0<μ < 1, and θ + μ = 1.
If TVpx ≥ TV∆, it is said that node P trust node X, set RVix = 0.5, which means that node P knows node X indirectly and recommend it with reservation;
If TVpx < TV∆, it is said that node Pdoes not trust node X, and set RVix = 0.
θ(and μ = 1 — θ) is a control factortwo adjust the weight of trust value between itself and its friends. AndΣiചFP TVpi·RVix reflects multiple nodes’trust on to a single one: if some node is more trustableto node P,
ΣiചFP RVix
it will get more recommendationtrust which will increase itstotaltrust value.
Implementation of the Model TACM in TrustP2PNet

We apply the formula into the TrustP2PNet Project and design the TrustP2PNet system which is an application overlay of the physical networks. It is constructed by thenodes and their accessible parts of the Internet. every peer in the systemis a proxy which voluntarilyrelay the traffic of pass through it . Each node of TrustP2PNet is composed of 4subsystems: The Functional-Module, the Calculation-Engine,the Friends-List and the Evaluation-Engine. Where, theFunctional-Module is used fortransferring traffic, registering andother functions. Our policy model for admission control is implemented inthe calculation engine.When a new node comes, the calculate engine is responsible to calculate its trust value and reflect to the friend list to record, and when the node interact with some new node, as the functional module offers or demands the service, the evaluate engine estimate the Recommendation and record in order for further calculation for the calculate engine.

Parameters and Simulations

Obviously, whether a node can join the system depends on the parameterθ, which reflects the degree a node believe in itself or believe in the friends, and TV∆, which reflects a node adopts a strict policy on making friends or a loose one.
Consider a random system as below. There are twenty nodes initially, most of the honest nodes in red have constructed the system but left a few honest nodes in the out as well as some malicious nodes in green.
If the system does not offer knowledge about the new nodes and let single nodes to make judgments by themselves, they may choose to accept or refuse to add the new node randomly due to an absence of effective way to evaluate the new comer. The result is obvious that malicious nodes join in the system as easily as


honest ones. That’s a common way adopted by most of current P2P systems. It depends much on mechanisms in later phase to erase the malicious nodes.
And if nodes in the system adopt very strict policy on permitting new comer, namely they only add who they know directly to the system, in other words let θ equals to 1 and omit all friends’ recommendation, we can deduce another result: malicious nodes cannot be added in easily nor can the system expand easily.
And with our model, depending on different θand TV∆, considering the portion of new coming nodes and total nodes in the system as the result of the system development, we can gain a three-dimensional picture.
And other points of values of θ and TV∆ do not seem to have much affection on the curves, so we set:θ = 
0.8 and TV∆ = 0.8


Figure 1.we can see when the abscissa: ș is bigger than 0.8, hardly does the portion of new nodes to total nodes increase. It reflects the abovediscussion, if one over emphasize its own opinion and omit friends’ recommendations, the system is hard to expand. So ș in our model should be smaller than 0.8.


Figure 2.we can see when TV∆ is between 0.9 and 0.85 the proportion is always increasing and not stable. So we can set TV∆ smaller then
0.8 to gain a stable status.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a Trust based Admission Control Model TACM for P2P network, and implemented a P2P social network system TrustP2PNet based on TACM. The TrustP2PNet is composed of


application layer proxies with P2P structure. Additionally, an admission control model based on recommendations from trustable friend in social networks is proposed to prevent malicious peers fromthe TrustP2PNet. Both the simulation results and the practical application of TACM in the system TrustP2Pnet show that, with our model, it can not only effectively protect the system from malicious peers but alsopossessvery good scalability.
