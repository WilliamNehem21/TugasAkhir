Major sources of error in stochastic circuits are correlation errors, soft errors, and random fluctuation errors, which impact the circuit’s accuracy and reliability. The soft error has the effect of modifying the correlation status, which in turn modifies the probability of the output. This has serious implications for security and medical systems that require highly precise systems. To address this issue, we employ a fault-tolerant technique of correlation-sensitive stochastic logic circuits. To ensure reliable operation, we have developed a Remodelling Correlation (ReCo) framework for correlation-sensitive stochastic logic elements (SLEs). Using two intriguing case studies, we present two variants of ReCo model for combinational circuits with contradictory requirements. To achieve faster convergence to the desired Mean-Squared Error (MSE) value with less hardware area, the proposed method prioritizes the selection of logic elements and the placement of correction blocks. It is shown that the overall reliability of the circuit is unaffected by this method. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework, the contrast stretch operation on images of CEED2016, a standard contrast enhancement
output images using the proposed method is observed as 0.91 ± 0.02, which is significantly higher than the dataset, is investigated in a noisy setting. The average Multiscale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) of the original images with error, i.e., 0.75 ± 0.12.





Introduction

Computation on binary numbers using Stochastic computing [1] is gaining popularity nowadays because it offers several advantages [2] compared to conventional weighted-binary computation. It is a low power and low cost alternative to complex arithmetic functions. With a remarkable reduction in size, circuit complexity and power consump- tion, stochastic architecture has proved to be noise immune compared to the conventional implementation of binarization algorithms [3] and various other image processing tasks also [4]. Different types of errors, such as soft errors, correlation induced errors, and random fluctuation errors are identified that affect the accuracy and reliability of stochastic circuits [5]. Thus, to generate the desired function using unreliable components in the presence of errors has become a challenging task. Transient or soft errors are caused due to exposure to external radiation and are greatly increased by manufacturing defects in a chip. These introduce false logic at the output of the circuit [6]. If multiple faults occur at the nodes of a gate, the output may be erroneous. Soft errors are the cause of bit-flips in a stochastic bitstream and may lead to an undesirable correlation between two numbers.
There are several analytical approaches to assess the reliability of probabilistic circuits with unpredictable behaviours; Probabilistic
Gate Models (PGM), Probabilistic Transfer Matrices (𝑃 𝑇 𝑀 ), Stochastic
Computational Model (SCM), Monte Carlo Simulation [7] etc. Never- theless to mention that majority of works are aligned towards reliability assessment and analysis [8,9]. In [10], a multiple fault modelling methodology was proposed for efficient estimation of the circuit’s reli- ability. Gates that have the highest impact on circuit’s reliability were determined to design trade-off at early stages of circuit design. There are several approaches proposed in literature for modelling and analysis of transient faults in logic circuits [11], modelling and reduction [12], soft error analysis tool [13] for combinational logic circuits. In [14] a Bernoulli distribution based-model for reliability calculation was developed to decompose the evaluation objective of circuits, with single and double fault simulations. The proposed method is scalable with circuit size and is independent of the soft error rate. But the above works deal with the modelling and analysis of soft errors in weighted- binary logic circuits. Recently, Ting et al. [15] investigated the role of constant inputs in SC, and propose an algorithm to eliminate them by introducing sequential circuits. But they do not deal with handling the transient error scenarios in stochastic circuits. To our knowledge, no correction mechanism exists in the literature to generate reliable output under transient error scenarios for stochastic logic circuits.

The objective is to develop a technology-independent framework for observing error-free output in complex circuits with minimal hardware. A study is also conducted to demonstrate that the reliability of a circuit is unaffected by subtle changes in correlation status. The contributions are highlighted as follows:

A priority-based approach in the selection of SLEs is explored to reduce the hardware complexity and improve the accuracy in computation for complex circuits.

The rows in 𝐽 and 𝑀 correspond to input combinations 00, 01, 10, 11. Columns correspond to outputs 𝑦 = 0, 𝑦 = 1. 𝑃 𝑇 𝑀 for a large circuit can be calculated from the 𝑃 𝑇 𝑀 of the individual gates and the way

Probability transfer matrices
The 𝑃 𝑇 𝑀 , which is used in analysing probabilistic logic circuits [16] has proved to be a convenient tool in error [17] and reliability anal- ysis [18] of small stochastic circuits. The PTM is derived from Ideal
Transfer Matrix (𝐼 𝑇 𝑀 ) of a logic circuit. Each entry in 𝐼 𝑇 𝑀 𝐽 (𝑖, 𝑗)
of a logic circuit with 𝑖 = 𝑖0, 𝑖1, … , 𝑖𝑛−1 and 𝑗 = 𝑗0, 𝑗1, … , 𝑗𝑚−1 depicts the logic behaviour excited by a set of inputs. A 1 is observed in the matrix where a particular input combination generates a 1 in the truth
table. It can be observed as a conditional probability matrix so that,
𝐽 (𝑖, 𝑗) = 𝑝(𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 = 𝑗|𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 = 𝑖), where 𝑝 represents the conditional
𝐼𝑖𝑛 can also be written in terms of bit overlaps in the bitstreams
𝐼𝑖𝑛 = [𝑖0  𝑖1  𝑖2  𝑖3] = [𝑛00  𝑛01  𝑛10  𝑛11]
where, 𝑖0, 𝑖1, 𝑖2, 𝑖3 represents the input probabilities 𝑝𝑥 and 𝑝𝑦 being 00, 01, 10 and 11 respectively. Thus, it can represent correlation between input signals as well. When 𝑆𝐶𝐶(𝑋, 𝑌 ) = 1, maximum overlap of the bitstreams is guaranteed [17]. When 𝑝𝑥 > 𝑝𝑦, the overlap 01 never occurs, so 𝑛01 = 0. The probabilities of the other three overlaps 00, 10 and 11 are respectively given as (1 − 𝑝𝑥), (𝑝𝑦 − 𝑝𝑥) and 𝑝𝑦. We can
therefore express the input vector for two maximally correlated inputs as
𝐼+1 = [(1 − 𝑝𝑥)  0  (𝑝𝑥 − 𝑝𝑦)  𝑝𝑦] , 𝑝𝑥 > 𝑝𝑦	(2)

to be error free, elements are either 0 or 1, representing exact binary values instead of probabilities.
Similarly, for two negatively correlated inputs the 11 overlap never occurs if 𝑝𝑥 +𝑝𝑦 ≤ 1. Similarly, 00 overlap will never appear if 𝑝𝑥 +𝑝𝑦 ≥ 1.

In 𝑃 𝑇 𝑀 (𝑀 ) each entry contains a real value in the interval [0, 1]

For two uncorrelated numbers the input vector is written using Eq. (6)
where, 𝑝(𝑗 𝑖) is the (𝑖, 𝑗)𝑡ℎ entry of 𝑃 𝑇 𝑀 . Using Eq. (7), reliability of the circuit at 𝑆𝐶𝐶 = 0 is obtained as (1 − 𝑝𝑒). For AND gate, 𝑅𝑐𝑘𝑡 for

We are often concerned with the reliability of circuits under noisy conditions. The reliability of a circuit is defined as its ability to produce a correct output on a regular basis. For stochastic circuits, it can be
evaluated using the circuit’s 𝐼 𝑇 𝑀 (𝐽 ) and 𝑃 𝑇 𝑀 (𝑀 ). It can be shown
that the reliability of the circuit does not change with changes in correlation, but rather depends on the probabilistic error in the circuit.
Definition 1. The reliability of a circuit 𝑅𝑐𝑘𝑡 is invariant to change in correlation between inputs and depends on the probabilistic error rate
‘𝑝𝑒’.
Circuit reliability [18] is a measure of the similarity between its
𝐼 𝑇 𝑀 and 𝑃 𝑇 𝑀 and is written as:
Eq. (8) demonstrates that the circuit’s reliability is independent of the correlation between the input numbers. Thus, error minimization by varying correlation has no effect on the circuit’s reliability. This
property aids subsequent analysis of 𝑆𝐿𝐸 in producing the corrected
output in the presence of transient error.

Major error sources
Circuits are becoming more vulnerable to transient faults as feature sizes, operating voltages, and design margins continue to shrink. Cos- mic rays, capacitive coupling, electromagnetic interference, and power transients are some of the leading physical phenomena. Transient faults induced by radiation have gained a lot of attention in recent years because they are seen as a potential roadblock to further technological advancement. In stochastic computing another major challenge is the

correlation induced errors that are often associated with reordering of bits caused due to bit flips, which may or may not appear as a change

in the probability of a given number when a single level circuit is considered. But for multi-level circuits this can effectively change the overall value. In the next section we focus on two major error sources and study their effect on the behaviour on logic circuits.

Correlation errors

Correlation between two bitstreams has been identified as a ma- jor source of inaccuracy in certain stochastic circuits. Correlation in Stochastic computing indicates that the bitstreams generated by LSFR [19] or SNG [20] inherit some sort of dependence between them (cross-correlation) or between the bits of the same bitstream (auto-correlation). Earlier, correlation in stochastic circuits could only be vaguely identified as inaccurate output caused by a pair of bit- streams when passed through an AND gate. But, recently, correla- tion in stochastic computing has been quantified and identified with definiteness [20].
To quantify the correlation between input bitstreams 𝑋 and 𝑌 , 𝑆𝐶𝐶
(Stochastic Correlation Coefficient) which is analogous to the similarity coefficient [21] is represented as
	𝑛11 .𝑛00 −𝑛01 .𝑛10	
(𝑛11 +𝑛10 )(𝑛11 +𝑛01 )−𝑛.𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑛11 −𝑛00 ,0)
⎪⎩	,otherwise
where, 𝑛11, 𝑛10, 𝑛01 and 𝑛00 are the respective bit overlaps of 𝑋 and
𝑌 . Thus, the measure of correlation is influenced only by the overlap of similar and dissimilar bits in the bitstreams. Let, 𝑋 = 110011110100, and 𝑌 = 010011110100, then, 𝑆𝐶𝐶 = +1. But, if 𝑋 = 101100010101, 𝑌 = 111111000101, 𝑆𝐶𝐶 = 0.5. In this case, not every 1 in Y is influenced by the presence of 1 in that position in 𝑋. There is overlapping of 0′𝑠 in 𝑋 and 1′𝑠 in 𝑌 as well as 1′𝑠 in 𝑋 and 0′𝑠 in 𝑌 . Thus, the pair of bitstreams
is positively correlated to a certain degree. Correlation has also been found to have a positive effect on the circuit’s behaviour [22,23]. XOR gate acts as an absolute subtractor when inputs are positively correlated, as shown in Fig. 3. Implementing the same function using binary inputs increases hardware complexity [24].
But for boundary values of probability, either, 0 or 1, the measure

⎧  𝑝𝑋∧𝑌 −𝑝𝑋 ⋅𝑝𝑌  , 𝑝
𝑆𝐶𝐶(𝑋, 𝑌 ) = ⎨ 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑝𝑋 ,𝑝𝑌 )−𝑝𝑋 𝑝𝑌

to change the 𝑆𝐶𝐶 value with the help of any external circuit such as

11111111. Logic operations on these numbers tend to produce output that will stick to the boundary values itself, either 0 or 1 depending
on the SLE. Attempts to change the correlation status will result in a change in probability value, which is undesired. Using a correlator circuit such as [25] will not be able to alter the degree of correlation
between 𝑋 and 𝑌 because only grouping of one kind of bit-pair (here
01) will be possible and we lose the leverage of pairing other three bit pairs i.e., 00, 10, 11. For any degree of correlation, we can write the output 𝑝𝑧 as a linear combination of its functions at 𝑆𝐶𝐶 = 0 and
𝑆𝐶𝐶 = +1 or −1 [20] given as:
𝑝𝑧 = 𝑓 (𝑝𝑥, 𝑝𝑦) = (1 + 𝑆𝐶𝐶)𝐹0 − 𝑆𝐶𝐶.𝐹−1, ∀ 𝑆𝐶𝐶 < 0	(9)
𝑝𝑧 = 𝑓 (𝑝𝑥, 𝑝𝑦) = (1 − 𝑆𝐶𝐶)𝐹0 + 𝑆𝐶𝐶.𝐹+1, ∀ 𝑆𝐶𝐶 > 0	(10)
𝐹0, 𝐹−1, 𝐹 +1 are the functions realized by the logic at 𝑆𝐶𝐶 = 0, −1, +1 respectively. Consider an AND gate with inputs 𝑝𝑥 and 𝑝𝑦. For different correlation status between inputs, different functions are realized; 𝐹0 =
𝑝𝑥𝑝𝑦 (when inputs are uncorrelated), 𝐹+1  = 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑝𝑥, 𝑝𝑦) (positively
correlated) and 𝐹−1 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑝𝑥 + 𝑝𝑦 − 1, 0) (negatively correlated).
Similarly, functions realized by XOR gate when the inputs are
uncorrelated, positively correlated, can be found out as,
𝐹0 = 𝑝𝑥(1 − 𝑝𝑦) + 𝑝𝑦(1 − 𝑝𝑥) = 𝑝𝑥 + 𝑝𝑦 − 2𝑝𝑥𝑝𝑦	(11)
𝐹1 = |𝑝𝑥 − 𝑝𝑦|	(12)

Soft errors

As semiconductor technology advances with reduced feature size and increased scalability, it is becoming more prone to soft errors [6]. The sources of such soft errors have been traced to mainly alpha particles and high energy cosmic rays [26]. Although soft errors are not unique to stochastic circuits, its properties make it more tolerant to soft errors than weighted-binary logic circuits. Soft errors do not affect the circuit physically, but they introduce behavioural changes in the circuit in the form of bit flips by introducing false logic [27,28]. Transient or soft errors are caused due to exposure to external radiation and are greatly increased by manufacturing defects in a chip. These introduce false logic at the output of the circuit [6]. So, if multiple faults strike

(BRV) represented by their probability of success 𝑝𝑥 to perform similar Stochastic numbers are analysed as Bernoulli random variables
using Mean Square Error (MSE) written as 𝐸𝑧 = 𝐸[(𝑝𝑧𝑒 − 𝑝𝑧)2], where, operations as with other BRVs. Errors in BRVs are usually analysed
𝑝𝑧𝑒 and 𝑝𝑧 represent the estimated and exact value respectively. A lot
of applications involving stochastic circuits are carried out in a noisy
environment where the circuit is prone to bit-flip errors. For nano-scale devices, transient or soft errors are growing prominence as the device features are downscaled to sub-micron ranges. The observed output might exceed the error threshold due to the change in the expected value of signals and also due to unwanted correlation introduced during bit flips. For larger circuits, this may be a major concern for accuracy [29].
The presence of soft errors coupled with other inherent error sources may cause model instability in multiple responses. Thus, to achieve the desired level of accuracy irrespective of the environment is a dire
need in this scenario. Soft errors can change the status of correlation between bitstreams that may or may not change the probability value. If an equal number of 1s and 0s are flipped in a bitstream on account of transient faults, then the probability value remains unchanged. However, if the number of bit-changes is unequal that may have an effect on changing the overall probability value. Fig. 4 shows the effect

The responses of the correlation-sensitive logic elements like AND, OR and XOR gate with varying transient errors are captured in Fig. 1(a),(b) and (c). These are discussed in detail in the next section, where the motto is to reduce the effect of the transient faults on probabilistic circuits by harnessing some of the unique properties of each of these correlation sensitive circuits.

Handling errors in stochastic circuits using the proposed tech- nique

Minimizing errors is crucial since this distorts the output logic level of the circuit. We assume that transient faults at the gates introduced by external factors lead to change in the input as well as output probabilities thereby introducing uncertainty in correlation assumption of the circuit. It is observed that bit flips at different positions due to transient errors may lead to different correlation status between the same bitstreams. Undesired correlation can also lead to different stochastic functions being implemented by the same logic circuit, as shown in Fig. 4 and impedes the natural function to get implemented.

the accurate stochastic function and hence the output in this error scenario a correlation restoration scheme needs to be grabbed, that minimizes the effect of transient error in the circuit.

The proposed Remodelling Correlation (ReCo) framework

Our work suggests Remodelling Correlation (ReCo) technique to cater to the change in the probability assumption at the inputs owing to transient faults. We interpret techniques for correlation-sensitive ele-
ments to bring down the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 to a minimum level. While conducting
a study on correlation-sensitive SLEs we demonstrate that every design
error can be corrected by introducing correlation to a certain degree at the inputs. We deduce an operating point of the circuit in this
incorrect environment with a suitable injection of 𝑆𝐶𝐶 that reduces
𝑀𝑆𝐸 to a minimum value. 𝐴𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚1 searches for a unique solution of the induced correlation within the range [−1,1] to find a minimum
error for input parameters. We begin our analysis by considering single
𝑆𝐿𝐸s. The flowchart of the proposed framework is shown in Fig. 5.

Consider 𝑝𝑥 = 0.3 and 𝑝𝑦 = 0.6. The error free output is 𝑝𝑧 = 0.18. If
𝑝𝑒 = 0.125, the observed output, 𝑝𝑧𝑒 = 0.33. Using the proposed method,
𝑀𝑆𝐸 = (0.066𝑆𝐶𝐶 + 0.0388)2  which shows that 𝑀𝑆𝐸 can be reduced to zero for 𝑆𝐶𝐶 ≈ −0.58.
We will now discuss two distinct cases of fault correction in multi- input multi-level circuits.
𝑅𝑒𝐶𝑜 I: Error minimization for Multiple-input Single output (MISO) stochastic logic circuits

Let us consider correlation-sensitive blocks interconnected in a fash- ion as shown in Fig. 12. The quantification of SCC is only available for two signals in literature, so we consider two input gates in the circuit
model. The block diagram consists of 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑛 levels and each
level consists of multiple two input gates. Consider that one or more
an increased 𝑀𝑆𝐸 at the output. The 𝑀𝑆𝐸 is minimized by selecting gates at different levels are subject to transient faults which result in
suitable candidates for ReCo analysis using the proposed Algorithm 2 which is discussed below.

Assume that the correlation between input pairs for gates at level 1 as 𝑆𝐶𝐶11, 𝑆𝐶𝐶12, 𝑆𝐶𝐶13,.., 𝑆𝐶𝐶1𝑝, where 𝑝 is the number of 2-input gates at level 1. We can represent the output of each gate in level 1 in terms of 𝑆𝐶𝐶. Thus, 𝑝𝑧11 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝐶𝐶11), 𝑝𝑧12 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝐶𝐶12), 𝑝𝑧13 =

It is observed that the effect of transient error is reflected in an
of 𝑀𝑆𝐸 on 𝑆𝐶𝐶. Thus, a suitable technique can be investigated that overall change in the probability of SNs. This suggests the dependence
adapts to the change in the assumption of correlation and tries to minimize the observed error at the output by using ReCo method.
It relocates 𝑆𝐶𝐶 at several levels to counterbalance the change in
initial assumption of 𝑆𝐶𝐶 due to transient faults. We trace faults and identify faulty gates in the circuit and remodel 𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑠 by modifying input vectors of the primary inputs of the sub network in level 1.
In noisy operating conditions, errors in output are assumed to be primarily contributed by one or more faulty gates in the circuit. For a multilevel MISO circuit shown in Fig. 13, the number of SLEs that undergo ReCo correction primarily depends on the number of faulty gates and the probability of error. Thus, it is important to identify faulty paths in the circuit. We generalize the procedure for fault correction in
𝑀𝐼𝑆𝑂 circuits as follows:
Check if the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 of the circuit is within the tolerable limit
𝛿(<= 10−3) or not. If not,

SLE from the sorted priority list.
From the previous discussion, it can be inferred that the XOR

SLEs. So XOR gate line up the highest in the correlation-sensitivity
tions from the list L_MSE[]. Suppose, 𝑷 𝒓𝒊𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚𝑺𝒐𝒓𝒕() list consists of index. If a single gate does not suffice then we proceed for combina-
{𝑋𝑂𝑅, 𝐴𝑁𝐷1, 𝐴𝑁𝐷2} and 𝐴𝑁𝐷2 generates less 𝑀𝑆𝐸 compared to
𝐴𝑁𝐷1, then we combine 𝑋𝑂𝑅 and 𝐴𝑁𝐷2 to find minimum MSE. This
condition is often guided by the position of the gate(s) in the circuit.
The whole analysis is carried out to improve the accuracy and reduce the number of correlators in the circuit.
It is observed that the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 is proportional to the number of faulty
gates and the error rate 𝑝𝑒. For any error observed at the output, the
error can be due to transient error at the gate itself or due to the error
being propagated from the previous stage or the both. We consider different cases of fault propagation in Fig. 13 where the path P is indicated in red colour.

It is observed from Fig. 14(a),(b) that for a single faulty gate, 𝐺1/𝐺4 with 𝑝𝑒 ≤ 0.20, single gate ReCo analysis, 𝑆𝐶𝐶1 or 𝑆𝐶𝐶3 will suffice to minimize MSE. For multiple gates faulty, as for example, 𝐺1, 𝐺4 faulty with 𝑝𝑒 ≤ 0.125 same logic can comply. Thus, in both cases, the error

𝑀𝑆𝐸 can be minimized using single gate ReCo (𝑆𝐶𝐶3). But the same
with 𝑝𝑒 = 0.20 we invoke dual gate ReCo (𝑆𝐶𝐶3, 𝑆𝐶𝐶1) as shown in Fig. 18(d). When 𝐺4 and 𝐺6 are faulty with 𝑝𝑒 ≤ 0.25 we invoke dual ReCo (𝑆𝐶𝐶3, 𝑆𝐶𝐶1) as shown in Fig. 18(a)–(c). It is observed that there is a finite error of 0.01 when 𝐺1, 𝐺4, 𝐺6 are faulty at a rate of 0.25
even after dual ReCo analysis of prioritized SLEs. Table 1 is given to comprehend the nature of the analysis and the results obtained in the proposed work.
It is observed that the possibility of error reduction is motivated by several factors; the nature and number of faulty gates as well as the arrangement of gates in the circuit. As AND gate is the most susceptible to soft errors, an AND gate in place of the XOR gate would contribute to larger MSE. These factors coupled with the probability of error play a pivotal role in determining the circuits’ resilience towards soft errors.
There is also a slight dependence on input probability values i.e 𝑝𝑥
and 𝑝𝑦 as indicated in Fig. 7(a)–(c). The worst-case time complexity of Algorithm 2 is calculated as 𝑂(𝐺) + 𝑂(𝐹 ) + 𝑂{𝐼 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐼 )} + 𝑂(𝐼 + 𝐼 2), where, 𝐺 is the number of gates in the circuit and 𝐼 is the number of
input gates connected to these faulty gates.

deviate from this initial assumption. When non-faulty gates converge to a different output node, ReCo analysis of primary SLEs may give
undesired results. The condition can be best described with the help of a Multiple-input–Multiple-Output circuit shown in Fig. 15. The circuit
has two distinct outputs 𝑍1 and 𝑍2 with probabilities 𝑝𝑧1 and 𝑝𝑧2 .
Consider two faulty gates 𝐺2 and 𝐺4 that converge to 𝑝𝑧2 i.e., the output of gate 5 and the output is modified to 𝑝𝑧𝑒2 . We assume that there are no faulty gates in the path that converges to 𝑝𝑧1 . One way of suppressing
the propagation of faulty results to the non-faulty output node is to
perform ReCo analysis at the inputs of faulty gates only. This avoids analysis of primary SLEs that are explicitly connected to non-faulty outputs.
It is interesting to note that for 𝐺2, 𝐺4 faulty with an error rate
≤ 0.2, the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 at the output 𝑍2 can be reduced to 0 by doing ReCo
analysis at either of the faulty gates, 𝑆𝐶𝐶2 or 𝑆𝐶𝐶4, as shown in
of the precedence rule as shown in Fig. 16(b). For 𝑝𝑒 > 0.2, however, Fig. 16(a). We may perform ReCo at any faulty gate location, regardless
𝑀𝑆𝐸 can only be reduced to 0 using 𝐴𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚3. Modelling correlation between inputs of gate 𝐺4 (which is the priority in this case), can reduce 𝑀𝑆𝐸 to 0 with a soft error margin of 0.3. At 𝑝𝑒 = 0.325, we invoke dual 𝑅𝑒𝐶𝑜 (𝑆𝐶𝐶4, 𝑆𝐶𝐶2) to observe the error free behaviour as
shown in Fig. 18(e). ReCo is performed specifically at the faulty gate site to prevent the generation of erroneous output at a node that is
preceded by non-erroneous output nodes. The modelling of 𝑆𝐶𝐶s at the
primary gates 𝐺1 is avoided without affecting the output logic level at
𝑍1. This is contrary to the selection criteria in 𝐴𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚2. It attempts

Experimental results and discussion

We can now identify the key factors on which the whole analysis
well as the number (𝑙) of ReCo blocks, depend on several underlying is hinged upon. The magnitude and polarity of induced correlation, as
circuit. As transient error increases, the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 increases exponentially factors. The predominant factor is the amount of transient error in the (see graphs in Fig. 1(a)). With higher 𝑀𝑆𝐸 the value of 𝑙 tends to be larger. For 𝐺1, 𝐺4, 𝐺6 faulty at 𝑝𝑒 ≤ 0.125 error can be reduced to 0 using a single ReCo block (𝑆𝐶𝐶3). The 𝑝𝑒 ≥ 0.20 error, however, can be reduced to 0 with 𝑙 = 2 as shown in Table 1. This is because 𝑀𝑆𝐸

an XOR gate, 𝑀𝑆𝐸 can be reduced to 0, even if, 𝐺1, 𝐺4, 𝐺6 are faulty at 𝑝𝑒 = 0.25.
The observed 𝑀𝑆𝐸 is greatly dependent on the nature of faulty
gates. If AND gate 𝐺4 is replaced in the circuit with an XOR gate, the overall 𝑀𝑆𝐸 is reduced from 0.0375 to 0.02 when 𝐺1, 𝐺4, 𝐺6 are faulty at 𝑝𝑒 = 0.20. This is because XOR is least susceptible to transient
on the overall 𝑀𝑆𝐸. A faulty gate distant from the periphery of the errors. The location of faulty gates within the circuit has also an impact
for example, 𝐺1 faulty at an error rate 𝑝𝑒 = 0.2 gives 𝑀𝑆𝐸 as 0.0011, primary input and closer to the output contributes to a larger MSE. As whereas 𝐺6 faulty at the same error rate gives larger 𝑀𝑆𝐸 (0.0237).
This is because 𝐺6 is distant from the primary input side than 𝐺1. It
is also implicit from Fig. 1(c), (d) and Fig. 2(c), (d) that the initial
assumption of SCC also plays a significant role in determining the exact operating point of SCC for a given circuit. In the current experimental setup as in Fig. 15 the error rates up to 0.3 can be handled accurately and this is determined by the number of faulty gates in the circuit
(≤ 2) and location of faulty gates (closer to the input side) as shown
in Fig. 18(e). A block diagram illustrating the interdependence of these
parameters is shown in Fig. 17.
For complex circuits with multiple faulty gates, we have introduced a priority-based selection scheme of SLEs showing promising results.






/ig. 17. Factors influencing the polarity and the magnitude of the induced SCC.



In our investigation, the XOR gate is a prime component because of its high correlation sensitivity. Assuming a priority-based strategy, the bare minimum number of ReCo blocks needed to achieve a minimum
𝑀𝑆𝐸 is found as 𝑙 = 1. The only exception is 𝐺1, 𝐺4, 𝐺6 faulty at 𝑝𝑒 =
0.25, which requires two ReCo blocks to achieve minimum 𝑀𝑆𝐸. The graphs of Fig. 19 are obtained with 𝐺1, 𝐺4, 𝐺6 faulty at different error
rates. The deviation in output from the actual value (without error) using the proposed scheme is much less compared to the non-priority- based approach. It has been found that this method can deal with high error rates while using less hardware. Furthermore, the desired value can be achieved with fewer iterations when using a priority-based approach. The deviation graph with the priority-based (red) approach is obtained with one ReCo block whereas the deviation with non-priority based approach (gray) is obtained with two ReCo blocks to model the output. The blue line represents to the observed error (without ReCo). This demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed priority-based approach in terms of hardware design. The efficacy of the proposed method relies heavily on the presence of correlation sensitive logic blocks in the circuit. If there are no correlation sensitive logic blocks in the circuit the method fails drastically. Also, care needs must be taken while placing the ReCo blocks at specific targets without which errors could be propagated to non-erroneous output node.
As there is no standard benchmark stochastic circuit available in lit-
erature, we have implemented a complex matrix multiplication circuit using stochastic logic blocks under the assumption that the erroneous behaviour of the circuit is due to the cumulative error caused by the
12 constants and some of the gates being noisy due to the presence
of transient error. A comparison of 𝑀𝑆𝐸 using CEASE method in
the presence of only constant error [15] and the proposed method in
presence of both the constant error and transient error is shown in Table 4. Due to presence of both the errors in the circuit the original
𝑀𝑆𝐸 was bit higher in our case, but after correction using 𝑅𝑒𝐶𝑜
method the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 can be lowered significantly, which shows that the
proposed method can potentially combat the effect of the duo.
In Table 3 estimates the number of 𝑅𝑒𝐶𝑜 blocks needed to minimize the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 at a given error rate to indicate the efficiency of the proposed
The cells marked in grey show the variations in 𝑀𝑆𝐸 at a particular method in making a trade-off between error metrics and overheads. error rate. In cases, where it is not possible to achieve the lowest 𝑀𝑆𝐸
output. Increase in the number of 𝑅𝑒𝐶𝑜 blocks in the circuit increases using a single block, a second block is inserted to observe the error-free
hardware overhead, which can be minimized by using a priority-based approach. It is observed that even for very high degree of error rates
with multiple gates faulty, it is possible to bring down the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 within
a limit using only two 𝑅𝑒𝐶𝑜 blocks in the circuit.

Differ- ent evaluation metrics such as Multi Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) [32], Entropy [33], Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) [34] and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) [34] are calculated on the entire CEED2016 dataset to measure the similarity between the enhanced images and the ground truth image using our methods. The results are shown in Fig. 21. It is observed that all the metrics of the enhanced images using the contrast stretching technique are improved after the correction of errors. A priority-based strategy is utilized for this

methodology provides faithful results even in transient error scenarios. The entropy of the different images after image enhancement are shown in Fig. 21(b). The figure shows the entropy of the images (after correction) are close to the ground truth images compared to the images

Conclusion

Recent applications of stochastic computing involve noisy oper- ating conditions leading to incorrect results at times. The source of inaccuracy has been predominantly traced to transient errors. In this work, we have progressively varied the transient error probabilities
for single gates and observed their effect on the 𝑀𝑆𝐸 of these gates.
Attempts are made to formulate the process within a mathematical
framework. The study on the the effect of varying correlation on the
𝑀𝑆𝐸 was extended to realistic multi-level circuits where single or
have modified the framework to minimize the overall 𝑀𝑆𝐸. Algorithm multiple gates are subjected to transient errors. For such circuits, we 2 introduces a priority-based approach of choosing 𝑆𝐿𝐸 to reduce the
number of correlator circuits and to obtain the desired level of accuracy quickly under noisy operating conditions. Inevitably, there are conflicts in constraints in different applications, which are handled elegantly.
Algorithm 3 eliminates this issue for a MIMO circuit by introducing
correction blocks at fault specified nodes only. Both these algorithms have been observed to handle noise and yield accurate results, even at high transient error rates. In our future work, we will explore other variants of these algorithms to achieve even better accuracy using lesser number of ReCo blocks. Also, equivalent circuits can be developed with a given set of conditions to ease the task of error minimization at a lesser hardware cost.
