Introduction

Recently developments with short-term and lower cost are strongly required for shorten products life cycle. Therefore Taguchi-methods [1],[2] are used for deciding optimum process conditions. However these methods are not enough to develop a new product with short time, lower cost, high quality and high accuracy. In this research, the software for innovative tool using Taguchi-methods is developed and evaluated. There are two trials in the innovative tool using Taguchi-methods. First trial investigates rough fuctions regarding all

levers of all control factors, then important control factors and meaningless control factors were sorted with the several comments for the second trial. At that time, maximum, intermediate and minimum values for each lever of the each control factor should used for pursuit of all possibilities. Second trial decides the optimum combination of the control factors by more detail trial using only important control factors. The second trial is tried for getting the best combination using the optimum level of each control factor. The optimum condition regarding cooling system for cutting was investigated for evaluating this innovation tool in the experiment.

Explanation of Taguchi-methods

The Taguchi-methods is used to decide optimum processing conditions with narrow dispersion for robust design. Therefore the Taguchi-methods is explained in this section.
Control factors are equal to the design factors (See the control factors in Table 1). Noise factors are occurred for the error of function on the product (See the noise factors in Table1). Most designer can understand that the final functions of the developed product are strongly influenced for the each lever of each control factor under several noise factors. All combinations using all control factors are compressed by an orthogonal table (See the orthogonal array in Table 2).Then the experiment or the CAE analysis with influence of noise factors is performed by the orthogonal array. At last, the average and the standard deviation regarding all combinations using all control factors are calculated for the SN ratio and Sensitivity. Then most of users write the effective figure (Fig. 1) of the control factors and zealously search the combination of the control factors for large SN ratio. A product using the combination isn’t nearly influenced by noise factors.

Algorithm for innovative tool

Now, innovative development with short-term, low cost, labor saving and energy-saving is also required in the world. Therefore, in this research, the software for innovative tool using Taguchi-methods is developed and evaluated. At first, first trial investigates rough fuctions regarding all levers of all control factors, then important control factors and meaningless control factors were sorted with the several comments for the second trial. At that time, maximum, intermediate and minimum values for each lever of the each control factor should used for pursuit of all possibilities. Then second trial decides the optimum combination using the levels of the control factors by more detail trial using only important control factors. The second trial is tried for getting the best combination using the optimum level of each control factor.
The control factors consist of digital data and non digital data. When these data are inputted in the software of Taguchi-methods, the results of the effective figures for both SN ratio and Sensitivity can calculate such as Fig. 2. In case of Taguchi-methods, after several evaluations were performed by using the effective figures, the trial was completed. Therefore our original system starts from here; then Fig. 2 is rewritten to Fig. 3. At that time, horizontal axis is the levels of the each control, and vertical axis is used the average of function (desired property) or it standard deviation. In case of the digital data, a line graph is used such as Fig. 3(a), and in case of the non digital data, a line graph is used such as Fig. 3(b). Everyone can intuitively and visually feel the influences of the control factors by using the Fig. 3, can grasp for the physical image regarding the influences of the control factors. In case of the line graph, then the working of curb fit is performed by using exponential, linear, logarithmic, polynomial and radical approximations. In here, an operator can intutively understand the influences of the control factors. In case of a bar graph, Fig. 3(b) could not change to Fig. 4.

The optimum levels of the control factors for the second trial were decided by using the results of the first trial. The method for selection of the optimum levels of the control factors is shown in Fig. 4. In the explanation, it suppose that the larger function is desired by everyone. The curve of Fig. 4(a) has a mountain shape, there is the optimun lever of the control factor in the region of first trial. Therefore new level 2’ is decided to the top of the mountain, new level 1’ is middle between the old level 1 and the new level 2’ , and new level 3’ is middle between the new level 2’and the old level 2. Level 1’, lavel 2’ and level 3’ are the optimum levels for the second tiral. The curve of Fig. 4(b) has a shape of graph rising to the right, there is the optimun lever of the control factor in the right region of first trial. Therefore new level 3’ is decided to the practicable large value, new level 1’ and new level 2’ devide into three regions between the new level 3’and


the old level 3. The operator of the software can select standard deviation for vertical axis, at that time, the operator can estimate stability for the noise factors.

Experimental results for evaluation

At last, wet cutting using strong alkaline water with air of optimum quantity was used for evaluation of the innovative tool. Experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 5. Micro bubble is always supplied for high heat transfer coefficient in strong alkaline water. The strong alkaline water with micro bubble is dew from the vessel and is supplied to the blender for air. Air is also supplied to the blender for air by the compressor. Strong alkaline water and air are mixed in the blender for air and are supplied to the nozzle for outlet.
In the manufacturing field, everyone is desired high heat transfer coefficient. Therefore heat transfer coefficient is used for the function in the proposed innovative tool. The control and noise factors for first trial are shown in Table 3. Then, the optimum quantities of strong alkaline water and air were investigated for high cooling efficiency in the experiment with Table 3. At that time, the proposed innovative tool was used for plan of the second trial.

Results of the first trial are shown in Fig. 6. There are the results of the first trial (Blue line) and the results of the recommendation area (Light green area) of the levels for 2nd trial in Fig.6. Shapes of graphs in (b) and
(d) are mountain shape. Therefore middle region were selected for the second trial regarding (b) and (d). As
(a) and (c) were graphs rising to the left and right, therefore the more left region and the more right region were selected for the second trial regarding (a) and (c), respectively.
The control factors and the noise factors for the second trial are also shown in Table 3. After the experiment with Table 3, the experimental results of the second trial were calculated by the proposed innovative tool (Brown square). The results of the second trial are also shown in Fig. 6. Averages of heat transfer coefficient for the second trial were larger than those for the first trial. The proposed innovative tool could estimate the good region for the second trial. The optimum levels of the each control factor are decided by using Fig. 6 (Green arrow). The optimum condition are also shown in Table 3 (  ); Optimum length L mm of hose between the blender for air and the nozzle for outlet is 70 mm, optimum air pressure P is 0.2 MPa, optimum quantity of flow for strong alkaline water Q is 6.0 l/min and optimum distance D mm between the nozzle for outlet and the sensor is 200 mm. And heat transfer coefficient of the proposed cooling system with optimum condition was improved to 8490 W/m2K.
