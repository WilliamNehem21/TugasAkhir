Abstract
Many works have shown strong connections between learning and
regularization techniques for ill-posed inverse problems. A careful analysis shows
that a rigorous connection between learning and regularization for inverse prob-
lem is not straightforward. In this study, pattern recognition will be viewed as an
ill-posed inverse problem and applications of methods from the theory of inverse
problems to pattern recognition are studied. A new learning algorithm derived
from a well-known regularization model is generated and applied to the task
of reconstruction of an inhomogeneous object as pattern recognition. Particu-
larly, it is demonstrated that pattern recognition can be reformulated in terms
of inverse problems deﬁned by a Riesz-type kernel. This reformulation can be
employed to design a learning algorithm based on a numerical solution of a sys-
tem of linear equations. Finally, numerical experiments have been carried out
with synthetic experimental data considering a reasonable level of noise. Good
recoveries have been achieved with this methodology, and the results of these
simulations are compatible with the existing methods. The comparison results
show that the Regularization-based learning algorithm (RBA) obtains a promis-
ing performance on the majority of the test problems. In prospects, this method
can be used for the creation of automated systems for diagnostics, testing, and

1. Introduction
No patterns can be derived solely from empirical data (Yee and Haykin, 1993).
Some hypotheses about patterns have to be chosen and, from among patterns
satisfying these hypotheses, a pattern with a good ﬁt to the data must be
sought.
Neurocomputing brought a new terminology to data analysis: searching for
parameters of their input/output functions is called learning, and samples of data
training sets and a capability to satisfactorily process new data that have not been
used for learning is called generalization.
The capability of generalization depends upon the choice of a hypothesis set of
input/output functions, in which one searches for a pattern (a functional relation-
ship) that matches the empirical data. So a restriction of the hypothesis set to only
physically meaningful functions can improve generalization.
Inverse problems frequently arise in experimental situations when one is inter-
ested in the description of the internal structure of a system and is given indirect,
noisy data. Estimating the response of a system given a complete speciﬁcation of
the internal structure, on the other hand, is the forward problem.
The modeling problem arises when one is given noisy data, observed over irreg-
ular intervals of space and time, and is asked to develop a reasonable model to ﬁt
those observed data (Vapnik, 1998).
With the advent of high-speed computers and artiﬁcial intelligence techniques,
this modeling problem underwent a metamorphosis and emerged as a machine
learning problem (Bauer et al., 2007; Gdawiec and Domanska, 2011). Tikhonov
and Lanweber regularized that learning algorithms have recently received an
increasing interest due to both theoretical and computational motivations (Abru-
kov et al., 2006; Kurkova, 2012; Tiknonov and Arsenin, 1977). Fractal, optimiza-
tion, and a two-dimensional functional relational model have been used as a
feature in several pattern recognition methods (Chang et al., 2010; Lo Gerfo
et al., 2008; Noureddine, in press). Considerable attention is currently being de-
voted to new possibilities of using artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) in view of their
increasing importance for solving the problem of automated reconstruction of the
inner structure of an object. Accompanying algorithms that effectively quantify
uncertainties, deal with ill-posedness, and fully take the nonlinear model into
account are needed Therefore, it is necessary to both look for possible ways to
improve the classical learning algorithms already existent in the literature, and
to identify new methods which can compete with the traditional ones in speed,
robustness, and quality of results.

Inverse problems are often formulated by assuming that the underlying phe-
nomenon is a dynamic system characterized by mathematical equations, although
no such assumption is always essential. Often the goal is to build an algorithmic
model of the underlying phenomena. In some contexts a model is only a means
to an end. The ultimate goal in such cases is to test the validity of a hypothesis.
In these cases, the model is used as a classiﬁer (e.g., neural nets and decision trees),
and it matters little whether the model is parametric or non-parametric; the clas-
siﬁcation accuracy becomes more important. From this point of view the entire
ﬁeld of Machine Learning can be treated as an exercise in solving inverse problems
(Bauer et al., 2007; Prato et al., 2007). By their very nature, inverse problems are
difﬁcult to solve. Sometimes they are ill-posed. A well-posed mathematical prob-
lem must satisfy the following requirements: existence, uniqueness and stability.
The existence problem is really a non-issue in many realistic situations because
the physical reality must be a solution. However, due to noisy and/or insufﬁcient
measurement data, an accurate solution may not exist. More often, the major
difﬁculty is to ﬁnd a unique solution; this especially when solving a parameter
identiﬁcation problem. Different combinations of parameter values (including
boundaries and boundary conditions) may lead to similar observations. One
useful strategy to handle the non-uniqueness issue is to utilize a priori information
as additional constraints. These constraints generally involve the imposition of
requirements such as smoothness on the unknown solution or its derivatives, or
positivity, or maximum entropy or some other very general mathematical prop-
erty. A more aggressive approach would be the use of regularization. Given an
observed data set, genetic algorithms and genetic programming can be used to
search a hypothesis space.
In this paper, starting from a reformulation of the pattern recognition as an in-
verse problem, we introduce an alternative learning algorithm derived by a well-
known regularization method. We use a Riesz-type kernel to solve classiﬁcation
tasks by transforming the geometry of input space by embedding them into higher
dimensional, inner product spaces, and introducing a regularization method which
adds to the derived integral equation a new term, called stabilizer, which penalizes
undesired input/output functions. We split the problem into a simpler, ill-posed
problem (an integral equation with a Riesz-type kernel) and a well-posed problem.
In this way, we isolate and better control the propagation of errors due to the
ill-posedness (Noureddine, in press). Then we show that this reformulation can
be employed to design a learning algorithm based upon a numerical solution of
a system of linear equations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next Section describes our
model and justiﬁes its use. In Section 3, we formulate the proposed regularized
learning algorithm. Section IV presents main simulation results. We compare
our Regularization-based Algorithm (RBA) with the Support Vector Machine
(SVM) and Semanteme-based Support Vector Machine (SSVM) in Section 5.
Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary of the work in Section VI.

2. Generalization model as Regularization
Let us formulate the generalized problem as regularization in the following way:
Find a function r1 2 L1ðXÞ; X 2 Rn, given the function B(xk) = w(xk), xk 2 Ok,
Ok 2 Rn. Therefore, we have the following integral equation of the ﬁrst kind
Ar1ðxÞ ¼ BðxÞ;
x 2 Xk
ð2:1Þ
where Ar1(x) = �X
k(x, y)r1(y)dy and k(x, y) = (1/2p)2|x � y|�2 and A is consid-
ered as an operator from L1(O) into L1(Ok). This integral equation is the Fred-
holm integral equation of the ﬁrst kind with a Riesz-type kernel.
First we need to show that Eq. (2.1) represents a severely ill-posed problem.
Then we have to prove that a solution r1(a) to the Eq. (2.2) exists and is unique.
Theorem 1. Let us assume that O and Ok are nonintersecting domains in R3. Then
the integral Eq. (2.1) with the Riesz-type kernel represents an ill-posed problem.
Proof. We should notice that there are no singularities in the Riesz-type kernel
with the domains deﬁned above. We then claim that whether r1 2 L2(O) is contin-
uous or not, (Ar1)(x) is continuous in the usual sense. In fact,

jjx1 � yjr � jx2 � yjaj2:dy
Since the integrand ||x1 � y|r � |x2 � y|a| is uniformly continuous, we have if
|x1 � x2| < d,
jjx1 � yjr � jx2 � yjaj2 < e for 8 y 2 X:
Therefore,
jAr1ðx1Þ � Ar1ðx2Þj 6 kr1k2:e:jXj;
|X| stands for a certain measure of X for any given e > 0.
Now it is clear that if we take any B(x)eL2(Xk) which is continuous, then there
is no r1eL2(X) such that Ar1 = B. So the existence requirement of the well-
posedness is violated. Therefore the Eq. (2.1) is ill-posed.
For the integral Eq. (2.1), with a Riesz-type kernel and non-intersecting do-
mains X and Xk, there is uniqueness in L2(X) Prato and Zanni, 2008. Djatlov’s
work shows a logarithmic type of stability estimate (Kress, 1989).
We use the Tikhonov regularization method (Kress, 1989; Sever, 1999) to solve
the ill-posed problem in Eq. (2.1). In this method, instead of Eq. (2.1), we solve the
following regularized equation:
4
A. Sever
ðA�A þ aIÞr1ðxÞ ¼ A�BðxÞ
ð2:2Þ
where I is the identity operator, and a is a regularization parameter. Now we will
show the solution r1(a) and its convergence to the solution B when aﬁ0, provided
r1 exists and the uniqueness for the original Eq. (2.1). Now we need to prove the
existence of the solution r1(a) and its convergence to the solution f when aﬁ0,
provided r1 exists and is unique.
Theorem 2. A solution r1(a) to the Eq. (2.2) exists and is unique. Also Ray deﬁned
as r1(a) is a regularizer to the Eq. (2.1) on X = XM, provided that the equation
Ar1 = 0 has only zero solution.
Proof. First we assume that A is compact, so is A*A, but A*A is also self-adjoint.
Thus A*A has a complete eigenfunction system denoted by {ek} with the corre-
sponding eigenvalues {kk}.
Then, we have r1(a) = P
kr1k(a)ek, A*y = P
kBAkek using equation, we get
ðkk þ aÞr1kðaÞ ¼ BAk
which implies r1k(a) = BAk/(kk + a) is uniquely determined. Uniqueness can be
obtained without using the expression of the solution. In fact, since A*A is posi-
tive, we have
ððA�A þ aÞx; xÞ ¼ ðAx; AxÞ þ aðx; xÞ > 0 for 8 x–0:
Therefore it cannot happen that there is some r*
1 „ 0 such that
ðA�A þ aÞr�
1 ¼ 0
which means
kernelðA�A þ aIÞ ¼ f0g:
Now we show that r1(a) is actually a regularizer. To this end, we may assume now
Ar1 = B where r1eXM. Noticing that A*A + aI is also self-adjoint, we have
ððA�A þ aÞÞr1ðaÞ; ekÞ ¼ ðA�B; ekÞðA�Ar1; ekÞ
or
ðr1ðaÞ; ððA�A þ aÞekÞ ¼ ðr1; A�AekÞ
ððkk þ aÞðr1ðaÞ; ekÞ ¼ kkðr1; ekÞ
with r1(a) = P
kr1k(a)ek,r1 = P
krkek, therefore, we get
r1kðaÞ ¼ ðkk=kk þ aÞr1
and
r1kðaÞ � r1k ¼ ðkk=kk þ aÞr1k � r1k ¼ �ða=kk þ aÞr1k:

Here we assume that kk P kk+1 P . . .
For all e > 0 since x 2 L2, P

P
k|r1k|2 < e2/2.
Then, for the ﬁxed K, we may chose d such that

ðkk þ aÞ�2jr1kj2 < e2=2:
Consequently,
jjr1kðaÞ � r1kjj 6 e
It remains to prove that Ra, i.e., r1 is continuous. By observing that
r1kðaÞ � r1kða0Þ ¼ ðða0 � aÞkkÞ=ðkk þ aÞðkk þ a0Þr1k
And using a similar argument to what we had above, we get the continuity of r1k.
Spectral representation of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space gives the gen-
eral case. Assumption Ar1 = 0 if and only if r1 = 0 guarantees that the limit of
r1(a) is unique.
3. Regularized learning algorithm
In this section we formulate a regularized learning algorithm based upon the
Tikhonov regularization algorithm. For computational reasons, let O and Ok be
the domain in R2 and we will regard the integral operator
Ar1ðxÞ ¼

r1ðyÞ=jx � yj2dy
as deﬁned from L2(O) into L2(Ok). By using the deﬁnition of an adjoint operator in
L2, we have A*: L2(Ok) ﬁ L2(O) deﬁned by

where x 2 Ok, and y, y0 2 O. By discretizing Eq. (2.4), we have

From (2.3)–(2.6) we have the discretized matrix equation in the form of

for some regularization parameters, a > 0. Now the problem is reduced to solving
systems of linear equations.
4. Simulation results
In this section we want to investigate the effectiveness of the regularized learning
algorithm introduced in Section 3.
Let us denote ‘real object’ by rt, and ‘computed object’ by rc. To test the meth-
od numerically, it is necessary to generate ‘B(x)’ in the integral Eq. (2.1). We do
this by specifying r and evaluating the integral numerically. Once we have the
numerical values of B(x), we use these as our data and recover the pattern inside
the required region. The steps of test calculation are:
(1) specify rt,
(2) calculate the integral (2.1),
(3) use (2.7) to ﬁnd rc,
(4) compare rt with rc.
Our test calculation used
(i) smooth surface (Fig. 1)
(ii) rt = r0 + x1r1 + x2r2 (two objects)
where xi’s are characteristic functions of unknown objects, and r0 = ½ and
rI = 1 (Fig. 3). In the case of smooth surface (i), the numerical calculations have
shown that when rt is a smooth polynomial, the reconstruction is a very good
approximation of rc (Fig. 2).
Inverse problem approach to pattern recognition

In case (ii), we used two different regularization parameters for our reconstruc-
tion: simply, a = 10�7 and a = 10�10. We provided the cross sections of rt and rc.
The proposed model was able to distinguish the objects. We observed that the
computed rc was always smoothed. The location of the objects was well produced
by rc, and also the shape of the rc was a fair indication of the objects (Figs. 4 and 5
and Table 1).
Equation (2.7) involves main parameters that must be adjusted for greatest efﬁ-
ciency: the regularization parameter and the number of grid points. Looking at the
reconstructions, the numerical experiments described above have shown that the
reconstructed surface is smooth and close to the true surface. The reconstruction
was usually a fair representation of the shape of the r.
Summarizing, the simplicity and the reconstruction accuracy make the
proposed regularized learning model well suited for the considered application.

5. Results and discussion
In this section, misclassiﬁcation rate (Li and Wang, 2009) is used to evaluate the
efﬁciency of our algorithm. Misclassiﬁcation rate refers to the ratio of the number
of misclassiﬁed exemplars to the total number of exemplars in the dataset. The
ratio is computed using the Formulation (5.3). Correspondingly, the classiﬁcation
accuracy is determined by the Formulation (5.2).

where numberi refers to the number of misclassiﬁed exemplars in the positive and
negative classes, and n is the total number of X. A smaller cerror value indicates
higher classiﬁcation accuracy and better classiﬁcation efﬁciency. Conversely, a big-
ger cerror value indicates worse classiﬁcation efﬁciency.
Experiments are performed on the purely syntactic datasets from the UCI ma-
chine learning repository (UCI, 1998). We compare our Regularization-based
Algorithm (RBA) with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Semanteme-based
Support Vector Machine (SSVM) in the Table 2. In each test, all patterns with
missing attribute values are initially removed. Continuous Dataset (CDS), Discon-
tinuous Dataset I (DDS-I), and Discontinuous Dataset II (DDS-II) have their
ﬁxed real and computed pattern sets. The 9% outliers existing in DDS-II’s training
patterns are identiﬁed, and the dataset is classiﬁed as unbalanced. The continuous

A number of classiﬁcation algorithms depend on the similarity or dissimilarity of
exemplars, such as Euclidean distance and inner production, among others. How-
ever, majority of these algorithms only process continuous-attributed data, not
discontinuous data. Discontinuous data (surface in our examples) are extreme,
having disordered and unbalanced distribution.
For parameter selection and optimization, regularized learning algorithm faces
the problem of selecting parameter a. In many algorithms, the standardization of
the selection method for a is rarely performed (Han and Zhao, 2009). The heuristic
method or some optimization algorithm is used to select a. In this study, the
heuristic method is used in each experiment to standardize datasets. Table 1 shows
the relationship between classiﬁcation accuracy and the value a in the RBA
algorithm.
6. Concluding remarks and future work
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss several results obtained and issues related to the
proposed RBA learning and recognition technique. Some of these issues may be
viewed as merits while others as limitations leading to open research problems
for the future.
The implementation of the proposed algorithm shows that the method is
reasonably accurate for the reconstruction of two objects, using artiﬁcially gener-
ated data whose distributions are known. We have seen, both theoretically and
experimentally, that pattern classiﬁcation can be viewed as an ill-posed, inverse
problem to which a method of regularization may be applied. As shown in Table 2,
our proposed regularized learning algorithm has already shown promising perfor-
mance in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, such as Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), on benchmark datasets and real-life test problems.
The information obtained from a preliminary analysis is by no means
exhaustive of the method discussed here and suggests several areas of additional
investigation. We recognize the clear connection between regularization theory
for inverse problems, and pattern recognition as learning, and this allow us to

introduce a new learning algorithm. On one front, improvements have to be done
both on the algorithm (different regularizer properties must be investigated) and
the applications (non-homogeneous 3-D object recognition). More detailed work
is needed to improve the effectiveness of the numerics in general. In addition, the
answer to exactly how sensitive the method is to moderate amounts of noise is an
open question.
