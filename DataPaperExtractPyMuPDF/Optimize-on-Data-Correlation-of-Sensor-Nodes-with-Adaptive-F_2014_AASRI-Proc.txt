based on the spatial correlation algorithm, such as distributed Bayesian fault tolerant detection algorithm 
(BFTD) [2]. 
However, BFTD frequent communication between adjacent nodes, that leads the energy consume fast .A-
SMAC protocol based on data traffic dynamic adjustment to listen and sleep time. A-SMAC protocol does not 
contribute to the reliability of the underlying data judgment. Usually send out unreliable information, result in 
wrong decision to Fusion Center. 
In this paper, we present an adaptive fault tolerant algorithm (AFTA).Through the Threshold Area 
Decision Scheme [3], using the data correlation, realize the combination of underlying data fault-tolerant 
verdict and A-SMAC protocol. 
We adopt the simulation shown the values of slow changes in the monitor environments, the AFTA could 
improve the efficiency of valid data delivery and reduce the unnecessary data to send. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents Time Correlation Fault-tolerant 
algorithm. Adaptive listening dormancy discussed in Section 3. Section 4 described our simulation results. 
Section 5 concludes the paper. 
2. Fault-tolerant Based on Time Correlation 
2.1. System  model 
When a sensor readings is greater than certain threshold, assumes the sensor monitoring area by events; 
And when the sensor readings is smaller than certain threshold, it assumes no incident. Because of the sensor 
is not reliability, sensor readings may greater than a certain threshold method does not necessarily mean the 
monitoring area has occurred. 
We define the node  in ��time values is :  
����� � ����� � ��                                                                                                                                  (2-1) 
�����is environment characteristic value at t time.������is Detection of noise(including the effect on the 
stability of the environment noise and equipment). 
Assume that at any time of t,�����is Gaussian distribution���������We define that t is the system test 
cycle,�his the threshold. Each node periodically send binary decision, get test results:������� 
������� � ������������������������� � ��
������������������������� � ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������(2-2) 
������� � ��is at����  time test results of the node i  is “no event”. 
So we know ������� � � actually as result is “event”. Assume that node i at ��� time the actual 
circumstances of the environment in a binary variable ������� to expression: 
������� � � ������������������������ � ����
�������������������������� � �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������  (2-3) 
�������=0 is at time of ��� situation for the environment without incident.�������=1 is real situation for 
the incident. 
61
 Yun Liu and Hongzhi Zhou /  AASRI Procedia  6 ( 2014 )  59 – 65 
It has four possible situations: ������� � � � ������� � � (Sensor correctly report without 
events);������� � ��������� � � (Sensor correctly report events)�������� � ��������� � �(Sensor error 
report events); ������� � ��������� � �(sensor error report without events). 
We observe that sensor node have not reliability, ������� � ������� may occur, also is to detect errors. 
Missed detection probability�� and false alarm probability��� are: 
�� � ��������� � ��������� � ���� ��������� � ����������� � ����� � �
����������
�
���������������������(2-4) 
��� � ��������� � ��������� � ���� ��������� � ����������� � ����� � �
����������
�
�                 (2-5) 
Assumptions in ref.[4] the symmetry error probability:�� � �� But from (2-4) and (2-5) can be obtained, 
Missed detection probability ���and false alarm probability ��� are all based on environment value������� 
and Noise standard variance�� . 
We define the time correlation of fault tolerance algorithm, is used to improve the energy efficiency and 
precision. 
2.2. Time correlation data 
Under the condition of monitoring the environment change slowly, environment characteristic value����� 
in a short period of time considered change slowly. 
So we called value at the time of the redundant as time correlation data [5]. We define that node i 
characteristic value keeps the same situation at � � ��� � ����� ����. 
So in time t, (L + 1) consecutive redundant information can be used to test results of time error correction. 
Average values of node i within the time period C is: 
����� �
�
��� �

��� � ������� �� � � ���              (2-6) 
�� �is the average value of characteristic environment within the time period C.��� is aGaussian random 
variable, the value of variance is �� �� � ��
�
 
��������the average value without event, such as proposed in [6]. So��� is average value with event .the 
binary decision threshold is 0.5(��+��). 
For the actual situation of node  environment to make the following binary estimates�������� 
������� � ����������������������������������� � ��
���������������������������������� �� �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� (2-7) 
Detection error probability can be approximately expressed in the following Q function to: 
�� � ��������� � ��������� � ������������ � ��������� � �� � � �

������������               (2-8) 
The system miss probability��and false alarm probability��� are given by

If ������� � ������� 
and ������� � ������� that means corrected a mistake. Type (2-8) is shown that 
probability of miss and probability of false alarm decreases with the increase of L. 
2.3. Threshold Area Ruling Model 
Using environment characteristic value if there has been a marked change, the node redundancy testing 
information of fault tolerance, will introduce more mistakes. So we define the node decision threshold area 
concept (such as those described in [7]).Through the threshold region to estimate changed in the environment. 
Here we suppose the threshold area:��� � ��� ��� � ���, The parameter  is the standard variance of 
Environmental noise.���is the parameter. 
According to the same node in time of the adjacent value differences, defines the dynamic change of 
environment. If the same node twice values satisfy the following condition, define that obvious changes have 
taken place in monitor region. 
������ � ����� � �� � ��������������� � �� � ����
������ � ����� � �� � ��������������� � �� � ��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� (2-9) 
Otherwise, we assume the value of the testing region is not changing significantly. 
If the node i characteristic values for environment is ��then the probability density function of ������� is : 
����������� �
�
���� ��� ��
�������������
���
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������  (2-10) 
�������in the interval ��� � ��� �� � ���  Probability as follows: 
����� � ��� � ������� � ��� � ���� � �
������������
�������
�������
��������� � � � �������������������� (2-11) 
Similarly, if the environmental characteristic value of node i is ���Probability of ������� as follows: 
����������� �
�
���� ��� ��
�������������
���
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������  (2-12) 
�������in the interval ��� � ��� �� � ��� Probability as follows: 
����� � ��� � ������� � ��� � ���� � �
������������
�������
�������
��������� � � � ���������������������� (2-13) 
If the parameter  is enough big, can approximate thought that ��������distribute in the interval ��� �
��� �� � ���or��� � ��� �� � ���. For example, when a = 196,�� � �����=95%. 
When the node values in the interval��� � ��� �� � ���, test results is not clear. Thus, interval as a 
mixing zone, the aliasing region is defined as the threshold area. 
Parameter���shouldsatisfy the inequality:�� � �� � ����������� � �� � ��[8] 
�������������������������������� � ������� � ��� �

Expanding the single threshold for the threshold area, (2-9) formula to judge whether tested environment 
changed. In order to estimate the duration time of the node and adjust the average values (2-6), and finally 
63
 Yun Liu and Hongzhi Zhou /  AASRI Procedia  6 ( 2014 )  59 – 65 
make an estimate of the actual situation of the environment. The algorithm implementation step in the 
following ways: 
a) Using the detection threshold area, to determine whether a test environment change obviously. 
b) In case of obvious change, the binary decision, binary estimates�� and will be the verdict sent three 
times in a row. 
c) If it had no obvious change, determine the time correlation processing period T, to calculate the L 
average values at period T. reach the ��. 
d) For binary decision detection average values��. For binary estimate T, and then send the verdict. 
If this test environment does not change, using the data of time correlation, fault-tolerant processing of test 
data. If suddenly change, a binary decision sent three times in a row, is to improve the node number of sent 
packets. 
In MAC layer, A-SMAC protocol according to the node throughput dynamic adjustment to listen and sleep 
time. So it can transmit the information in a timely manner. 
3. Adaptive Listening Dormancy Scheme 
3.1. A-SMAC protocol principle  
A-SMAC protocol is based on the SMAC protocol improved, such as propose in [8,9]. A-SMAC protocol 
has adaptive listening scheme could according to the value of the node throughput to predict the change of 
network traffic. 
3.2. A-SMAC protocol working process 
A-SMAC protocol could base on the node throughput to measure the size of network traffic. Set the 
parameters used for statistical nodes in each cycle to send and receive packets number. We adopt the two 
threshold method (respectively set as S, M) can be divided n into three kinds of circumstances. 
And in these three cases,��������. The three kinds of duty ratio(��<��<��).Corresponding to the 
setting as follows: 
a) If � � �, at this stage the network load is small, adjust the duty ratio, the minimum duty cycle��� 
b) If � �� � � ��at this stage the network load is not big, adjust the duty ratio, the duty cycle��� 
c) If��� � �, at present stage network load is bigger, use duty cycle ��. 
Duty ratio adjusted, the length of the frame period is not change, just listen time to adjustment, new 
activity time should be as follows: 
���������� � �� � ������(i=1,2,3,)(3-1) 
The �� is adjusted the value of duty ratio, 
Increase the time of data packets, can transmit more data in the effective time. AFTA propose if the 
environment changed, send three consecutive decisions, so that we can make the node to transmit data traffic 
increase. Then, according to A-SMAC protocol make duty ratio increases, listen time increases, can make 
decision information sent out in time, reduce the decision delay data. 
4. Results of Simulation Analysis 
In order to compare the AFTA and Bayesian algorithm .We use theNS-2.35 emulator as experimental

platform [10]. 
We define the 90 nodes were randomly distributed in the area, between two nodes in turn form pairs of 
CBR stream transmission link. Adaptive incident detection algorithm adopts the method of sliding window-
restart. Determine the length L of the sliding window, binary decision threshold th, and a threshold area 
parameters. 
 
Fig. 4.1. Energy consumption rate 
 
Fig. 4.2. Error performance comparison 
Sliding window length L should according to the test to determine changes in the environment condition, 
general values between 3~5 more appropriate. Binary decision threshold �� � ������ � ��� The simulation 
results as shown in the figure below. 
We can see from the graph Fig. 4.1, the algorithm after joined the fault-tolerant judgment relative to A-
SMAC protocol, the node energy consumption is lower.

Fig.4.2 shows error reduction performance of AFTA. We can seen from the diagram when data acquisition 
number L take more than three times, the AFTA is superior to using spatial correlation of (adjacent nodes N = 
4)Bayesian fault tolerance detection algorithm at error reduction. 
5. Conclusions 
Energy consumption and event monitoring has been one of the important indices for wireless sensor 
network performance .In this paper, AFTA is proposed. This approach  require data time correlation to fault 
tolerance through Threshold area. The proposed approach also determines the combination of algorithm and 
A - SMAC protocol. 
The simulation results demonstrate that this approach can significantly reduce the unnecessary data to send 
and lead energy consumption is lower than A-SMAC protocol. It is also shown that the AFTA improve the 
ruling data transmission efficiency effectively, makes the system has a higher real-time performance and 
reliability is better. As a future extension, AFTA approach can be developed that can be used for even larger 
networks.
