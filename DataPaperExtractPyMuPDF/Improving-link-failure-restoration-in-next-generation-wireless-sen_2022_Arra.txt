Next-generation wireless sensor networks (xWSN) have applications in many emerging wireless technologies,
such as fifth-generation, internet-of-things, device-to-device communications, e-health, e-agriculture, etc. For
most of these xWSN applications, network reliability and robustness against failures are crucial considerations.
In this paper, an appropriate network restoration model is developed to help achieve network protection and/or
restoration for xWSN in the event of link failures. In the model, effective network restoration is achieved by
investigating efficient pre-configured-cycle (p-cycle)-based restoration solutions for the xWSN. Furthermore, to
achieve significant improvement in the capacity efficiency of the p-cycle solutions realised, the concepts of p-
cycle selectivity, load redistribution and the use of single p-cycles for double failure restoration are investigated
and incorporated in the network restoration design. The restoration model developed, alongside the various
improvement concepts incorporated, is shown to achieve better performance in terms of average path length
and total capacity cost when compared with similar restoration models for modern wireless communication
applications.
1. Introduction
Emerging next-generation (xG) wireless communication technolo-
gies such as fifth-generation (5G) and beyond, internet-of-things (IoT),
cognitive radio networks, etc. promise fast speed, high capacity, low
latency and impressive reliability, among others [1,2]. Wireless sensor
networks (WSN), despite no longer being a new technology, are also
developing modern models and prototypes that are being designed and
deployed to help achieve the promises and expectations of xG wireless
communication. The new WSN designs for modern applications are
referred to as next-generation wireless sensor networks (xWSN) [3].
Alongside other xG technologies, these modern xWSN models and pro-
totypes do have practical applications in smart cities, device-to-device
(D2D) communications (such as machine-to-machine and vehicle-to-
vehicle communications), e-health, e-agriculture, e-transportation, e-
education, and several other modern sensor-dependent xG wireless
communication applications.
As the xWSN evolve, one main challenge with their development
is the possibility of network failures, especially when they are to
be employed or deployed for highly sensitive xG communications. In
reality, even in very robust modern network designs, it is quite difficult
to completely eliminate the possibility of the occurrence of network
failures in communication networks. Therefore, for xWSN, although
there are significant improvements over conventional WSN, failures

may still occur. A network failure in the xWSN may be a result of
the limitations in size, quality, durability, storage capacity, processing
capability or lifetime of the sensor nodes (SNs) being deployed for
network operations [4]. Network failures in the xWSN may also be
caused by complexities in the network operations or difficulty in the
terrain or location of deployment and usage of the SNs [5], or by some
other foreseen or unforeseen factors [6].
The negative impact of network failures on the performance of
xWSN has been alluded to in [7]. Importantly, network failures in
xWSN, if uncontrolled, can frustrate the realisation of the promise
of high reliability in the xG network applications for which they
are deployed. Therefore, to help mitigate the effects of network fail-
ures in xWSN, appropriate network restoration models must be in-
corporated in the network design. Such network restoration models
would effectively anticipate the occurrence of failures and provide
timeous backup and/or recovery plans for the network in which they
are incorporated. Developing network restoration models for xG com-
munication applications is an important area of research in modern
telecommunications.
In this paper, we present an appropriate network restoration model
that can provide the necessary protection and/or restoration for the
xWSN in the event of network failures (link failures, particularly). We

then investigate and analyse some important concepts to achieve signif-
icant improvement in the restoration solutions of the network restora-
tion model being employed for xWSN applications. The important
contributions in this paper are summarised as follows:
• We advance an appropriate network restoration model that is
most applicable for restoring and protecting xWSN against link
failures.
• We present practical concepts to achieve significant improve-
ment in the solutions of the network restoration model that is
developed and advanced for xWSN applications.
• We analyse optimal restoration solutions for the restoration model
developed for xWSN and present comparative results for the var-
ious improvement concepts incorporated in the network restora-
tion model.
The remaining parts of this paper are organised as follows: Section 2
gives a brief review of related literature on network restoration in
xWSN, Section 3 presents the system model for network restoration
against link failure in xWSN applications, Section 4 provides an analysis
of the various concepts for improving the restoration solutions of the
network restoration model for xWSN, Section 5 presents some impor-
tant results from the improved solution model for network restoration
in the xWSN, and Section 6 gives concluding remarks.
2. Review of related literature
Even though it is still an evolving technology, there are already
a few researchers who have studied xWSN and discussed some rel-
evant use of the technology in modern applications. An example of
the application of xWSN in modern technologies is in cognitive radio
sensor networks, as recently studied in [8]. Moreover, some works have
investigated and developed network restoration solutions for xWSN and
other emerging xG wireless networks. A good review of the application
of network restoration for xG networks was carried out in [9]. The
work explored network failure and restoration for xG networks, and
gave specific examples of network restoration models and applications
in 5G, IoT, xWSN, etc.
In [10], the authors developed the xWSN to be deployed for en-
vironmental monitoring, such as in border control or during forest
fire emergencies. The SNs in the xWSN design were empowered to
be able to remotely reprogramme their software. The SNs could also
reconfigure their hardware, making it possible to remotely modify
their design, long after it has been deployed. In the design, each SN
was equipped with a particular unique and adaptable feature that
the SNs use to adjust to their immediate environment, even after the
deployment process has been completed.
The authors in [11] developed a new adaptive sleep-efficient hybrid
medium access control protocol for the xWSN. The protocol was argued
to achieve improved energy efficiency by allowing nodes to adjust their
sleep time in a dynamic manner, mainly dependent on the amount of
traffic load that is available in that time. In the model, whenever there
was an increase in the traffic load of the network, the sleep time of
the nodes was shortened to reduce the amount of energy that goes to
waste as a result of their switching operations. Conversely, whenever
the network’s traffic load was low, the sleep time of the nodes was
increased to save energy that would have gone to waste because of idle
listening. As the network shared scheduling information and utilised
system resources in an efficient manner, it was shown that the medium
access protocol developed did help in reducing control overheads in the
xWSN.
The models developed and studied in [12] are important examples
of the development and analysis of network restoration models for
xWSN. The network restoration models developed in [12] leveraged
the peculiarities of WSN, as well as the promising prospects of xG
communications, in achieving network restoration solutions that op-
timised resource usage, while also providing sufficient protection for
the network. In the work, the pre-configured or pre-planned cycle
(also called p-cycle) restoration scheme was employed to develop the
network restoration models that were used to achieve timeous recovery
of the xWSN from network failures.
Apart from the work in [12], more recent works on network failure
and restoration for xG networks such as xWSN are now employing
p-cycles to carry out restoration and recovery of their networks, and
to protect them from network failures. Indeed, p-cycle restoration
schemes have been shown to have some significant advantages over
most other network restoration schemes. The first advantage of p-cycles
over other schemes is that p-cycles achieve network recovery from
network failures at speeds that are near to the achievable speed of ring-
based restoration, while still attaining restoration capacities that are
close to the achievable capacity of mesh-based restoration [13]. The
next advantage is that p-cycles achieve good recovery and protection
of communication networks against both link and node failures [14].
Another benefit is that p-cycles usually carry out network restoration
using only the spare capacities of the links in the network, making
the network highly capacity-efficient [9]. A final advantage is that
network restoration through p-cycles is quite effective in protecting
both spanning (or on-cycle) and straddling links in a network [12].
These important advantages make p-cycle restoration particularly ideal
for xWSN and most other emerging xG networks.
In this paper, the p-cycle-based restoration scheme is further ex-
plored and advanced to achieve better protection and restoration for
the xWSN, especially against link failures. Specifically, we first establish
an appropriate and efficient p-cycle-based restoration model for xWSN.
Thereafter, three different schemes – p-cycle selectivity, load redistri-
bution and the use of a single p-cycle for double failure restoration
– are employed in achieving significant improvement in the network
restoration solutions for the xWSN. The improvement in the restoration
solutions realised is significant in that it helps in providing efficient
and sufficient protection against link failures for most practical xG
applications, especially the xWSN.
3. System model
A simple, generic system model for xWSN is presented in Fig. 1. The
xWSN consist of a large number of SNs dispersed within a geographical
area. At any given time, some of the SNs are active, while others are
inactive. The active SNs drive the sensing activities for the xWSN. The
inactive SNs are inactive because they are either dead nodes or because
they have been made inactive (that is, they have been temporarily
put out of service in order to conserve network resources). The SNs
are connected via the connecting links. The links are either wired
links or wireless links. The network could be designed as either a
distributed network or a centralised network. The generalised system
model in Fig. 1 can be adapted to study most emerging xG commu-
nication networks. In this paper, the xWSN model is adapted for D2D
communications.
3.1. Network architecture
In this subsection, we present a realistic consideration of the archi-
tectural description of the xWSN being set up for D2D communications.
In practical xWSN to be employed for D2D communications, the net-
work devices are the SNs in the network. Communication between the
SNs can either be single-hop or multi-hop. Single-hop communication
means that communication is simply from one SN to another neigh-
bouring SN. Multi-hop communication implies that communication is
from one (source) SN to another likely non-neighbour (destination)
SN, via other SNs that act as relays between the source SN and the
destination SN. For the D2D communications network under consider-
ation, the SNs in close proximity communicate with one another using
a direct link, therefore their radio signals do not travel through a base
station or a core network. Furthermore, each SN has at least one sensing

device through which it gathers information and communicates with
other neighbouring SN(s). Then, each SN is allowed to carry out its
transmission on more than one channel in and around the sufficiently
wide area of communication.
Similar to most other xG technologies, in D2D communications, it
is common to find heterogeneous traffic load demands and fluctuating
wireless link conditions. Despite this, the xWSN for D2D communica-
tions under consideration should be capable of providing autonomous
network services under such different conditions to various kinds of
users, and for different kinds of user demands. The xWSN for D2D
communications are able to achieve all these expectations by simply
setting up the network using the distributed architecture. With this ar-
chitecture, data transmission via the SNs is carried out in a distributed
manner. The distributed network architecture for D2D communica-
tions offers some important advantages over other types of architec-
ture, especially the centralised network topology. The most signifi-
cant advantages of the distributed architecture are cost-effectiveness,
ease of network recovery from failure and better scalability of the
network [15].
3.2. Network model
In the xWSN for D2D communications being investigated, the set
of nodes in the network (which are the SNs within the coverage area)
is represented by 𝑁, and the set of all connecting links is represented
by 𝐿. The link 𝑖𝑗 is the connection between the two SNs 𝑖 and 𝑗. 𝑤𝑖𝑗
represents the working capacity on link 𝑖𝑗, 𝑠𝑖𝑗 represents the spare
capacity on link 𝑖𝑗 and 𝑡𝑖𝑗 represents the total capacity on link 𝑖𝑗,
(∀𝑖𝑗 ∈ 𝐿). We assume that the network’s time frames are very short.
Therefore, the network conditions do not change within each time
frame but may only change from one time frame to another. Thus, the
capacities do not change with time in each time frame.
In the network set up, the set of source nodes 𝑁𝑠 and destination
nodes 𝑁𝑑 (𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑑 ∈ 𝑁) make up the end-nodes. The working paths
(WPs) refer to original paths of communication between the source
𝑠 and the destination 𝑑. The restoration paths (RPs) are the paths
designed to help protect or restore traffic from 𝑠 to 𝑑 in case of a failure
along its WPs. The total traffic flow 𝑓𝑖𝑗 on the link 𝑖𝑗 is the addition of
all the traffic flows between 𝑠 and 𝑑 that have passed through link 𝑖𝑗.
Usually, 𝑓𝑖𝑗 ≤ 𝑡𝑖𝑗.
As discussed earlier, the p-cycle-based restoration has some pe-
culiar advantages over other types of restoration that makes it an
ideal restoration model for xWSN applications. As a result, the p-cycle
restoration model is employed in this paper for achieving network
protection and recovery in the xWSN being employed for D2D com-
munications. The fundamental description of the network model for
network restoration using p-cycles in xWSN has been established in
the authors’ previous work in [12], therefore, it is not necessary to
repeat it in this paper. Rather, we focus our attention on improving the
restoration solutions that can be realised by using p-cycle restoration
for xWSN. A simple pictorial representation of p-cycles being employed
for link failure restoration in xWSN is shown in Fig. 2.
4. Improving p-cycle-based network restoration solutions
We have established that p-cycle restoration has peculiar advan-
tages over other schemes that make it an ideal restoration scheme
for D2D communications, particularly xWSN. Furthermore, xWSN and
most other D2D communication designs support both single-hop and
multi-hop communication possibilities, making p-cycle restoration even
more suitable for them. However, in designing p-cycle-based network
restoration models to protect the xWSN for D2D communications
against link failures, the candidate p-cycles must be such that they
do not require too many hops, otherwise the protection or restoration
provided may be suboptimal and inadequate for the network [12].
Therefore, to achieve optimal or near-optimal restoration of the
network against link failures, the p-cycle-based restoration models to
be used for D2D communications must be well designed such that the
number of hops in the RPs of the p-cycles is always at the barest
minimum. Moreover, apart from using a minimum number of hops,
there are other very useful ideas that, when incorporated into the p-
cycle restoration model, can help improve the overall performance of

the restoration model. In this section, we investigate some of the most
useful concepts that can help improve the network restoration solutions
of p-cycles in order to meet the specifications and demands of emerging
xG networks, particularly xWSN.
4.1. p-cycle selectivity
The first concept that we advance for improving the network
restoration solutions of the p-cycles being used for protecting and
restoring xWSN is the concept of p-cycle selectivity. To ensure that the
number of hops in the RPs of the p-cycles is always at a minimum, it is
possible to select one or more candidate p-cycles from all the available
p-cycles in the network that achieve a desired hop count requirement,
especially when the number of potential p-cycles is quite high. The
idea of selecting a candidate p-cycle(s) from among all the p-cycles
that are available for achieving network restoration against link failures
was first developed in [16]. More recently, the concept was explored
in [12] for achieving network restoration in xG communications. In this
subsection, the important concept of p-cycle selectivity is employed for
achieving improved link failure restoration in xWSN. One important
benefit of employing the selection-based p-cycle restoration solution
explored in this subsection is that it is possible to achieve complete
protection and recovery of the network against failures at minimal costs
for the xWSN in consideration.
To carry out the p-cycle selectivity, an appropriate cost is assigned
to each p-cycle being considered for possible selection. This cost is
determined by summing the costs of all the links that make up the p-
cycle. For the selection process, the set of p-cycles selected comprises
the p-cycles that minimise the total costs associated with selecting
them. Determining the particular p-cycle(s) to be selected for achieving
network restoration by using the cost implications of each potential p-
cycle as a criterion is a crucial aspect of the selection process. This
is because selection based on cost implications helps to achieve the
needed cost-effectiveness in the network restoration design for the
xWSN.
Therefore, in the optimisation problem set up, the appropriate
objective would be to determine (and select) the p-cycles that minimise
the total cost of achieving the network restoration, with the guarantee
that every link is protected from failure. This objective must be subject
to the constraint that the total traffic flowing on any link to be restored
(that is, the failed link) must be less than or equal to the total spare
capacity that is made available through the p-cycles that are selected
for restoring that link. In other words, the total spare capacity of the p-
cycles that are selected for network restoration must be large enough to
restore the original traffic flowing through the failed link, otherwise the
selected p-cycles would not be able to restore the network sufficiently.
Let
P be the set of all possible p-cycles from which the RPs are
to be selected; 𝑃 (𝑖𝑗) is the set of distinct cycles that are selected for
restoring link 𝑖𝑗.
𝑐𝑝 be the cost accrued by using the p-cycle 𝑝 for achieving
network restoration. The value of 𝑐𝑝 is obtained by adding the costs
of using the spare capacities of all the links that make up 𝑝; 𝑐𝑖𝑗 is the
cost of selecting link 𝑖𝑗.
𝑠𝑖𝑗,𝑝 be the maximum available spare capacity for traffic flow 𝑓𝑖𝑗
on the p-cycle 𝑝 when link 𝑖𝑗 fails.
𝑋𝑝 ∈ {0, 1} be the parameter that encodes whether a p-cycle is selected
or not. 𝑋𝑝 = 1 if p-cycle 𝑝 is selected and 𝑋𝑝 = 0 otherwise.
The optimisation problem for selecting the candidate p-cycle(s)
from the total number of p-cycles that are available for achieving
network restoration in the xWSN for D2D communications can now be
formulated as follows:
min
𝑋𝑝
∑
∀𝑝∈𝑃
𝑐𝑝.𝑋𝑝,
(1)
subject to
𝑓𝑖𝑗 ≤
∑
∀𝑝∈𝑃(𝑖𝑗)
𝑠𝑖𝑗,𝑝.𝑋𝑝
∀𝑖𝑗 ∈ 𝐿,
(2)
𝑋𝑝 ∈ {0, 1}
∀𝑝 ∈ 𝑃 .
(3)
The optimisation problem given in Eqs. (1)–(3) is a convex problem.
Therefore, any of the well-defined classical optimisation approaches for
Array 14 (2022) 100147
5
B.S. Awoyemi and B.T. Maharaj
solving convex programming problems may be employed to solve the
problem and to obtain optimal solutions [17]. In this paper, the well-
known branch-and-bound (BnB) optimisation approach is employed to
solve the optimisation problem. The BnB approach is known to be
computationally demanding, because it checks each possible branch
in the network problem before determining the best branch to use to
arrive at an optimal solution. To keep the computational demand of
the optimisation solution within the acceptable limits for the xWSN,
therefore, the implicit enumeration tool is used alongside the BnB
optimisation approach. The implicit enumeration tool, employed with
the BnB optimisation approach, achieves an advantage in that it is able
to identify the most viable branch for optimal solutions in a reasonably
shorter time [18].
Furthermore, to ensure that the additional traffic on the links that
are being used to carry out the restoration does not affect the original
traffic flowing in those links, in the network design the concept of
network restoration without interference is employed. This implies that
the restoration is carried out using only the spare capacities on the links
that make up the p-cycles. As a result, the spare capacities on the links
that would otherwise have remained unused are now well employed
in the network. With this design plan, capacity gain is achieved on
individual links in the network, which translates into improvement in
the overall restoration capacity of the network.
4.2. Load redistribution
The second important concept for improving the restoration solu-
tions of the p-cycles being used for restoring xWSN is the concept of
load distribution. Even though p-cycle selectivity helps in improving
the capacity that the network restoration achieves, the total amount
of traffic that the selected p-cycle 𝑝 realises may still be limited.
This is because the traffic that the selected p-cycle can successfully
restore without interference depends on the link that has the minimum
spare capacity on that p-cycle [12]. The link with the minimum spare
capacity in a p-cycle is referred to as the limiting link. The limiting link
of a p-cycle poses a serious bottleneck to the amount of traffic that the
selected p-cycle can restore.
Therefore, to realise even better restoration capabilities for the p-
cycle(s) that are selected for network restoration in the xWSN design,
the capacity limitation imposed on the p-cycle(s) by the limiting link
has to be overcome. Overcoming the capacity limitation of the limiting
link in a p-cycle can be achieved by seeking means to improve the
capacity of that limiting link. Improving the capacity of the limiting
link of the p-cycles that are selected for network restoration will then
result in an improvement in the overall capacity of the p-cycles being
used for carrying out network restoration in the xWSN.
To improve the capacity of the limiting link in the p-cycles that
are selected for network restoration, in this subsection, we employ
the concept of load redistribution. Simply, load redistribution means
shifting some of the load on a link to other neighbouring links in order
to free up more space (capacity) on that particularly link. Specifically
for the model developed in this paper, we target the limiting link of the
p-cycles that are selected for network restoration as the link to carry
out the load redistribution in the xWSN design. In other words, the
load redistribution incorporated helps to achieve an improved value
for the amount of spare capacity of the limiting link 𝑖𝑗 of the p-cycle
𝑝 being used in restoring the network. This implies that, by employing
load redistribution, the value of 𝑠𝑖𝑗,𝑝 becomes a value 𝑠′
𝑖𝑗,𝑝 > 𝑠𝑖𝑗,𝑝. The
improvement in the capacity of the limiting link results in a higher
value for the total restoration capacity of the p-cycle(s) selected for
restoring the network.
Actually, the improvement in the link capacity of the limiting link
of the selected p-cycle is achieved by improving the channel occupancy
ratio (COR) of the limiting link of the p-cycle. The COR of a link gives
information on the available or free channel airtime on that link. It
is important to understand how the local traffic load redistribution of
the load on the limiting link of the p-cycle(s) is carried out to achieve
capacity improvement (that is, an improvement in the COR value) of
the limiting link. This is because it is an integral part of the process of
improving the overall capacity of the p-cycle(s) being used for restoring
the network. The local traffic distribution process is explained in the
remaining part of this subsection.
First, we define the COR of links in a network. The COR (represented
by 𝜇) of any link in a network is defined as the ratio of its working
capacity (or aggregate load) to its total capacity. Particularly, for the
limiting link 𝑖𝑗 in the xWSN of interest, 𝜇𝑖𝑗 is given as:
𝜇𝑖𝑗 =
𝑤𝑖𝑗
𝑡𝑖𝑗
.
(4)
From the 𝜇𝑖𝑗 value that is obtained, the spare capacity (or achievable
link capacity) 𝑠𝑖𝑗 of the limiting link 𝑖𝑗 for the particular p-cycle of
interest can be calculated. The value of the spare capacity 𝑠𝑖𝑗 is obtained
as:
𝑠𝑖𝑗 = (1 − 𝜇𝑖𝑗)𝑡𝑖𝑗.
(5)
After obtaining the value of the spare capacity 𝑠𝑖𝑗 of the limiting
link for the p-cycle that is being used for restoring the network, we
now seek to achieve a better value of 𝑠𝑖𝑗 that can improve the overall
capacity of the p-cycle. As already established, the improvement in the
value of 𝑠𝑖𝑗 can be realised by carrying out a local redistribution of
some of the original load on the limiting link 𝑖𝑗, when required. To
decide whether a local traffic load redistribution of the original load
on the limiting link is required or not, the p-cycle that is selected for
restoring the network must first establish if it has sufficient capacity
for the requested backup or restoration needed. If the spare capacity
𝑠𝑖𝑗 of the limiting link 𝑖𝑗 for the selected p-cycle is sufficient for the
requested restoration or backup stream, the p-cycle accepts the backup
without any need for local load redistribution. However, if the spare
capacity 𝑠𝑖𝑗 of the limiting link 𝑖𝑗 of the p-cycle is insufficient for the
requested restoration or backup, it immediately triggers the local traffic
redistribution process to redistribute some of the original load on that
limiting link 𝑖𝑗.
In the local redistribution process, part of the traffic or load on the
limiting link 𝑖𝑗 is simply moved to its neighbouring, one-hop nodes
with sufficient spare capacities to accommodate the extra incoming
load. Importantly, the neighbouring nodes to be used for the local load
redistribution must be nodes that are not part of the p-cycle. By moving
some part of the original traffic of the link, new spare capacity 𝑠′
𝑖𝑗 on
the limiting link 𝑖𝑗 is achieved. As a result of the load redistribution,
the newly obtained spare capacity 𝑠′
𝑖𝑗 of the limiting link 𝑖𝑗 is now an
improved value of the initial spare capacity 𝑠𝑖𝑗. We write the new spare
capacity 𝑠′
𝑖𝑗 of the limiting link as:
𝑠′
𝑖𝑗 = 𝑠𝑖𝑗 + 𝑚𝑖𝑗,
(6)
where 𝑚𝑖𝑗 is the amount of capacity that is freed up by the redistribu-
tion of some of the original load on the link 𝑖𝑗 to its neighbouring nodes
through the local redistribution process. The value of 𝑚𝑖𝑗 is usually
a fraction of the working capacity or original aggregate load on the
limiting link 𝑖𝑗. With the load redistribution achieved, and depending
on how much load has been redistributed, the network is able to realise
significant improvement in the amount of the restoration solutions for
the xWSN. The new optimisation problem for link restoration with load
redistribution on the limiting link of the p-cycle(s) selected for restoring
the network is now given as:
min
𝑋𝑝
∑
∀𝑝∈𝑃
𝑐𝑝.𝑋𝑝,
(7)
subject to
𝑓𝑖𝑗 ≤
∑
∀𝑝∈𝑃(𝑖𝑗)

𝑋𝑝 ∈ {0, 1}
∀𝑝 ∈ 𝑃 .
(9)
Array 14 (2022) 100147

B.S. Awoyemi and B.T. Maharaj
By solving the optimisation problem in Eqs. (7)–(9), an improve-
ment in the total capacity per cost is achieved for the p-cycles that are
selected for restoring the xWSN. Since the new optimisation problem in
Eqs. (7)–(9) is still a convex problem, any of the well-defined classical
optimisation approaches may be employed to solve the problem, and
to obtain optimal solutions. Again, the BnB approach with implicit
enumeration is employed for solving the optimisation problem because
of its advantage of obtaining optimal solutions timeously.
4.3. Single p-cycle for double link failure restoration
Further to the concepts of p-cycle selectivity and load redistribution
already incorporated, in this subsection we present a third useful
concept for achieving significant improvement in the capacity of the p-
cycles being selected for restoring xWSN from link failures. The concept
is that of employing individual p-cycles to achieve network restoration
from double link failures. Indeed, if two links are in close proximity and
they do have overlapping protection, the probability of simultaneous
failure on the two links can be quite high. Thus, providing sufficient
but also resource-efficient protection from such double link failures is
quite essential for the xWSN.
The possibility of using a single p-cycle to protect a network from
double link failures depends on the simple fact that all the straddling
links of a p-cycle can be protected from any two simultaneous link
failures, provided the p-cycle protection has as many copies as the
working capacity plus one additional unit of the straddling link with
the highest capacity on the p-cycle [19]. The number of copies is the
number of p-cycles that are available on each link for achieving net-
work protection or recovery from failure. Usually, a copy of a p-cycle
protects two units capacity on a straddling link but only a unit capacity
on an on-cycle link. This is because on a p-cycle, each straddling link
has two alternative paths it can follow to achieve network restoration.
The attribute of a p-cycle protecting two units of capacity on a
straddling link but only a unit of capacity on a spanning link is what
is leveraged to achieve the use of a single p-cycle in protecting the
xWSN from two simultaneous link failures. Therefore, the p-cycles are
used to provide protection only to straddling links and no on-cycle
(or spanning) protection is carried out. Usually, when a p-cycle is
shared among multiple straddling links, the number of copies of the
p-cycle is taken to be equal to the straddling link with the highest
capacity. The major advantage of using the concept of a single p-cycle
for double restoration is that, since the scheme requires only one p-
cycle to help protect the xWSN against two simultaneous link failures,
a significant reduction in the computational time demand and the
number of variables required for arriving at solutions is realised. Also,
the spare capacity is more efficiently utilised, especially if the average
nodal degree of the network is considerably high. Thus, the possible
improvement in the restoration solution capabilities that can be realised
when single p-cycles are employed for restoring double simultaneous
link failures makes the use of the concept an important consideration
in modern xWSN designs.
In practical applications, the most significant improvements in the
network restoration solutions for xWSN can be realised by combin-
ing multiple concepts that work hand in hand to achieve the best
restoration solutions for the network. For example, if the concepts of
p-cycle selectivity, load redistribution and the use of single p-cycles
for double link failure restoration are combined, the improvement in
resource usability and restoration capability for the xWSN can be very
substantial. Therefore, it is recommended that as many improvement
concepts as possible be incorporated into the network restoration model
for xWSN, as long as the concepts can complement one another, and as
long as the resulting complexity of the network is still within acceptable
limits, especially in practical xWSN designs.
5. Results and discussion
In this section, we present some results to demonstrate the perfor-
mance of the restoration model and the various improvement concepts
incorporated and investigated in this paper. The xWSN for D2D com-
munications is simulated as a test network of 100 SNs (which represent
the devices in the D2D communication network) and 250 links be-
tween the SNs. The SNs are randomly deployed in a sufficiently wide
geographical location. The packet switched traffic model is used for
modelling the data traffic in the network. The packet switched traffic
model is employed because it supports most internet protocol-based
transmissions, and because it is a well-developed standard for machine-
to-machine communications, of which D2D communications are part.
One other scenario that could impact the range of the parameters used
is the possible large size of practical xWSN. However, the model and
parameters employed in the paper are quite scalable. Therefore, they
are sufficient to represent practical applications of xWSN.
In the xWSN developed for D2D communications, the demand for
nodes and links to be used for data transmission and network restora-
tion between the 𝑁𝑠 and the 𝑁𝑑 is distributed in an even manner
among all the nodes in the network. The network topology is varied
slightly at different simulation runs for each nodal degree used. This
is to help guarantee the accuracy of the solutions, and to eliminate
any possible bias in the results obtained for the network. The network
topologies employed have a highest average nodal degree of 4.0. The
average nodal degree of 4.0 was used in the paper because of the need
to compare with the reference works to help validate the model and
results provided. Furthermore, an average nodal degree of 4.0 is quite
commonly used for wireless sensor networks, therefore, it is considered
best to apply it in this paper. Still, results that compare the model at an
average nodal degree of 4.0 with similar networks having higher nodal
degrees (5.0 and 6.0) were considered. As expected, the results show a
similar pattern in the performance of the network, irrespective of the
average nodal degree being employed. Since the results are very similar
to the ones presented, they are not repeated for the sake of brevity.
The MATLAB software is used for simulating the network. Since
the resulting problems are classical optimisation problems, the YALMIP
solver – a MATLAB-based tool developed in [20] for solving classical
optimisation problems – is employed to solve the problems. The pro-
cessor used for carrying out the simulation runs at a speed of 3.2 GHz
and has a random access memory size of 8 GB. In all cases, restoration
solutions are obtained at an average runtime of a minute.
To achieve optimal restoration solutions for the xWSN designed
for D2D applications, the restoration model investigated in this paper
takes into consideration the possible shortest route between the 𝑁𝑠
and the 𝑁𝑑 for each network demand. Furthermore, the capacity costs
are normalised to the lowest cost of achieving the network design. All
topologies in consideration use a maximum of the average nodal degree
of 4.0 in achieving their normalised capacity cost. Therefore, the data
points plotted in the results presented can be seen as the results of the
normalised total capacity cost of the optimal solution for the network.
In evaluating the performance of the p-cycle-based restoration
model and the improvement in the restoration solutions realised
through the various schemes incorporated, we present the results of
the average path length and the total capacity cost for the network.
The average path length is given as the number of links in the p-cycle
that is selected and used for restoring the network. Thus, the average
path length indicates the hop count of the p-cycles being employed for
achieving network restoration. The total capacity cost is the sum of the
costs of using the WPs and the RPs. The cost of using the WPs is usually
known in advance by the network. The cost of the RPs is the additional
cost incurred by employing the p-cycle(s) that are selected for network
restoration. This cost is evaluated as the sum of the costs of all links on
the p-cycle(s) being used for restoring the network.
The results presented in Fig. 3 act as a validation for our restora-
tion model. To help validate the p-cycle-based restoration model for

the xWSN developed in this paper, we compare the results of our
restoration model with the possible closest p-cycle-based restoration
models available in the literature. From an extensive search, the closest
traditional p-cycle-based restoration models available are the models
presented in [21,22], which developed viable p-cycle-based restoration
solutions for wavelength division multiplexing networks. Comparative
results in terms of capacity cost are thus presented in Fig. 3. We note
that the results are very close for all the network restoration models
compared. This establishes that the results from our p-cycle-based
restoration model agree with traditional p-cycle restoration solutions,
thereby validating our restoration model.
Fig. 4 presents the results of the average path lengths for the p-
cycle restoration model for xWSN, as investigated in this paper. In
terms of the average path length, the results for the traditional p-cycle
restoration model obtained in this work are similar to the ones obtained
in [23], which further validates the results. Furthermore, the plot in
Fig. 4 compares the results of the average path lengths for some of the
restoration concepts incorporated to improve the restoration solutions
of the p-cycle restoration model for xWSN. Particularly, the results
obtained from the introduction of the concepts of p-cycle selectivity
and the load redistribution are compared with the results from the
traditional p-cycle restoration.
From the results presented in Fig. 4, we note that the link failure
restoration improvement concepts incorporated, alongside the tradi-
tional p-cycle-based link failure restoration, all achieve 100% link
protection for the network. This means that any of the restoration
concepts can indeed be successfully employed to provide the required
p-cycle protection for each link in the network. More importantly, we
observe that by incorporating any of the selection-based improvement
concepts, that is, either the p-cycle selectivity concept or the load redis-
tribution concept, the network achieves better results than by using just
the traditional link restoration. The reason is that the selection-based
schemes select the p-cycles that have a minimal number of hops from
the set of possible p-cycles to achieve network restoration or protection
against link failure. Therefore, by selecting the p-cycles that have a
minimal number of hops, the time taken to complete data transmission
is reduced, thereby improving the overall restoration performance for
the network.
Fig. 5 presents the results of the total capacity costs for the restora-
tion model developed in this paper. Furthermore, the plot compares the
results of the total capacity costs for the various restoration concepts
introduced to improve the restoration solutions of the p-cycle restora-
tion model developed for xWSN. As the results show, the incorporation
of the concepts of p-cycle selectivity, load redistribution, and the use
of a single p-cycle for restoring double link failures all brought about a
significant improvement in the capacity cost-efficiency of the p-cycles
in comparison with the use of the traditional restoration scheme alone.
This is because the selection-based schemes leverage their ability to
select the most-appropriate p-cycles from the set of possible p-cycles in
providing cost-effective protection for the network against link failures.
Moreover, the selection-based scheme with load redistribution, because
of the further improvement in the capacity realised through load redis-
tribution, outperforms the ordinary selection-based restoration scheme
in providing better efficiency in the capacity cost realisation for the
network. Still, the highest improvement in the capacity cost is observed
when the concept of a single p-cycle for double link failure restoration
is used concurrently with the selection-based restoration concept and
the load redistribution concept. The results prove that the combination
of the right improvement concepts will always yield the best improve-
ment in the restoration performance of the p-cycles being used for
restoring xWSN from link failures.
Fig. 6 presents the performance of the selection-based restoration
scheme with load redistribution when more than one limiting link is
considered for load redistribution. In the plot, the case for double load
redistribution (that is, the redistribution of loads on the two most-
limiting links of the p-cycle) and triple load redistribution (that is,
the redistribution of loads on the three most-limiting links of the p-
cycle) are presented. The plot shows that as load redistribution is

carried out on more limiting links, further improvement in capacity
cost solutions is realised. However, in practical terms, the feasibility
of having the loads of more than one limiting link redistributed may
not be guaranteed, as the xWSN may become too complex in design
and analysis, given such considerations.
6. Conclusion
This paper has developed and investigated an appropriate p-cycle-
based network restoration model for xWSN being employed for D2D
communications. The p-cycle restoration model is employed because of
the important advantages that p-cycles have over most other restora-
tion mechanisms, especially because they provide adequate network
restoration at very high speeds and optimal capacity. Further, a number
of improvement concepts are advanced for the network restoration
model for xWSN applications. The particular improvement concepts
investigated are the concepts of p-cycle selectivity, load redistribution,
and the use of a single p-cycle to achieve double failure restoration. The
improvement in the capacity efficiency realised through the various
concepts incorporated makes the restoration model an ideal model for
protecting and restoring the xWSN against link failures in practical
xWSN applications. It is noted that there could be several external
parameters (such as an unexpected increase in network traffic demand)
and external events (such as natural disasters) that may influence the
probability of the occurrence of failures and the performance of the
network restoration solutions that has been explored in this paper. The
cases and impacts of such external factors have not been considered in
this paper and would be explored in future works.
