On field experiences, which were carried out in Italy on traditional lines and employed the diagnostic trains 
“Archimedes” and “Taletes”, allowed to point out that 92.6% of the track alignment faults and 82.6% of 
superelevation faults occur in line sections with a non-void curvature (circular curves, clothoids and cubic 
parabolas) [4]. This can be due to the high lateral stresses in the track as trains pass by owing to the centrifugal 
force, which in the long run cause sleepers to be weakly clamped to the ballast with consequent variations in 
the original geometry of the track. In order to face these problems, whose solution can be reached only 
through frequent ordinary and/or extraordinary maintenance activities with high financial costs and 
deterioration in service levels for users (due to the necessity, for instance, to reduce the speed on faulty lines 
or to interrupt lines for maintenance work), a new railway sleeper was designed, planned and patented, called 
“HP-BB” (High Performance Bi-Block sleeper) [5], [6]. It is a reinforced concrete bi-block sleeper equipped 
with two lateral stoppers with a “clamping action”. The sleeper, whose dimensions are illustrated in Figures 1 
and 2, provides the lateral actions with high resistance values under conditions of well-compacted and 
degraded ballast, as emerged by the analyses performed and better described later.

2.  Evaluation of  lateral sliding resistance  
The railway sleepers should be tightly clamped into the ballast body so as to provide the sliding with high 
resistance values both lengthwise and crosswise. In particular, the specific lateral sliding resistance 
0 
influences the critical load value Pcrit, the latter being the theoretical minimum axial load value which gives 
rise to the track “twist”. Assuming a track initially deformed by a sinusoid with an amplitude fo and a 
wavelength L, a track “frame” characterized by a deflectional stiffness which is evaluated on the horizontal 
plane equal to EI, is able to stand an axial load Pcrit given from the following equation [2]: 
 
f
EI
Pcrit
 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
Equation 1 shows the proportionality between the critical load Pcrit and the specific lateral sliding resistance 
0; therefore, a track marked by high values of 0 is able to successfully stand thermal as well as lateral and 
longitudinal actions generated from railway carriages. The specific lateral resistance values, in case of an 
unladen track, are equal to 0 = 11 kN in mono-block sleepers and 0 = 14 kN in bi-block sleepers. 
The evaluation of the lateral resistance of a railway sleeper can be carried out through two different criteria: 
the former, empirical, involves in situ tests with an unladen track; the latter, theoretical, involves the 
assessment of the resistance of the single element-girder thought as independent of the other elements forming 
the track frame through specific mathematical models. In order to adopt the latter approach it is required [1], 
[7]: 
 To set the friction angle of the ballast which, under condition of aggregates obtained from crushed stony 
rock with solid elements in low porosity and with sharp corners, can be assumed as equal to ’ = 45°; 
 To set the specific weight of the ballast which under ordinary conditions can be evaluated as 15 kN/m3.  
The comparative evaluation of the performances provided by traditional sleepers and by a HP-BB sleeper 
is here made by taking two limit conditions into consideration: 
 condition A: ballast in good condition ( ’ = 45°). In this case the friction angle between ballast and sleeper 
assumes such values which can be estimated through the relation ’w = 2/3 ’; 
 condition B: degraded ballast ( ’ = 35°). In this case, precautionarily the value of the friction angle can be 
set as ’w = 1/3 ’. 
 
3. Performances of a HP-BB sleeper and comparison with traditional sleepers 
In order to establish the behaviour of the new sleeper it is hypothesized that a lithostatic stress distribution 
is determined in the ballast. Under the conditions of incipient motion the total sliding resistance of the sleeper 
can be obtained from the sum of the elementary resistances offered by each component of the same sleeper 
and developing under each part of the structure denoted with letters “b” and/or “B” (see Table1). From the 
equilibrium conditions [3] are obtained the following expressions which give the lateral sliding resistance of 
sleepers S whenever there are variations in their geometrical parameters, the mechanical properties of the 
railway ballast and the weight force (P) transmitted to each sleeper:

from the previous equation (7).
