the cost and eliminate the multi-camera synchronization problem automatically [9,10]. It can also decrease the 
size of the whole system so that it can be used in narrow space. These advantages enable this system with a 
good potential application and it develops rapidly in recent decade [11-14].. 
2. Virtual image of a multi-ocular prism 
Acconding to [15], a 3D point and one of its virtual image by the twice refraction of prism can be 
expressed by way of combine these two process together as:

Where Mp is the transformation matrix which can be used to calculate the virtual image for the refraction 
of prism. 
3. Position estimation of prism 
3.1. Parameters of a multi-ocular prism 
As well as camera, the parameters of a prism used in stereovision system can also be divided into intrinsic 
and extrinsic parameters. The intrinsic parameters which including refractive index, the angle and the 
thickness denoted the shape of a prism; the extrinsic parameters which including the surface normal and point 
coordinates of each plane expressed the position of the prism in camera coordinate.  
The numbers of intrinsic parameters for any prism were fixed in 3, while the extrinsic parameters of a 
multi-ocular prism with one back plane and m inclined planes have m+1 normal vectors and m+1 points, each 
normal vector and point get three variables, so if we want to express this prism, there should be 6*(m+1) +3 
variables (for example, the number of parameters for a two-ocular prism is 21, for a three-ocular prism is 27). 
Obviously, it was overload and would hardly get accuracy results. 
3.2. Simplification of surface normal 
If a vector V0=[vox, voy, voz]T rotated around a vector V=[vx, vy, vz]T to a new vector Vn=[vnx, vny, vnz]T with 
angle , the transformation can be written as: 
 
n
V
o
V
M V  
(2) 
Where 
V
M  denote the rotation matrix with angle  around the rotation axis V.If we considered the surface 
normal of each inclined plane as a vector which rotated around a vector with the same angle, the result would 
be simple than before. For a multi-ocular prism with m inclined planes, if the surface normal of back plane is 
denoted by , the direction vector of edge (
1,2,

)

where

Moreover, the surface normal of inclined planes can be taken as Vb  rotated around Vi with angle , and 
then we have:

Where  is the angle between back plane and inclined plane, which is one of the intrinsic parameters. This 
equation denoted that for any multi-ocular prism, all the surface normal of extrinsic parameters can be

3.3. Point selection 
An obvious advantage of multi-ocular prism was all the inclined plane must intersect at one common point; 
this character can easily reduce the point number from m+1 to 2. If this common point is denoted by P=[px, 
py,pz]T, the perpendicular line from P to the back plane intersected back plane with point Pb=[pbx, pby, pbz]T ,we 
have:

3.5. Maximum likelihood estimation 
We are given n 3D object points and m inclined plane of prism. There should be n*m points in image plane.  
Assume that the image points are corrupted by independent and identically distributed noise. The maximum 
likelihood estimation of prism position can be obtained by minimizing the following functional:

function changed to:

c

X  in camera coordinate system, and each point
c
ij
X  must correspond to m 
ij
x  by 
equation (28) as a process of perspective projection. For the position estimation of prism, the first step is 
camera calibration. When the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of camera were known, we can work out 
c
ij
X  
by equation (27). The we could get n*m corresponding points between 
ij
x  and 
c
ij
X  .Minimizing (30) is a 
nonlinear minimization problem, which could be solved with the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm [16]. The 
initial guess could use the position of standard coordinate, because we always want to set the prism as similar 
as the standard coordinate. 
4. Experiment and analysis 
4.1. Experimentation Devices 
Camera and prism are mounted on a mechanical stand which installs venire calipers in X, Y, Z axis as well 
as rotational stage. The relative positions between the camera and prism are known and adjustable, and a 
high-precision laser be used for measuring the distance from camera image plane to object, as shown in Fig 1. 
Fig 1 System set up and multi-ocular prism 
4.2. Experiment results 
The images captured by our stereovision system were divided into two, three and four segments 
respectively according to the corresponding prisms. In order to explain it clearly, we used   to express them, as 
shown in Fig 2.

5. Conclusions 
In this paper, we introduced a new method for position estimation of stereovision system using prism. The 
parameters of multi-ocular prism were reduced to only 7 extrinsic parameters which could express the 
position of the prism and 3 intrinsic parameters which could denote the shape of the prism. Our method is 
based on optical geometry, and could be used in stereovision system with any coordinate. The experiments 
with both three prisms show that the method is efficient, robust and has good property of convergence and 
small reprojection errors.
