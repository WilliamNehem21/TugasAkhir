transmission charges. The main transmission pricing methodologies are embedded cost and incremental 
pricing methodology. Countries like Colombia, UK and Brazil, have used long run marginal cost (LRMC) 
methodology due to its easy implementation. On the other hand countries like Argentina, Chile and Panama 
adopting marginal participation method. Power flow tracing provide us a complete view of usage allocation 
problem which is very important for transmission cost allocation. When usage allocation is known it is 
straightforward to allocate the transmission cost to generators and loads.  The first attempt to trace power 
flows was done by Bialek et al. when Topological Generation Distribution factors based Power flow tracing 
were proposed in March 1996 [2] which explained the method for tracing generator's output. They introduce a 
simple topological method of tracing the flow of real and reactive power in transmission networks. In Feb 
1997, Kirschen et al. [3] explained a power flow tracing method based on the proportional sharing assumption 
which introduces the concept of domains, commons, and links. In Nov 2000, Gubina et al. [4] described the 
method to determine the generators’ contribution to a particular load by using the nodal generation distribution 
factors. In Aug 2000, Wu et al. [5] explained the use of graph theory to calculate the contributions of 
individual generators and loads to line flows and the real power transfer between individual generators and 
loads. In 2009 Xie et al.[6] proposed and explained the power flow tracing algorithms founded in the extended 
incidence matrix considering loop flows.  
Similarly many different loss allocation schemes have been proposed for transmission loss allocation. The 
existing transmission loss allocation methods may be classified into prorata method, marginal methods, power 
flow tracing-based methods, and circuit theory based methods [1]. A usage based transmission loss allocation 
method is proposed in [7]. In [8] method based on circuit theory and the concept of orthogonal projection for 
pool based electricity market is proposed. 
Due to deregulation, the number of interaction entitles on the electric grid increases dramatically. At the 
same time capacity margin reduced. Hence this rapid growth threatened reliability of transmission network 
greatly. That’s why transmission reliability margin allocation should be addressed in a fair way. Many 
researchers proposed methodology which incorporate reliability cost element in total transmission cost. For 
this first usage and TRM allocation is done. In [9] Silva et al. considered the transmission network operation 
under normal as well as contingency condition for allocation reliability cost to users. In [10-11] D. Hur et al. 
proposed various variants of procedures to allocate reliability contribution to market participants. 
This paper presents a model of usage, loss and transmission reliability margin allocation based on the 
concept of the matrices methodology. In the proposed method modified Kirchhoff matrix is developed for 
usage allocation. After that loss allocation matrix is formed for transmission loss allocation to loads and 
generators. Further by incorporation (n-1) reliability criteria, maximum flow of transmission lines is 
calculated. After that the TRM of every transmission line is allocated to generators by using modified 
Kirchhoff matrix. 
2. Proposed Matrices Methodology 
Let consider a simple diagraph G showed in Fig1.

Fig.1. Simple Diagraph G 
Hence from the above example for a simple digraph G of n vertices, an n by n matrix called the Kirchhoff 
matrix

Where, �

-Xij = (i,j)th entry in the adjacency matrix 
This matrix is the basis of the proposed methodology. Authors construct a power flow matrix from the 
Newton Raphson load flow. This matrix gives a complete overview of power flows in the system. It is formed 
between nodes of the system. Diagonal elements give net flows at nodes and off diagonal elements give the 
actual flows and counter flows in the system. The proposed matrix is defined as follows: active power in 
branch  i-j from bus 1 to bus J as  Pij(� �) nd total inflow at bus 1 as PTi

�����
������������������������������
����������������������������

Where  PTi=net flows on the nodes�
From the above matrix and using Eq. 1 the Modified Kirchhoff matrix is constructed as follows. Denoting

3. Procedure for Tracing Power Flow and Loss Allocation
97
 Baseem Khan et al. /  AASRI Procedia  7 ( 2014 )  94 – 100 
In this paper authors adopt the tracing procedure which is proposed in [6]. But authors modified this 
tracing algorithm for transmission loss allocation.
3.1 Model for Power Flow Tracing 
The procedure for power flow tracing is same as preaented in [6]. Power flow allocated to generators from 
the lines flow as shown in Eq. (5). It is assumed that a ��� �� (23:77) split in the transmission usage occurs 
between generators and demand. For example the generator share situated as bus s to the line s-t is given by 
��������� � ��������                                                                       (5)�
Hence eq. (5) gives the generators share in lines flows. Similarly, the usage allocated to a load for the use 
of all lines can be defined by using �� instead of���. For calculating the loads shares in line flows and 
generated power same procedure is followed. 
     PL=PLL(��
�����                                                                    (6)�
Where the diagonal matrix PLL= diag (PL1, PL2, …., PLd)  and R= R=PLL (��
���
��is the extraction factor 
matrix of loads from generators [6]. By using an extraction factor matrix, loads share in generating power and 
line flows is calculated. 
3.2 Model for Transmission Loss Allocation 
For transmission loss allocations to generator consider Eq. (5). In this equation line flows Pst is replaced by 
the transmission Loss in lines which is coming from the elements of the Kirchhoff loss matrix. Hence 
transmission losses of line s-t allocated to generator located at bus i is given by: 
      �������
�
� ����                                                                       (7)�
Similarly transmission losses of line s-t allocated to load situated at bus j is given by: 
                                                                        �������
�
� ����                                                                         (8) 
From the equations (18) and (19) losses are allocated to generators and loads respectively. This method of 
loss allocation is said to be direct because all the calculation is already done for usage allocation.      
3.3 Model for TRM Allocation 
For transmission reliability margin allocation to generator and load, considered eq. 5,  
TRM = maximum capacity of the line in p.u. – usage of the line in p.u. 
ij
ij
TRM
= 1- pf                                                                              (9) 
Where for a particular line the calculation of TRM has considered Maximum capacity of the all line is 1 
p.u. In this equation line flows is replaced by the transmission reliability margins in lines which is coming 
from the elements of TRMij. 
Hence transmission reliability margin of line s-b allocated to generator located at bus i is given by: 
��������
�
� ������                                                                  (10) 
Similarly transmission reliability margin of line s-b allocated to load situated at bus j is given by: 
��������
�
� ������                                                                  (11)�
4. Result and Discussion
The proposed matrices methodology is applied to the sample 6 and IEEE 14 bus power system to 
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology. A computer program coded in MATLAB is 
developed.

4.1Sample 6 Bus System
4.1.1 Transmission Usage Allocation 
The sample 6 bus power system is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. The summation of powers 
extracted by the load buses from all the generators equals the total load demand similarly the addition of 
powers contributed by the generator buses to all the demands equals the total generation power. Table 1 gives 
the generators contributions to losses and line flows.Total system losses occurred in the system is 0.084697 pu 
from which 23% is allocated to generators and 77% is allocated to demands.

4.1.2Transmission Reliability Margin  Allocation 
From the equations (10) and (11) TRM are allocated to generators and loads respectively. From the table 2 
it is observed that the generators which contribute more power to line flows, have more TRM allocated. Also 
table 3 provides a comparison between TRM allocated by proposed method and method presented in [11].

4.2 IEEE 14 Bus System 
4.2.1Transmission Usage Allocation 
The proposed method is also applied on IEEE 14 bus system [12]. Authors assume that cost of the line is 
proportional to the length of the line. After this the share of each generator (load) in load (generator) and line 
flows is calculated. Fig 2 gives generators shares to various line flows respectively. Y axis shows the usage 
allocation in MW and x axis provide no of lines. 
Fig 2: Generators shares to Line flows 
4.2.2Transmission Loss Allocation 
Fig 3 presents the transmission loss allocation between generators respectively. Total system losses occur 
in IEEE 14 Bus system is 15.87016 MW. 23% of total losses i.e. 3.70114478 MW is allocated to generators 
and 77% i.e.  12.16902 is allocated to loads. 
Fig 3: Generators shares to Line loss 
5. Conclusion 
In the proposed work authors presents a combined methodology for the transmission usage, loss and 
reliability margin allocation which is based on the matrices methodology. This method is simple and easy to 
implement in large power system. Furthermore transmission loss and reliability margin allocation by this 
method is direct because all the calculation previously done for usage allocation. This method requires less

calculation as compared to other methods such as Topological generator distribution factors proposed by 
Bialek [4] because matrix inversion is required only one time. Further TRM allocation by this method is more 
as compare to method presented in [11]. Results are shown for the sample 6 bus system and IEEE 14 bus 
system.
