Abstract 
The appropriate estimation method plays a significant role in different kinds of teaching process. In order to overcome the 
disadvantages of the conventional teaching estimation methods, an integrative evaluating model, which is based on the 
fuzzy logic, is proposed to deal with the evaluating process with multiple variables in this paper. The design process of 
constructing the model based on the fuzzy logic is discussed in detail. A satisfactory estimating result has been obtained 
on the basis of the practical data. The evaluating effect shows that the fuzzy estimating model is effective in processing 
the multi-variable plant.

1. Introduction 
The teaching quality is very important for different levels and different kinds of teaching process, 
including both fulltime and extracurricular ones. A proper evaluating method of the teaching quality is quite 
significative for improving the teachers’ teaching and students’ learning enthusiasm. Nevertheless, there are 
no appropriate, objective, and comprehensive estimating methods in practice. In essence, there exists an

urgent requirement of setting up an effective estimating model for a specific teaching process. In this paper, 
we will make our efforts to provide a satisfactory solution.  
There are plenty of estimating models of teaching quality at present, still there are some disadvantages in 
the practical application. From this point of view, we make a try to construct a practical evaluating model of 
the teaching quality so as to estimate the multi-variable process by means of the comprehensive evaluating 
method based on the fuzzy reasoning. 
2. Fundamentals of Fuzzy Reasoning 
Fuzzy logic was first proposed by Prof. L. A. Zadeh of the University of California at Berkeley in 1965. 
After that, the fuzzy controller was first implemented by Mamdani on a steam engine in 1974 [1, 2]. In the 
following years, fuzzy logic has come into wide uses in many successful applications and has obtained 
significant achievements. 
Fuzzy Reasoning (FR) uses linguistic information to denote and process the relevant variables without the 
requirement for the mathematical model of the object, and it is able to adjust the parameters to adapt to the 
change of the system in-line, and possesses such advantages as robustness, universal approximation theorem, 
model-free, and rule-based algorithm, etc. Fuzzy logic is able to process incomplete data and provides 
approximate solutions to problems [3, 4].  
In addition to the automatic control field, research and development is also continuing on fuzzy 
applications in software design, including fuzzy expert systems and integration of fuzzy logic with neural 
network [5-7].  
Fuzzy set theory defines fuzzy operators on fuzzy sets. Fuzzy logic usually utilizes IF-THEN rules, or 
constructs that are equivalent, such as fuzzy associative matrices. Fuzzy rules are usually expressed in the 
form [8]: 
IF variable IS property THEN action.
There are also other operators, called hedges that can be applied. Usually these are such adverbs as very, or 
somewhat, which modify the meaning of a set using a mathematical formula [9]. 
3. Design Process 
3.1. Description of Algorithm 
In constructing the estimating model of the teaching quality, the first thing is to define the estimation index 
set U, the level set V, and the weights of the estimation index, the membership can be confirmed according to 
the maximum membership principle in the comprehensive evaluation [10-12]. 
U = {Teaching attitude, Teaching content, Teaching method, Teaching effect} 
V = {Very good, Better, ordinary, Worse, Bad} 
Here we utilize the sum-product method to compute the eigenvector of every evaluation index. The 
concrete computing procedure is as follow: 
(1) Normalize the elements in the judgment matrix, and the ordinary element is

Thus we can get U1= (0.11, 0.23, 0.36, 0.2, 0.1), U2= (0.1, 0.4, 0.34, 0.14, 0.2), U3= (0.01, 0.4, 0.44, 0.12,

According to the principle of the maximum membership, we can see that the ratio of “better” is higher, 
thus the teaching quality of the teacher is ranked to be a better level.  
4. Conclusion 
The evaluation of the teaching quality is very important for a particular teacher, which is a typical multi-
variable process, and there are lots of evaluation methods in the practical application. In this paper, a fuzzy 
integrative estimating model is proposed to get a reasonable evaluation result so as to overcome the 
disadvantages of the common estimating methods. By means of selecting the sum-product method to compute 
the eigenvector of every evaluation index, a proper estimating result has been obtained according to the fuzzy 
estimating model and the corresponding standardization procedure, which is on the basis of the practical 
application data. The overall results show that the fuzzy estimating model is quite effective for the multi-
variable process.
