The maturity state of durian fruit is a key indicator of quality before trading. This research aims to improve the
near-infrared (NIR) model for classifying the maturity stage of durian fruit using a completely non-destructive
measurement. Both NIR spectrometers were investigated: the short wavelength NIR (SWNIR) ranging from
450 to 1000 nm and long wavelength NIR (LWNIR) ranging from 860 to 1750 nm. The samples collected for ex-
perimentation consisted of four stages: immaturity, prematurity, maturity, and ripe. Each fruit was scanned at the
rind position on the main fertile lobe (header, middle, and tail) and stem. The classiﬁcation models were devel-
oped using three supervised machine learning algorithms: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector ma-
chine (SVM), and K-Nearest neighbours (KNN). The analysis results revealed that the use of durian rind spectra
only obtained between 83.15% and 88.04% accuracy for the LWNIR spectrometer, while the SWNIR spectrometer
provided 64.73 to 93.77% accuracy. The performance of model increases when developing with combination be-
tween rind and stem spectra. The LDA model developed using a combination of rind and stem spectra provided
the greatest efﬁciency, exhibiting 97.28% and 100% accuracy for LWNIR and SWNIR spectrometers, respectively.
The LDA modelistherefore recommendedfor obtainingspectrafromsmoothingmovingaverage (MA) +baseline
of rind position and when used in combination with the MA + standard normal variance (SNV) of stem spectra.
The NIR spectroscopy indicated high potential for non-destructive estimation of the durian maturity stage. This
process could be used for quality control in the durian export industry to solve the problem of unripe durian
being mixed with ripe fruit.

1. Introduction
Durian is known as the king of fruit and considered to be an impor-
tant agricultural product. Thailand is the largest producer and exporter
of durian in the world (Ministry of Commerce, 2020). In particular, the
Mon Thong variety is famous because it has a sweet, delicious taste. Ac-
cording to Thailand's export statistics for fresh durian in 2021, Thailand
is the world's number one exporter of durian, with an export volume of
around 900,000 tons, valued at about 3 billion dollars. In 2021, the value
of Thailand's fresh durian exportation increased by approximately
66.39% compared to 2020 (Export statistics of fresh durian, 2022).
Presently, market demand for durian fruit is showing a continuously in-
creasing trend, leading to high-value exports.
The quality of durian exports is controlled under the sorting criteria
of the Agricultural Commodity Standards of the National Bureau of Ag-
ricultural Commodity and Food Standards, Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives to retain high quality and meet the speciﬁed product stan-
dards (Product Standard of Durian Agriculture, 2013). The quality of du-
rian fruit for export is based on the analysis of its physical properties and
external characteristics such as shape, amount of pulp, cleanliness with-
out contamination, external defects, etc. (Somsri, 2013). For example, to
be considered a mature fruit, durian must be harvested when its rind
and stem colour change from bright green to brown or dark green. How-
ever, there is a high possibility that mistakes may be made if the fruit
grows on the outside branches of the tree (under sunlight). Fruit ex-
posed to extreme sunlight tends to be browner, rougher, and have

dark brown stems, while the end of the thorn is drier and browner than
canopied fruit of the same age (Regional information warehouse, 2023).
Therefore, the traditional visual sorting method is subject to potential
mistakes.
Most of the durian fruit exported is fresh. To deliver fresh fruit, it is
necessary for the fruit to be transported under the appropriate condi-
tions, such as by considering the transportation distance. If the transpor-
tation distance is short, mature durians could be chosen which can ripen
within 1–3 days, while a longer transportation distance requires durians
to be at a less mature stage to allow enough time for the fruit to be ripe
and ready to eat when it reaches the consumer. Usually, durians are
transported under refrigeration to retain the appropriate temperature
(Paoumnuaywit, 2019).
According to a recent report, from 2014 to 2015, the value of durian
exports reduced from 69.3 to 6.5% because the quality of the fruit failed
to meet the required standards (Jintakanon, 2020). If this situation were
to continue, it could affect the international export business sector,
causing the loss of its existing customer base. If the durians delivered
do not meet the required standard, they will be beaten and sold at a
lower price causing high-value losses.
To control quality and reduce the problem of young durian being
mixed with mature fruit, random selection is employed to determine
its chemical values, such as total soluble solid content (TSS) and dry
matter (DM), allowing the inside quality of the durian to be thoroughly
and accurately assessed. This method also has limitations in terms of
cost because such analysis is time-consuming and requires highly-
skilled operators. Therefore, it is not popularly used and cannot guaran-
tee 100% quality.
Currently, near infrared (NIR) is used as an alternative method
and has the potential to predict the quality of durian fruit.
Talabnark and Terdwongworakul (2017) used FT-NIR spectroscopy
(12,500–3,500 cm−1) to assess the DM content of durian pulp. The
PLSR model developed from pulp spectra and whole fruit spectra
with sliced rind spectra were compared for performance. The pulp
spectra model provided an rp and RMSEP of 0.78% and 3.02%, respec-
tively, while the model developed from whole fruit with sliced rind
spectra gave an rp and RMSEP of 0.69% and 3.57%, respectively.

applied
near-infrared
spectroscopy
(1100–2500 nm) to classify three maturity classes (immature du-
rian, early-mature durian, and mature durian) based on sliced rind
and sliced stem absorbance. They concluded that a combination
model using both sliced rind and stem spectra data provided the
highest classiﬁcation accuracy (94.4%). The researchers in the fore-
going studies employed minimally destructive evaluation by remov-
ing the stems and slicing the peel and rind to provide a ﬂat area
before scanning. However, since fruit for export should not be
scratched or damaged, this application is impractical. To address
this research gap, an effective non-destructive test should be devel-
oped in the future.
Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to predict the sweetness of du-
rian pulp both online (scanning with the sample moving) and ofﬂine
(scanning with the sample remaining static) (Leepaitoon, 2018). The
online model consisted of an R2 of 0.70 and RMSEP of 4.0%. Meanwhile,
the ofﬂine model had an R2 of 0.81 and RMSEP of 3.27%. The near-
infrared (NIR) hyperspectral image technique was used to scan the du-
rian pulp, predict DM, and classify the ripeness of the durian pulp
(Sharma et al., 2022). For DM prediction, the model developed with a
genetic algorithm (GA) for variable selection provided the highest per-
formance with an R2
p of 0.878 and RMSEP of 1.22%. For ripeness classiﬁ-
cation, the LDA algorithm demonstrated 100% accuracy. Durian (Durio
zibethinus) ripeness detection (unripe, ripe, and overripe) was per-
formed using thermal image and multivariate analysis (PCA, KNN,
LDA, SVM) (Mohd Ali et al., 2021). The classiﬁcation accuracy was
higher than 93% for each model. The SVM model exhibited the best per-
formance, providing 97% accuracy. However, this research was con-
ducted at room temperature.
According to the literature review, the near-infrared spectroscopy
(NIRs) techniques demonstrated a high potential to determine the ma-
turity stage and ripeness of durian fruit and pulp. The previous research
resulted in destructive and minimally destructive fruit. Therefore, this
present research attempted to perform evaluation under conditions
which were as non-destructive as possible. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to apply NIR spectroscopy techniques to classify the maturity
of whole durian fruit. The scanning was performed under full non-
destructive conditions and two main objectives: 1) to develop a classiﬁ-
cation model for measuring the maturity stage of whole durian fruit
using SWNIR and LWNIR spectroscopy, and 2) to search for an optimal
scanning method for use as a full non-destructive measurement of
maturity class.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample collection
Durian fruit (Mon Thong variety) was obtained from the Duangkhae
durian orchard, Nam Nao District, Phetchabun Province (Latitude
16.7866, longitude 101.6478). A total of 160 fruit samples were col-
lected from ﬁve different age periods, based on the days after blooming
(DAB), including 80 to 90 (40 fruits), 90 to 100 (40 fruits), 100 to 110
(40 fruits), 110 to 120 (20 fruits), and 120 to 130 (20 fruits). The durian
fruit collected was classiﬁed into three maturity stages based on DAB:
unripe (80 to 100 DAB = 80 fruits), prematurity (101 to 120 DAB =
60 fruits), and mature (121 to 130 DAB = 20 fruits). The samples
were taken to the Department of Agricultural Engineering Laboratory,
Faculty of Engineering, KhonKaen University. The 30 durian fruits
from prematurity stage (60 fruits) were separated randomly and were
left to ripen for seven days. They were assigned as the ripe stage
(Pimten., 2021; Posomboon, 2020). Durian is a climacteric fruit. The rip-
ening is regulated by ethylene which fruit can ripe by itself after har-
vesting (Tongdee et al., 1990).
Therefore, the durian fruits of this experiment included four matu-
rity stage (unripe: 80 fruits; prematurity: 30 fruits; mature: 20 fruits
and ripe stage: 30 fruits). Table 1 shows the durian fruit categorised ac-
cording to maturity and number of samples.
2.2. NIR scanning
The fruits sample were placed in room temperature at 25 ± 2 °C for
one hour before the samples were taken for scanning to eliminate the
temperature difference factor. The NIR scanning system consisted of a
measurement chamber and two NIR spectrometers. The measurement
chamber comprised a black box measuring 60 L × 60 W × 60H cm.
Four halogen lamps of 25 W were installed at the top of each corner of
the box at an angle 45° from the y-axis (see Fig. 1a). The samples
were scanned using two spectrometers: long wavelength (LWNIR)
spectrometer (AvaSpec-ULS2048-USB2-VA-50, AVANTES, Netherlands,
wavelength range between 860 and 1750 nm), and short wavelength

(SWNIR)
spectrometer
(AvaSpec-NIR256-1.7-EVO,
AVANTES,
Netherlands, wavelength range between 140 and 1100 nm).
Spectra acquisition consisted of three steps: 1) the light source was
turned on and left for 10 min to ensure stable light intensity; 2) the
dark and white references were collected; and 3) the samples were
scanned using two spectrometers with the same integrating time of
200 ms. Each durian fruit sample was scanned under light windows.
The reﬂectance was calculated as R ¼ Is � Id
Iw � Id , with Is, Id, and Iw being
the reﬂectance intensity of the sample, dark, and white reference, re-
spectively. The absorbance (A) was then calculated as A = log(1/R).
The samples were scanned at the stem (Somton et al., 2015) of one
side in triplicate to obtain average spectra. The rind (at header, middle,
and tail position) of the fertile lobe (which is a completing lobe through-
out the length of the fruit and larger than other lobes) was then scanned
in triplicate at each position and averaged (Buasub, 2007) (see Fig. 1b
and Fig. 2). Therefore, four spectra were obtained for each fruit: header,
middle, tail, and stem. The schematic of the developed classiﬁcation
model is shown in Fig. 2.
2.3. Dry matter content measurement
After scanning, the peel was removed from the fruit, and the pulp
taken at the head, middle, and tail determined for DM using the dry
oven method. The samples at each position weighed approximately
10 g according to the digital balance system (ATX224, Shimadzu,
Japan) and placed in a hot air oven at 60 °C for 72 h (UF75, Memmert,
Germany) (Saechua et al., 2021). The dried samples were then weighed
and the DM calculated following Eq. (1).

Where W2 is the ﬁnal weight of the dried sample (g), W1 is the initial
weight (g). Each position was evaluated in triplicate and averaged.
2.4. Model development
Fig. 2 displays the schematic for developing the model of maturity
classiﬁcation. To search for the best model, the total data were analyzed
using supervised machine learning classiﬁcation, linear discriminant
analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neigh-
bours (KNN). Spectral pre-treatment methods were used for both
non-pre-processed (raw spectra) and pre-processed spectra from the
1st derivative (D1) (gap = 5 points, segment = 5 points), 2nd deriva-
tive (D2) (gap = 5 points, segment = 5 points), smoothing moving av-
erage (MA) + standard normal variance (Smooth + SNV), and
MA + baseline offset. For the gap-segment derivative, the gap size indi-
cated the spacing between points over which the derivative is com-
puted, while the segment size indicated the range over which the
points are averaged. Adding a gap and segment to a derivative can
help to smooth and eliminate any noise created from the derivative
itself.

The training model was created using cross-validation (CV). K-Fold
CV is where a given dataset is split into a K number of sections/folds
with each fold used as a testing set at some point. Taking the scenario
of 5-Fold CV (K = 5). In the ﬁrst iteration, the ﬁrst fold is used to test
the model and the remainder to train the model. In the second iteration,
the second fold is used as the testing set, while the remainder serves as
the training set. This process is repeated until each of the ﬁve folds have
been used as the testing set (Krishni, 2018). Thus, in this research, k-fold
CV of k = 5 used where the training set and test dataset are 75% and
25%, respectively. Therefore, the total sample was 160, calibration set
was 117 fruits and validation set were 43 fruits.
In the ﬁrst step, the models were developed using rind spectra (at
positions: a (head), b (middle), and c (tail)), with each position
assigned as an individual spectrum sample to choose the optimal

spectra pre-processing technique. Therefore, calibration set had 351
samples (117 × 3 spectra) and validation set had 129 samples (43 × 3
spectra). The rind spectra were examined with either raw or pre-
processed spectra. The appropriate spectra pre-processing technique
and its corresponding classiﬁcation algorithm were then obtained.
In the second step, when the optimal spectra pre-processing method
for rind (from ﬁrst step) had been obtained, the pre-processed rind
spectra were merged with raw stem spectra or stem spectra pre-
treated with several techniques (D1, D2, MA + SNV, and MA + baseline
offset). A rind spectral sample was merged with a stem sample to form a
single sample. These combined spectra were used to generate the clas-
siﬁcation model again.
The performance of LDA, SVM, and KNN models was evaluated for
overall accuracy (Eq. (2)), precision (Eq. (3)), recall (Eq. (4)), and spec-
iﬁcity (Eq. (5)). The variables in each equation are true positives (TP),
true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) true
positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false
negatives (FN).

This work classiﬁes into four classes i.e. unripe, prematurity, matu-
rity, and ripe. For example, if considering for the class of ripe stage; TP,
TN, FP, and FN can be described as: TP is the number of samples that
are correctly classiﬁed for ripe; TN is the number of samples unripe, pre-
maturity, and maturity; FN is the number of samples to unripe that are
misclassiﬁed as ripe, prematurity, and maturity and; FP is the number of
samples of unripe, prematurity, and maturity that are misclassiﬁed as
ripe. Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC-ROC) estimated the potential of the classiﬁer to distinguish
between classes. The AUC-ROC ranges from 0 to 1, where a score close to
1 indicates that the classiﬁer can successfully divide the positive class

above mention.
Both SWNIR and LWNIR spectra classiﬁcation models were gener-
ated using the same methodology, and their performance subsequently
compared. Finally, using different machine learning classiﬁcation and
pre-processing, the NIR wavelength spectrometer and spectra position
model (only rind or combined spectra) provided the highest accuracy
and was found to be the best model.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Spectral characteristics of durian
The raw spectra of durian rind and stem collected using LWNIR
(860–1750 nm) and SWNIR (450–1000 nm) are shown in Figs. 3 and
4, respectively. Figs. 3a, b, and c; 4a, b, and c show the raw, SNV, and av-
erage raw spectra of the rind, respectively. Figs. 3d, e, a, and f; 4d, e, and f
show the raw, SNV, and average raw spectra of the stem, respectively.
Figs. 3a, b, d, and e; and 4a, b, d, and e show the raw spectra and SNV
spectra of the rind and stem, respectively. Baseline offset usually oc-
curred when scanning the durian fruit samples. The linear baseline
shift affecting the absorption value was tilted up systematically with in-
creasing wavelengths (Haruthaithanasan, 2011). The average raw spec-
trum of the rind and stem at different maturity stages, i.e., unripe,
premature, mature, and ripe, are presented in Figs. 3c and f and 4c and
f for LWNIR and SWNIR, respectively. The average raw spectra of both
rind and stem were clearly divided into two groups. Group 1: unripe
and premature stage and Group 2: mature and ripe stage, showing sim-
ilar results. While the average raw spectra between the two groups was
obviously different. For example, Fig. 3c and f show that the absorption
of the two groups was clearly different at a wavelength of 1250 nm vi-
brational band of sugar (Pu et al., 2016). For SWNIR, the average raw
rind spectra, at a wavelength of 680 nm vibrational band of anthocya-
nins and chlorophyll (Benelli et al., 2021), approximately, clearly had
different absorption values at various stages. Whereas Fig. 4f shows
that the SWNIR of raw stem spectra clearly had a different absorption
curve. As previously mentioned, the different absorption values ap-
peared clearly at various maturity stages resulting in the classiﬁcation
model giving good accuracy. The report by Sharma et al. (2022) shows
the average spectra SNV pre-treated. At wavelengths of 900 and
1200 nm the spectra can be clearly split according to the different ripe-
ness stages of durian. Likewise, Saputro and Handayan (2017)

demonstrated that the reﬂectance proﬁle of a banana was separated in
the various maturity stages at wavelengths of around 480, 680, and
960 nm.
3.2. Dry matter content
Fig. 5 demonstrates the average DM of durian pulp at different matu-
rity stages. The results show that the DM of durian pulp increased with a
rise in DAB. However, durian at the ripe stage exhibited a lower DM
than at the maturity stage because it was left to ripen naturally from
the prematurity. These results are consistent with the ﬁndings of
Chuenatsadongkot et al. (2018) in that the correlation of the DM per-
centage to the DAB shows a clear trend, with the DM percentage
tending to increase steadily during the period, rising from 100 to 135
DAB. However, at the ripe stage, the mean percentage DM declined
less than at the maturity stage because when the durian is very ripe,
the pulp smears, causing the humidity to be higher than usual. This
corresponds to Timkhum and Terdwongworakul (2013), where the
percentage DM values are lower because of the high moisture caused
by the heavy rainfall. This demonstrates that humidity affects the
percentage DM.
3.3. Classiﬁcation models
Table 2 shows the accuracy of validation set of each classiﬁcation
model developed using the full wavelength from LWNIR. The report
on the ﬁrst step indicates that the maturity classiﬁcation models were
developed using durian rind spectra coupled with different algorithms
(i.e., LDA, SVM, and KNN) and either raw spectra or pre-treated spectra
(i.e., D1, D2, MA + SNV and MA + baseline offset) to ﬁnd the optimal
pre-treatment and its corresponding algorithm. The model efﬁciency
was determined based on precision, recall, speciﬁcity, and accuracy.
The results show that the optimal pre-treatment of the D2 was suitable
for LDA and SVM algorithms, and the MA + SNV was appropriate for
KNN, provided precision, recall, speciﬁcity, and overall accuracy for val-
idation set of 71.45%, 71.62%, 91.61%, and 87.50%; 73.91%, 62.45%,
90.21%, and 88.04%; and 73.91%, 62.45%, 90.21%, and 88.04%, respec-
tively. Finally, the optimal spectra pre-treatment of the D2 was appro-
priate for LDA and SVM, while MA + SNV was optimal for KNN.
According to the report on the second step, either the raw or pre-
treated stem spectra were matched with the rind spectra (pre-treated
using the D2 for LDA and SVM, and MA + SNV for kNN, obtained from
the ﬁrst step). From the hypothesis, it is clear that the combination of
rind spectra and stem spectra could improve the classiﬁcation accuracy.
Table 2 indicates that the combined spectra (rind and stem) can in-
crease the model performance of all algorithms. The LDA model devel-
oped with the rind (D2) + stem (MA + SNV) provided the best
classiﬁcation efﬁciency, precision, recall, speciﬁcity, and overall accu-
racy of 96.40%, 91.88%, 97.55%, and 97.28%, respectively. The confusion
matrix of validation set was displayed in Table 3.

Table 4 shows the accuracy of validation set of each classiﬁcation
model developed using the full wavelength from SWNIR. The analysis
methodology was the same as for LWNIR. The maturity classiﬁcation
models were developed using durian rind spectra. Each algorithm
coupled with either raw or pre-processed spectra was used for model
development to ﬁnd the optimal pre-treatment and its corresponding
algorithm. The model efﬁciency was also determined based on preci-
sion, recall, speciﬁcity, and overall accuracy. The results show that the
optimal pre-treatment of the MA + baseline offset was suitable for
LDA, the D1 for SVM, and the D2 for KNN, provided precision, recall,
speciﬁcity, and overall accuracy of 84.70%, 83.48%, 85.30%, 84.39%;
95.99%, 91.99%, 95.56%, 93.77%; and 87.90%, 85.62%, 87.50%, 87.01%,
respectively.
As seen in Table 4, it can be observed that the combined spectra
(rind and stem) can increase the model performance for all algorithms.
The LDA model developed with the rind (MA + baseline off-
set) + stem (MA + SNV) provided the best classiﬁcation efﬁciency,
obtaining precision, recall, speciﬁcity, and overall accuracy of 100%.
Table 5 demonstrate the confusion matrix of validation set for
SWNIR spectrometer which model ability was higher slightly than
that of LWNIR spectrometer.
The NIR-HSI (NIR hyperspectral image) system (900–1600 nm) was
used to create the ripeness classiﬁcation model (unripe, ripe, and
overripe) following DAB. The model was developed with pulp durian
spectra. The results display that the LDA model could be used to classify
the durian maturity level, providing high accuracy of 100% (Sharma
et al., 2022). Talabnark and Terdwongworakul (2017) reported that
FT-NIR spectroscopy (800–2500 nm) can be used to classify the fruit
maturity levels (at 101, 108, 115, and 122 days) using sliced rind spectra
with a high accuracy level of 87.48%, and the model developed by PLS-
DA. Whereas the model established from pulp durian spectra provided
higher accuracy than the sliced rind spectra (92.5%). Somton et al.
(2015) found that the classiﬁcation model from NIR (1000–2500 nm)
developed using a combination of sliced rind and sliced stem spectra
can achieve higher accuracy than models created from only sliced rind
spectra (94.4% accuracy). Timkhum and Terdwongworakul (2012) ap-
plied visible NIR spectroscopy (350–750 nm) to classify ﬁve maturity
stages (ranging from 106 to 134 DAB) using sliced rind durian spectra.
The model achieved the best classiﬁcation accuracy (83.30%), while
the model developed with sliced stem spectra provided higher accuracy
than the sliced rind spectra (94.7%) (Saputro and Handayani, 2017).
These results were supported by Praneenararat, who found that the du-
rian stem contains liquid sugar compounds that coincide with sweet-
ness. The chemical analysis revealed that when the durians began to
ripen, the sucrose increased signiﬁcantly while the glucose and fructose
decreased (Praneenararat, 2021). Therefore, the higher accuracy

provided by the durian stem spectra model accords with the results of
the present study (see Tables 2 and 4), while the spectra of the stem
combined with rind gave high accuracy. Some previous studies have re-
sulted in destructive measurement, and others minimally destructive.
The aim of the present research was to provide a completely non-
destructive measurement. The NIR spectroscopy, combined with
machine learning has the potential to be used as a non-destructive
measurement.
The application of NIR spectroscopy could reduce operating time,
and different positions of rind combined with stem spectra producing
a similar performance. Any rind position combined with stem spectra
can be used for prediction. The ﬁndings reveal that different rind spectra
can give similar results. Accurate prediction was achieved by the LDA
classiﬁcation model developed from MA + baseline rind spectra (differ-
ent positions, i.e., head, middle, and tail) and MA + SNV stem spectra for
SWNIR spectrometer.
4. Conclusion
This research demonstrates that the NIR spectroscopy technique has
the potential to become a full non-destructive measurement. The model
was generated using several machine learning techniques for classiﬁca-
tion of the maturity (four stages, i.e., immature, premature, mature, and
ripe) based on durian DAB. The strength of this research is that the sam-
ples are not destroyed during the classiﬁcation process. The LWNIR and
SWNIR coupled with LDA, SVM, and KNN algorithm gave slightly differ-
ent performance results. The developed LWNIR model using rind
spectra provided overall accuracy of 87.50%, 88.04%, and 88.04%, respec-
tively, while the developed SWNIR model using rind spectra gave over-
all accuracy of 84.39%, 93.77%, and 87.01%, respectively. The models
improved when combined spectra (rind spectra + stem spectra) were
used. The LDA model was the best classiﬁer, providing 100% classiﬁca-
tion accuracy for SWNIR when the rind spectra were pre-treated with
the MA + baseline offset and the stem spectra pre-treated using
MA + SNV. The rind spectra at any position combined with the stem
spectra is recommended for practical use. The NIR spectrometer could
be applied to classify durian maturity. Any spectrometer instruments
could be used as it offers the same high efﬁciency, but SWNIR is recom-
mended because it is less expensive than LWNIR.
