Multiple-Point Simulation (MPS) is a geostatistical simulation technique commonly used to model complex
geological patterns and subsurface heterogeneity. There have been a great variety of implementation methods
developed within MPS, of which Patch-Based Simulation is a more recently developed class. While we have
witnessed great progress in Patch-Based algorithms lately, they are still faced with two challenges: conditioning
to point data and the occurrence of verbatim copy. Both of them are partly due to finite size of Training
image, from which a limited size of pattern database is constructed. To address these questions, we propose a
novel approach that we call Generative-Patched-Simulation (GPSim), which is based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN). With this method, we are able to generate sufficient (in theory an infinite) number of new
patches based on the current pattern database. As demonstrated by the results on a simple 2D binary image,
this approach shows its potential to address the two issues and thus improve Patch-based Simulation methods.
1. Introduction
Multiple-Point Simulation (MPS) (Guardiano and Srivastava, 1993;
Hu and Chugunova, 2008) is a geostatistical simulation technique
commonly used to model complex geological patterns and subsurface
heterogeneity. There have been a great variety of implementation
methods (Strebelle, 2002; Mariethoz et al., 2010; Peredo and Ortiz,
2011) developed within MPS, of which Patch-Based Simulation (Arpat
and Caers, 2007; Zhang et al., 2006; Honarkhah and Caers, 2010;
Tahmasebi et al., 2012; El Ouassini et al., 2008; Chatterjee et al.,
2012; Rezaee et al., 2013) is a more recently developed class. In
general, Patch-Based Simulation has better pattern reproduction and
faster simulation speed than Pixel-Based Simulation (Guardiano and
Srivastava, 1993; Strebelle, 2002; Mariethoz et al., 2010) since it
synthesizes patches rather than pixels (Wei et al., 2009). Patch-Based
Simulation relies on the use of Training images (TI) from which patches
are extracted as the building blocks to construct multiple stochastic
realizations. While we have witnessed great progress in Patch-Based
algorithms recently, they are still faced with several challenges.
The first difficulty is conditioning to point data. Patch-based meth-
ods generally have more difficulty with conditioning to point data
than Pixel-based algorithms. During the simulation, patches from TI
are compared with the neighborhood of the current simulation point
(termed Data Event) using the concept of distance (or similarity). The
most similar candidate patches are selected and one of them is pasted
onto the simulation grid. Data Event often includes hard data which

are assumed known and certain, as a result the candidate patches must
honor the conditioning hard data exactly. There is a likelihood that
we could not find from TI a sufficient number of replicates exactly
matching the hard data. What is even worse, no such patch from TI
could be found if the hard data within the data event are dense.
The second difficulty is the occurrence of verbatim copy, which
refers to portions of TI perfectly reproduced onto the simulation grid.
This leads to the reduction of variability between realizations. Since
one of the main goals of MPS (or say geostatistics) is the modeling
of spatial uncertainty, it is desired if we can improve the variability
between realizations to ameliorate the verbatim copy problem.
Both of the challenges above are partly due to finite size of TI (Caers
and Zhang, 2004; Mariethoz, 2018; Emery and Lantuéjoul, 2014), from
which a limited size of pattern database is constructed. As a result, it
is possible that no patches from the database could exactly match a
certain hard data pattern in the case of conditional simulation, leading
to poor hard data reproduction; in the case of unconditional simulation,
there is a possibility that just a few or perhaps even just one patch
from the database, with a given conditioning data event, is available for
selection, resulting in the occurrence of verbatim copy and a reduced
variability between realizations.
These observations lead us to a key question concerning the size
of TI: How to increase the size of TI if only one TI of finite size is
available? More specifically, how to generate an unlimited number
of new patches based on the current pattern database? To address

these questions, we propose a novel approach that we call Generative-
Patched-Simulation (GPSim), which is based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014a). With this method, we are
able to generate sufficient (in theory an infinite) number of new patches
based on the current pattern database to address the issues above. In
recent years, there have been many papers (Chan and Elsheikh, 2017;
Mosser et al., 2017; Laloy et al., 2018; Dupont et al., 2018; Song
et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2021) that use GANs for
the generation of realistic earth models. However, to our knowledge,
all these methods require a relatively large data set as input and have
difficulties in generating new data when there is a single image. Our
method is, by design, geared towards such scenarios, which, in our
experience, are very common in realistic settings. Furthermore, our
paper is different from other work as it solves other problems which
are notorious in patch-based simulations: (i) lack of patches to match
point data patterns exactly and (ii) the occurrence of verbatim copy.
Finally, these methods, to our knowledge, are mainly focused on using
GAN and its variants to replace MPS to generate geological realizations.
Our work is focused on using GAN to improve patch-based algorithms.
The paper is structured as follows. A literature review is conducted
in Section 2. In Section 3 we present an overview of GPSim that is
developed to improve Patch-based simulations. Experimental results
are demonstrated in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize the
paper.
2. Literature review
2.1. Using GAN to generate geological realizations
GAN is a class of deep neural network architectures consisting of
two competing nets trained simultaneously by an adversarial process.
Given a training dataset, it learns to create new data such that both
of new and original data come from the same distribution. The idea of
using GAN and its variants to generate geological models is not new.
Chan and Elsheikh (2017), Mosser et al. (2017), Laloy et al. (2018),
Dupont et al. (2018), Song et al. (2021), Chen et al. (2022), Pan et al.
(2021) try to generate realistic geological models by substituting GAN
for MPS. They all require a sufficient number of training images as
input to the Discriminator.
Unlike the above papers that generate realistic geological models by
substituting GAN for MPS, we take another direction and propose a new
approach that combines the ability of GAN to model a distribution of
patches and the ability of MPS to generate realizations with one single
TI. Our proposed method is mainly focused on using GAN to improve
performance of Patch-based algorithms which have two notorious chal-
lenges: (a) conditioning to point data; (b) the occurrence of verbatim
copy.
2.2. Generating new patterns
Generating new patches used in patch-based simulation is always
desirable due to finite size of TI. Recently, Rezaee et al. (2015) en-
riches the pattern database by generating many independent realiza-
tions from which more patches can be extracted. These realizations
are obtained by passing the original training image to a patch-based
multiple-point simulator. Our paper and Rezaee et al. (2015) address
the same problem of improving patch-based algorithms by enriching
pattern database. The main difference is as follows:
– the way of generating new patches
is
different. As
stated
in Jetchev et al. (2016), patch-based simulations do not ‘‘learn’’
any models of the textures of interest but just reorder the input
TI using local similarity. Therefore, it is argued that Rezaee
et al. (2015) does not ‘‘learn’’ new patches but generate patches
from reordered TI. In our paper, new patches are generated by
using GAN, which has the well-known capability of learning a
distribution of natural images.
It is noteworthy that we provide an alternative way to enrich the
pattern database. There is no conflict between our method and any
other way of generating new patches, which means that a combination
of these methods can be used to generate more diverse patterns and
further improve the performance of patch-based simulation.
3. Methodology
3.1. Construct pattern database
We denote by 𝐭𝐢 a training image consisting of 𝑏 pixels which are
𝛽-dimensional feature vectors,
𝐭𝐢 ∈ R𝑉
𝑉 = 𝑏𝛽
(3.1)
in which 𝛽 = 1 for a grayscale training image or 𝛽 = 3 for an RGB
training image. We then scan the training image 𝐭𝐢 with a template of
size 𝜔 to extract a list of patches (multi-point vectors), denoted as data
events P = {𝐩1, … , 𝐩𝑡
}, where 𝑡, the number of patches extracted from
𝐭𝐢, can be represented as follows,
𝑡 = (
√
𝑏 + 𝜔 − 1)2
(3.2)
These patches can be used as training dataset to train our GAN model
to generate new patches that resemble patches from the dataset.
3.2. Enrich pattern database
The problem can be stated as follows: Given a pattern database P
consisting of 𝑡 patches which come from the same distribution 𝐏𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎,
we would like to generate new patches coming from a probability
distribution 𝐏𝐺 which is as close as possible to 𝐏𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 To achieve this, we
will follow an approach called GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014b) for the
generation of such new patches. GAN consists of two competing neu-
ral networks trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. These
two nets, called the Generator and the Discriminator, are essentially
differential functions. We first introduce the Generator, which can be
formulated as follows,
̃𝐩 = 𝐺(𝐳; 𝜽𝒈)
(3.3)
where we denote by G the Generator, which takes a random vector
𝐳 ∈ R𝑛𝑧 as input and outputs a high-dimensional vector, specifically
a synthetic patch ̃𝐩 ∈ R𝑛𝑝 in our case. Note that 𝑛𝑧 ≪ 𝑛𝑝 and the
random vector 𝐳 is assumed to come from a prior distribution 𝐏𝐳 (e.g. a
uniform distribution or a Gaussian distribution). Given a fixed prior
distribution 𝐏𝐳, the weights of the generator G, denoted by 𝜃𝑔 are the
sole determinant for the shape of the distribution 𝐏𝐆. The goal of G is
to update 𝜃𝑔 so that 𝐏𝐆 is as close as possible to the target distribution
𝐏𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎, which can be formulated as follows,
minimize
𝜽𝒈
DIV(𝐏𝐆, 𝐏𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)
(3.4)
where DIV indicates a function called divergence that measures the
similarity between two probability distributions 𝐏𝐆 and 𝐏𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎.
To compute the divergence between these two distribution, the
other component of GAN called the Discriminator will be introduced
below,
𝑦 = 𝐷(𝐩; 𝜽𝒅)
(3.5)
where we denote the discriminator by D, which takes a patch 𝐩 as
input and outputs a scalar 𝑦. Larger output value 𝑦 means a higher
probability that an input patch 𝐩 comes from the true distribution of
training patches. More specifically, the parameters 𝜽𝒅 will be updated
to assign high values to the patches coming from the pattern database
and low values to the patches generated from the generator G. This
boils down to a binary classification problem and can be formulated as
follows,
maximize
𝜽𝒅
E𝐩∼𝐏𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎[log 𝐷(𝐩; 𝜃𝑑)] + E𝐩∼𝐏𝐆[log(1 − 𝐷(𝐩; 𝜃𝑑))]
(3.6)

X. Tan and E. Haber
Practically, we do not know how to compute explicitly the two distribu-
tions but we know how to generate samples from them, therefore (3.6)
can be reformulated as,
maximize

𝑖=1
log 𝐷(𝐩𝑖; 𝜃𝑑) + 1
𝑚
𝑚
∑
𝑖=1
log(1 − 𝐷(̃𝐩𝑖; 𝜃𝑑))
(3.7)
whose maximum objective value is related to Jensen–Shannon di-
vergence (Goodfellow et al., 2014b). By combining (3.4) with (3.7),
the problem of enriching pattern database boils down to a minmax
optimization problem,

log(1 − 𝐷(𝐺(𝐳𝐢; 𝜃𝑔); 𝜃𝑑))
(3.8)
which, in practise, can be iteratively solved in two successive steps:
(1) fix 𝜃𝑔 and update 𝜃𝑑 to maximize (3.7); (2) fix 𝜃𝑑 and update 𝜃𝑔
to minimize (3.4). As a result, the optimum 𝜃𝑔 can be used in (3.3)
to generate new patches, denoted as ̃P = {̃𝐩1, … , ̃𝐩𝑠
}, where 𝑠 is the
number of new patches generated.
3.3. Simulation with patterns
By combining these two groups of patches P and ̃P, a new pattern
database Q is created and can be used to generate realizations. Q can be
considered to come from a larger and pattern-richer ‘‘training image’’.
The simulation, in general, follows a typical patch-based approach,
except that our patches not only come from the original TI, but also
from the Generator. A typical patch-based approach can be summarized
as follows,
– The input to this simulation process consists of an empty grid (SG)
whose nodes are denoted as 𝐮, an enriched pattern database Q,
and, if available, a set of hard data which are assigned to their
nearest grid nodes in the SG.
– The path is defined along the rest of nodes in the SG. There are
two common simulation paths, one is random and the other is
unilateral. Either one of them can be employed.
– For each node 𝐮 of the simulation grid along the path, a pattern
centered on 𝐮, denoted as 𝐁(𝐮), is extracted using a fixed template
that is the same size as patches in Q. This pattern 𝐁(𝐮), termed
data event, consists of previously simulated values and/or any
hard data in the neighborhood of the node 𝐮.
– We calculate a distance (mismatch) between the data event 𝐵(𝐮)
and the patch 𝐪𝑖 in Q,
min
𝑖
𝑑(𝐵(𝐮), 𝐪𝑖)
.
(3.9)
once the most similar patches in Q are found, we randomly select
one of them and paste it into the simulation grid to replace the
current data event.
– A realization 𝐲 is constructed by proceeding to next node until all
nodes of the grid have been simulated.
There are several things worth noting in the above summary:
– the pattern recognition literature (Ashby and Ennis, 2007) pro-
vides many different distance functions, which should be selected
properly according to the property of our variables. A simple ex-
ample of a distance function that often works well for continuous
variables is the Euclidean distance, expressed as,
𝑑(𝐵(𝐮), 𝐪𝑖) = 1
𝜌
𝜌
∑
𝑗=1
𝜔𝑗 ‖‖‖𝐁𝑗 − 𝐪𝑖𝑗‖‖‖
2
(3.10)
where 𝐁 is abbreviated from 𝐵(𝐮); 𝜌 is the total number of
nodes in the data event; 𝜔𝑗 is the weight associated with the 𝑗𝑡ℎ
node. A large weight will be assigned if the node is hard data.
Fig. 1. Training Image.
For categorical variables, a simple measure of similarity can be
represented as,
𝑑(𝐁, 𝐪𝑖) = 1
𝜌
𝜌
∑
𝑗=1
𝜔𝑗 ‖‖‖𝐁𝑗 − 𝐪𝑖𝑗‖‖‖
0
(3.11)
which indicates the percentage of ill-matched nodes.
– Instead of comparing 𝐁(𝐮) with every patch 𝐪𝑖 in Q, we can first
classify patches of Q into a certain number of categories based
on a similarity criterion. Each class is then represented by the
average of all its patterns, namely a prototype. As a result, we
only need to compare 𝐁(𝐮) with every prototype.
– there are various implementation methods developed within
patch-based approaches. The emphasis in the paper is not on
describing all implementation methods. It is on how to improve
the performance of those existing methods using GAN. For a detail
review of patch-based algorithms see, e.g. Hu and Chugunova
(2008), Mariethoz and Caers (2014), Mariethoz and Lefebvre
(2014), and references therein.
4. Experiments
4.1. The dataset
We start with a two-dimensional binary training image of size
101 × 101 (Strebelle, 2002) shown in Fig. 1. The yellow color stands
for the high permeability channels, and the blue color stands for the
low permeability background. We then scan the training image with
a template of size 21 to extract 6561 patches of size 21 × 21. These
patches will be used as training dataset to train our GAN model to
generate new patches. Some of these patches are shown in Fig. 2(a).
4.2. Generate new patches
Our GAN model consists of two neural networks, called the Gener-
ator and the Discriminator, respectively. The architecture of our GAN
model generally follows Radford et al. (2015).
– The Discriminator consists of 3 blocks followed by a fully con-
nected layer (FCL). Each block includes a convolution layer (CL)
and a leaky ReLU layer. Batch normalization (BN) is used on
each CL except the first block. The Discriminator has a Binary
Cross-Entropy Loss function on the last (fully-connected) layer.
The architecture of the Discriminator is shown in Table 1.

– The Generator starts with a FCL followed by 3 blocks. Each block
includes a transposed convolution layer (TCL) and a ReLU layer.
BN is used on each TCL except the last block. A tanh activation
function is applied to the ReLU layer of the last block. The
architecture of the Generator is shown in Table 2.
We trained our models using the Adam optimizer with a batch size
of 32 patches on a cluster server with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 376 E5-
2670 v3 for 500 epochs. As suggested in Radford et al. (2015), the
learning rate is set to 0.0002, and the first moment is set to 0.5. The
time needed for training is a fixed cost (roughly 23 min), regardless of
the number of patches generated. Once trained, the Generator can then
be used to generate new patches, some of which are shown in Fig. 2(b).
The trained generator takes approximately 10 s to generate 3000 new
patches of size 21 × 21.
Before using these new patches to generate stochastic realizations,
we need to verify that both of new and original patches come from the
same probability distribution. Visually, the new and original patches
have the similar channelized structures. Fig. 2 shows that the patterns
do not differ significantly between original and new patches.
Quantitatively, we assume the original patches come from a distri-
bution 𝐹1 and the new patches from a distribution 𝐹2. Both of the two
distributions are unspecified. Our goal is to test the null hypothesis
𝐻0 ∶ 𝐹1 = 𝐹2
(4.12)
versus the alternative 𝐹1 ≠ 𝐹2. Székely et al. (2004) uses 𝜖-statistic
(Székely, 2003) to test equality of multivariate distributions. The 𝜖-
statistic (Székely, 2003) is
𝜖𝑛1,𝑛2 =
𝑛1𝑛2
𝑛1 + 𝑛2

where 𝑛1 and 𝑛2 are the number of original patches 𝐩 and new patches
̃𝐩 respectively. In our case, the 𝜖-statistic is 14.1637. Then the permu-
tation test approach (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994) is used to derive the

we conduct 2000 resamples to conduct an approximate permutation
test. The sampling distribution of the 𝜖-statistic is shown in 3. The
𝑃 -value, represented by the blue area to the right of the vertical red
line, is 0.3965, which is large enough (> 0.05) to fail to reject the null
hypothesis.
4.3. Hard data conditioning
In this subsection, a comparison with patch-based methods in terms
of data conditioning capabilities is conducted. Fig. 4 shows some
randomly generated hard data patterns of size 21 × 21. Given these
data patterns, we cannot find from TI any patches that exactly matches
these data patterns. To perfectly match these data patterns, we generate
new patches using the trained Generator and obtain a certain number
of eligible patches using the acceptance-rejection method. This demon-
strates that there is a possibility that we cannot find eligible patches
from TI, however, a number of patches that exactly match the hard
data pattern can be obtained by the trained Generator
The first column in Fig. 4 shows one type of hard data pattern. The
second column shows the most similar patch from TI, which is unable
to exactly match this hard data pattern, leading to poor hard data
reproduction. The percentage of ill-matched nodes is 0.2. Our trained
Generator can be used to generate patches that honor the hard data
exactly. The last 3 columns show 3 of these patches.
4.4. The problem of verbatim copy
In this section, realizations generated from the enriched pattern
database will be compared with the ones obtained from the origi-
nal pattern database. The comparison is conducted in terms of the
occurrence of verbatim copy, which can be quantified with coher-
ence maps. Fig. 5(a) shows the training image of size 101 × 101
and linearly increasing indices of the location of each node in the
training image. Coherence maps can then be constructed by recording
these indices during the simulation. Fig. 5(b) shows one realization of
301 × 301 and its coherence map generated from the original pattern
database. Similarly, Fig. 5(c) shows one realization of 301 × 301
and its coherence map obtained from both the original and GAN-
generated patches, in which the white pixels indicate these nodes of
the realization come from new patches and not from the training image,
limiting the occurrence of verbatim copy.
The occurrence of verbatim copy is partly due to finite size of TI,
from which a limited number of patterns are extracted. Generating new
patches is equivalent to increasing the size of TI. The greater the num-
ber of GAN-generated patches are used, the less chance portions of the
TI are exactly copied into the simulated realizations. It is noteworthy
that the effect of verbatim copy could be completely avoided under
some conditions: (a) discarding all patterns from the original TI and
only use GAN-generated patches during the simulation; (b) The GAN-
generated patches should be different from any part of the TI, which
can be quantified by a distance (or dissimilarity) function. How to
properly choose distance functions to meet the condition (b) deserves
further study.
4.5. Quantitative assessment
In this section, we will quantitatively compare realizations created
from the enriched patch database with the ones produced from the
original patches. This comparison is conducted on the basis of two
criteria (Tan et al., 2014): (i) the variability between generated real-
izations, also called a diversity score representing a model of spatial
uncertainty and (ii) the variability within the realizations, also termed
an inconsistency score depicting how well the statistics of the training
image are reproduced. Realizations generated by a better patch-based
algorithm could be deemed to have a larger space of uncertainty and
a better pattern reproduction. To quantitatively study these two types
of variabilities, we use the distance function, as defined in Tan et al.
(2014) to provide a measure of similarity between any two images
𝑑(𝑙𝑖, 𝑙𝑗) = 𝐉𝐒(𝐌𝐏𝐇(𝑙𝑖), 𝐌𝐏𝐇(𝑙𝑗))
(4.14)
where 𝐌𝐏𝐇(𝑙) represents the multiple-point histograms (Deutsch and
Gringarten, 2000) of patches extracted from the image 𝑙 with the
template size of 4 × 4; 𝐉𝐒 stands for the Jensen–Shannon diver-
gence (Endres and Schindelin, 2003) measuring the similarity between
two MPHs. Therefore, the variability between any two of 𝑁 realizations
can be represented as,
𝐷𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛(𝑙1, … , 𝑙𝑁) =
1
𝑁(𝑁 − 1) 𝛴𝑁
𝑖=1𝛴𝑁
𝑗=1𝑑(𝑙𝑖, 𝑙𝑗)
(4.15)
Similarly, the variability between the 𝑁 realizations and the training
image 𝐭𝐢 can be computed as,
𝐷𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛(𝑙1, … , 𝑙𝑁, 𝐭𝐢) = 1
𝑁 𝛴𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑑(𝑙𝑖, 𝑡)
(4.16)
Then, the ratio of the above two distances is used to rank the algo-
rithms,
𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜(𝑙1, … , 𝑙𝑁, 𝐭𝐢) = 𝐷𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛(𝑙1, … , 𝑙𝑁, )
𝐷𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛(𝑙1, … , 𝑙𝑁, 𝐭𝐢)
(4.17)
We start with the training image shown in Fig. 6(a) and generate two
sets of 50 realizations of size 101 × 101: one from the enriched pattern
database denoted as X = {𝐱1, … , 𝐱50
}, and the other from the original
pattern database denoted as Y = {𝐲1, … , 𝐲50
}. One realization with
each method is shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(c).
Then the two types of variabilities can be calculated based on (4.15)
and (4.16), which are summarized in Table 3.
The first row of the Table 3 shows that our proposed method is
better in terms of the spatial uncertainty (by representing a larger
distance of 1 compared to 0.9058 for the original method). This result
is consistent with the expectation that enriched pattern database is able
to suppress the occurrence of verbatim copy (see Section 4.4), which is
inversely proportional to the variability between realizations.
In the second row, the original approach represents a slightly
shorter distance of 0.9823 compared to 1 for the proposed one, in-
dicating that both of their performance in reproducing statistics of
the training image is quite similar. This result is also consistent with
the expectation. A possible reason could be that both of new and
original patterns come from the same probability distribution (see
Section 4.2). Therefore, the performance of both two methods in
reproducing statistics of the training image is quite similar.

Fig. 7. two dimensional representation of realizations and TI using MDS.
The last row of the Table 3 shows that our proposed method per-
forms better than the original one with a quantitative rank of 1 ∶ 0.9221
(proposed method : original method). This result is as expected on the
basis of the above two rows.
Having computing the ratio of these two counteracting distances
used to compare our proposed method and the original one, we use
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) to visualize these distances.
Fig. 7 shows the two most important coordinates of our realizations
and training image. Even though 2D projection of our data may result
in loss of information, it is still a good way of visualizing the relative
positions of them. It can be seen from Fig. 7: (1) a wider spread of (blue)
points for our proposed method, indicating a larger space of uncertainty
and (2) the performance of both methods in reproducing statistics of the
TI (black dot) is visually no obvious difference. These two observations
are consistent with the results shown in Table 3
5. Discussion and conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve patch-based
algorithms by addressing the problem of conditioning to point data
and the occurrence of verbatim copy. The results show that we can
generate new patches which have the same probability distribution as
the original patches. We also show that given some hard data patterns
no such patch from TI can be found but a number of matching patches
can be found with our method. Lastly, we also show that our method
can ameliorate the verbatim copy problem by generating new patches.
The ultimate goal is always to generate ‘‘good models’’. One must
acknowledge that ‘‘good models’’ cannot be dealt with in a wholly
objective way. We will need to choose some measure of ‘‘good models’’
and such selection is often problem-specific and can be questioned. In
our paper the measure of ‘‘good models’’ is based on two questions be-
low: (a) whether the proposed method, compared to its corresponding
patch-based algorithm, has a higher point-data conditioning capability;
(b) whether the proposed approach is able to alleviate the effect of
verbatim copy in comparison with the original patch-based algorithm.
The experimental results indicate that models generated by our method
are better than its patch-based counterpart in terms of the two above
issues.
