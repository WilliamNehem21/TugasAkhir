A separator and multiphase ﬂow meters are considered the most accurate tools used to measure the surface oil ﬂow rates. However, these tools are expensive and time
consuming. Thus, this study aims to develop a correlation for accurate and quick evaluation of well surface ﬂow rates and consequently the well inﬂow performance
relationship. In order to achieve the abovementioned aim, this study uses artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) for ﬂow rates prediction particularly in artiﬁcial lifted wells
especially in the absence of wellhead pressure data. The ANN model is developed and validated by utilizing 350 data points collected from numerous ﬁelds located in
Nile Delta and Western Desert of Egypt with inputs include; wellhead temperature, gas liquid ratio, water cut, surface and bottomhole temperatures, water cut, surface
production rates, tubing cross section area, and well depth. The results of this study show that, the collected data are distributed as follows; 60% for training, 30% for
testing and 10% for the validation processes with R2 of 0.96 and mean square error (MSE) of 0.02. A comparison study is implemented between the new ANN
correlation and other published correlations (Gilbert, Ros and Achong correlations) to show the robustness of the developed correlation. The results show that the
developed correlation able to predict oil ﬂow rates accurately with the lowest mean square error.
1. Introduction
The most widely used correlations for wellhead rate estimation are
presented by Gilbert (1954); Ros (1960); Achong (1961); and Al-Attar
and Abdul-Majeed, (1988) for multiphase ﬂow across wellhead choke
and critical ﬂow. Gilbert's correlation is valid only when the upstream
pressure greater than downstream pressure by at least 70%. The corre-
lation is given by:
Pwh ¼ CRmQ
Sn
(1)
where;
Pwh is the wellhead pressure (psia), S is the choke size (1/64 inch), R
is the gas–liquid ratio (SCF/STB), and, Q is the liquid critical-ﬂow rate
(STBD).
C, m and C ¼ n are the coefﬁcients calculated based on sufﬁcient data
available for speciﬁc reservoir. A ¼ 0.1, B ¼ 1.89 and C ¼ 0.546.
Following Ros [2] and Achong [3] modiﬁed the coefﬁcient of Gilbert's
correlation as follows;
Pwh ¼ CRmQ
Sn
(2)
where C ¼ 0.05, m ¼ 1.88 and n ¼ 0.65.
Al-Attar and Abdul-Majeed, (1988) collected wellhead data from
around 210 wells in Iraq. The data include gas-liquid ratio, upstream/-
downstream pressures, chock size, production rates and API oil gravity.
The author performed a sensitivity analysis to select the best correlation
for rate estimation. The results show that the Gilbert's correlation yielded
a relative accurate prediction of the wellhead rates while Achong's cor-
relation underestimated the production rates. Economides et al. (2011)
mentioned that the theory of multi-phase ﬂuid ﬂow through choke is not
clearly described. Ghareeb and Shedid (2007) proposed a study to
develop a new correlation for artiﬁcially lifted wells to predict surface
ﬂow rates using the least square method technique. While, Rasoul (2012)
proposed mathematical correlation used to calculate wellbore ﬂow
temperature. Khorzoughi (2013) presented a multiphase ﬂow chock
correlation using non-linear optimization technique and Monto Carlo
simulation. Seidi and Sayahi (2015) combined a genetic algorithm with
non-linear regression analysis to predict the sub-critical ﬂow through
wellhead chokes.
Although the pressure measured at the wellhead is considered one of
the main parameter that used to predict the wellhead ﬂow rates in several
choke correlations, however, this parameter disappears for artiﬁcially
lifted wells. This due to the absence of critical ﬂow condition and choke is
either disconnected or fully opened during the oil lifting process.
Therefore, the main aim of this study is to develop a correlation that
heavily based on the wellhead temperature (Th) to eliminate the effect of
unavailable wellhead pressure data. The proposed correlation in this
study is function of gas-oil ratio (GOR), surface temperature (Ts), water

Around 350 data points are collected from numerous wells drilled in
Egypt. The wells are artiﬁcially lifted using gas lift or sucker rod pumps.
The artiﬁcial neural network technique (ANN) is used in this study to
achieve that goal.
2. Artiﬁcial neural network
The artiﬁcial neural network is widely used in petroleum engineering
applications includes diagnosis of the drill bit (Arehart 1989), well test
interpretation (Al-Kaabi et al., 1993), spatial property mapping (Veez-
hinathan et al., 1992), wireline log analysis (Rogers et al., 1992), and
identiﬁcation of well productivity (Garcia et al., 1992). The neural
network can be trained by supervised and unsupervised training algo-
rithms. Supervised learning algorithm as back propagation (Rumelhart
et al., 1986 and Lippmann 1987) requires training data with the desired
outcome for each pattern of input. Unsupervised learning algorithm
(Hopﬁeld 1992) is suitable for classiﬁcation problems. A simple ﬂow
chart is presented to describe how the supervised learning algorithm
works (see Fig. 1). The neural net consists of three layers include input,
hidden and output layers. The number of hidden layers should be a
positive number including zero. If none of the hidden layer used in the
network, the network calls simple perceptron that suitable for classiﬁ-
cation linearly patterns (Morgan et al., 1989). If the network contains one
or more hidden layers, it calls multiple perceptron and can be used for
nonlinear separable patterns. Each layer in the neural net contains pro-
cessing elements called neurons. Each neuron in the input layer trans-
ports into the network the value of one independent variable, and no
mathematical operations are performed. Entirely, neurons are connected
together with the hidden layer by a simple weighted link. Each link has a
weight either positive or negative. Each of the output layer neurons
receive signals from hidden neurons and provides a similar weighted
response (see Fig. 2).
The tan sigmoid function is the most commonly used in the neural
network to constrain the output values to a range of 0 and 1 (Mahmoodi
et al., 2016). The function is expressed by:
f ðsÞ ¼
1
1 þ e�s
(4)
where S is expressed as:
S ¼
X
n
i¼0
xiwi
(5)
where n is the dimensions of the input vector X (x0, x1, …, xn), and W
(w0,w1, …,wn) is corresponding weight vector. Note that w0 is the
weight for the bias input x0 (which is equal to one).
There are two process in the neural net, forward and backward
propagation steps. In the forward step, signals are sent through neurons
to calculate the output targets while backward step is used to calculate
the error vector between actual and target values. The error value at the
output neurons for a training pattern can be deﬁned by a quadratic cost
function:
Ep ¼ 1
2
X
n2
1
�
xp � yp
�2
(6)
where E is the error vector for the training pattern p.
In this study, the back propagation algorithm is used. This is due to
the strength shown by the algorithm in learning and generalizing large
variety of relationship embedded in the training data set. The algorithm
does not require prior mathematical knowledge that maps the input
patterns to the output patterns. In addition, the ﬂexibility of the back
propagation algorithm in choosing number of hidden layers, in-
terconnections, neurons, the learning and momentum constants is wide.
3. Application of ANN in predicting surface production rates
The previous researches regarding the application of the ANN in
predicting the wellhead surface rates are presented in Table 1. The
conclusion is the literature does not provide a single physical equation
that can be used to predict surface oil rates for speciﬁc ﬁelds using ANN.
Therefore, this study aims to clarify the black box concept of the ANN and
to present a new correlation to combine wellbore and ﬂuid parameters to
predict surface oil rates for wells located in Egypt.
Zhong-bao et al., (2011) proposed a neural network model that based
on the back propagation learning algorithm to predict surface oil rates.
The neural network consists of one hidden layer and 10 neurons. The
input neurons include the wells number, the coordinates of the wells, the
cumulative production, the derivative of cumulative production, the
shut-in time, the average distance to surrounding wells, average cumu-
lative production of surrounding wells, and the cumulative production
days. The output layer contains one neuron representing the cumulative
production at time tþ1. The results indicate that the model can predict
the ﬂow rate for short term of ﬂow.
Elmabrouk et al. (2010) established a neural network model to pre-
dict the reservoir average pressure without shut the wells. Elshaﬁei et al.
(2011) presented a neural network model to predict the crude oil pro-
duction rates from multi stage oil separators. The model is based on in-
puts that include initial, ﬁnal temperature for each stage and oil
composition.
4. Data processing
Around 350 measured points are collected from numerous ﬁelds in
Egypt include: Bakr, Meliha, Lotus, Aman, and Wadi El Sahl ﬁelds. The
data include; the gas-oil ratio (GOR), water cut (WC), surface production
rate (Q), bottom hole temperature (Tbh), tubing cross section area (A),
and well depth (H). In advance, the data are pre-processed and its quality
has been tested to avoid peculiar answers. In order to improve the per-
formance of the neural network model, the dataset is subdivided
randomly into 60% for training, 30% for testing, while validation dataset
is 10% of the total collected data. Table 2 shows the statistical analysis of
the input data. Numerous scenarios are performed to test the effect of
each input parameter on the outputs. Therefore, the input parameters are
removed one by one while others are kept constant. The surface

temperature is the ﬁrst then water cut, gas liquid ratio, bottom-hole
temperature followed by depth and tubing size. Table 3 summarizes
the sensitivity runs with mean square error (MSE) and R2 value to assess
the accuracy of each run. The results show that surface measured tem-
perature has a signiﬁcant effect on the predicted surface ﬂow rates.
The optimum architecture of the neural network is achieved by trial
and error approach, in which the optimum number of the hidden layer is
one with 10 neurons. The neurons in the hidden and output layers are
activated with the logistic function and Levenberg Marquardt (More,
1978) algorithm that provides the back error propagation with the lowest
mean square-error (MSE).

5. Results and discussion
A total of 350 data points are used in the neural net, in which 60% for
training, 30% for testing, while validation dataset is 10%. Results in this
study show a reasonable match between the predicted and measured data
as shown in Fig. 3. This exceptional match based on the back propagation
learning algorithm that used in the ANN model. The back propagation
learning algorithm (BP) is selected in this study with sigmoid function
based on the comparison performed against scaled conjugate gradient
(SCG) and one-step secant (OSS) algorithms. A 500 epches (iterations) is
used to get the minimum error which conﬁrms the effectiveness of
convergence technique used with the ANN model. This section will test
the robustness of the designed neural network. Fig. 3 shows a comparison
between the network surface oil rates versus measured oil rates at the
wellhead during the training and testing processes. The results show that
the network gives R2 of 0.963 with MSE ¼ 0.02 for the training. It can be
seen that from Fig. 3 that the results are in a close agreement with the
actual ﬂow rates. In addition, same procedure is followed for testing
process, the results show that the optimum R2 of 0.94 found with using
10 neurons with MSE ¼ 0.0325.
It can be seen form these encouraging outcomes in this study, a
mathematical correlation can be extracted to calculate the surface oil
rates at wellheads as a function of wellbore parameters that has been
mentioned before. The correlation is based on weights and biases and
their values are given in Table 4.
The extracted correlation is given as:

where Qon is the normalized surface oil ﬂow rate, (w2, i) is the weight
vector connect the hidden layer with output layer. (w1, j) is the weight
vector connect the input and the hidden layer, j is the neuron number, b1
is the biases vector for the input layer, and b2 for the output layer, for-
mation depth (H), water cut (WC), surface temperature (Ts), bottom hole
temperature (Tbh), tubing cross section area (A) and, gas liquid ratio
(GLR).
The extracted Qo equation can be attained by de-normalizing Qo as
follows:
Qo ¼ 1203 � Qon þ 80

5.1. Validation of the ANN model
To validate the designed artiﬁcial neural network, a new dataset is
collected from west Bakr reservoir in Egypt. This dataset never used
during the training and testing of the ANN model. The generated corre-
lation in this study (see Eqs (8) and (9)) used to predict the oil rates at the
wellhead, and then the results are compared with published correlations
include Gilbert, Ros, and Achonhg correlations. Fig. 4 shows the recorded
wellhead head temperature and GLR versus the well depth for the tested
wells. As it can be seen from Fig. 4 that the wells exhibit a severe ﬂuc-
tuation in the measured temperature and GLR. The existing ﬂuctuation
scheme complicates the prediction of the oil rates at surface using
traditional correlations specially with the disappearing of recorded daily
well events.
The results show that this study developed a new correlation able to
predict the oil ﬂow rate with R2 of 0.93 as shown in Fig. 5. In addition,
Fig. 6 shows a comparison between actual and predicted ﬂow rates for
the dataset used in validation operation. A good match is achieved at
different depths. Statistically, the ANN model presented in this study is
reliable based on the calculated MSE between actual and predicted oil
rates. Base on the results, ANN correlation gives the lowest MSE with
0.02 compared to Gilbert, Ros, and Achonhg correlations as shown in
Fig. 7.
6. Conclusion
1. The results of this study shows a robustness of the presented ANN
model used to predict the oil ﬂow rates for artiﬁcially lifted wells
based on recorded surface temperature in the absence of wellhead
pressures with accuracy exceeds 96% compared to well-known cor-
relations (Gilbert, Ros, and Achong correlation with MSE ¼ 0.02.
2. Based on the outcome of this study, a new correlation is extracted
based on proposed ANN that can be used for wells located in Nile
Delta and Western Desert parts of Egypt.
3. The ANN model in this study use back propagation learning algorithm
which provides the optimum results in terms of lowest MSE and
highest R2 values.
4. A comparison is carried out in this study, shows that the well-known
correlations have deﬁciencies in predicting oil rates at the wellhead,
those correlations are the most widely used in predicting oil rates.
Therefore, this study anticipated a solution for companies in Egypt to
