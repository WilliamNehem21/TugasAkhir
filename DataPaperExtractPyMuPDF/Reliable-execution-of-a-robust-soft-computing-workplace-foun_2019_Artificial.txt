Tendency towards computer simulations linked to agricultural machinery has enormously increased in recent
years. In this regard, the principal contribution of current research was to develop soft computing simulation
workplaces for performance prognostication of tractor-implement system in plowing process. Two neuro-
fuzzy strategies based on multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (MANFIS) scenario and the MANFIS
coupled with multiple nonlinear equations (MNE) scenario were executed in the workplace. Additionally, neural
strategy based on artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) scenario was also fulﬁlled in the workplace. Operational vari-
ables of plowing depth (10–30 cm), forward speed (2–6 km/h), and tillage implement type (moldboard, disk, and
chisel plow) were considered as the workplace inputs and ten performance parameters were taken as the work-
place outputs. According to the obtained prognostication accuracy, simulation time, and user-friendly conﬁgura-
tion of three scenarios (ANN, MANFIS, and MANFIS+MNE), the MANFIS+MNE was recognized as the prominent
simulation scenario. According to the MANFIS+MNE workplace results, for each tillage implement, the com-
pound effect of plowing depth and forward speed on some performance parameters (required draft force of im-
plement, tractor rear wheel slip, fuel consumption per working hour, speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption,
tractor drawbar power, energy requirement for tillage implement, overall energy efﬁciency, and tractor tractive
efﬁciency) was nonlinearly synergetic. However, it was nonlinearly antagonism in case of speciﬁc draft force and
fuel consumption per tilled area. The MANFIS+MNE workplace simulation results provide opportunity for tech-
nical farmer associations involved in the decision-making of agricultural machinery management in order to gain
exhaustive fundamental insights into the compound effect of plowing depth and forward speed on performance
of tractor-implement systems in plowing process.

1. Introduction
Studying performance of tractor-implement system in plowing pro-
cess could be advantageous to gain accurate view about how the system
performs in the process. The performance realization provides the pos-
sibility of upgrading the system mechanisms without performing re-
fabrication process. Moreover, the obtained view would be assistive to
devise proper management strategies for inventory of tillage systems
and thereby, it could remarkably reduce total cost of crop production
systems, repair, maintenance, fuel, ownership, and other involved oper-
ational issues. On the other hand, performance results of tractor-
implement system in plowing process could be applied to develop ex-
haustive information bank for multivariate analysis through partitioned
graphical descriptions.
In this realm, modeling strategies help to comprehend performance
of tractor-implement system in plowing process on the basis of exten-
sion of discrete operational results towards integral interpretable re-
sults. The discrete operational data are gained by performing limited
experiments. The integral interpretable results provide an opportunity
to ascertain general trend of variations of dependent performance pa-
rameters when independent operational variables change. These deter-
minations lead to presentation of physical meaning of phenomena
occurring in the process and showing what happens along different
working states of the process. Therefore, it can be indicated that a

well-developed model is able to guarantee presentation of exhaustive
perception of the phenomena in a wide ranges of conditions. Hence, a
well-developed model is a supportive tool for researchers, engineers,
and managements in solving problems associated with performance
of tractor-implement system and thereby, optimization of the mecha-
nized plowing process can be performed without conducting expensive
and time-consuming ﬁeld tests.
The modeling strategies frequently employed by the researchers can
be classiﬁed into two main branches of mathematical and soft comput-
ing models. In general term, mathematical models (SLR, MLR, one vari-
able nonlinear regression, MNR, dimensional analysis, etc.) are linear or
nonlinear equations with speciﬁc constants and coefﬁcients. However,
soft computing models (ANN, FIS, ANFIS, support vector machines,
etc.) are computer simulation workplaces which are originally worked
through predetermined consecutive calculations.
Among soft computing models, the ANN performs regarding intelli-
gent computational scenario with self-learning algorithm. The FIS
works on the basis of predetermined linguistic transparency in form of
IF and THEN rules. The ANFIS includes advantages of both the ANN
and the FIS. Therefore, the ANN and ANFIS soft computing scenarios
are generally known as intelligent powerful modeling tools for dynamic,
uncertain, and multidimensional and highly nonlinear interrelations,
especially when physical relationships between input and output data
are not fully understood.
The main body of this paper is organized in four parts. The ﬁrst part
is review and analysis of literature for relevant published attempts pre-
viously completed in domain of model development for prognostication
of performance parameters of tractor-implement system in plowing
process. In this part, existing deﬁcits of several sequential attempts doc-
umented by earlier researchers are discussed and ultimately, aims and
questions of the research are described. The second part is dedicated
to execute simulation workplaces based on intelligent soft computing
scenarios. The third part is devoted to extensively validate outstanding
simulation workplace. The forth part presents exhaustive perception
of performance parameters of tractor-implement system in plowing
process on the basis of remarkable results obtained from prominent
simulation workplace.
1.1. Review and analysis of literature
Modeling performance parameters of tractor-implement system in
plowing process have been of great interest to researchers over the
past ﬁve decades in stationery tests and ﬁeld operations. The stationery
tests have been commonly performed in indoor soil bin facility or as-
phalt test track with load car. Meanwhile, ﬁeld operations have been
generally accomplished utilizing tillage implements in farm conditions.
Table 1 presents tendency of the researchers to apply mathematical
models for prognostication of the performance parameters. As it can be
seen in the Table 1, the SLR, MLR, ASABE equations, MNR, one variable
nonlinear regression, and dimensional analysis methodologies have
been frequently employed by the researchers to model variations in
some performance parameters based on some input variables of
plowing depth, forward speed, static load, tractor engine speed, and im-
plement type in conditions of ﬁeld operations or stationery tests. For
each case, results of these attempts have led to ﬁt several equations to
desired performance parameters which are applicable for a speciﬁc con-
dition. Although some equations have been satisfactorily ﬁtted to actual
data, constants and coefﬁcients of the equations varied as tested condi-
tions changed. Moreover, inherent drawback of these parametric
models conﬁnes them to prognosticate one output variable. Therefore,
to prognosticate whole tractor performance parameters, there is a
need to develop several equations with different constants, coefﬁcients,
and assumptions. This fact prevents the widest applicability of accept-
able prognostications for set of input and output variables within tested
ranges. Hence, the researchers focused their efforts to apply another
methodology with taking multiple input and output variables into ac-
count. This scheme motivated the researchers to release user-friendly
software and programs with multiple objects. The software and pro-
grams are great outreach potential tools for prognostication of some
performance parameters on the basis of several input variables.
Table 2 summarizes details of the software and programs. According
to the information manifested in the Table 2, it can be pointed out
that the software and programs suffer from wide range applications
owing to dependency to equations deﬁned based on the mathematical
relationships documented in the ASABE standards or classical soil me-
chanics theory. Therefore, these software and programs, similar to
mathematical models, could be only applied for certain conditions of
stationery tests or ﬁeld operations.
Recent progressive advancements in applications of soft computing
models in engineering based simulation practices extend range of pos-
sibilities in prognostication of some performance parameters of
tractor-implement system in plowing process based on multiple opera-
tional input variables. In this context, much interest has been focused on
the ANN, FIS, and ANFIS soft computing scenarios by some researchers,
in case of ﬁeld operations and stationery tests. The overall descriptions
concerning these employments are briefed in Table 3. Reviewing the re-
sults of cited papers in the Table 3 demonstrated that these soft comput-
ing scenarios are adaptable computer simulation environments. It
means that model structure established based on these soft computing
scenarios is trained with inventory data sets and it can be possible to be

inent ability encourages the investigators to follow the previous re-
searches in order to complement the knowledge in this realm.
Careful inspection of available literature which are chronologically
reported in the Table 3 indicated that, although some partial attempts
have been accomplished by the investigators to apply soft computing
scenarios for individual or component prognostication of some perfor-
mance parameters of tractor-implement system in ﬁeld operations, de-
ﬁciency of an exhaustive attempt to simulate whole performance
parameters is tedious.

In a remarkable attempt, some performance parameters (fuel con-
sumption per working hour, fuel consumption per tilled area, speciﬁc
volumetric fuel consumption, tractor drawbar power, tractor tractive ef-
ﬁciency) in plowing process with moldboard implement were intelli-
gently simulated by means of the ANN scenario (Almaliki et al.,
2016b). The ANN simulation workplace was trained well in accordance
with input operational data sets of plowing depth and forward speed.
However, the effects of plowing depth and forward speed on required
draft force of the implement, tractor rear wheel slip, speciﬁc draft
force, energy requirement for tillage implement, and overall energy ef-
ﬁciency were not simulated in the research. Additionally, further inter-
pretations for presentation of clear physical perceptions of the effect of
the operational variables on the desired performance parameters have
not been expressed by the researchers. Hence, it is still indispensable
to take drastic efforts for extension of the ANN simulation workplace
and employment of another intelligent simulation workplace (ANFIS)
of soft computing scenario for exhaustive prognostication of whole per-
formance parameters of tractor-implement system in plowing process.
1.2. Hypotheses and problematic challenge of research
The ANFIS soft computing scenario includes unique properties inte-
grating advantages of the ANN and FIS soft computing scenarios. The FIS
provide a strong mechanism for knowledge representation when expert
knowledge is available. However, it does not possess the capabilities for
automated learning. The ANN do not possess knowledge representation
capability, but it has powerful mechanism of learning from sample data
when expert knowledge is limited. The ANFIS overcomes the limitations
of both soft computing scenarios of the ANN and FIS. It means that the
ANFIS offers particularly strong simulation workplace with identiﬁca-
tion techniques when relationship between input and output data is
not trivial. Therefore, it is understandable that the ANFIS is able to
build a fuzzy rule based on the structure of the FIS (IF and THEN) and
tune the parameters of the FIS membership functions from a given set
of input/output data by training itself, like the ANN. Hence, between
two intelligent soft computing scenarios of the ANN and ANFIS, it is an-
ticipated that the ANFIS better performs than the ANN in simulation

practices. This hypotheses was approved by the authors in their previ-
ous researches, especially in case of the component effect of nominal
and numeral variables on desired target (Shafaei et al., 2015; Shafaei
et al., 2018d; Shafaei et al., 2019b; Shafaei et al., 2019e). Accordingly,
it is desired to validate the hypotheses in case of simulation of the com-
ponent effect of plowing depth, forward speed, and tillage implement
type on whole performance parameters (required draft force of imple-
ment, tractor rear wheel slip, fuel consumption per working hour, spe-
ciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption, tractor drawbar power, energy
requirement for tillage implement, overall energy efﬁciency, tractor
tractive efﬁciency, speciﬁc draft force, and fuel consumption per tilled
area). To accomplish this, there is need to develop the ANFIS computer
simulation workplace with three input variables and ten output param-
eters. In this regard, a challenging problem exists in the ANFIS computer
simulation workplace, when the number of output parameters is more
than one. Practically, in the ANFIS computer simulation workplace, to
link several input and output data, deﬁnition of fuzzy rules based on
the structure of IF and THEN is very complex and impossible. Thus, to
avoid this problem, the overall ANFIS structure has been established
based on consideration of one output parameter in accordance with
several input variables.
Literature review concerning application of the ANFIS computer
simulation workplace for prognostication of several output parameters
indicated that the investigators completed desired simulations by
means of development of a simulation workplace including several
ANFIS sub-environments, each for one output parameter, based on the
same multiple input variables (Shafaei et al., 2016a; Shafaei et al.,
2018a; Shafaei et al., 2018c; Shafaei et al., 2019c). Although, this simu-
lation scenario obviated inherent drawback of structure of the ANFIS
computer simulation workplace for prognostication of several output
parameters, more simulation time required to develop several sub-
environments were reported by the investigators. Besides, user-
friendly conﬁguration of the simulation workplace was diminished
with development of several sub-environments.
1.3. New simulation scenario
According to aggregation of outcome results of some previous pub-
lished papers of the same authors (Shafaei et al., 2018a; Shafaei et al.,
2018c; Shafaei et al., 2018d; Shafaei et al., 2019c), it was found that mas-
ter performance parameters of tractor-implement system in plowing
process are required draft force of implement, tractor rear wheel slip,
and fuel consumption per working hour. Other seven slave performance
parameters (speciﬁc draft force, fuel consumption per tilled area, spe-
ciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption, tractor drawbar power, tractor trac-
tive efﬁciency, energy requirement for tillage implement, and overall
energy efﬁciency) can be mathematically obtained utilizing the three
master performance parameters. Hence, to achieve higher prognostica-
tion accuracy and user-friendly conﬁguration of the workplace as well
as lower simulation time, a new simulation scenario is presented in
this research for the ﬁrst time. The scenario is based on developing sim-
ulation workplace for stepwise prognostication of ten performance pa-
rameters with respect to three input variables of plowing depth,
forward speed, and tillage implement type. The simulation procedure
is performed in two main stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the MANFIS conﬁgu-
ration consisting of the ANFIS environments is developed to prognosti-
cate three master performance parameters. In the second stage, the
obtained simulation values of three master performance parameters

are employed for stepwise prognostication of the other seven slave per-
formance parameters. This task is performed by utilization of two MNE
conﬁgurations. Therefore, it can be deduced that new simulation sce-
nario is established based on development of the MANFIS coupled
with the MNE. However, efﬁciency of new simulation scenario
(MANFIS+MNE) is ascertainable in comparison with the two known
simulation scenarios (ANN and MANFIS).
1.4. Aims and questions of research
The systematic literature survey concludes that there is an inevitable
demand to obviate the aforementioned problematic challenge and in-
vestigate the hypothesis through development of robust soft computing
workplace operated based on the new introduced simulation scenario
(MANFIS+MNE) for exhaustive prognostication of whole performance
parameters (required draft force of implement, tractor rear wheel slip,
fuel consumption per working hour, speciﬁc draft force, fuel consump-
tion per tilled area, speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption, tractor draw-
bar power, tractor tractive efﬁciency, energy requirement for tillage
implement, and overall energy efﬁciency) of tractor-implement system
regarding three independent input variables of plowing depth, forward
speed, and tillage implement type. The novelty of this research can be
addressed not only to validate the new simulation scenario, but also to
follow to respond the main questions outlined below:
• Is efﬁciency of neuro-fuzzy strategy higher than neural strategy in
prognostication of desired output targets based on the compound ef-
fect of nominal and numeral input variables?
• Are prognostication accuracy and simulation time of the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace better rated than that of the ANN and
MANFIS simulation workplaces?
• Is user-friendly conﬁguration of MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace
simple enough to be considered as applicable neuro-fuzzy calculator?
• Do physical perceptions obtained from results of prominent simula-
tion workplace enrich state of the art in the domain of comprehending
behavior of the performance parameters?
2. Research methodology
2.1. Tillage site layout
Three experimental zones in an arable land of Bajgah Agricultural Re-
search Station of Shiraz University (29°32′ N 52°35′ E, North West of Shi-
raz city, Iran) were considered as tillage site. The site had clay loam soil
texture (35% sand, 30% silt, and 35% clay) and ﬂat topography. Each site
was partitioned into 27 separated plots (30 m long by 5 m wide) resulting
in a total of 81 plots. To measure moisture content of plot soils, in ﬁve ran-
dom locations of the plots, a sampling procedure in 30 cm topsoil layer
was carried out utilizing a cylindrical core sampler. The collected soil sam-
ples were immediately packed in separate polyethylene bags and trans-
ferred to research laboratory. The samples were dried in a convection
oven at 105 ± 1 °C until constant weight was obtained (SAA, 1977). To
avoid experimental error, the drying process was triplicated for each
soil sample and mean value was used. The moisture content of the site
soil was found to be 8.84% (g water/g dry sample).
One of the tillage sites employed for chiseling process was covered
with uniform wheat stubble. The percentage of wheat stubble coverage
was calculated 22% based on Eq.(1) (Papendick, 2002).

2.2. Speciﬁcations of tractor-implement systems
A popular 4WD tractor with MFWD system, with its front wheels
smaller than rear wheels, was used in this research. The key technical
speciﬁcations of the tractor are provided in Table 4. To measure princi-
pal performance parameters in plowing process, the tractor was fully
equipped with a digital instrumentation system. The system was devel-
oped and validated by the same authors in the previous work (Shafaei
et al., 2019a). The instrumentation system composed of a data acquisi-
tion unit and three groups of transducer assembly (two ﬂow meters,
three rotary shaft encoders, and one load cell). The major engineering
details of the transducers are completely reported in Table 5. The instru-
mented tractor at base station is shown in Fig. 1.
The two ﬂow meters were utilized for measuring tractor fuel con-
sumption. The ﬁrst one was embedded between the injector pump
and fuel ﬁlter of the tractor. The second one was also embedded in the
line between injection pump and fuel tank and thereby, excess fuel
returned to the tank was measured. The difference between two mea-
sured values obtained from the ﬂow meters was considered as the trac-
tor fuel consumption value.
The load cell was used to measure required draft force of implement
in accordance with the method standardized by the RNAM institute
(RNAM, 1995). This method has been frequently used in previous
works by the researchers (Zhang et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2015;
Rahmanian-Koushkaki et al., 2015; Shafaei et al., 2019d).
Driving wheel slip can be continuously measured using the method
suggested by Pranav et al. (2010). In this method, to measure forward
speed of outer radius of the wheels (ground speed), two encoders were

ﬁtted into the wheel hubs of the rear wheels and one on a ﬁfth wheel
employing some mechanical joints. The ﬁfth wheel was hinged to the
tractor chassis between rear and front wheels as a non-driving wheel. It
was reasonable to assume that slip of left and right driving wheels of
the rear axle might not be equal at the same time, owing to existence of
different soil conditions in the ﬁeld. Hence, average values of obtained
ground speed of left and right driving wheels were considered as theoret-
ical forward speed. Meanwhile, measured ground speed of the ﬁfth wheel
was considered as actual forward speed. To calculate slip percentage of
rear driving wheel of the tractor, Eq.(2) was applied in data acquisition
unit of the digital instrumentation system (ASAE, 2003).

Three mounted implements of disk, chisel, and moldboard plow
commonly used by farmers in southern area of the country were
employed in this research. Principal technical speciﬁcations of the im-
plements are tabulated in Table 6. To restrict redundant and lateral
forces acting on the implement in plowing process, the implement at-
tached to the tractor was leveled utilizing three-point hitch links of
the tractor. Prior to ﬁeld operations, initial inspection of the tractor-
implement system was also performed at base station.
2.3. Field operations
The ﬁeld operations were conducted in a half day (10 AM to 4 PM)
on January 16, 2017 in predetermined plots. For each implement type,
arrangement of the plots was randomized and blocked based on split
plot design with three replications. In this design, plowing depth and
forward speed were considered as major and minor treatments,
respectively.
Before entering the plots, three-point linkage height lever was acti-
vated to lower the implement corresponding to the desired plowing
depth. The tractor, in 2WD mode, was also operated at respective gear
and throttle settings (rated speed of engine) to achieve desired forward
speed at selected plowing depth in a practice area. These settings of the
tractor were remained invariable along each test plot. Before each plot, a
practice area was considered to adjust operational treatments (plowing
depth and forward speed) until a steady state reached. For each combi-
nation of the treatments, three runs were performed to ensure repeat-
ability and reliability of collected data. Arithmetic average of the
collected data was then used for next step (data processing). The con-
sidered levels of the treatments (independent variables) applied in
ﬁeld operations and the master performance parameters of tractor-
implement systems measured in ﬁeld operations in accordance with
the slave calculated performance parameters (dependent variables)
are reported in Table 7.
In the plots, as the tractor-implement system reached the ﬁrst
installed ﬂag marking, data collection for the master performance pa-
rameters was started utilizing the digital instrumentation system. The
data collection process continued until end of the plot, and it was
stopped as the tractor-implement system passed the second installed
ﬂag marking. At end of each plot, a headland area was allocated for turn-
ing the tractor-implement system in order to enter into the next plot.
In each plot, required draft force of the implement was measured
based on the RNAM method. According to the method, the main
tractor-implement system was pulled by an auxiliary tractor (model:
4450, Company: John Deere, Country: USA), while the load cell trans-
ducer of the digital instrumentation system was horizontally connected
between the two tractors. During applying the RNAM method, it was
ensured that the main tractor-implement system and the auxiliary trac-
tor were placed on level ground in both lateral and longitudinal direc-
tions and the connection line of the transducer was parallel to ground
surface. The operations were carried out with the mounted implement
at desired plowing depth and forward speed. Obtained data from the
transducer were considered as gross traction forces. The operations
were also conducted at desired forward speed with the implement in
transport position and the collected data from the transducer were con-
sidered as rolling resistance force of the tractor wheels. Finally, required

draft force of the implement (net traction force) was calculated once
rolling resistance force of the main tractor was deducted from the
gross traction force. It should be noted that the operations were con-
ducted, while transmission system of the main tractor was set to neutral
position.
2.4. Data processing
Collected data for the master performance parameters (required
draft force of implement, tractor rear wheel slip, fuel consumption per
working hour) make it possible to calculate the slave performance pa-
rameters (speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption, tractor drawbar
power, energy requirement for tillage implement, overall energy efﬁ-
ciency, tractor tractive efﬁciency, speciﬁc draft force, and fuel consump-
tion per tilled area) by means of the following equations (Jr, 1989; ASAE,

2.5. Execution of soft computing simulation workplace
2.5.1. ANN
The multi-layer perceptron architecture of the ANN scenario was
employed in the simulation workplace. The architecture comprises
three main layers: an input layer, hidden layer, and an output layer.
Each layer includes several nodes. The number of nodes in the input
and output layer is equal to the number of input and output variables
in the simulation workplace. The connections among the nodes in the
hidden layer signiﬁcantly inﬂuence prognostication accuracy. The ANN

scenario repeatedly decreases overall error of prognostication through
modiﬁcation of its connections among hidden nodes in predetermined
training algorithm. In this scenario, prognostication process is automat-
ically completed by means of neural computing through the layers. The
data sets in input layer are intelligently mapped to hidden layer and
consequently mapped to output layer by means of input and output
transfer functions, respectively.
In the simulation workplace, the ANN scenario was developed based
on three layers. The values of three input variables of plowing depth (10,
20 and 30 cm), forward speed (2, 4 and 6), and implement type (mold-
board, disk, and chisel plow) were imported into the input layer and the
values of ten performance parameters of tractor-implement systems in
plowing process were imported into output layer, too. Therefore, the
ANN scenario was established with three and ten nodes in input and
output layers, respectively. In input layer of the simulation workplace,
to have possibility of arbitrary selection of the implement, the integers
1, 2 and 3 were assigned for moldboard, disk, and chisel plow imple-
ment, respectively.
To import data sets into the ANN simulation workplace, data sets
were randomly classiﬁed into three categories of training, testing and
validation sets by 70:15:15 ratios. During training the ANN simulation
workplace, the ANN scenario is tested in contradiction of the test data

set to control correctness, and training process is stopped when the
mean average error remained constant for a speciﬁc number of training
cycles. This task is considered to avoid over ﬁtting.
According to the ANN structure, several structural arrangements
were tried to obtain the best structure with the highest prognostication
accuracy. Various structural parameters of the scenario (the number of
training cycles, input and output transfer functions, and the number of
nodes in hidden layer) were run through frequent simulation tests in
the ANN toolbox of STATISTICA 12 software (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA). During development process of the ANN scenario, the number
of nodes in the hidden layer was set to a range from 2 to 10. The transfer
functions of nodes were considered as follows: tangent, logistic, linear,
Gaussian, sine, unit step, logarithm, and exponential. Fig. 2 illustrates
the ﬂowchart for selection of the best structure of the ANN simulation
workplace in accordance with schematic of simulation scenario.
2.5.2. MANFIS
The ﬁrst order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type of the ANFIS scenario was
used to prognosticate ten performance parameters of the tractor-
implement systems in plowing process, on the basis of three indepen-
dent input variables of plowing depth, forward speed, and implement
type. The ANFIS is a ﬁve-layered structure including different nodes in
each layer. The nodes in each layer connect with the nodes in the previ-
ous layer and receive input data coming from the previous nodes. These
ﬁve layers are known as fuzziﬁcation, normalization, fuzzy rule,
defuzziﬁcation, and output layer, respectively. The ANFIS simulation
scenario is completed through passing data sets in these ﬁve layers.
The scenario is described in the following paragraph.
When input data are assigned to the ﬁrst layer nodes, they are
graded between zero and one by input membership functions (con-
stant, triangular, generalized bell (Gbell), gaussian, trapezium, and sig-
moid). The graded data are shifted to the second layer nodes as input
data. The numerical weights are allocated to the data in the second
layer. Furthermore, the second layer normalizes the weighted input
data. The weighted input data are transferred to the third layer nodes
as input data of fuzzy rules. These rules are deﬁned based on the IF
and THEN structure. Output data obtained by the rules are gathered
and aggregated to one output value in the fourth layer nodes. This
value is converted to desired output variable by defuzziﬁcation method
(weighted sum and weighted average) of the inference system. Output
membership functions (constant and linear) are used for this job. The
desired output variable is ﬁnally obtained in the ﬁfth layer node.
The second layer of the ANFIS scenario normalizes the weighted
input data by training itself. Training process is performed similar to
that of the ANN scenario. The Hybrid algorithm is commonly used to
train the simulation workplace. The algorithm is a combination of
back-propagation and least square error algorithm. In the ANFIS sce-
nario, the rules are also tuned automatically regarding relationships be-
tween input and output data. As it has been mentioned in Section 1.2,
deﬁnition of fuzzy rules based on the structure of IF and THEN is very
complex. The overall ANFIS structure has been established based on
consideration of one output parameter in accordance with several
input variables.
In the MANFIS simulation workplace of MATLAB R2016b software
(The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), ten ANFIS sub-environments
were individually developed for prognostication of ten performance pa-
rameters based on the same input variables of plowing depth (10, 20
and 30 cm), forward speed (2, 4 and 6 km/h), and implement type
(moldboard, disk, and chisel plow implement). Similar to the ANN sim-
ulation workplace, to introduce implement type as input variable for the
MANFIS simulation workplace, the integers 1, 2 and 3 were assigned for
moldboard, disk, and chisel plow implement, respectively. Data sets ob-
tained from the ﬁeld operations were randomly shufﬂed and classiﬁed
into three groups. The groups including 70, 15 and 15% of the data for
training, validating and testing, respectively, of each developed ANFIS
sub-environment. Calibration process was frequently performed until
the best structure of the ANFIS scenario for each performance parameter
with the highest prognostication accuracy was reached. The process
was completed by trying different training cycles, the number of input
membership functions, type of input membership functions, type of
output membership functions, and defuzziﬁcation methods. Flowchart
for selection of the best MANFIS scenario in accordance with schematic
of simulation scenario and ﬁve-layered structure of the ANFIS are
shown in Fig. 3.
2.5.3. MANFIS+MNE
The new simulation scenario of MANFIS+MNE was considered
based on one MANFIS conﬁguration coupled with two MNE conﬁgura-
tions (Fig. 4). The MANFIS conﬁguration consisted of four ANFIS sub-
environments. Three ANFIS sub-environments were applied for prog-
nostication of three master performance parameters (required draft
force of implement, tractor rear wheel slip, fuel consumption per work-
ing hour) of tractor-implement systems in plowing process regarding
three input variables of plowing depth (10, 20 and 30 cm), forward
speed (2, 4 and 6 km/h), and implement type (moldboard, disk, and
chisel plow). The forth ANFIS sub-environment was applied as auxiliary
one for prognostication of gross traction force. The best ﬁnalized struc-
tures obtained for the ANFIS1, ANFIS4, and ANFIS9 in the previous
Section 2.5.2 were employed in the workplace. Similarly, calibration
process was frequently performed until the best structure (training cy-
cles, the number of input membership functions, type of input member-
ship function, type of output membership functions, and defuzziﬁcation
methods) of the ANFIS4 was obtained for prognostication of gross trac-
tion force. The output prognostication values of the MANFIS conﬁgura-
tion
could

conﬁguration1 consisted of four MNE environments for prognostication
of tractor drawbar power, tractor tractive efﬁciency, speciﬁc draft force,
and fuel consumption per tilled area, based on the Eqs.(4), (7), (8) and
(9), respectively. The values of four performance parameters calculated
by the MNE conﬁguration1 were delivered to the MNE conﬁguration2 in

order to calculate other three performance parameters (speciﬁc volu-
metric fuel consumption, energy requirement for tillage implement,
and overall energy efﬁciency) on the basis of the Eqs.(3), (5) and (6). Fi-
nally, obtained values of ten performance parameters were achievable
in the simulation workplace output.
To run the MANFIS+MNE simulation scenario, a simple code was
written in Command Window of MATLAB R2016b software. When the
program (ﬁnalized code) was run, the prerequisite values of plowing
depth in the range of 10–30 cm, forward speed in the range of
2–6 km/h, and tillage implement type (the integers 1, 2 and 3 for mold-
board, disk, and chisel plow implement, respectively) were received
and the MANFIS conﬁguration, MNE conﬁguration1, and MNE conﬁgu-
ration2 were respectively called to simulate and calculate the ten per-
formance parameters. The error message was displayed in Command
Window, if the prerequisite values were not imported in desired ranges.
It should be also noted that required speciﬁcations (working width and
ﬁeld efﬁciency) for each implement were deﬁned for the program to be
used in the MNE conﬁguration1 and MNE conﬁguration2. Finally, the
prerequisite values in accordance with the ten obtained performance
parameters were placed in predetermined appropriate columns of
workspace in the MATLAB software. Therefore, it can be pointed out
that the deﬁned program for simulation workplace worked like a
neuro-fuzzy calculator in workspace of the MATLAB software. It
means that, values of the independent input variables were received
and values of the ten performance parameters were tabulated. Opera-
tional ﬂowchart of the program algorithm is shown in Fig. 5. As it can
be seen in the Fig. 5, the algorithm consisted of three sub-programs
for the MANFIS conﬁguration, MNE conﬁguration1, and MNE conﬁgura-
tion2 which are called, respectively.
2.6. Prognostication appraisal of soft computing simulation workplaces
Goodness of prognostication accuracy of each performance parame-
ter of tractor-implement systems in soft computing simulation work-
places for each scenario (the ANN, MANFIS, and MANFIS+MNE) was
appraised by coefﬁcient of determination of regression analysis utilizing
Eq.(15) (Shafaei et al., 2016b). Moreover, absolute and relative error of
prognostication were ascertained by Eqs.(16) and (17), respectively
(Shafaei et al., 2017b). The highest values of coefﬁcient of determination
closed to one and the lowest values of the RMSE and MRDM indicate the
best simulation workplace for each scenario. However, prognostication
accuracy of prominent simulation workplace of each scenario must be
compared with that of other ones.

To recognize prominent scenario for prognostication of performance
parameters of tractor-implement systems, not only a comparative trend
was performed between the values obtained from the Eqs.(15)–(18),
but also simulation time and user-friendly conﬁguration of three sce-
narios were benchmarked. The scenario with the highest prognostica-
tion accuracy, the lowest simulation time, and more user-friendly
conﬁguration was recognized as the prominent one.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Statistical descriptions
3.1.1. Required draft force of implement
Table 8 reports values of statistical descriptor parameters obtained
for required draft force of the implements in plowing process. According
to the Table 8, it can be seen although the range of draft force variations
of the implements has overlap, the range for chisel plow implement was
higher than that of other two implements. This led to considerable
higher mean value of the draft force of chisel plow implement than
that of the other two implements. The possible explanation for this
can be related to higher working width of chisel plow implement in
comparison with that of the other ones (Table 6). Another reason for
this fact might be corresponded to wheat stubble coverage of the tillage
site for chiseling process. Because of wheat root concentration in 30 cm
topsoil layer, resistance forces are higher and thereby, more draft forces
are required to cut and break the soil.
The minimum and maximum values of draft force tabulated in the
Table 8 were found in the lowest (forward speed = 2 km/h and plowing
depth = 10 cm) and the highest (forward speed = 6 km/h and plowing
depth = 30 cm) level of combination of the treatments, respectively, for
all implements. The draft force variation ranges obtained in this

research were within the similar ranges reported by Smith and Williford
(1988) and Almaliki (2018).
3.1.2. Tractor rear wheel slip
The values of statistical descriptor parameters determined for tractor
rear wheel slip in plowing process are tabulated in Table 9. As it can be
seen in the Table 9, the wheel slip ranged from 5.11 to 49.02% for the im-
plements. However, the wheel slip range for chisel plow implement was
higher than that of moldboard plow followed by disk plow implement.
This discrepancy might be attributable to the higher required draft force
of chisel plow implement than that of other implements which is men-
tioned in the previous subset. Due to lack of proper traction force gener-
ated by the tractor wheels in some conditions, the wheel slip increases.
Moreover, lower contact between the wheels and soil occurs, when the
tillage site is covered with uniform wheat stubble. Therefore, higher
wheel slip might be related to a condition that luges of the tires do not
penetrate enough into the soil to make proper engagement needed for
overcoming the higher implement draft.
Similar to the previous subset results, the minimum and maximum
values of the wheel slip reported in the Table 9 were found in the lowest
(forward speed = 2 km/h and plowing depth = 10 cm) and the highest
(forward speed = 6 km/h and plowing depth = 30 cm) level of combina-
tion of the treatments, respectively, for the implements. The range of the
wheel slip observed in this research overlaps with the range documented
by previous authors in their research study reports (Kolahloo and
Loghavi, 1994; Tayel et al., 2015; Taiwo and Owusu-Sekyere, 2015).
3.1.3. Fuel consumption per working hour
The values of statistical descriptor parameters determined for fuel
consumption per working hour in plowing process are given in
Table 10. With reference to the Table 10, it is clear that higher range of
the fuel consumption per working hour for chisel plow implement
than that of other implements led to higher associated mean value (ap-
proximately 1.6 times) of the fuel consumption for the chisel plow im-
plement than that of the other implements. There are two potential
causes for this observation. Higher required draft force of chisel plow
implement than that of other implements and consequently, higher
fuel energy requirements and fuel consumption per working hour. Ad-
ditionally, higher wheel slip of tractor results in higher fuel consump-
tion (Thansandote et al., 1977).
In parallel with two previously discussed performance parameters,
the minimum and maximum values of fuel consumption per working
hour noted in the Table 10 were found in the lowest (forward speed
= 2 km/h and plowing depth = 10 cm) and the highest (forward
speed = 6 km/h and plowing depth = 30 cm) level of combination of
the treatments, respectively, for the implements. These results for vari-
ation of the fuel consumption are in compliance with the ﬁndings of
previous researchers for strip tillage machine (Sarauskis et al., 2017).
3.1.4. Fuel consumption per tilled area
Table 11 presents values of statistical descriptor parameters de-
termined for fuel consumption per tilled area in plowing process. It
can be observed in the Table 11 that the fuel consumption ranged
from 12.04 to 43.22 (L/ha) for the implements. However, the fuel
consumption range for chisel plow implement is higher than that
of other implements. According to Eq.(9), higher value of fuel con-
sumption per working hour leads to calculation of higher value of
fuel consumption per tilled area. Hence, higher values of fuel con-
sumption per working hour of chisel plow implement than that of
other implements resulted in the higher values of fuel consump-
tion per tilled area of the chisel plow implement than that of
other implements.
On the contrary with previously discussed performance parameters,
the minimum and maximum values of the fuel consumption mentioned
in the Table 11 were found in combination of the treatments of forward
speed = 6 km/h and plowing depth = 10 cm, and forward speed =
2 km/h and plowing depth = 30 cm, respectively, for the implements.
The variation range of the fuel consumption observed in the present re-
search is consistent with the results published by previous researchers
(Hughes and Baker, 1977; Hemmat and Khashoei, 1995; Stajnko et al.,
2009).
3.1.5. Speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption
The values of statistical descriptor parameters determined for spe-
ciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption in plowing process are organized in
Table 12. As it can be found in the Table 12, the variation range of the
fuel consumption for disk plow was higher than that of the other imple-
ments. One possible explanation for this is related to the Eq.(3). The Eq.
(3) shows the inverse relation between speciﬁc volumetric fuel con-
sumption and the draft force as well as direct relation between speciﬁc
volumetric fuel consumption and fuel consumption per working hour.
The combination of these two relations results in various values calcu-
lated for speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption.
From analogical point of view, the minimum and maximum values
of speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption were obtained in different
levels of combination of the treatments against those of fuel consump-
tion per working hour and fuel consumption per tilled area. The mini-
mum and maximum values of speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption
were obtained in the forward speed = 6 km/h and plowing depth =
30 cm, and the forward speed = 2 km/h and plowing depth = 10, re-
spectively, for the implements. The variation range of the fuel consump-
tion observed in the current research is consistent with the results of
Parvanloo et al. (2015).
3.1.6. Speciﬁc draft force
The values of statistical descriptor parameters determined for spe-
ciﬁc draft force in plowing process are denoted in Table 13. With refer-
ence to the Table 13, the range of speciﬁc draft force for moldboard plow

implement was higher than that of disk plow followed by chisel plow
implement. This result is reasonable, since implement working width
of moldboard plow was lower than that of other two implements. Ac-
cording to Eq.(8), the inverse relation between speciﬁc draft force and
implement working width is observed. Therefore, lower implement
working width leads to higher speciﬁc draft force in the same condi-
tions. From another point of view, based on Eq.(8), the value of required
draft force of implement is important in speciﬁc draft force calculation.
In case of chisel and moldboard plow implement, the minimum
value of speciﬁc draft force was obtained in forward speed = 2 km/h
and plowing depth = 20 cm, while in the case of disk plow implement,
the minimum speciﬁc draft occurred in forward speed = 2 km/h and
plowing depth = 30 cm. The maximum value of speciﬁc draft force
for moldboard plow implement was obtained in forward speed =
6 km/h and plowing depth = 10 cm. Meanwhile, the maximum value
of speciﬁc draft force for disk and chisel plow implement was obtained
in forward speed = 6 km/h and plowing depth = 20 cm. These results
are closely aligned with those reported by Plouffe et al. (1995) and
Arvidsson et al. (2004).
3.1.7. Tractor drawbar power
The values of statistical descriptor parameters determined for tractor
drawbar power in plowing process are classiﬁed in Table 14. In accor-
dance with the values of the Table 14, it is clear that the range of the
values of tractor drawbar power for chisel plow implement was consid-
erably higher than that of other two implements. The reason behind this
result is explained by the fact of direct relation between required draft
force of implement and tractor drawbar power (Eq.(4)). Hence, based
on the Eq.(4), higher required draft force of implement results in higher
tractor drawbar power in the same tested conditions. Therefore, based
on the Table 8, higher values of the draft force of chisel plow implement
than those of other two implements lead to higher values of the draw-
bar power of chisel plow implement than those of other two
implements.
Similar to the results of required draft force of implement, the min-
imum and maximum values of tractor drawbar power tabulated in the
Table 14 were found in the lowest (forward speed = 2 km/h and
plowing depth = 10 cm) and the highest (forward speed = 6 km/h
and plowing depth = 30 cm) level of combination of the treatments, re-
spectively, for the implements. The drawbar power results in this re-
search are parallel to the results published by Chaplin et al. (1988),
and Loghavi and Moradi (1996).
3.1.8. Tractor tractive efﬁciency
Table 15 reports the values of statistical descriptor parameters deter-
mined for tractor tractive efﬁciency in plowing process. According to the
Table 15, tractor tractive efﬁciency is higher when disk plow implement
was attached to the tractor. This might be attributed to lower tractor
rear wheel slip (Table 9). Based on the Eq.(7), the tractive efﬁciency is
direct function of the wheel slip and net traction force (required draft
force of implement). Therefore, on the basis of the Table 9, lower tractor
rear wheel slip, as disk plow implement attached to the tractor, than
that of other two implement leads to higher tractor tractive efﬁciency.
The minimum and maximum values of tractor tractive efﬁciency re-
ported in the Table 15 were found in the highest (forward speed =
6 km/h and plowing depth = 30 cm) and the lowest (forward speed
= 2 km/h and plowing depth = 10 cm) level of combination of the
treatments, respectively, for the implements. The observed results are
in general agreement with the results of previous studies conducted
by Inchebron et al. (2012) and Far et al. (2015a).
3.1.9. Energy requirement for tillage implement
Table 16 lists values of statistical descriptor parameters determined
for energy requirement for tillage implements. The mean values of the
energy requirement in the Table 16 tend to increase as implement
varies from chisel to moldboard plow implement. A possible explana-
tion for this result is related to implement working width (Eqs.(5) and
(10)). Substitution of the Eq.(10) into the Eq.(5) shows that the energy
requirements is an inverse function of implement working width. Ac-
cordingly, considering working width of the implements noted in the
Table 6, the energy requirement increased as implement working
width decreased.
Similar to the results of some previously discussed performance pa-
rameters, the minimum and maximum values of the energy require-
ment noted in the Table 16 were found in the lowest (forward speed
= 2 km/h and plowing depth = 10 cm) and the highest (forward
speed = 6 km/h and plowing depth = 30 cm) level of combination of
the treatments, respectively, for the implements. The energy require-
ment results reported by Jr et al. (1985) and Celik et al. (2007) are sim-
ilar compared to results of this research.
3.1.10. Overall energy efﬁciency
Table 17 shows values of statistical descriptor parameters deter-
mined for overall energy efﬁciency of the tractor-implement systems
in plowing process. The mean value of the efﬁciency of disk plow imple-
ment in the Table 17 is higher than that of chisel plow followed by
moldboard plow implement. This result occurred due to higher tractor
tractive efﬁciency, when disk plow implement was attached to the trac-
tor. Moreover, based on the Eq.(6), overall energy efﬁciency is inverse
function of fuel consumption per tilled area. Therefore, the lower values
of fuel consumption per tilled area for disk plow implement (Table 11)
than those of other two implements were effective in obtained higher
values of overall energy efﬁciency.
Similar to the results of some previously discussed performance pa-
rameters, the minimum and maximum values of the efﬁciency in
plowing process documented in the Table 17 were found in the lowest
(forward speed = 2 km/h and plowing depth = 10 cm) and the highest
(forward speed = 6 km/h and plowing depth = 30 cm) level of combi-
nation of the treatments, respectively, for the implements. The obtained
values for the efﬁciency in current research are similarly ranged with

those described by Jr (1985), Sumer and Sabanci (2005), and Far et al.
(2015b).
Overall view on the Tables 8–17 demonstrated high values obtained
for the CV and CNU of the performance parameters. These high values
imply drastic changes of the performance parameters as affected by
level changes of the treatments (plowing depth and forward speed). Ac-
cording to the ranges obtained for the performance parameters of
tractor-implement systems in plowing process in clay loam soil, it can
be claimed that these results are complementary for the research
study results which were comprehensively conducted by Kheiralla
et al. (2004) in sandy clay loam soil of Malaysia in case of moldboard,
disk plow, disk harrow, and rotary tiller implements. Hence, it is practi-
cally desired that the experts who work in respective realms focus their
attention to these two published research results in order to optimize
the management of machinery in plowing process in the similar condi-
tions like these researches.
3.2. Performance appraisal of soft computing simulation workplaces
3.2.1. ANN
The parameters of the several structural arrangements in accordance
with corresponding R2, RMSE, and MRDM of selected twenty ANN soft
computing simulation workplaces executed to prognosticate perfor-
mance parameters of the tractor-implement systems in plowing process
are provided in Tables 18–27. As it can be seen in the Tables 18–27, the
prominent ANN soft computing simulation workplace was recognized
with 6 nodes in hidden layer, 113 training cycles, and exponential and
tangent transfer function in input and output layer, respectively. The
corresponding values of R2 for the prominent simulation workplace
ranged from 0.683 to 0.890 for ten performance parameters. Graphical
presentation of this improper range is illustrated in Fig. 6. With refer-
ence to the Fig. 6, the simulated and actual values of performance pa-
rameters are not clustered perfectly around 1:1 line which indicates
poor agreement between the simulated and actual values. Additionally,
scattered distribution of simulation residual error as shown in Fig. 7
clearly depicts that there was no pattern in the errors for the prominent
simulation workplace. However, distribution of the error values was
centralized in wide ranges. Fig. 8 displays frequency of simulation resid-
ual error that indicates scattered distribution of percentage of the errors.
On the discussion about these observations, it can be stated that simula-
tion residual errors of the prominent simulation workplace were sensi-
tive to actual data and consequently, it is inferred that the simulation
workplace was not matched well to actual data. It is related to the fact
that the effect of a variable on performance parameter values was not
appropriately simulated by the prominent simulation workplace. In
contrast to this result, some previous investigators (Taghavifar et al.,
2013; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014a; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014b;
Taghavifar et al., 2015) pronounced excellent prognostication accuracy
of well-developed ANN soft computing simulation workplaces for
estimation of unit output target on the basis of numeral multiple input
variables.
3.2.2. MANFIS
The parameters of the several structural arrangements in accordance
with corresponding R2, RMSE, and MRDM of selected twenty MANFIS
soft computing simulation workplaces executed to prognosticate per-
formance parameters of the tractor-implement systems in plowing pro-
cess are presented in Tables 28–37. As it has been emphasized in the
Tables 28–37, the structural arrangements of each prominent ANFIS
sub-environment are not identical in comparison with those of other
sub-environments.
The Table 28 implies that prominent ANFIS soft computing simula-
tion sub-environment for prognostication of required draft force of the
implements in plowing process was the one with structural arrange-
ments of 125 training cycles, 3 input membership functions for forward
speed, plowing depth, and implement type, trapezium and linear func-

membership functions for plowing depth and implement type, sigmoid
and constant function for input and output, respectively, and weighted
sum defuzziﬁcation method.
The Table 30 indicates that prominent ANFIS soft computing simula-
tion sub-environment for prognostication of fuel consumption per
working hour in plowing process was the one with structural arrange-
ments of 124 training cycles, 4 input membership functions for plowing
depth, and 3 input membership functions for forward speed and imple-
ment type, sigmoid and linear function for input and output, respec-
tively, and weighted sum defuzziﬁcation method.
The Table 31 address that prominent ANFIS soft computing simula-
tion sub-environment for prognostication of fuel consumption per tilled
area in plowing process was the one with structural arrangements of
157 training cycles, 4 input membership functions for forward speed
and plowing depth, and 3 input membership functions for implement
type, trapezium and constant function for input and output, respec-
tively, and weighted average defuzziﬁcation method.
The Table 32 reports that prominent ANFIS soft computing simula-
tion sub-environment for prognostication of speciﬁc volumetric fuel
consumption in plowing process was the one with structural arrange-
ments of 138 training cycles, 3 input membership functions for forward
speed and implement type, and 4 input membership functions for
plowing depth, triangular and linear function for input and output, re-
spectively, and weighted sum defuzziﬁcation method.
The Table 33 highlights that prominent ANFIS soft computing simu-
lation sub-environment for prognostication of speciﬁc draft force of the
implements in plowing process was the one with structural

The Table 34 describes that prominent ANFIS soft computing simula-
tion sub-environment for prognostication of tractor drawbar power in
plowing process was the one with structural arrangements of 115 train-
ing cycles, 2, 4 and 3 input membership functions for forward speed,

The Table 36 indicates that prominent ANFIS soft computing simula-

ment for tillage implements was the one with structural arrangements
of 146 training cycles, 4 input membership functions for forward
speed and plowing depth, 3 input membership functions for implement
type, triangular and constant function for input and output, respec-
tively, and weighted average defuzziﬁcation method.
The Table 37 presents that prominent ANFIS soft computing simula-
tion sub-environment for prognostication of overall energy efﬁciency of
the tractor-tillage implements was the one with structural arrange-
ments of 144 training cycles, 3 input membership functions for forward
speed, plowing depth, and implement type, Gbell and linear function for
input and output, respectively, and weighted average defuzziﬁcation
method.
An overview on the Tables 28–37 issues that the corresponding
values of R2 for the prominent sub-environment ranged from 0.971 to
0.997 for ten performance parameters. Graphical presentation of this
superior range is depicted in Fig. 9. As it can be seen in the Fig. 9, the

appropriately clustered close to 1:1 line which speciﬁes excellent corre-
lation between the simulated and actual values. Furthermore, distribu-
tion of simulation residual error is scattered in Fig. 10. The Fig. 10
clearly illustrates that speciﬁc pattern was not recognized in the errors
for the prominent sub-environments and distribution of the error
values was scattered around zero value. Fig. 11 exhibitions frequency
of simulation residual error revealing low ranges of percentage of the
errors. Accordingly, it can be pointed out that simulation residual
error of the prominent simulation workplace was not sensitive to actual
data and therefore, it is inferred that the simulation workplace was
matched well to actual data.
According to the observed results, it is found that the performance
parameters of the tractor-implement systems in plowing process were
satisfactorily prognosticated by the prominent MANFIS soft computing
simulation workplace executed in this research. This means that the ef-
fect of nominal and numeral variables on the performance parameter
values was appropriately simulated by the prominent simulation
workplace.
The previous authors (Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014c; Taghavifar
and Mardani, 2015; Taghavifar et al., 2016; Taghavifar and Mardani,
2017) who employed the ANFIS simulation workplace in their Agricul-
tural and Biosystems Engineering studies have similarly found proper
adequacy of the workplace for nonlinear prognostications of desired
variables.

forward speed and plowing depth, 3 input membership functions for
implement type, Gbell and linear function for input and output, respec-
tively, and weighted average defuzziﬁcation method. Meanwhile, its
statistical performance criteria is R2 = 0.984, RMSE = 0.985 kN and
MRDM = 2.167%. It should be noted that the structural arrangements
of the prominent ANFIS soft computing simulation sub-environments
for the three master performance parameters of required draft force of
implements, tractor rear wheel slip, and fuel consumption per working
hour obtained in the MANFIS soft computing simulation workplace
were also employed in the MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace. Con-
sequently, it is expected that the statistical performance criteria related
to the three master performance parameters in two simulation scenar-
ios were the same.
Table 39 presents statistical performance criteria for three mas-
ter as well as seven slave performance parameters prognosticated
in the MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace. As it has been docu-
mented in the Table 39, the corresponding values of R2 for prognos-
tication of ten performance parameters ranged from 0.971 to 0.996.
Graphical presentation of this excellent range as shown in Fig. 12
reveals that the simulated and actual values of performance pa-
rameters were properly clustered close to 1:1 line which implied
outstanding correlation between the simulated and actual values.
Additionally, distribution of simulation residual error is scattered
in Fig. 13. The Fig. 13 clearly exhibits that no speciﬁc pattern was
recognized in the errors for the simulation workplace and distribu-
tion of the error values was scattered around zero value. Fig. 14 dis-
plays frequency of simulation residual error revealing low ranges
of percentage of the errors. Accordingly, it can be stated that simu-
lation residual error of the simulation workplace was not sensitive
to actual data and consequently, it is inferred that the workplace
was matched well to actual data.

3.3. Performance benchmark of prominent soft computing simulation
workplaces
The statistical performance criteria of prominent soft computing
simulation workplaces executed based on three simulation scenarios
(ANN, MANFIS, and MANFIS+MNE) for prognostication of performance
parameters of the tractor-implement systems in plowing process are
compared in Fig. 15. According to the Fig. 15, the coefﬁcient of determi-
nation varied as 0.683 b R2 b 0.890, 0.971 b R2 b 0.997 and 0.971 b R2 b
0.996 for the prominent ANN, MANFIS, and MANFIS+MNE workplace,
respectively. Additionally, the relative error of prognostication varied
as 7.91% b MRDM b 9.66%, 0.91% b MRDM b 4.79% and 1.48% b MRDM
b 4.97% for the prominent ANN, MANFIS, and MANFIS+MNE workplace,
respectively. Meanwhile, the RMSE and MAVSRE for the MANFIS and
MANFIS+MNE simulation scenarios ranged in a lower bond than
those of the ANN simulation scenario. Hence, robustness of prognostica-
tion accuracy of the MANFIS and MANFIS+MNE simulation scenario
than that of the ANN simulation scenario was approved.
In this research, there was no precise relationship between perfor-
mance parameters and implement type (nominal variable). Hence,
weakness of several trained ANN simulation scenario based on neural
strategy, to sufﬁciently prognosticate performance parameters resulted
in uncovering this imprecise relationship. The neuro-fuzzy strategy can
extract sophisticated relationship between output and input parame-
ters using both neural and fuzzy beneﬁts. The fuzzy strategy can prog-
nosticate output based on multiple input variables using deﬁned rules
which are ascertained by expert knowledge. Unlike the neural strategy,
the fuzzy strategy cannot ﬁnd relationship between input and output

parameters by training itself. On the other hand, to appropriately prog-
nosticate target, the neural strategy based simulation workplace trains
itself and the fuzzy strategy based simulation workplace uses deﬁned
fuzzy rules. The neuro-fuzzy strategy ﬁnds proper fuzzy rules based
on training itself. Hence, an outstanding ability of the neuro-fuzzy strat-
egy based simulation scenario is to ﬁnd compound and uncertain rela-
tionships between output and input parameters. In this research, it
was found that the prominent MANFIS and MANFIS+MNE simulation
workplaces could detect exhaustive relationships between performance
parameters (dependent variables) and independent numeral variables
of plowing depth and forward speed, and nominal variable of imple-
ment type. These relationships were ruled in fuzzy form and then
trained to attain minimum value of simulation residual errors.
In parallel with this obtained result, satisfactory prognostication ac-
curacy of the ANFIS simulation workplace versus the ANN simulation
workplace in several previous Biosystems Engineering researches has
been covered by Khoshnevisan et al. (2014) and Khoshnevisan et al.
(2015).
Profound appraisal of structural arrangements of the prominent
MANFIS and MANFIS+MNE simulation workplaces in the Figs. 3 and
4, and Tables 28–38 conﬁrms that the statistical performance criteria
of two simulation workplaces were approximately identical. However,
in the MANFIS simulation workplace, ten different ANFIS simulation
sub-environments with various structural arrangements must be run
to acceptably prognosticate the performance parameters of the
tractor-implement systems in plowing process. While, in the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace, four different ANFIS simulation sub-
environments must be run. In other words, the ten performance param-
eters could be adequately prognosticated with the lower simulation
time and more user-friendly conﬁguration in the MANFIS+MNE simu-
lation workplace than MANFIS simulation workplace. Hence, it can be
stated that the MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace is trustworthy

and simple enough to be employed by the users for direct prognostica-
tion of the ten performance parameters based on forward speed,
plowing depth, and implement type. Therefore, for presentation of
clear physical perceptions of performance parameters of the tractor-
implement systems in plowing process in this research, the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace was employed.
3.4. Prognostication of performance parameters of tractor-implement
systems
3.4.1. Required draft force of implement
Fig. 16 displays surface and contour plots obtained from the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of required draft force
of the implements in plowing process. As it is obvious in the surface
plots of the Fig. 16, the draft force for each implement increased
nonlinearly as plowing depth and forward speed increased. Moreover,
the contour plots of the Fig. 16 clarify that the dual interaction effect
of forward speed and plowing depth on the draft force was increasingly
synergistic. It is clear in the contour plots of the Fig. 16 that the draft
force increased from the lowest bound (b4 kN) to the highest bound
(N35 kN) when plowing depth along with forward speed increased
from 10 to 30 cm and 2 to 6 km/h, respectively.
To interpret this obtained result, various physical perception have
been indicated by previous investigators. Zhang et al. (2001) have
stated that at higher plowing depth, the soil might become denser,
and density, cohesion and the tensile strength of the soil would increase
further and results in higher draft force requirement. Additionally, Al-
Suhaibani and Ghaly (2013) indicated that with plowing depth incre-
ment, the soil volume which should be cut, dispersed and moved in-
creases and whereby, higher draft force is required for plowing higher

soil volume. Moreover, increment of soil mass gathered around shank,
disk or bottom of the implement causes higher normal stress on the
shank, disk or bottom and consequently, friction force between shank,
disk or bottom surface and soil increases. To overcome higher produced
friction force, higher draft force is required (Almaliki, 2018; Upadhyay
and Raheman, 2019a).
On the other side, with increment of forward speed, soil particles are
subjected to higher acceleration. The higher acceleration forces result in
increase of normal loads which are acted on shanks, disks or bottoms of
the implement. Higher normal loads lead to higher frictional forces and
thereby, higher draft force is required (Kepner et al., 2005). Meanwhile,
it is comprehensible that higher forward speed leads to higher shear
rate and greater throw of the soil and therefore, higher draft force is ex-
pected (Upadhyay and Raheman, 2019a).
The results of increasing effect of plowing depth on the draft force of
the implements in a clay loam soil (current research) were similar to
those announced by Mouazen and Ramon (2002) and Naderloo et al.
(2009) for subsoiler implement in a sandy loam soil and moldboard
plow implement in a clay loam soil, respectively. Besides, the increasing
effect of forward speed on the draft force has been addressed for one-
way disk with seeder (Cullum et al., 1989) and cultivator (Novak
et al., 2014), which is paralleled to the results of the present research.
3.4.2. Tractor rear wheel slip
Fig. 17 shows surface and contour plots obtained from the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of tractor rear wheel
slip in plowing process. As it can be seen in the surface plots of the
Fig. 17, the wheel slip increased nonlinearly as plowing depth and for-
ward speed increased. Additionally, the contour plots of the Fig. 17 elu-
cidate that the dual interaction effect of forward speed and plowing
depth on the wheel slip was increasingly synergistic. It is observable
in the contour plots of the Fig. 17 that the wheel slip increased from

the lowest bound (b10%) to the highest bound (N35%) when plowing
depth along with forward speed increased from 10 to 30 cm and 2 to
6 km/h, respectively.
The possible explanation for this observation is associated with higher
draft force required to pull the implement at higher plowing depth. As a
result of lack of adequate traction force produced by the tractor rear driv-
ing wheels, at higher plowing depth, the wheel slip increases. It was also
revealed by previous researchers that required draft force for pulling the
implement grows with increase of forward speed. Consequently, the trac-
tion force generated by the tractor might be inadequate and accordingly,
the wheel slip increases (Raheman and Jha, 2007).
Similar to this observed result, the increasing effect of plowing depth
and forward speed on the wheel slip in plowing process has been docu-
mented in previous published papers (Raheman and Jha, 2007; Kumar
et al., 2017b).
3.4.3. Fuel consumption per working hour
Fig. 18 illustrates surface and contour plots obtained from the
MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of fuel con-
sumption per working hour in plowing process. As it can be seen in
the surface plots of the Fig. 18, the fuel consumption increased
nonlinearly as plowing depth and forward speed increased. Further-
more, the contour plots of the Fig. 18 reveal that the dual interaction ef-
fect of forward speed and plowing depth on the fuel consumption was
increasingly synergistic. It is visible in the contour plots of the Fig. 18
that the fuel consumption increased from the lowest bound (b6 L/h)
to the highest bound (N22 L/h) as plowing depth along with forward
speed increased from 10 to 30 cm and 2 to 6 km/h, respectively.
As forward speed increases, the time required for movement of an
assumed distance becomes smaller and therefore, time decrement will
result in increment of the fuel consumption rate. Moreover, higher

draft force at higher plowing depth results in higher required fuel en-
ergy and subsequently, the fuel consumption increment.
The same results for increase of the fuel consumption as a result of
plowing depth increment have been found by Sarauskis et al. (2017)
for strip tillage machine.
3.4.4. Fuel consumption per tilled area
Fig. 19 exhibits surface and contour plots obtained from the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of fuel consumption
per tilled area in plowing process. As it can be seen in the surface plots
of the Fig. 19, the fuel consumption changed nonlinearly as plowing
depth and forward speed increased. Besides, the contour plots of the
Fig. 19 reveal that the dual interaction effect of forward speed and
plowing depth on the fuel consumption was nonlinearly antagonism.
It is obvious in the contour plots of the Fig. 19 that the fuel consumption
changed from the lowest bound (b14 L/ha) to the highest bound
(N40 L/ha) as plowing depth along with forward speed increased from
10 to 30 cm and 2 to 6 km/h, respectively.

The physical perception for this observed result can be explained as
an assumed distance is traveled in shorter time when forward speed in-
creases. Thus, the fuel consumption decrease as caused by time decre-
ment. Meanwhile, it should be considered that higher draft force
required for higher plowing depth might result in higher required fuel
energy in hectare scale and accordingly, the fuel consumption
increment.
The same trend of fuel consumption increment as affected by
plowing depth increment was previously described by Sirhan et al.
(2002) and Ajav and Adewoyin (2012). This phenomenon was also
found by Serrano et al. (2003) and Gulsoylu et al. (2012) for forward
speed increment of offset disk harrow and chisel plow implement,
respectively.
3.4.5. Speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption
Fig. 20 presents surface and contour plots obtained from the
MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of speciﬁc
volumetric fuel consumption in plowing process. As it can be seen
in the surface plots of the Fig. 20, the fuel consumption decreased
nonlinearly as plowing depth and forward speed increased. More-
over, the contour plots of the Fig. 20 indicate that the dual interaction
effect of forward speed and plowing depth on the fuel consumption
was decreasingly synergistic. It is evident in the contour plots of
the Fig. 20 that the fuel consumption decreased from the highest
bound (N3 L/kW h) to the lowest bound (b0.4 L/kW h) as plowing
depth along with forward speed increased from 10 to 30 cm and 2
to 6 km/h, respectively.

Speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption indicates how much fuel is
consumed per each unit of effective engine power output. According
to the obtained results, the fuel consumption diminishes due to forward
speed growth because the fuel consumption is an inverse function of
forward speed (Eq.(3)). The fuel consumption decrease regarding
plowing depth increment is due to increase of the draft force.
The observed trend in this research for the fuel consumption as af-
fected by forward speed in plowing process is consistent with the
trend found by Parvanloo et al. (2015) in previous research.
3.4.6. Speciﬁc draft force
Fig. 21 shows surface and contour plots obtained from the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of speciﬁc draft force
of the implements in plowing process. As it can be seen in the surface
plots of the Fig. 21, speciﬁc draft force changed nonlinearly as plowing
depth and forward speed increased. In addition, the contour plots of
the Fig. 21 represent that the dual interaction effect of forward speed
and plowing depth on speciﬁc draft force was nonlinearly antagonism.
It is recognizable in the contour plots of the Fig. 21 that speciﬁc draft
force changed from the lowest bound (b40 kN/m2) to the highest
bound (N100 kN/m2) as plowing depth along with forward speed in-
creased from 10 to 30 cm and 2 to 6 km/h, respectively.
According to the Eq.(8), speciﬁc draft force is direct function of draft
force and invers function of plowing depth. Taking note that draft force
is direct function of plowing depth and forward speed. Therefore, the
component direct effect of plowing depth and forward speed, and
inverse effect of plowing depth on speciﬁc draft force is effective. The
surface plots in the Fig. 21 demonstrate that speciﬁc draft force in-
creased as forward speed increased (the direct effect of forward
speed). However, in case of moldboard plow implement, it ﬁrstly de-
creased and in the following increased nonlinearly as plowing depth in-
creased. In case of disk and chisel plow implement, it ﬁrstly increased
and then decreased nonlinearly as plowing depth increased. For the
moldboard plow implement, in the ﬁrst stage, it seems the inverse effect
of plowing depth was more effective than direct effect of plowing depth
and therefore, speciﬁc draft force decreased. In the second stage, the di-
rect effect of plowing depth was more pronounced than the inverse ef-
fect of plowing depth. In case of disk and chisel plow implement, it
seems the direct effect of plowing depth was predominant over the in-
verse effect of plowing depth in the ﬁrst stage and therefore, speciﬁc
draft force increased. In the second stage, the inverse effect of plowing
depth was greater than the direct effect of plowing depth.
The direct positive effect of forward speed on speciﬁc draft force
based on N/mm was similarly reported by Al-Suhaibani and Al-Janobi
(1997), and Al-Janobi and Al-Suhaibani (1998) for chisel, offset disk
harrow, moldboard plow, and disk plow implements.

and forward speed increased. Furthermore, the contour plots of the
Fig. 22 clarify that the dual interaction effect of forward speed and
plowing depth on the drawbar power was increasingly synergistic. It
is plausible in the contour plots of the Fig. 22 that the drawbar power in-
creased from the lowest bound (b5 kW) to the highest bound (N60 kW)
as plowing depth along with forward speed increased from 10 to 30 cm
and 2 to 6 km/h, respectively.
According to the Eq.(4), the drawbar power is direct function of for-
ward speed and draft force. The draft force is direct function of plowing
depth and forward speed. Therefore, it can be inferred that the drawbar

76

power is direct function of forward speed and plowing depth. Accord-
ingly, the drawbar power increases with increase of forward speed
and plowing depth.
The increasing effect of plowing depth on the drawbar power in
plowing process was also addressed by KarimiInchebron et al. (2012)
which is associate with the result of this research.
3.4.8. Tractor tractive efﬁciency
Fig. 23 depicts surface and contour plots obtained from the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of tractor tractive efﬁ-
ciency in plowing process. As it can be seen in the surface plots of the
Fig. 23, the tractive efﬁciency decreased nonlinearly as plowing depth
and forward speed increased. Moreover, the contour plots of the

77
S.M. Shafaei et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 38–84
Fig. 23 state that the dual interaction effect of forward speed and
plowing depth on the tractive efﬁciency was decreasingly synergistic.
It is observable in the contour plots of the Fig. 23 that the tractive efﬁ-
ciency decreased from the highest bound (N90%) to the lowest bound
(b50%) as plowing depth along with forward speed increased from 10
to 30 cm and 2 to 6 km/h, respectively.
To interpret the obtained trend, it should be considered that with in-
crease of plowing depth and forward speed, tractor rear wheel slip in-
creases (Section 3.4.2). According to the Eq.(7), the tractive efﬁciency
is negative direct function of the wheel slip. Therefore, as plowing
depth or forward speed increases, the wheel slip increases and conse-
quently, the tractive efﬁciency decreases. Another interpretation is

disk, and c: chisel plow implement).

78
S.M. Shafaei et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 38–84
attributed to gross traction force (draft force plus rolling resistance
force). According to the Eq.(7), the tractive efﬁciency is inverse function
of gross traction force. Increment of plowing depth or forward speed
leads to draft force increment (Section 3.4.1). Increment of draft force
results in the tractive efﬁciency decrease.
The observed decreasing trend of the tractive efﬁciency as inﬂu-
enced by increment of plowing depth and forward speed was in general
agreement with the results of previous researches conducted by
Inchebron et al. (2012) and Ranjbarian et al. (2017).
3.4.9. Energy requirement for tillage implement
Fig. 24 illustrates surface and contour plots obtained from the
MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of energy re-
quirement for tillage implements in plowing process. As it can be seen

79
S.M. Shafaei et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 2 (2019) 38–84
in the surface plots of the Fig. 24, the energy requirement increased
nonlinearly as plowing depth and forward speed increased. Besides,
the contour plots of the Fig. 24 display that the dual interaction effect
of forward speed and plowing depth on the energy requirement was in-
creasingly synergistic. It is perceptible in the contour plots of the Fig. 24
that the energy requirement increased from the lowest bound
(b15 MJ/ha) to the highest bound (N70 MJ/ha) as plowing depth along
with forward speed increased from 10 to 30 cm and 2 to 6 km/h,
respectively.
According to the Eqs.(4) and (5), the energy requirement is directly
related to the draft force. As it has been discussed in the Section 3.4.1,
the draft force increases as increment of plowing depth and forward

80

speed. Thus, the energy requirement rises due to increment of forward
speed and plowing depth. The increasing effect of forward speed on the
energy requirement was also mentioned in the published paper by
Thomas and Singh (2002).
3.4.10. Overall energy efﬁciency
Fig. 25 shows surface and contour plots obtained from the MANFIS
+MNE simulation workplace for prognostication of overall energy efﬁ-
ciency of the tractor-implement systems in plowing process. As it can be
seen in the surface plots of the Fig. 25, the efﬁciency increased
nonlinearly as plowing depth and forward speed increased. Moreover,
the contour plots of the Fig. 25 indicate that the dual interaction effect
of forward speed and plowing depth on the efﬁciency was increasingly
synergistic. It is visible in the contour plots of the Fig. 25 that the efﬁ-
ciency increased from the lowest bound (b6%) to the highest bound
(N26%) as plowing depth along with forward speed increased from 10
to 30 cm and 2 to 6 km/h, respectively.
According to the Eq.(6), overall energy efﬁciency is direct function of
tractor drawbar power. The drawbar power is function of forward speed
and the draft force (Eq.(4)). The draft force is direct function of plowing
depth and forward speed (Section 3.4.1). Therefore, it can be stated that
the efﬁciency is direct function of plowing depth and forward speed.
Hence, it is anticipated that the efﬁciency increases with increment of
plowing depth and forward speed.
Jr (1985) has pointed out that the range of 10–20% for overall energy
efﬁciency should be considered as normal range. The efﬁciency b10% is
known as poor tractive efﬁciency and/or load matching. It is also consid-
ered as good tractive efﬁciency and/or load match for the efﬁciency
above 20%. In this research, the efﬁciency ranged from 5.61 to 27.69%
for three tillage implements (Table 17). The efﬁciency b10% was related
to treatment of plowing depth = 10 cm and forward speed = 2 km/h.
With increment of plowing depth and forward speed, the efﬁciency
ranged from 10 to 20% and ﬁnally, it reached above 20%. Therefore, it
can be stated that in this research, proper tractive efﬁciency of the trac-
tor and good load match between implement and the tractor were
achieved at the upper levels of the plowing depth and forward speed.
The previous study results of Kheiralla et al. (2004) are similar to the
range and trend of overall energy efﬁciency of tractor-implement sys-
tems in this research.
4. Summary and conclusion
This research focused on development of soft computing simulation
workplaces for performance prognostication of tractor-implement sys-
tems in plowing process. Three simulation scenarios (ANN, MANFIS,
and MANFIS+MNE) were executed in the workplace. The operational
variables of plowing depth (10, 20 and 30 cm), forward speed (2, 4
and 6 km/h), and tillage implement type (moldboard, disk, and chisel
plow) were taken as the workplace inputs and ten performance param-
eters (required draft force of implement, tractor rear wheel slip, fuel
consumption per working hour, speciﬁc draft force, fuel consumption
per tilled area, speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption, tractor drawbar
power, tractor tractive efﬁciency, energy requirement for tillage imple-
ment, and overall energy efﬁciency) were considered as the workplace
outputs. According to aggregation of the results obtained in this re-
search, it can be asserted that this research satisﬁed both quantity and
quality aspects concerned in this realm, and the following conclusions
were drawn from the results:
1- In case of chisel plow implement with higher working width than
that of other implements, draft force, fuel energy, and drawbar
power required to pull the implement within soil were higher than
those of other implements.
2- Comparison of prognostication accuracy of two soft computing sce-
narios of the MANFIS and the ANN simulation workplace indicated
higher performance of the MANFIS against the ANN, based on the
obtained statistical performance criteria. Therefore, the hypotheses
of higher performance of neuro-fuzzy strategy than neural strategy
in prognostication of desired output targets based on the compound
effect of nominal and numeral input variables was approved.
3- According to obtained prognostication accuracy based on statistical
performance criteria, simulation time, and user-friendly conﬁgura-
tion of two neuro-fuzzy strategies based on the MANFIS and
MANFIS+MNE, the MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace was rec-
ognized as prominent simulation scenario. Therefore, the claim of
applicability of new simulation scenario of the MANFIS+MNE as a
simple neuro-fuzzy calculator was asserted. Accordingly, it can be
mentioned that difﬁculties of utilization of puzzling tables and
graphical charts for calculation of performance parameters are elim-
inated by means of neuro-fuzzy calculator.
4- In accordance with previous conclusions 2 and 3, the prominent sim-
ulation scenario among three simulation scenarios (ANN, MANFIS,
and MANFIS+MNE), executed in the workplace, was the MANFIS
+MNE simulation scenario.
5- The MANFIS+MNE simulation results revealed that simultaneous
increase of forward speed and plowing depth led to nonlinear incre-
ment of required draft force of implement, tractor rear wheel slip,
fuel consumption per working hour, tractor drawbar power, energy
requirement for tillage implement, and overall energy efﬁciency for
each tillage implement. Moreover, it demonstrated that simulta-
neous increase of forward speed and plowing depth led to nonlinear
decrement of speciﬁc volumetric fuel consumption and tractor trac-
tive efﬁciency.
6- The exhaustive physical perception obtained from the MANFIS
+MNE simulation results presented that the dual interaction effect
of forward speed and plowing depth on some performance parame-
ters (required draft force of implement, tractor rear wheel slip, fuel
consumption per working hour, speciﬁc volumetric fuel consump-
tion, tractor drawbar power, energy requirement for tillage imple-
ment, overall energy efﬁciency, and tractor tractive efﬁciency) was
nonlinearly synergetic. However, it was nonlinearly antagonism for
speciﬁc draft force and fuel consumption per tilled area. Based on
these interpretations, it can be advocated that the physical percep-
tion obtained from the MANFIS+MNE simulation results enrich
state of the art in the domain of comprehending behavior of the per-
formance of tractor-implement systems in plowing process.
These remarkable conclusions are in response to the fundamental
questions presented in the Section 1.4. Hence, it is desired to apply the
MANFIS+MNE simulation workplace and related physical perceptions
by technical farmer associations involved in the decision-making of ag-
ricultural machinery management in plowing process.
5. Recommendations for future research requirements
• Deﬁciency of soil moisture content and tractor driving mode (2WD
and 4WD) as input variables and tractor front wheel slip as output
variable of robust soft computing simulation workplace found on
the MANFIS+MNE scenario indicates requirement for further re-
searches to extend capability of the workplace. Hence, the associated
researchers in this realm are strongly encouraged to follow this exten-
sion in their future research works.
• Parametric analysis to ascertain the interaction effect of independent
variables (forward speed, plowing depth, and implement type) on de-
pendent variables (required draft force of implement, tractor rear
wheel slip, fuel consumption per working hour, speciﬁc draft force,
fuel consumption per tilled area, speciﬁc volumetric fuel consump-
tion, tractor drawbar power, tractor tractive efﬁciency, energy re-
quirement for tillage implement, and overall energy efﬁciency) was
not considered in the framework of the present research. Hence, it
should be investigated in more detail utilizing the MANOVA tech-
nique.

• Prior to recommendation of this MANFIS+MNE simulation scenario
for practical applications, its employment is recommended as a re-
source for forthcoming commercial attempts to release an exhaustive
user friendly graphical software package for prognostication of the
performance parameters of tractor-implement systems in plowing
process. The software package could be applied, as a new computa-
tional tool (neuro-fuzzy calculator), by the associated researchers, en-
gineers,
managements
and
students
in
order
to
familiarize
fundamental concepts of variation trends of the performance param-
eters as inﬂuenced by ﬁeld operational variables.
