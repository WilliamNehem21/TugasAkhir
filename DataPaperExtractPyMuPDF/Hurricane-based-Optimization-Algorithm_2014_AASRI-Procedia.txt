During the last few years, Nature inspired algorithms have been experiencing extremely rapid growth in 
the industrial world, where they have been shown to be very effective in solving real-world optimisation 
problems [1]. 
As an example of the huge and growing variety of heuristic approaches: Genetic Algorithm [6], Simulated 
Annealing [7], Ant Colony Search Algorithm [8], and Particle Swarm Optimization [9].  
However, these algorithms suffer from a major shortcoming, i.e. being trapped in local minima. In order to 
overcome these limitations, many other optimization technics have been developed. Some of these technics 
are Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) [10], Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) [11].  
In this paper we introduce a new optimization algorithm named as Hurricane-based Optimization 
Algorithm (HOA), based on wind and pressure profiles in a hurricane. During the search process, wind 
parcels search for a lower pressure zone (the eye), which is considered as the optimal solution. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of hurricanes as a meteorological 
phenomenon and the concepts and ideas behind HOA in details. In Section 3 the experimental results are 
demonstrated. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 4. 
2. Hurricane-based Optimization Algorithm 
2.1. Hurricanes 
A hurricane is a low-pressure zone with a warm core that forms over tropical and subtropical oceans. The 
center of the hurricane is known as the eye (Figure 1). Immediately outside of the eye is the Eyewall region, 
an area of vigorous tall/deep clouds, and the strongest observed winds. The surrounding spiral bands, called 
Rainbands, are localized areas of tall/deep clouds, heavy rain, and high winds. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Low-pressure system swirls off the southeastern coast of Greenland 
2.2. Basic Concepts 
The idea of the proposed algorithm is based on the observation of hurricane and how wind parcels move in 
the surrounding atmosphere.

A variety of equations have been suggested to model this phenomenon. The first one presents a 
straightforward description of the wind field. This model called Rankine-combined (or modified Rankine 
vortex) was applied to hurricanes by Depperman [12].  
The Rankine vortex model is a simple two-equation parametric description of a swirling flow. In the inner 
radial region about the center the flow is in solid rotation. While the outer region is free of vortices: 
V � Vmax

V � Vmax

     if  r �  Rmax  
 
(2) 
where V is the tangential wind with maximum value Vmax at r = Rmax, and the parameter X allows the shape of 
the wind field outside the (Rmax) to be modified to fit available data. The proposed method uses this model to 
control velocity variation over the search space. 
The interaction of the natural forces in a hurricane makes the wind parcels start spiraling outward. 
Therefore, the top horizontal surface of the hurricane can be approximated by a logarithmic (log) spiral 
pattern.  Log spirals, which can be formulated as follows:

r and � are radial and angular coordinate respectively in polar coordinates; (x, y) is the location in Cartesian 
coordinates; the real numbers (ex, ey) are the coordinates of the spiral center (eye). The real number a > 0; b 
controls how tightly the spiral whirls and in which direction. In the extreme case that b= 0, the spiral becomes 
a circle of radius a. 
In the proposed algorithm, the eye (lower pressure) corresponds to the best solution. Its pressure is 
determined using problem fitness function.

The function isOut(c) checks if the passed component c is within search space boundaries. Rand() 
generates a uniform random number in the interval [0, 1]. 
The algorithm starts with a random eye position. After the parameters initialization, the algorithm 
generates iteratively wind parcels by modifying the eye position according to Eq. (5). Each time a new wind 
parcel is generated, the algorithm considers 3 cases:  
1) The parcel is out of the search space, the algorithm resets the parcel parameters (�initial
i
and  �i ).  
2) The algorithm compares pressures, if the parcel pressure is lower than the eye pressure; the parcel 
position becomes the new eye.  
3) The parcel moves to the next position according to Eq. (7). 
After achieving a predetermined number of iterations (itMax), the algorithm returns the eye position, which 
is considered as the optimal solution. 
3. Experimental Results 
To validate the performance of the proposed method, HOA is applied to optimize a number of benchmark 
functions listed in Table 1, where n presents the dimension of the function. All benchmark functions are 
minimization problems. 
The values of parameters used in HOA are, � = �/10, Rmax = 0.2, R0 = 10-5. Wind parcels number is 100, 
and the maximum number of iterations is 20000. All experiments are averaged over 20 independent runs.

Table 2 presents the experimental results of HOA in terms of the average final best value (Avg) and the 
standard deviation (SD). In this table, x* is the optimum for the problem, and f(x*) is the best achievable 
fitness for that function. According to experimental results HOA shows a great performance in solving some 
benchmark functions. In general the results are close to the global optimum. The small standard deviation 
values prove the convergence of HOA. 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, HOA as a new nature-inspired algorithm is proposed to tackle optimization problems. The 
underlying concepts and ideas behind HOA are based on the observation of hurricanes and the radial wind 
and pressure profiles.  
In HOA, wind parcels start spiraling outward from the eye. The velocities are controlled by a predefined 
model. In this process, wind parcels search for a lower pressure zone (new eye position). Once new lower 
pressure is discovered, its position becomes the eye and the process starts all over again.  
To prove its performance, HOA is tested with several benchmark functions with different dimensions. The 
statistical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions. In 
further work, HOA should be compared to other metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
