Abstract 
The continuation education is very important for people who have left school to work to increase their competence and 
skills. To avoid the disadvantages of the common test paper generating methods, genetic algorithm is used to generate the 
test paper automatically. The concrete design process of test paper generating based on genetic algorithm is discussed in 
this paper, and some corresponding parameters setting have been compared and defined. The application results 
demonstrated that the genetic algorithm was an effective tool in the test paper generating.

1. Introduction 
In the continuation education, the exam, which is the key stage in the course of the whole teaching process, 
plays an important role in estimating the competence and learning effects of the students, and is also an 
effective method of measuring the teaching effects of the particular teacher. However, there are some 
disadvantages in the common method of test paper generating, and thus leading to obvious deviation from the 
reasonable distribution of the different parts of the specific subject.

With the rapid development and application of the modern computer technology, a new kind of cross 
subject—computer aided teaching (CAT)—is coming into use in the continuation education field. By means 
of this kind of technology, the test paper can be generated automatically with the help of the computer, thus 
the disadvantages of the traditional test paper generating method can be overcome, and the teachers’ time and 
efforts can be saved.  
The test paper generating system is an expert system to generate the test paper automatically according to 
such specified parameters as the number and the type of the exam questions, the degree of difficulty, the scope 
of knowledge, etc. Most of the traditional test paper generating algorithms are easy to lead to local optimal 
solution and slow convergence. In this paper, we present an efficient intelligent paper generating method 
based on the genetic algorithm according to the mathematical model and better effects have been obtained. 
2. Principle of Genetic Algorithm 
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a kind of stochastic search process that is capable of adaptive and robust 
searching over a wide range of searching space, which ﬁrst appeared in the Ph.D. thesis of Bagay in 1967. In 
1975, genetic algorithm was ﬁrst introduced by Prof. Holland for use and admitted formally. A typical genetic 
algorithm in its simple form works with a set of N data structures called individuals, each representing a 
separate solution to the specific problem [1-2]. 
In genetic algorithm, the calculations are performed with a population of individuals in following steps  
(1) Generate randomly an initial population of possible solutions (candidates chromosomes); 
(2) Decode the chromosomes to obtain a set of parameters for each individual; 
(3) Select a pair of individuals according to the ﬁtness function, which is a measure of the quality of this 
solution; 
(4) Parent individuals are selected for reproduction proportional to a ﬁtness value and mutate each bit of 
each parents with mutation probability; 
(5) Each pair of parents creates a pair of new individuals called o�springs, partially by recombining 
(crossover), partially by mutating chromosomes of the best-ﬁtted individuals; 
(6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the stopping criterion is satisﬁed.
3. Design method 
3.1. Description of Algorithm 
Suppose yi, hi, ji(j=1, 2, 3…k, k is the levels of the teaching difficulties, here k=5) represent the ratio of 
scores with difficulty i required by the customer, the ratio of scores with difficulty i in the practical generated 
test paper, and the permission error of the ratio of scores with difficulty i, which is evaluated according to 
formulas (1) and (2).

It can be concluded from formulas (1) and (2) that the smaller f is, the smaller the error between the 
generated test paper and what the customer requires is. The test questions in the test question base may be 
indexed according to the types of the test questions, it’s easy to meet the customers’ demands if there are

enough amounts of test questions in the test question base [3]. Therefore, the object function of solving the 
problem of test paper generating can be obtained to be 
Min(f)=f1

3.2. Design Process 
(1) Chromosomes coding and population initialization 
To solve a problem with genetic algorithm, the solutions space of the problem should first be mapped to be 
a set of codes. The binary code is used in the classical genetic algorithm, which “1” means a question item is 
selected, and “0” means a question item is not selected. This is an easy coding method, but the question 
number can not be controlled exactly and the coding is very long when the test base is very large. If the real 
number coding is utilized, the optimization efficiency will be increased effectively.  
(2) Adaption function 
In genetic algorithm, the bigger the adaption values, the better the individual. The test paper generating 
model is a minimal problem in this paper. The object function can be transformed to be the adaption function 
F�  according to formula (4):

The exponent ratio will allow the individuals to have more duplicating chances, and it also restrict the 
duplicating numbers [4-6]. So the above formula can be transformed to be the following formula:

where � is selected to be 0.03. 
(3) Design of genetic operator

where M is the population scale, Fi is the adaption value of the ith individual. 
Match the individuals that are selected according to the above method in pairs randomly, every pair is 
crossed evenly and exchanged at a certain cross probability Pc, therefore two new individuals are generated [7, 
8]. First randomly generate a real number r1 which is between 0 and 1, if r1<Pc and the exchange condition is 
satisfied, the two individuals are exchanged and two new individuals are generated, otherwise they are not 
exchanged. 
The effective evaluating index of a particular test paper is difficulty D, differentiation degree, reliability, 
and effectiveness. For the difficulty of a particular test paper, it can be described as the mean score rate P
which is shown in formula (7), or the difficulty weighted mean of the test problem which is shown in formula 
(8), or the mean score of the high scores H and the low scores L which is shown in formula (9).

(4) Standardization of test paper generating 
The index of the test problems is the important factor in the automatic test paper generating, including the 
full mark FM, the test range, the test time TT, and the types of the test problems, etc.  
The distribution curve, which is also called the index curve, is the ratio of the corresponding index in the 
test paper. The corresponding distribution curves are shown in table 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Applying the above genetic algorithm and the corresponding parameters setting to the automatic test paper 
generating system, a better effect has been obtained in several subjects of the test paper. In addition, the 
overall efficiency has been increased to a certain extent.  
4. Conclusion 
In the design of the test paper generating system based on genetic algorithm, an independent coding 
strategy is used, which is fitted to the practical condition of generating test paper. By means of selecting such 
parameters as the variation operator, the adaption crossing, and the weighted adaption function properly, there 
are no needs to control the problems’ type, the problems’ number, or the problems’ mark, and the efficiency 
has been increased to a great extent. On the basis of the effects obtained from practical application, it was 
demonstrated that the genetic algorithm is a powerful tool for parameter optimization, which can be 
successfully applied in many fields.
