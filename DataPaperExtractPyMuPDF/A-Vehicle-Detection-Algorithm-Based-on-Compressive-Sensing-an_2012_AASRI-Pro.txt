Abstract 
An efficient vehicle detection method is a necessity for the intelligent transportation system under the complicated traffic 
environment at present. To solve the problems of large computation and the poor real-time in traditional vehicle detecting 
methods, this article proposes a real-time vehicle detecting algorithm integrated compressive sensing (CS) theories and 
background subtraction method. In addition, this paper undertakes the reconstruction of foreground image of vehicle 
based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Proved by the experimental result, the proposed vehicle 
detection algorithm could produce higher precision detection, smaller calculation and higher-quality reconstructed image 
compared to the traditional ones.

Intelligent transportation system has attracted plenty of researchers. As one of the essential steps, vehicle 
detection [1] is extremely significant for video intelligent traffic monitoring system. 
The common methods for moving vehicle detection contain: optical flow [2], frame subtraction [3], and 
background subtraction [4]. For optical flow algorithm, it is of greatly large calculation and without of the 
real-time monitoring function. In view of the frame subtraction, it is hardly to get the complete vehicle 
information and the vehicle at low speed can not be detected. The background subtraction used in this article 
is the more popular algorithm at present [5-6]. At the earliest, Wren proposed the running-Gaussian-average 
background subtraction algorithm [7]. He believed that each pixel of the background image was independent 
and satisfied the Gaussian probability function. The algorithm was very fast and required small storing space, 
but the result of the background image was not good. Later, Koller made improvement in background 
updating, which did litter work on the basic of the former algorithm and increased the calculation. To suit the 
complicated external environment, Stauffer and Grimson carried out the background subtraction method 
based on Gaussian mixture model [8]. The algorithm obtained good performance for target detection, but was 
restricted to the calculation. Though many researchers proposed modifications for the model [9], it was 
difficult to solve the problem. The algorithms above are assessed in terms of the computing speed, the storage 
volume and complexity under the premise of the favourable detection. Then the target detecting methods 
based on data compression was emerged. B.Ugur suggested the wavelet-domain target detection algorithm 
[10]. Considering that the vehicle target possesses a small part in the background image which agrees to the 
characteristic of compressive sense sparse, this article integrates compressive sensing [11-13] and background 
subtraction method. The algorithm operates compressive sample on background image and input image 
respectively, from which the compressive measurement will be received, then subtracts the measurements of 
background image and input image to get the measurement of the target vehicle, and precisely reconstructs 
the vehicle information by orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm at last. As the background update is just 
conducted on the measurements, the calculation is largely decreased. 
2. The compressive sensing theory 
Suppose that we have an image X of size 
1
2
N
� N
and we vectorize it into a column vector x of size 
N �1
(

) by concatenating the individual columns of X in order. The nth element of the image vector x
is referred to as x(n), where 
1,

. Let us assume that the basis 
[ 1

�
�

 provides a K-sparse 
representation of x:

where ( )
� n
 is the coefficient of the nth basis vector 
n

ln  are 
the K-nonzero entries of the basis decomposition. Equation (1) can be more compactly expressed as follows 
x
� ��
                                                                             (2) 
where �  is an 
1

 to denote the 
p

the 
0

In the CS framework, it is assumed that the K-largest ( )
� n
 are not measured directly. Rather, M
� N
linear projections of the image vector x onto another set of vectors

 are measured:

                                                                  (3) 
where the vector 
(
y M �1)
 constitutes the compressive samples and the matrix 
(

M
N

�
 is called the 
measurement matrix. Since M
� N
, recovery of the image X from the compressive samples y is 
underdetermined; however , as we discuss below, the additional sparsity assumption makes recovery possible. 
There exists a computationally efficient recovery method based on the following 
1� -optimization problem 
[11-12]: 
          
min � 1

                                                       (4) 
This optimization problem, also known as Basis Pursuit [11], can be efficiently solved using polynomial 
time algorithms. 
3. Vehicle detection algorithm based on CS 
Applying the background subtraction method based on CS, in this paper, the measurements of the video is 
firstly obtained through the compressive sample operated on the input video images. And then, the 
measurements of the background image will be achieved from the estimation of the former measurements. 
Besides, the background image needs real-time update considered about the changes in external environment. 
When conducting the background subtraction, the differential threshold operation should be undertaken on the 
measurements of background model and measurements of the real-time video frame image to determine 
whether there existed moving vehicle in the frame image. If there is no existence, drop the image. Otherwise, 
reconstruct the target vehicle image through the OMP image reconstruction algorithm in Ref. [14]. 
3.1. Background modeling and updating 
As background subtraction target detection algorithm has been widely applied to monitoring systems, the 
method of background subtraction is expanded to the image data compression domain [10]. In this paper, we 
use the data compression based on CS to realize background subtraction that estimating the measurement of 
the background image from the video-image measurement. Suppose that 
n
X ,
n
B represents the input image at 
present and the background image, respectively. And 
bn
y  is the measurement of 
n
B ,
tn
y  is what to 
n
X . Then, 
at the time of

ybn 1

where a is an integer close to 1, b is a number greater than 1. The threshold could be adjusted by changing 
the value of a and b.
3.2. Sparse representation for background subtraction image 
In traditional background subtraction method, the first step is to build the background model, then to 
conduct the subtraction between the input image and background image, set the threshold for subtracted 
image, and finally get the target. Though a great many of researchers’ works on the background modeling 
method, it is difficult to achieve the perfect result. What’s more, the estimation conducted through 
background modeling and updating for every pixel will make the calculation very large. The compressive 
sensing method used in this text overcomes the problem in traditional method which does not need modeling 
and updating for each pixel and is of no necessity for background image reconstruction. Instead, the proposed 
method subtracts on the measurement of background image compression sensing and it of the input image, as 
shown in expression (8).

4. Experiment and analysis 
The proposed algorithm was experimented under the environment of Matlab 2009. Fig.2 was the 50th frame 
of the traffic video self-recorded. Fig.3 was the result of the steps that compressively sampled from each 
frame of the image by random observation matrices, got the value of the 50th frame of the background image 
measured by background modeling and updating according to expression (5), and reconstructed the 
foreground image of vehicle for observation. The vehicle detecting result was shown in Fig.4, from which the 
complete and accurate vehicle contour was almost obtained.

5. Conclusions 
As an important part of modern intelligent transportation system, the high-efficient vehicle detecting 
algorithm has great significance for improving the reliability of intelligent transportation. For the 
characteristics of small amount of data for compressive sample and high precision for construction, the 
compressive sensing theory is suitable to apply to the vehicle detecting algorithm. As the few amount of the 
measurements on each frame of image through background model calculation, it is greatly decreased on 
computing operation. Proved by the experimental result, the proposed vehicle detection algorithm could 
produce higher precision detection, smaller calculation and higher-quality reconstructed image compared to 
the traditional ones.
