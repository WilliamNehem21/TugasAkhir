Abstract
In this paper, we shall integrate some ideas in terms of concepts in
topology. First, we introduce some new concepts of rough membership relations
and functions in the generalized covering approximation space. Second, we
introduce some topological applications namely ‘‘near concepts’’ in the general-
ized covering approximation space. Accordingly, several types of fuzzy sets are
constructed. The basic notions of near approximations are introduced and sufﬁ-
ciently illustrated. Near concepts are provided to be easy tools to classify the sets
and to help for measuring exactness and roughness of sets. Many proved results,
examples and counter examples are provided. Finally, we give two practical
examples to illustrate our approaches.

1. Introduction
Rough set theory, a mathematical tool to deal with inexact or uncertain knowledge
in information systems, has originally described the indiscernibility of elements by
equivalence relations. Covering rough sets [1–9,11,12] is a natural extension of clas-
sical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to cov-
erings. In our work [6], we have introduced a framework to generalize covering
approximation space that was introduced by Zhu [11]. In fact, we have introduced
the generalized covering approximation space Gn – CAS as a generalization to rough
set theory and covering approximation space. The Gn – CAS is deﬁned by the triple
hU; R; Cni, where U – ; be a ﬁnite set, R be a binary relation on U and Cn be n-cover
of U associated to R, where n 2 fr; lg (for more details see [6]).
The main works in this paper are divided into three parts. In the beginning of
work, we introduce some new generalized deﬁnitions to rough membership rela-
tions (resp. functions) and new types of fuzzy sets in Gn – CAS. Second part aims
to introduce one of an important topological concepts which are called ‘‘near con-
cepts’’ in rough context (specially, in Gn – CAS ). In fact, we apply near concepts in
Gn – CAS to deﬁne different tools for modifying the original operations. The sug-
gested methods in this paper represent easy mathematical tools to approximate the
rough sets and removing the uncertainty (vagueness) of sets. In addition, compar-
isons between the suggested methods are obtained and many examples (resp.
counter examples) to illustrate these connections are provided. Hence, we can
say that our approaches are very useful in rough context namely, in information
analysis and in decision making. Finally, in the end of paper, simple practical
examples are provided to illustrate the suggested methods and to show the impor-
tance of these methods in rough context namely in information system and in
multi-valued information system. In addition, we give some comparisons between
our approaches and others approaches such as Pawlak and Lin approaches.
2. j-Rough membership relations, j-rough membership functions and j-fuzzy sets
The present section is devoted to introduce new deﬁnitions for rough membership
relations and functions as easy tools to classify the sets and help for measuring
exactness and roughness of sets. These rough membership functions allow us to
deﬁne four different fuzzy sets in Gn – CAS. Moreover, the suggested rough mem-
bership relations (resp. functions) are more accurate than classical rough member-
ship function that was given by Lin [10] and the other types.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then we say that:
(i) x is ‘‘j-surely’’ belongs to A, written x 2j A, if x 2 Rj A
ð Þ.
(ii) x is ‘‘j-possibly’’ belongs to X, written x �2j A, if x 2 RjðAÞ.
52
M.E. Abd El-Monsef et al.
These two rough membership relations are called ‘‘j-strong’’ and ‘‘j-weak’’
membership relations respectively.
Lemma 2.1. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then the following state-
ments are true in general:
(i) x 2j A implies x 2 A.
(ii) x 2 A implies x �2j A.
Proof. Straightforward. �
The converse of the above lemma is not true in general, as the following exam-
ple illustrates:
Example
2.1. Let
hU; R; Cni
be
a
Gn – CAS,
where
U ¼ a; b; c; d

ðc; c

g. We will show the above remark in
case of j ¼ r and the other cases similarly: Suppose that A ¼ a; b; d
f
g, then we get
Rr A
ð Þ ¼ a; b
f
g and RrðAÞ ¼ U. Clearly d 2 A but d Rr A and c �2r A but c R A.
The following proposition is very interesting since it is give the relationships
between different types of membership relations 2j and �2j. Accordingly, we will
illustrate the importance of using these different types of these membership
relations.
Proposition 2.1. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then the following are
true generally
(i) If x 2i A ) x 2r A ) x 2u A.
(iii) If x �2u A ) x �2r A ) x �2i A.
(ii) If x 2i A ) x 2l A ) x 2u A.
(iv) If x �2u A ) x �2l A ) x �2i A.
Proof. We will prove the ﬁrst statement and the others similarly:
ið Þ If x 2i A ) x 2 Ri A
ð Þ ) x 2 Rr A
ð Þ ) x 2r A.
Also, if x 2r A ) x 2 Rr A
ð Þ ) x 2 Ru A
ð Þ ) x 2u A. �
The converse of the above proposition is not true in general as the following
example illustrates.

c Rl A. By similar way, we can illustrate the others cases.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then for each
j 2 r; l; i; u

The j- rough membership functions on U for subset A are l j

l j

j
Nj x

and A
j j denotes the cardinality of A.
The rough j-membership function expresses conditional probability that x
belongs to A given R and can be interpreted as a degree that x belongs to A in view
of information about x expressed by R. Moreover, in case of inﬁnite universe, the
above membership function l j
A can be use for spaces having locally ﬁnite minimal
neighborhoods for each point.

One of the key issues in all fuzzy sets is how to determine fuzzy membership
functions. A membership functions provides a measure of the degree of similarity
of element to fuzzy set. The following deﬁnition uses the j-rough membership
functions l j
A to deﬁne four different types of fuzzy sets in Gn – CAS.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then the j-fuzzy sets in U
is the set of ordered pairs:

3. Near rough concepts in the generalized covering approximation space Gn CAS
The main goal of this section is to introduce one of the important topological
applications which are named ‘‘near concepts’’ in Gn – CAS. Moreover, we intro-
duce the new concepts ‘‘j-near approximations’’ (resp. j-near boundary regions
and j-near accuracy measures) to generalize the j-approximations (resp. j-
boundary regions and j-accuracy measures). In addition, we introduce near exact-
ness and near roughness by applying near concepts to make more accuracy for
deﬁnability of sets in Gn – CAS.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Thus we deﬁne ‘‘near
rough’’ sets in U as follows: For each j 2 r; l; i; u
f
g, the subset A is called
(i) j-Pre rough set (brieﬂy pjÞ if A # Rj RjðAÞ
�
�
.
(ii) j-Semi rough set (brieﬂy sjÞ if A # Rj RjðAÞ
�
�
.
(iii) cj-rough set if A #
Rj Rj
�
�
�
�
[ Rj RjðAÞ
�
�
�
�
.
The above sets are called ‘‘j-near rough sets’’ and the families of j-near rough
sets of U denotes by Kj U
ð Þ, for each K 2 fP; S; cg.

Remark 3.1. The family of j-pre rough sets and the family of j-semi rough sets are
not comparable as the following example illustrates.
Example 3.1. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, where U ¼ a; b; c; d
f

R ¼

We will show the above remark in case of j ¼ r and the other cases similarly as
follows:
Nr a
ð Þ ¼ a; b
f
g ¼ Nr b
ð Þ;
Nr c
ð Þ ¼ U;
Nr d
ð Þ ¼ d
f g:
Thus, we compute the j-near rough sets for j ¼ r as follows:
The family of r-pre rough sets is: Pr U

is:

The main goal of the following deﬁnitions is to introduce the new approxima-
tion operators (j-near approximations) which modify and generalize the j-
approximations.
Deﬁnition 3.2. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then we deﬁne the j-near
approximations of any subset A as follows: For each j 2 r; l; i; u
f
g
(i) The j-pre lower and the j-pre upper approximations of A are deﬁned respec-
tively by
Rp

ð Þ ¼ x 2 AjNj x

�
and Rp
j ðAÞ ¼ A [ fx 2 AcjNjðxÞ \ RjðAÞ – ;g
(ii) The j-semi lower and the j-semi upper approximations of A are deﬁned
respectively by
Rs
jðAÞ ¼ x 2 A NjðxÞ\RjðAÞ–;

and Rs
jðAÞ ¼ A[ x 2 RjðAÞ NjðxÞ#RjðAÞ

(iii) The cj-lower and the cj-upper approximations of A are deﬁned respectively by
Rc
j ðAÞ ¼ Rp
j ðAÞ [ Rs
jðAÞ
and
Rc

j ðAÞ \ Rs
jðAÞ
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then we deﬁne the j-near
boundary, j-near positive and j-near negative regions of A are deﬁned respectively
as follows:
8j 2 r; l; i; u

A # U is deﬁned by

where Rk

Obviously 0 6 dk
j A
ð Þ 6 1:
Deﬁnition 3.5. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then, for each
j 2 r; l; i; u
f
g; k 2 fp; s; cg, the subset A is called ‘‘j-near deﬁnable (brieﬂy kj-
exact) set’’ if Rk
j A
ð Þ ¼ Rk
j ðAÞ ¼ A. Otherwise, it is called j-near rough (brieﬂy
kj-rough). It is clear that A is kj-exact if dk
j A
ð Þ ¼ 1 and Bk
j A
ð Þ ¼ ;. Otherwise, it
is kj-rough.
Remark 3.2. In the Gn – CAS; hU; R; Cni, we can compute the j-near approxima-
tions of any subset A # U, directly by using the j-approximations, as the following
lemma illustrates.
Lemma 3.1. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Then, for each j 2 r; l; i; u

Remark 3.3. The main goals of the following example are:
(i) The converse of the above results is not true in general.
(ii) Using near concepts in rough context is very useful for removing the vague-
ness of sets and accordingly, these approaches is very useful in decision
making.

By using Deﬁnitions 3.2 and 3.4, the following table gives comparisons between
the j-accuracy of approximations and the kj-accuracy of approximations of the all
subsets of U, where j ¼ r; 8k 2 fp; s; cg :
From Table 3.1, we notice that:
(i) Using cr in constructing the approximations of sets is more accurate than
others
types,
since
for
any
subset

and
dk
r A
ð Þ 6 dc

ð Þ; 8k 2 fp; sg. Thus, these approaches will helps to extract and
discovery the hidden information in data that collected from real-life appli-
cations. For example, all shaded sets in Table 3.1.
(ii) Every r-exact set is r-near exact, but the converse is not true. For example,
shaded sets in Table 3.1.
Remark 3.4. The following result is very interesting because it is prove that the j-
near approaches are more accurate than the j-approaches. Moreover, it is illus-
trates the importance of j-near concepts in exactness of sets.

4. j-near rough membership relations, j-near rough membership functions and j-near
fuzzy sets in Gn CAS
By considering j-near concepts, the new concepts ‘‘j-near rough membership rela-
tions’’ (resp. ‘‘j-near rough membership functions’’) are provided to modify and
generalize
the
j-membership
relations
(resp.
j-membership
functions)
in
Gn – CAS. The near rough membership functions are considered as easy tools to
classify the sets and help for measuring near exactness and near roughness of sets.
The existence of near rough membership functions made us introduce the concept
of near fuzzy sets.
Deﬁnition
4.1. Let
hU; R; Cni
be
a
Gn – CAS,
and
A # U.
Then
8j 2 r; l; i; u
f
g; k 2 fp; s; cg, we say:
(i) x is ‘‘j-near surely’’ (brieﬂy kj-surely) belongs to A, written x 2k
j A, if
x 2 Rk
j A
ð Þ.
(ii) x is ‘‘j-near possibly’’ (brieﬂy kj-possibly) belongs to X, written x �2k
j A, if
x 2 Rk
jðAÞ.

Lemma
4.1. Let
hU; R; Cni
be
a
Gn – CAS,
and
A # U.
Thus
8j 2 r; l; i; u
f
g; k 2 fp; s; cg, the following statements are true in general:
(i) If x 2k
j A implies to x 2 A.
(ii) If x 2 A implies to x �2j A.
Proof. Straightforward. �
The converse of the above lemma is not true in general, as the following exam-
ple illustrates:
Example 4.1. Consider U ¼ a; b; c; d
f
g and R ¼
ða; a

ð
Þ; c; a
ð
Þ; c; d
ð

Thus, we get Nr a
ð Þ ¼ a
f g; Nr b
ð Þ ¼ a; b
f
g, Nr c
ð Þ ¼ a; c; d
f
g; Nr d
ð Þ ¼ d
f g.
We will show the above remark in case of ðj ¼ r and k ¼ pÞ and the other cases
similarly:
Suppose that A ¼ b; d
f
g, then we get Rp
r A
ð Þ ¼ d
f g and Rp
rðAÞ ¼ fb; c; dg.
Clearly d 2 A but d Rp
r A and c �2p
r A but c R A.
Remark 4.1. We can redeﬁne the j-near approximations by using 2k
j and �2k
j as
follows:
For any A; B # U :
Rk
j A
ð Þ ¼
x 2 U x 2k
j A
���
n
o
and Rk
j ðAÞ ¼
x 2 U x �2k
j A
���
n

.
The following proposition is very interesting since it is give the relationships
between the j-rough membership relations and j-near rough membership relations.
Accordingly, we will show the importance of using these different types of j-near
rough membership relations.

then
we
get

Clearly c 2s

Also RrðBÞ ¼ fb; c; dg and Rs
rðBÞ ¼ fb; dg. Clearly c �Rs

c R B.
Deﬁnition 4.2. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A # U. Thus we can deﬁne the j-
near
rough

functions
for
Gn – CAS
as
follows:
For
each
j 2 r; l; i; u
f
g; k 2 fp; s; cg and x 2 U, the j-near rough membership functions on
U for subset A are l

The following result is very interesting since it gives the relation between the
rough j-membership functions and j-near rough membership functions. Moreover,
it illustrates the importance of j-near rough membership functions.
Lemma 4.2. Let hU; R; Cni be a Gn – CAS, and A; B # U. Then, for each

(ii) l j

Proof. (i) If l j

x 2 Rk

Accordingly,

(ii) If l j

5. Illustrative examples
The main goal of this section is to introduce two practical examples in order to
illustrate the importance of applying near concept in rough context. In the ﬁrst
example we use an equivalence relation that induced from an information system
and hence we compare between our approaches and Pawlak approach. In the sec-
ond example, we apply our approaches in a multi-valued information system
(MVIS) [14]. This type of information system is generalization to information sys-
tem which uses an arbitrary binary relation and thus Pawlak approach does not ﬁt
in this type. Lin [10] introduced general rough membership function depending on
an arbitrary binary relation, these rough membership function coincide with our j-
rough membership function in the case of j ¼ r only. But, the other types j of our j-
rough membership functions are more accurate than j ¼ r, so we can see that our
approaches are the appropriate tools for these types and very useful in information
analysis. Finally, in the second example we introduce a comparison between our
approaches and Lin method.
Example 5.1. Consider the following information system as in Table 5.1 that
represents the data about 6 students, as shown below.
From Table 5.1, we have.
The set of universe: U ¼ f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g,
Generalized covering approximation space and near concepts
65
The
set
of
attributes:
AT ¼ Analysis; Algebra; Statistics

f
g ¼ D,
The
sets
of
values:
VAnalysis ¼ fBad; Goodg; VAlgebra ¼ fBad; Goodg,
VStatistics ¼ fBad; Medium; Goodg and VDecision ¼ fAccept; Rejectg.
But
we
take
the
set
of
condition
attributes,
C ¼ Analysis; Algebra;
f
Statisticsg.
Thus we have: U=C ¼

f g; 2; 5
f

f g; 4
f g; 6
f g
f
g and the set of r-pre rough set
is
Pr U
ð Þ ¼ } U
ð Þ ðset of all subsets in UÞ:
Suppose that X Decision : Accept
ð
Þ ¼ f1; 2; 3; 6g. Thus we compute the rough
membership function with respect to Pawlak [13,14] and with respect to our
approaches as follows:
Pawlak Deﬁnition [13,14] (rough membership function):
For x ¼ 1, then lC

Moreover, for some elements that has decision (Reject) such that 5 we get:

But

our
deﬁnition:

This means that 5 does not belongs to the set X Decision : Accept
ð
Þ ¼ f1; 2; 3; 6g
which is coincide with Table 5.1. Hence, our approaches are more accurate than
Pawlak deﬁnition.
Example 5.2. Consider the following multi-valued information system (MVIS) as
in Table 5.2. Suppose we are given data about 5 persons, as shown below.
Where
R1 ¼ Languages ¼ fEnglish; German; Arabicg,
R2 ¼ Sports ¼
fHandball; Basketball; Tennis
g
and
R3 ¼ Skills ¼
fSwimming; Running; Fishingg such that xRny; 8n ¼ 1; 2; 3.
We will use the case of j ¼ r and k ¼ c as follows:
aR1 ¼ a; b
f
g;
bR1 ¼ b
f g;
cR1 ¼ b; c; d
f
g;
dR1 ¼ d

eR1 ¼ d; e

aR3 ¼ a; b

g;
bR3 ¼ a; b
f
g;
cR3 ¼ c; d
f
g;
dR3 ¼ d
f g;
eR3 ¼ d; e
f
g:
In order to represent the set of all condition attributes, we generate the following
relation from all above relations as follows: xR ¼ T3
n¼1xRn. Thus we get
aR ¼ a; b
f
g; bR ¼ b
f g; cR ¼ c; d
f
g; dR ¼ d
f g; eR ¼ e
f g.
Clearly, this relation is symmetry relation (reﬂexive and symmetric) but is not
transitive and thus it is not equivalence relation. Hence, Pawlak approach does not
ﬁt in this case, so we use Lin deﬁnition and our approaches as follows:

It is clear that Lin rough membership function is the same as r-rough member-
ship function. Moreover, our approaches l-rough (resp. i-rough) membership
function is more accurate than r-rough membership function and Lin rough mem-
bership function. Finally, we can also apply j-near rough membership function as
in Example 5.1.

6. Conclusions and future works
In this work, we introduced one of an important topological application that
named ‘‘near concepts’’ in rough context. Accordingly, different types of approx-
imations (resp. rough membership relations and functions) were provided to be
easy mathematical tools to classify the sets and help for measuring exactness
and roughness of sets. These tools are more accurate than other types that were
deﬁned by others authors. Consequently, our approaches are very interesting in
decision making. We believe that these structures are useful in the applications
and thus these techniques open the way for more topological applications in rough
context and help in formalizing many applications from real-life data. In our
future works, we will apply the suggested methods in this paper in real life appli-
cations and problems.
