The agriculture sector is no exception to the widespread usage of deep learning tools and techniques. In this
paper, an automated detection method on the basis of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models
is proposed to identify and classify paddy crop biotic stresses from the ﬁeld images. The proposed work also pro-
vides the empirical comparison among the leading CNN models with transfer learning from the ImageNet
weights namely, Inception-V3, VGG-16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121 and MobileNet-28. Brown spot, hispa, and
leaf blast, three of the most common and destructive paddy crop biotic stresses that occur during the ﬂowering
and ripening growth stages are considered for the experimentation. The experimental results reveal that the
ResNet-50 model achieves the highest average paddy crop stress classiﬁcation accuracy of 92.61% outperforming
the other considered CNN models. The study explores the feasibility of CNN models for the paddy crop stress
identiﬁcation as well as the applicability of automated methods to non-experts.

1. Introduction
India is a rice-growing country with a wide range of rice varieties
adapted to wide spectrum of agro-climatic conditions. As a result, the
crop has become a host for a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses, all
of which have a negative impact on crop productivity and survival.
Realizing the economic losses caused by them, efforts have been made
to comprehend the importance of integrated and automated paddy
crop management for the timely intervention and mitigation of the
stresses. Furthermore, experts and politicians are also concerned
about improving paddy production and yield. The agricultural experts
identify the stress categories by the visual inspection of individual
paddy plant leaf which is subjective and tedious in nature. The paddy
crop stresses have a complicated composition, and their presentation
in different paddy crop varieties is very similar, making classiﬁcation
challenging. The goal of quickly identifying crop stress has various
advantages for potential farmers and agriculture science researchers.
Crop yields can be effectively increased by intervening early and miti-
gating stress-related issues using suitable crop management strategies
that take advantage of technology. This necessitates ongoing study in
agriculture science and technological adoption.
In agriculture, emerging technologies such as Big Data, Machine
Learning, and the Internet of Things have been widely used to improve
all parts of rice production processes, ushering in a new era of smart
farming. Signiﬁcant gains in agricultural tasks have been noticed as a
result of innovations in AI-based deep convolutional neural networks.
Plant disease recognition, crop/weed separation, fruit grading, and
land stat classiﬁcation are just a few examples of agricultural applica-
tions where CNNs achieve human-level accuracy. Several improve-
ments have been made in the architecture of CNN with the gradual
increase in the number of layers to make CNN scalable to multiclass
problems. The most popular CNN models are GoogLeNet, AlexNet,
Inception-V3, VGG-16, DenseNet-128, and ResNet-50. One of the appli-
cations under consideration in this work is the processing of images of

paddy plant leaves using the various leading transfer learning CNN
models. Literature searches have been conducted in this regard to
learn about recent deep learning applications in the core topic of the
current research.
A pre-trained VGG-16 model is deployed for automatic recognition
and categorization of diverse paddy crop biotic and abiotic stresses
using ﬁeld images. To illustrate the technological viability of applying
the deep learning method, researchers have used 30,000 ﬁeld images
from ﬁve different paddy crop varieties with 12 different stress classiﬁ-
cations. An average classiﬁcation accuracy of 92.89% is achieved (Anami
et al., 2020b). An upgraded VGG-19 model which was pre-trained on
ImageNet public image dataset is deployed for the classiﬁcation of ﬁve
categories of paddy crop stresses using leaf images. The augmented
image dataset is used in the experimentation. An average accuracy of
92% is obtained (Chen et al., 2020). Different CNN models are employed
for the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant diseases. The VGG-16,
Inception-V4, ResNet, and DenseNet models have deployed to experi-
ment on the PlantVillage image dataset which includes 38 different
categories of diseased and healthy leaf images from 14 different plants.
It is reported that DenseNet provides a better classiﬁcation accuracy
score of 99.75%, outperforming the other architectures (Yakkundimath
et al., 2022). Four prominent CNN models are used to construct an auto-
mated wheat disease diagnosis system. There are 50,000 labeled images
of healthy and afﬂicted wheat crop leaves in the image dataset. The
greatest average recognition accuracy of the VGG-16 model is 97.95%
(Lu et al., 2017a). The LeNet-5 and AlexNet models are employed for
paddy crop disease identiﬁcation using an image dataset containing
500 images of stable and diseased rice leaves and stems. An average
identiﬁcation accuracy of 95.48% is achieved using the AlexNet model.
The work has also showed that the stochastic pooling technique
improves the CNN model's generalization ability and avoids over-
ﬁtting (Lu et al., 2017b). The ﬁeld images are used to identify 12
categories of biotic and abiotic paddy crop stresses using conventional
image classiﬁers such as Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k−NN). The
maximum average classiﬁcation accuracy achieved by the BPNN classi-
ﬁer was 89.12% (Anami et al., 2020a).
The usefulness of pre-trained deep learning CNN models for
constructing non-destructive and cost-effective systems to automate
the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of rice crop diseases can be seen
with a literature review. Using traditional image processing techniques,
signiﬁcant attempts have been made to automatically identify and clas-
sify paddy crop diseases from individual leaf images (Huang et al., 2015;
Mohan et al., 2016; Mohanty et al., 2016; Orillo et al., 2014; Pugoy and
Mariano, 2011; Phadikar et al., 2012; Phadikar et al., 2013; Sethy et al.,
2020). The literature survey reveals the potential of pre-trained deep
learning CNN models in the recognition and classiﬁcation of paddy
crop diseases from the public image datasets (Hughes and Salathé,
2015; Saleem et al., 2020; Yakkundimath et al., 2022). This has
stimulated interest in developing a sophisticated paddy crop stress rec-
ognition system for use in developing crop management strategies.
There are four sections to the paper. The proposed methodology is
presented in Section 2. The classiﬁcation results of the considered CNN
models are described in Section 3. The work's conclusion is presented
in Section 4.
2. Proposed methodology
The overall methodology for the study is depicted in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst
step is to select an image dataset that depicts various biotic diseases on
rice crop leaves. The next step is to label or annotate the training dataset.
The learned CNN models' performance is then assessed on the testing
image dataset. The hyper parameters are adjusted to improve the CNN
models' performance. Finally, the different CNN models' classiﬁcation
performance is compared.
2.1. Image dataset
For dataset preparation, ﬁve popular paddy crop varieties, namely,
Jaya, Abhilasha, Mugad Suganda, Mugad 101, and Mugad Siri are
considered. The images were captured in the ﬁeld under natural light
condition near solar noon which is the period with the most consistent
illumination using a Nikon D3300 Digital SLR camera having a resolu-
tion of 60 megapixels. Some of the stressed paddy crop images are
imported from PlantVillage image dataset. The PlantVillage is an openly
and publicly available dataset that includes 54,306 images and 26 dis-
eases affecting 14 different plants. The image dataset comprises a total
of 3355 images, among which 523 images of Brown Spot symptom,
565 images of Hispa pests, and 779 images of Leaf Blast symptoms.
The remaining 1488 images are from a healthy paddy crops. Fig. 2
shows some images of paddy crops that are affected by various stresses.
The original image dataset comprising a total of 3355 paddy crop im-
ages are enhanced to 26,840 using various classical image augmentation
techniques such as translation, arbitrary rotations, shearing, scaling and
ﬂipping. The images collected from the dataset are of different sizes. The
image size is reduced to 400 × 400 pixels for minimizing the computa-
tional time required for further processing and their storage on the
medium. The dataset is partitioned into three sub-datasets: 70% for
training (18,788 images), 20% for validation (5368 images), and 10%
for testing (2684 images). The details of the ﬁnal image dataset used
in the work are depicted in Table 1. The images collected from the
dataset are of different sizes. The image size is reduced to 400 × 400
pixels for minimizing the computational time required for further
processing and their storage on the medium.

2.2. CNN classiﬁers
The present work has considered ﬁve high potential and commonly
used transfer learning models namely, VGG-16, Inception-V3 (Szegedy
et al. 2016), ResNet-50 (He et al. 2016), DenseNet-128 (Huang et al.,
2017), and MobileNet-28 (Howard et al., 2017) which are pre-trained
on ImageNet dataset (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2019).
The description of transfer learning mechanism is available in literature
(Yakkundimath et al., 2022). The descriptions of individual CNN models
are available in literature (Too et al., 2019). There are around 1.2 million
images and 1000 class categories in the ImageNet dataset. The steps
involved in training the considered CNN models on the prepared dataset
are given in Algorithm 1.

3. Experimental results and discussion
The paddy crop biotic stress classiﬁcation experiments are con-
ducted using the Deep Learning Toolbox provided by MATLAB 2021b
programming platform. The considered pre-trained CNN models are
imported and prepared them for transfer learning by editing suitable
layer properties using Deep Network Designer application. In all the
models, the last learnable layer and output or classiﬁcation layer are re-
placed to match the classes in newly constructed paddy crop biotic
stress image dataset. All the CNN model training and testing operations
are performed on a single workstation running on Windows 10 operat-
ing system, conﬁgured with Intel Core i7–11,700 processor, 16 GB of
RAM, and NVIDIA GPU with 12 GB memory. To get control over model
training, the signiﬁcant training options such as initial learn rate, valida-
tion frequency, number of epochs, and mini-batch size are initialized to
0.0001, 10, 30, and 32 respectively. All hidden layers are activated using
the ‘ReLu’ function, while the output layer is activated with the ‘softmax’
function. The network is ﬁne-tuned using a stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) algorithm with a categorical cross-entropy logarithmic loss func-
tion. Batch normalization is applied to improve overall accuracy and
faster learning.
The customized CNN models are trained and validated using the
augmented image dataset as depicted in Table 1. The individual CNN
model training progress, validation accuracy, loss, and other details of
training are graphically shown in Figs. 3–7. Fig. 8 shows the confusion
matrices for the considered CNN models when evaluated with the test
image dataset. The performance comparison of all the CNN models is
accomplished based on the evaluation metrics such as precision, recall
and F1 scores derived from the confusion matrices. The evaluation met-
ric scores and its computation time per epoch obtained by all the con-
sidered CNN models for the four classes of paddy crop images are
tabulated in Table 2. Table 2 shows that the ResNet-50 model has the
best
performance,
followed
by
the
DenseNet-128,
MobileNet,
Inception-V3, and VGG-16 models in that order. The ResNet-50 model
has yielded the highest evaluation metrics as well as the maximum val-
idation and testing accuracies of 96.65% and 92.61%, respectively and
reasonable computing time to attain best in classiﬁcation performance.
The performance comparison results of all the considered pre-trained
CNN models are graphically shown in Fig. 9.
4. Conclusions
The effectiveness of contemporary transfer learning models such as
Inception V3, VGGNet with 16 layers, ResNet with 50 layers, DenseNet
with 121 layers and MobileNet with 28 layers in the classiﬁcation of
paddy crop biotic stresses on ﬁve paddy crop varieties is explored in
the present work. Fine-tuning and evaluation of state-of-the-art deep
convolutional neural network models are utilized to determine the
best model. In the classiﬁcation of four categories of paddy crop stresses,
including
the
healthy
crop
category,
the
RestNet-50
model
outperformed all other models with the highest average classiﬁcation
accuracy of 92.61% by learning over 26,840 images. The ResNet-50 and
DenseNet-128 models have nearly identical classiﬁcation results. How-
ever, when training and testing times are taken into account, the
ResNet-50 model is effective. Since the work considers a larger number
of CNN models for the task of image-based paddy crop biotic stresses
classiﬁcation, the results are promising. But, work needs to be carried
out as future research is in improving the computational time. In the
present work, there is a scope for adding new stress categories as well
as enhancement of existing dataset with signiﬁcant number of stressed
paddy crop images. The work can be empowered with the sensor
