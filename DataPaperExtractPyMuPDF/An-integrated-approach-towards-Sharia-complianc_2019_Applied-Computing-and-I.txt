The Sharia compliance trust concerns over the conventional e-commerce systems among devoted Muslims
causesreluctance andabstinence to partake ine-commerce transactions. Although e-commerce trustbuild-
ing mechanisms have been highlighted in the extant literature, there has not been any integrative or
exhaustive solution to the Sharia compliance trust concerns of Muslims. Therefore, it became necessary
to develop a framework that will provide a guide towards achieving Sharia compliance e-commerce trust
(SCE-C). Consequently, relevant literature on e-commerce trust from a conventional perspective and the
Sharia perspective were reviewed to gain a background. It provided the basis for proffering a framework
for SCE-C trust with a view to enhancing e-commerce adoption and use by Muslims around the world.
The framework for SCE-C Trust highlights that e-commerce vendor trustworthiness factors comprising of
Sharia compliance, integrity, benevolence, competence, website quality, and third-party assurance if
positively moderated by consumer trust propensity and religious commitment will ensure SCE-C trust.

1. Introduction
There is a rapid increase in the acceptance and use of
e-commerce by both traditional businesses trying to develop new
online channels and new businesses that originate from the inter-
net [12]. This development is primarily attributed to the beneﬁts
ascribed to e-commerce, especially in the business to consumer
segment. However, issues of e-commerce trust have been a major
constraint to its adoption and use by many consumers around the
world [18,26]. There are recent clamor and research attention to
resolve the e-commerce trust concerns from an Islamic view point
which is guided by Sharia law [1,3,14,20]. It is therefore important
to ensure that e-commerce trust from the Sharia perspective is
developed in order to induce and cater the need of over 1.8 billion
Muslim around the globe [3,5,20].
The concerns among Muslims over non-Sharia compliance of
the conventional e-commerce system leads to reluctance and
abstinence
to
patronize
the
prevailing
e-commerce
system
[3,4,20]. Fundamentally, adherents of the Islamic religion are
guided by the Sharia law in all their endeavors. Thus, Muslims
are obligated to only patronize Sharia compliant goods and ser-
vices. It is therefore essential that e-commerce systems must be
in conformity with the Islamic law of contract which requires that
it must be devoid of fundamentally prohibited elements of riba
(usury), gharar (uncertainty), haram (forbidden) objects and maysir
gambling) to be deemed permissible to Muslims [17,20,22].
This paper proposes a framework that integrates the generic
antecedents of e-commerce trust with the Sharia compliance
requirements for e-commerce systems highlighted in the litera-
ture. It is aimed to foster Sharia compliance e-commerce SCE-C)
trust in order to enhance acceptance and use of e-commerce by
Muslim faithful’s around the world. Furthermore, it is envisaged
to bridge the gap between studies on e-commerce trust from a
conventional perspective [5,9,10,15,26] and e-commerce trust
from a Sharia perspective [6,14,17,22,23]. The next section of this
paper highlights related studies on e-commerce trust from a
conventional perspective and also, an Islamic perspective to
e-commerce trust. The subsequent sections present the framework
for SCE-C trust, then conclusion.
2. Literature review
2.1. E-commerce trust from a conventional perspective
To adequately understand the concept of trust, Chopra and Wal-
lace [7] articulated three elements of trust as, a trustee to whom it
is directed, the conﬁdence that trust will be upheld, and the will-
ingness to act in that direction. Similarly, Limbu et al. [13] high-
lighted the concept of trust based on trustor willingness to rely
on a trustee due to conﬁdence and belief that the trustee will
uphold trust. It is also perceived as a trust relationship that inter-
personally exists between trustors and trustees. Trust is therefore
central to the success of commerce and its impact has been felt
across market structures, processes, and relationships over the
years [22]. However, despite a shift in the business paradigm from
the traditional market frameworks to e-commerce, it is important
to consider and improve all the underlying trust mechanisms to
effectively build trust in e-commerce systems.
McKnight
&
Chervany
[15]
considered
the
typology
of
e-commerce trust by analyzing and distilling numerous deﬁnitions
of trust and coming up with the major trusting beliefs as compe-
tence, benevolence, integrity, and predictability. These trusting
beliefs have been exhaustively reviewed and adopted by various
studies over the years [1,26,28,27]. In an evaluation of the effect
of social presence SP) on e-commerce trust, Weisberg et al. [30]
focused on understanding and highlighting the e-commerce cus-
tomer experience with a view to predicting factors that inﬂuence
them. They found that participants with prior e-commerce pur-
chasing experience showed a higher perception of SP and have a
higher degree of trust.
Azam [4] highlights that perception-based factors, experience-
based factors, knowledge-based factors, and attitudes are the ante-
cedents of trust in e-commerce and subsequently e-loyalty. The
study revealed that e-commerce experiences are signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by perception-based factors in developing trust. The
dominant factors are Perceived familiarity, perceived similarity,
perceived control, word of mouth, and information received from
family and friends. Nonetheless, perceived similarity and perceive
control manifest as the most dominant factors for trust, while its
absence justiﬁes the low trust levels attributed to persons with
no e-commerce experience.
Fang et al. [9] while emphasizing the impact of trust on online
repurchase, they expressed that it is usually inﬂuenced by the con-
text. Consequently, this motivated researchers to further explore
e-commerce institutional context and its moderating effect on
trust and online repurchase. The institutional context is the formal
regulatory mechanism put in place to ensure that the e-commerce
transaction environment is safeguarded. The online repurchase
intention of e-commerce customers is determined by the level of
trust they have on an e-commerce vendor. Furthermore, online
customers evaluate their trust on e-commerce vendors based on
ﬁrst-hand information they receive.
Abdulgani & Suhaimi [1] stressed that many consumers abstain
from e-commerce due to trust-related concerns which negatively
inﬂuence their perceived risk of buying online. The factors that
determine e-commerce trust are e-commerce vendor trustworthi-
ness factors and their third party assurances, the trust propensity
of consumers and their religious commitment. Thus, these factors
negatively affect the perceived risk of e-commerce while inﬂuenc-
ing a consumer’s intention to purchase online in a positive manner.
Therefore, e-commerce trust is ascertained to be essential in devel-
oping or sustaining any relationship between customers and ven-
dors [10]. It is because online customers are more prone to
patronize trusted vendors of whom they have knowledge about
or who have earned the seal of trust from trusted third parties
and use secure payment systems [26].
2.2. E-commerce trust from an Islamic perspective
Islamic law denotes the same connotation to e-commerce as the
traditional commerce [3,20,28,31]. It is obligatory for e-commerce
systems and the transactions they carry out to comply with the
fundamental requirements of Islamic law of contract. This is
indeed aimed at protecting people from harm and ensuring the
mutual good of all transacting parties. Thus, e-commerce systems
are required to fulﬁll the form (offer and acceptance), the contract-
ing parties (buyer and seller) and the subject matter (object and
price) requirements stipulated by the Islamic law of contract to
be adjudged Sharia compliant. Furthermore, it has been critically
highlighted that Sharia compliance requirements for e-commerce
systems must be devoid of the fundamentally prohibited elements
of riba, gharar, haram objects, and maysir [20,24,31].
Contextually, an e-commerce offer is considered to be the initial
proposal made by either party (buyer or seller) in a contract and
the acceptance refers to the consent of the other party expressing
his or her agreement to the terms of the offer. Traditionally, offer
and acceptance is done verbally but Muslim scholars also acknowl-
edge its validity through writing or through an electronic medium
as applicable in e-commerce [17,20,22,31]. However, the process of
offer and acceptance must be connected, clear and consistent
throughout the transaction session. Muhammad & Muhammad
2
M.B. Ribadu, W.N. Wan Ab. Rahman / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 1–6
[22] highlighted that the meeting session in an e-commerce trans-
action begins when sellers advertisement of products on their
website, whereas a customer acknowledges acceptance after
selecting products of interest and reviewing features, prices, and
delivery information, and consequently proceeding to checkout.
The numerous capabilities, functionalities, and the interactive nat-
ure of e-commerce further enhance e-commerce fulﬁllment of the
Sharia compliance requirements for offer and acceptance as evi-
dent from a review of Amazon.com [20].
The second requirement for compliance with the Islamic law of
contract in both traditional and e-commerce systems is to ensure
free and mutual consent by both contracting parties [3,20]. Fur-
thermore, they must have the legal capacity and authority to exe-
cute a contract. It implies the seller must be the rightful owner
with the right to transfer ownership to a buyer. Both the buyer
and the seller must also be of a sane mind and must attain the
age of puberty. Although it is argued that, the legal capacity of
an e-commerce customer to engage in a transaction can simply
be determined by the possession of debit or credit card which is
the predominant payment method used [2,3,19,20]. Because it is
a universal norm for bank customers to be determined to have
attained the legal age (puberty age) and of sane mind to be issued
a banking card.
The Sharia compliance requirements for the subject matter
object and price) in e-commerce entails the subject of the contract
to be lawful, valuable, existent, deliverable and precisely deter-
mined [19,20,22]. Any ambiguity over the object of a contract, its
price, or deliverability can lead to gharar which is a fundamentally
prohibited element in Sharia. However, advances in e-commerce
have tackled these concerns through clear products displays,
descriptions, reviews, prices, and delivery options. Therefore, con-
ventional e-commerce systems that adhere to best practices usu-
ally fulﬁlls these stipulated Sharia compliance requirements
except where goods or services are haram, where ribawi items such
as currency, gold, and silver are sold based on deferred delivery
and/or using a riba-based medium of payment [20]. A critical and
comprehensive review of the Sharia compliance requirements for
e-commerce systems from extant literature by Ribadu & Wan Ab.
Rahman [24] is depicted in Table 1.
Adhering to these Sharia compliance requirements is very fun-
damental in ensuring e-commerce trust among devoted Muslims
around the world. Muhammad et al. [20] explained that all forms
of business transactions (e-commerce inclusive) are permissible
in Islam unless where the clearly violate Sharia principles. Further-
more, all transactions must ensure justice to all parties and the
processes involved must be free from fundamentally prohibited
elements of riba, gharar, maysir, and haram objects. Literally, riba
means to increase or a practice of lending money at a ﬁxed interest
[11,17]. Riba is a fundamentally prohibited element that is clearly
forbidden by Islam [3,20,24,31]. Therefore, it is forbidden to utilize
any riba credit card or any other interest-bearing medium of pay-
ment for both ofﬂine and online use.
Today, Muslims can conveniently do away with riba prone
mediums of payment, especially with the rise of Islamic banks
and the option for Sharia-compliant credit cards, use of debit cards,
pay on delivery and other non-interest payment options. Whereas
gharar is associated with uncertainties and risk associated with a
system or transaction. Therefore, it is unlawful to engage in any
kind of transaction with a high uncertainty or excessive risk
[3,17,22,29,31]. For that reason, it is mandatory to ensure that both
buyers and sellers have adequate information of the terms, values,
existence, obtainability, quantity, quality, and attributes should be
identiﬁed and its deliverability must be guaranteed [20,21]. Islam
also forbids maysir, which means the acquisition of wealth by
chance [3]. This is meant to ensure justice and to promote industry
among individuals and societies. Similarly, it is forbidden to pro-
duce, sell, buy, advertise or engage in any form of haram product
or service. These include items such as alcohol, pork, musicals
and phonographic materials.
3. A framework for SCE-C trust
Based on the typology of e-commerce trust [15], the model for
building e-commerce trust from an Islamic law of contract per-
spective [22] and the Muslim-intention-to-purchase-online frame-
work [1], we proffer a framework for developing SCE-C trust. The
Framework for SCE-C trust is proposed to bridge the gap between
studies on conventional e-commerce trust and e-commerce trust
from a Sharia perspective. This conﬂuence is bound to provide a
contextual
understanding
in
developing
SCE-C
trust
among
Muslim consumers. Unlike previous e-commerce trust frame-
works, a dual approach is carried out to ensure that Sharia compli-
ance requirements are fulﬁlled at the same time addressing the
traditional e-commerce trust concerns customers.
The SCE-C trust framework postulates Sharia compliance, integ-
rity, competence, benevolence, and SCE-C web quality as factors
that will positively inﬂuence e-commerce vendor trustworthiness.
These factors are moderated by the third party assurances of ven-
dors, and the religious commitment and trust propensity of con-
sumers towards SCE-C trust. Therefore, this study postulates a
positive moderating relationship between consumer religious
commitment, trust propensity, and third party assurances of a site
and
consumer’s
perception
of
e-commerce
trustworthiness

website quality and third party assurance) and consequently SCE-C
trust. These relationships are depicted in the framework for SCE-C
Trust (Fig. 1).
3.1. Religious commitment
Religious commitment is an individual’s level of devotion to the
teachings and practice of Islamic religion in this context [1]. For the
Muslims, it is obligatory to patronize only products and services
that are deemed Sharia compliant. Therefore, a Muslim with high
religious
commitment
will
be
hesitant
to
engage
in
an
e-commerce transaction that is perceived to be non-Sharia compli-
ant [19,20]. Thus, the higher the religious commitment of a Muslim
consumer, the more likely he or she will perceive a SCE-C platform
to be trustworthy and inclined towards SCE-C trust. Similarly,
when an e-commerce platform is deemed not Sharia compliant,
the less it will be perceived as trustworthy or be trusted by
consumers.
3.2. Trust propensity
Trust propensity is a factor of an individual willingness to
depend on the commitment of others [1,28]). Therefore, the inﬂu-
ences of e-commerce trust factors are positively moderated by a
consumer’s propensity to trust. Because, an individual’s propensity
to trust can be inﬂuenced by attributes such as cultural and
religious background, personality, and experience [1,25], whereas
Azam [4] articulated them as perception-based factors (PBFs),
experience-based factors (EBFs), knowledge-based factors (KBFs)
and attitude. Trust propensity is a consumer trait that moderates
the perception of e-commerce trustworthiness of online vendors.
Therefore, it can positively inﬂuence consumer perception of
e-commerce trustworthiness and SCE-C trust. It moderates the
relationship between e-commerce trustworthiness of a site and
SCE-C trust such that, the higher the trust propensity, the stronger
the positive relationship between e-commerce trustworthiness of
a site and SCE-C trust.
3.3. Third-party assurance
Third-party assurance is provided to customers as an assurance
and advisory service that aid an independent view of the controls
and processes of a web vendor. It is carried out based on certain
principles and criteria regarding the assurance offered. The third-
party assurance provides an endorsement of e-commerce vendors
through seals of approval, trust marks, directories of trusted sites,
trust intermediaries and label bureaus [1]. Islamic religious author-
ities can also serve as a third-party assurance body to certify the
Sharia compliance status of e-commerce systems is advocated
[3,20]. Therefore, we propose third-party assurance to encompass
assurances on Sharia compliance, process, and technology which
will ensure privacy for customers, security of transactions, and
SCE-C trust.
3.4. E-commerce trustworthiness
E-commerce trustworthiness is a factor of integrity, compe-
tence, benevolence and web quality inherent in an e-commerce
system [1,15,28,27]. McKnight et al. [16] validated integrity, com-
petence, and benevolence as factors that inﬂuence e-commerce
trust. Basically, trust reveals a trustee to whom trust is focused
on, the conﬁdence that trust will be upheld and the disposition
to act on that basis [7]. Therefore, the perception of e-commerce
trustworthiness is moderated by the religious commitment and
trust propensity of consumers and the third-party assurances of
an e-commerce site on SCE-C trust. E-commerce trustworthiness
of a site has a positive effect on SCE-C trust which is positively
inﬂuenced by Sharia compliance, integrity, competence, benevo-
lence and SCE-C website quality.
3.5. Sharia compliance
Sharia compliance denotes obedience to Sharia Law. Therefore,
e-commerce systems are required to work in conformity with the
principles of Islamic law of contract and to be devoid of fundamen-
tally prohibited elements (riba, gharar, maysir and haram objects) as
a prerequisite for Sharia compliance [20,22,24,32]. Islamic law of
contract
deﬁned
and
set
the
principles
for
fulﬁlling
form
(offer and acceptance), contracting parties (buyer and sellers)
and
subject
matter
(object
and
price)
requirements
by
an
e-commerce system. These requirements are primarily aimed at
ensuring cohesion and the mutual of vendors, customers, and the
society. Therefore, Sharia compliance of an e-commerce site is pos-
itively related to Muslim consumer’s perception of SCE-C trust.

3.6. Integrity
Integrity is a quality of honesty and uprightness that is guided
by moral principles [28]. Therefore, it reﬂects the expectation of
an e-commerce vendor to act in good faith, with absolute honesty
and be guided by ethical obligations from initiation to the fulﬁll-
ment of an e-commerce transaction. Integrity is mainly centered
around the character of the trustee and the ability to fulﬁll pro-
mises and obligations to the trustor. Furthermore, it is an impor-
tant component of e-commerce vendor trustworthiness and a
prerequisite
for
SCE-C
trust.
Therefore,
the
integrity
of
an
e-commerce site is positively related to a consumer’s perception
of e-commerce trustworthiness and SCE-C trust.
3.7. Competence
Competence depicts the ability of a trustee to serve the needs of
a trustor [15]. It reﬂects the ability to successfully initiate and
accomplish e-commerce transaction by a vendor and the capacity
to produce desired results or effect in a system [1]. Furthermore,
it is a motivating force that reduces uncertainty and enhances
understanding, forecasting, and control of people’s behavior. The
competence of an e-commerce vendor is tested base on the ability
to ensure a hitch-free transaction experience. Therefore, the
competence of an e-commerce system is positively related to
consumer’s perception of SCE-C trust.
3.8. Benevolence
Benevolence is the general belief of extending goodwill to
others. It is seen as the concern and motivation of a trustee to
act in the interest of the trustor [15]. Therefore, benevolence is
the deliberate effort by an e-commerce vendor to serve the best
interest of his or her customers without any prejudice of their
knowledge. The extent of benevolence will reﬂect on the level of
trust a consumer has in a vendor [1]. Thus, the perception of
e-commerce vendor benevolence is positively related to SCE-C
trust.
3.9. SCE-C website quality
The concept of SCE-C website quality is a convergence of con-
ventional e-commerce website quality attributes of system quality,
information quality and service quality [8], in addition to ensuring
that Sharia compliance requirements are fulﬁlled. It entails the
desired characteristics of e-commerce systems such as reliability,
usability, assurances, empathy, and effective online support capa-
bilities. Furthermore, fulﬁlling the requirements of Islamic law of
contract which must be devoid of any fundamentally prohibited
element [3,22]. The concept of SCE-C website quality is postulated
considering the inﬂuence of web quality on consumer’s online pur-
chasing decisions and experience. Therefore, it is fundamental to
redress
e-commerce
quality
concerns
and
ensure
that
e-commerce systems provide operations, services, and information
in consonance with Sharia prescriptions.
3.10. SCE-C trust
SCE-C trust is posited to be a convergence of traditional antece-
dents of e-commerce trust and Sharia compliance requirements.
There is a consensus among researchers that SCE-C must fulﬁll
the obligations of Islamic law of contract and be free from any fun-
damentally prohibited element (riba, gharar, haram objects and
maysir) [20,22,24]). Siala [25] highlighted that, Muslim consumers
are inclined to trust and patronize only systems that fulﬁll Sharia
requirements and other ethical obligations. Therefore, SCE-C trust
is a factor of e-commerce system trustworthiness and third-party
assurance which is necessary to inﬂuence Muslim consumer inten-
tion to engage in e-commerce. It is also critical in ensuring
e-commerce inclusiveness of Muslims to accord them the sanctity
and beneﬁts of engaging e-commerce.
4. Conclusion
The most fundamental aspect in developing SCE-C trust is to
ensure adherence to the requirements of Islamic law of contract
and avoidance of any fundamentally prohibited element of riba,
gharar, haram objects, and maysir. These Sharia requirements are
hypothetically interwoven with some of the generic antecedents
of e-commerce trust such as, integrity, competence, quality and
ensuring the mutual good of contracting parties. Therefore, a con-
vergence of Sharia requirements and generic antecedents of
e-commerce trust is envisaged to bolster SCE-C trust. This will
enhance Muslim consumer’s intention to engage in an SCE-C trans-
action. It will also foster e-commerce inclusion for a huge number
of devoted Muslims around the world and guide future researchers
and other e-commerce stakeholders in the development processes
of SCE-C systems. The framework for SCE-C trust bridges the gap
between previous studies on e-commerce trust in a conventional
setting and recent studies that scrutinized e-commerce trust from
an Islamic perspective. Therefore, Sharia compliance, integrity,
competence, benevolence, website quality and third party assur-
ance of e-commerce systems will bring about SCE-C trust. While
these assertions stand to be very potent when put into the perspec-
tive of existing literature, further empirical studies need to be
carried out to validate the proposed framework.
