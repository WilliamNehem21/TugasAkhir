1. Introduction 
As the most traditional and mature way of generating electricity in the power industry, thermal power has 
its own advantages, but the industry itself faces many risks. So, it is important to the thermal power industry to 
have a systematic study of these risks and it has an important significance for both industry operators and 
national macroeconomic. Power industry is moving from monopoly to competition under the influence of 
deregulation, as the market instability and security risks of the electricity market, caused by fluctuations of the 
electricity price and raw materials price, has become a prominent issue. At the same time, according to China's 
electric power system planning, electric market will be eventually fully opened, the relationship between 
financial markets and power industry will be more closely, and market participants are facing unprecedented

market risks. Zheng Xinli considered that financial security is the core of industrial safety[1], so it is urgent and 
important to accelerate the improvement a modern financial system. Other researchers elaborated the basic 
framework of China's power financial markets, presented risk management strategies and methods[2-7]. Among 
above of these, the forecast of power financial environmental risk is a very important aspect, however, related 
literatures are very rare. 
Radial basis function (for short, RBF) neural network is a network of local approximation. It can 
approximate any continuous nonlinear mapping accuracy[8], as for it is more suitable for dynamic system 
modeling and pattern classification, this paper choose RBF neural network to forecast market risk and build a 
forecast based on RBF neural network model to analyze the environmental risks by choosing impact indicators 
of MA5, BIAS6 and PSY12. 
2. Financial environment risk 
Financial environment risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes on financial products held by power 
generation companies, and the risk of fluctuations in the overall financial environment. Financial investments 
are risky, financial environment risk happens when the stock market's volatility not conducive to investors, so 
investors cannot obtain expected investment return or even get losses. For example, the expected rate of return 
of 25% equity investment, while the actual rate of return of 18%, 12% deviation to reflect the risks. 
Different enterprises have appropriate investment strategies according to the characteristics of themselves. 
As the Power generation companies is very sensitive to changes in the prices of coal, Enterprises always hold 
investments Fuel-related stocks or futures to resolve the fuel market price fluctuations risk, which associated 
with risk. 
This paper was based on the stock price data of November 2010, analyzed stock index futures data and 
forecasted by using the RBF neural network method to take the future direction of risk of the occurrence and 
transmission. 
3. Radial basis function neural network 
Radial basis function neural network is a three-layer feed-forward network, including the input layer, 
hidden layer and output layer. Input layer consists of source nodes; hidden layer is the second layer, the 
number of nodes is as required; output layer responds to the input mode. From the input layer to hidden layer 
transformation is nonlinear, while the transformation from hidden layer to output layer is linear. The activation 
function of hidden layer node is the radial basis function[9]. RBF neural network structure is shown in Fig. 1.

Vector X=(x1, x2, �, xm) is a m-dimensional input analog variable, W=(w1, w2, �, wn) is the output 
layer weight vector. Activation function is the Gaussian function, denoted as gi(X) = gi( || X - Ci || ) in which 
i=1, 2, �,n and n is the number of hidden layer nodes, Ci is the i-th activation function of the center, | | * | | is 
the Euclidean norm.

4. Forecasting and Results Analysis  
4.1. Data choose and preprocessing. 
In order to describe the state of the financial environment, this paper chooses the stock price index as 
forecast target, which describes the general stock market price level changes. Based on data in stock index 
futures market, the paper examined the relationship between closing price and other indicators of BIAS6, 
MA5 and PSY12, then the RBF neural network model constructed to forecast stock price index on the stock 
index futures market during fixed period of time. 
The RBF neural network structured and trained by data from 2010-11-30 to 2010-11-02, to forecast data 
from 2010-12-01 to 2010-12-14, after that, the forecasted and actual data were analyzed. 
The data pretreatment is needed for the input data. In this paper, BIAS6 and PSY12 are pretreated by (3), 
and (4) is set for MA5.

4.2. Forecast results show.  
This Paper takes predictive analysis mainly in the MA5, BIAS6 and PSY12 indicators. The following three 
steps are used in the analysis of the data:  
522  
 Xiaopeng Guo et al. /  AASRI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  519 – 524 
(1) Forecasting by using a single indicator one by one.  
(2) Forecasting by combining two indicators to form two-dimensional input vector. 
(3) Forecasting by combining three indicators to form three--dimensional input vector. 
In summary, this trial will generate seven groups of forecast data. This paper will give the graphic of 
corresponding forecast data and actual data, as well as the comparative analysis table of seven groups of data. 
4.3. Analysis of forecast results. 
(1) BIAS6 indicators. Take BIAS6 data and the corresponding closing price data as training samples, 
structure the network and train it. Based on this, input 10 groups of BIAS6 data to the network, obtain the 
corresponding 10 output groups of forecasted data, shown in Fig. 2. 
(2) MA5 indicators. Take MA5 data and the corresponding closing price data as training samples, structure 
the network and train it. Based on this, input 10 groups of MA5 data to the network, obtain the corresponding 
10 output groups of forecasted data, shown in Fig. 3. 
(3) PSY12 indicators. Take PSY12 data and the corresponding closing price data as training samples, 
structure the network and train it. Based on this, input 10 groups of PSY12 data to the network, obtain the 
corresponding 10 output groups of forecasted data, shown in Fig. 4. 
(4) Combined BIAS6 and MA5, shown in Fig. 5. 
(5) Combined BIAS6 and PSY12, shown in Fig. 6.

By comparing data in the table, It can be concluded that, the forecast result by RBF neural network from 
three latitude input vector combined by the three indicators is better than the other models. It’s a general 
approach of forecasting calculation based on the RBF, therefor, when this method approached to analysis of 
other indicators related to stock market factors, some more accurate and useful combinations should be draw 
out. Based on the data above, combined with the current macroeconomic environment and the latest financial 
policy, we can make a comprehensive assessment of financial environment risk.

5. Summary 
This paper constructed data forecast model based on RBF neural network which considered several impact 
indicators. To verify the validity of the forecast model, three indicators, MA5, BIAS6 and PSY12, were 
chosen to make the composition of the input vector, which provides an effective algorithm model for the 
thermal power industry making analysis and forecasting of the financial environmental. In the technical 
indicator group, BIAS6 and MA5 outperformed other indicators. Using a single indicator to forecast stock 
closing indices, whether it was a technical indicator, an average stock yield indicator or a closing index 
indicator, the accuracy was lower than that achieved with group indicators. Of all the hybrid combinations, 
BIAS6 + MAS5 + ASY12 were the optimum group with the smallest forecasting errors.  
In this paper, quantitative indicators were used to forecast the closing indices. However, stock movements 
are affected not only by quantitative factors, but also by non-quantitative factors, such as macroeconomic 
policies, regulations and psychological factors, etc. How to integrate these non-quantitative factors into 
mathematical algorithms using mining techniques to effectively increase forecast accuracy will be left to 
future research.
