Abstract
The ‘‘near-repeat” effect is a well-known criminological phenomenon in which the occur-
rence of a crime incident gives rise to a temporary elevation of crime risk within close physical prox-
imity to an initial incident. Adopting a social network perspective, we instead deﬁne a near repeat in
terms of geodesic distance within a criminal social network, rather than spatial distance. Speciﬁ-
cally, we report a statistical analysis of repeat effects in arrest data for Chicago during the years
2003–2012. We divide the arrest data into two sets (violent crimes and other crimes) and, for each
set, we compare the distributions of time intervals between repeat incidents to theoretical distribu-
tions in which repeat incidents occur only by chance. We ﬁrst consider the case of the same arrestee
participating in repeat incidents (‘‘exact repeats”) and then extend the analysis to evaluate repeat
risks of those arrestees near one another in the social network. We observe repeat effects that dimin-
ish as a function of geodesic distance and time interval, and we estimate typical time scales for
repeat crimes in Chicago.

1. Introduction
Criminological studies have shown that crime is not uniformly
distributed among victims, arrestees and places, with repeat
crimes playing a fundamental role [5]. In fact, about half of
all crimes in the United States are committed by repeat arrest-
ees [19]. Moreover, some reports [4] have suggested a high
degree of overlap between victim and arrestee populations,
and research has already demonstrated that victims of per-
sonal or property crimes and of gun violence experience ele-
vated crime risks within months of an instigating incident
[8,16]. Thus, it is reasonable to expect the same effect to exist

among the arrestee population, which has implications for the
prevention of crime [10,21].
In the ﬁeld of criminology there is a well-known phe-
nomenon known as the near-repeat effect, which refers to a
tendency for crime risk to be temporarily increased within
the near vicinity of recent crime incidents (i.e., incidents that
have taken place nearby in both space and time; e.g., [10,20]).
In this paper, we hypothesize the existence of a different
kind of near-repeat effect, in which we modify the deﬁnition
of ‘‘near” to refer not to geographical relationships among
crime incidents, but rather to crime-related interpersonal rela-
tionships among the individuals involved in these incidents.
We measure the notion of interpersonal distance by using
the well-established concept of ‘‘degrees of separation,” which
is known technically as geodesic distance. In this paper we
deﬁne geodesic distance in a criminal social network as follows:
If Person A and Person B have been arrested previously in con-
nection with the same crime incident (co-arrested), they are said
to have one degree of separation. If, in turn, Person C has been
co-arrested with Person B, then Person C is said to be separated
from Person A by two degrees, and so on. Thus, we hypothesize
that a crime incident involving Person A, will temporarily
increase the crime risk for individuals such as Persons B and
C, who are near Person A in this speciﬁc sense that we have
deﬁned. Later we show that the hypothesized effect does indeed
exist within crime data for the city of Chicago.
The immediate motivation for our study is to inform an ongo-
ing collaborative effort between the Chicago Police Department
and our research team at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
In this initiative, we have successfully developed and deployed
prediction algorithms that estimate the risk of future violence
for persons with extensive criminal records. We anticipate that
our prediction algorithms will be enhanced by exploiting the
probabilistic relationship, if it exists, that would be implied by
the aforementioned interpersonal near-repeat effect. Thus, the
present work not only informs our fundamental understanding
of crime behavior, but is also expected to have practical implica-
tions for the prediction of crime, which is a rapidly emerging ﬁeld
[18]. We next review basic concepts of the near-repeat effect and
social networks so as to place our work in context.
Repeat crimes may occur for various reasons, including
event dependence linked to the psyche, actions, and environ-
ment of arrestees [10], with some facet of the arrestee’s
previous experience increasing the chances of participation in
a subsequent incident, with the possibility of the effect
spreading to others in the same environment and social groups
as the original arrestee [16]. With victims and arrestees
tending to belong to similar populations, event dependence
suggests the formation of crime patterns establishing positive
feedback, eventually escalating into situations involving an
excess of dangerous persons or groups, and areas of high crime
density. Effective policing strategies would identify these
situations as they are forming, thus ceasing the spread of
further crime.
Repeat crimes can be characterized as either exact-repeat or
near-repeat, depending on whether consecutive incidents occur
at the same location, or at a nearby location. [10] considered
the spread of repeat effects to neighboring locations by using
Monte Carlo methods to determine the likelihood of the
observed patterns occurring if no correlation between spatial
and temporal distributions exists. Similarly, Ratcliffe and
Rengert [20] investigated repeat effects
in shootings in
Philadelphia, PA, using a modiﬁcation of a standard Knox test
[12]. Short et al. [22] showed that repeat effects exist among
burglaries in Long Beach, CA, and further showed that these
effects decrease with distance in space and time.
Social networks have recently been used to investigate the
inﬂuence that an individual has on his peers [16,17]. There
are many reasons to suspect the spreading of repeat effects
in a criminal social network. First, many violent crimes are dri-
ven by emotions created by social relationships and thus occur
between persons who know one another [9]. Second, condi-
tions favoring the participation in crime incidents are spread
through peer inﬂuence [7]. Third, physical objects such as
drugs or weapons are usually dispersed through interpersonal
connections, implying that the illegal selling and use of these
objects also occur through these connections [6].
For the remainder of this paper, we will present repeat anal-
yses on crimes that occurred in Chicago, IL, during the years
2003–2012, by integrating statistical techniques with a social
network perspective. Unlike previous repeat studies that have
been concerned with spatial locations and geographical dis-
tances of crime incidents, we will focus on arrestees and rela-
tionships among arrestees. Each incident in our dataset
includes a unique identiﬁcation number for each arrestee tak-
ing part in a crime incident, the date of the incident and the
type of crime. Of particular interest to police is the behavior
of violent criminals [4], so we divide our data into two mutu-
ally exclusive datasets – one containing only violent crimes
and the other containing all other crimes – and we perform
analyses on the two datasets separately. We refer to these data-
sets as the violent dataset and the non-violent dataset, respec-
tively. The former consists of 6630 arrestees, while the latter
consists of 941,029 arrestees.
Through the construction and analysis of social networks
and application of statistical techniques, this paper aims to dis-
cover patterns by repeat arrestees in Chicago. In Section 1 we
use a Poisson model to describe the situation in which events
are independent of one another and occur only by chance,
referring to this as the null model. We describe and apply
our counting technique to test our datasets against the null
model, and show that Chicago’s exact-repeat incidents are
not due to chance alone. We describe the social network in
Section 2, where we measure the spread of repeat effects
through the network by keeping track of the geodesic distance
between incidents – that is, the network separation of the two
arrestees
–
and
applying
well-established
spatiotemporal
descriptive statistics. We show that repeat effects in our data
diminish with time and geodesic distance. We conclude the
paper with a summary and discussion.
2. Exact-repeat effects
If there were no repeat effects, an individual’s participation in
a crime incident would be statistically independent of partici-
pation in other crime incidents. This model is contradictory
to the existence of repeat effects and will serve as our null
hypothesis. Moreover, an arrestee cannot participate in simul-
taneous criminal incidents, as such incidents would simply be
thought of as a single event. Independence of the incidents
implies a Poisson process [21], as reviewed next.
Chicago’s criminal social network
155
2.1. The null hypothesis
In a homogeneous Poisson process the probability that k crim-
inal incidents occur within a time interval from t to Dt is
PkðDtÞ ¼ ðkDtÞke�kDt
k!
;
ð1Þ
where k is the rate parameter.
It is easy to show that, for this distribution, the wait time s
between incidents obeys an exponential probability law, i.e.,
PðsÞ ¼ ke�ks:
ð2Þ
Therefore, if the null hypothesis is correct, and crime incidents
are indeed statistically independent, then the time intervals
between incidents in which an arrestee participates should be
exponentially distributed, with shorter times occurring more
frequently, in accordance with Eq. (2).
2.2. Testing for event dependence
In this section we describe the methodologies used to test for
event dependence. For our ﬁnite-length data, we employed a
moving-window counting method [22] that produces a distri-
bution of the observed wait time s, which can be compared
to the null distribution in Eq. (2) to test for the presence of
event dependence. We applied this method to our violent and
non-violent datasets separately.
2.2.1. The moving-window counting method
In the moving-window technique, a time window of width smax
weeks is deﬁned, beginning at the time of the ﬁrst crime inci-
dent in the dataset. If one or more arrestees in this initial inci-
dent participate in a secondary incident within the time
window, the time interval (wait time) s between the initial
and secondary incidents is recorded. The time window then
shifts to the next crime incident in the dataset, and the wait
time between that incident and the following one is again
recorded. This process continues until the entire data record
has been analyzed. The wait time observations obtained at
the various time-window positions are assigned to bins to form
a histogram of counts, and normalized to obtain a probability
distribution, which can be compared to the null distribution in
Eq. (2). Note that, in general, the number of observations is
greater than the number of repeat arrestees because not all
arrestees will participate in a second incident. Hence, order-
one arrestees (i.e., arrestees who are arrested only once in the
study period) inﬂuence the probabilities not by contributing
time intervals s, but by increasing the count. Incidents occur-
ring within the ﬁnal smax weeks of the data record – the so-
called ‘‘buffer period” – are not counted and do not contribute
to the probability distribution, because any incident occurring
during that period will have its associated time window falling
beyond the end of the data record and thus no data can be
observed for such incidents.
The exact choice of smax is not critical, but extreme choices
will not allow sufﬁcient data for the opportunity to disprove
the null hypothesis. One extreme is to choose smax as the length
of the study’s time frame. In this case, all of the data fall within
the buffer period and are discarded. The other extreme,
smax ¼ 0, only allows for measurements of s ¼ 0 nothing lar-
ger. For our study, we choose smax ¼ 104 weeks (two years,
or one-ﬁfth of the study’s time frame) corresponding to a buf-
fer period of the years 2011–2012.
The counting scheme with smax ¼ 104 weeks, applied to a
single arrestee, is illustrated by way of an example timeline
in Fig. 1, in Supplementary material. The ﬁrst incident occurs
212 weeks into the study period, and an observation is con-
ducted to determine whether a repeat incident occurs within
the following 104 weeks. In this example, a repeat incident
has
indeed
occurred,
so
the
time
interval
s ¼ 96
(308 � 212 ¼ 96) is recorded, and the analysis continues
through the timeline. The next incident to occur is the one fol-
lowing 308 weeks; this was the repeat incident for the previous
measurement and is now a potential instigating incident.
Again, an observation is made, but this time a repeat incident
does not occur within the time window of smax ¼ 104 weeks.
The analysis continues up to the incident occurring 413 weeks
into the study, and it is observed that two later incidents fall
within the time window. Since we are counting inter-arrival
times of a possible Poisson process, we use the ﬁrst of these
two events, and the time interval s ¼ 7 (420 � 413 ¼ 7) is
added to the record. The buffer period begins after week
416; any possible instigating incident during this period cannot
be checked for secondary incidents over the entire time win-
dow, and so no further observations are made.
The counting scheme in the preceding example is repeated
incident by incident for every arrestee in the dataset. The
records of s are combined into one master record, and the
numbers of observations are summed across all arrestees,
yielding the total number of observations N0. We applied this
method to the violent and non-violent datasets separately; a
graph of the respective histograms is shown in Fig. 2, in Sup-
plementary material. For the violent dataset, we made a total
of N0 ¼ 4975 observations, 398 of which were followed by a
repeat incident in the following 104 weeks. N0 ¼ 261; 006
observations were made for the non-violent dataset, and
130,503 observations were followed by a repeat incident within
the 104-week time window. Both histograms exhibit more
short time intervals than long ones.
2.2.2. Observed data versus the null hypothesis
First consider the violent dataset and the upper histogram in
Fig. 2, containing N0 ¼ 4975 observations. Normalizing the
histogram to obtain a probability distribution yields the solid
blue line in the upper graph of Fig. 3, in Supplementary mate-
rial. By summing the probabilities, we see that about 8% of all
violent crimes are followed by an exact repeat occurring within
104 weeks of the instigating incident. Next, we determined the
least-squares ﬁt of Eq. (2) to the observed data to estimate the
rate parameter. For the violent dataset, the least-squares esti-
mate of k was found to be ^k ¼ 6:989 � 10�4. The function
pðsÞ ¼ ^ke�^ks
is shown as the dashed red curve in the upper graph of Fig. 3.
We applied the same procedure to the non-violent histogram
with N0 ¼ 261; 006 observations. Its probability distribution
is shown in the bottom of Fig. 3 along with its best-ﬁt curve,
determined to have ^k ¼ 6:400 � 10�3. Again, summation of
the probabilities reveals that 50% of non-violent crimes are fol-
lowed by an exact-repeat incident occurring within 104 weeks
of the instigating incident. As we will establish quantitatively
156
P. Kump et al.
in the next section, the null hypothesis distribution poorly
describes the observed data for small values of s, indicating
that event dependence is present in the data.
2.2.3. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
To test the validity of the exponential distribution in Eq. (2) as
a model of our Chicago repeat data, we use the well-known
Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) goodness-of-ﬁt test [14,11], the
basic premise of which is to compare the observed cumulative
distribution function (CDF) with the CDF of the assumed null
distribution.
If
the
maximum
discrepancy
between
the
observed and null CDFs is larger than a speciﬁc conﬁdence
threshold for a given sample size, the null distribution is
deemed an unacceptable model of the data. On the other hand,
if the discrepancy is less than the threshold, the null distribu-
tion cannot be rejected.
Let FðsÞ be the CDF of the null distribution in Eq. (2),
that is
FðsÞ ¼
X
s
t¼0
pðtÞ;
and similarly let bFðsÞ be the CDF of the observed data. The
test statistic of the K–S test is the maximum absolute differ-
ence between FðsÞ and bFðsÞ. Let this maximum difference be
denoted by
DN0 ¼ max
s j bFðsÞ � FðsÞj:
K–S test of size a compares DN0 with the conﬁdence thresh-
old value Da
N0 deﬁned by
PrðDN0 6 Da
N0Þ ¼ 1 � a;
where N0 is the number of degrees of freedom (histogram nor-
malization factor).
If the observed value of DN0 is greater than the threshold
Da
N0,
the
null
hypothesis
can
be
rejected
at
the
ð1 � aÞ � 100% conﬁdence level. In our study, we chose
a ¼ 0:05 corresponding to a 95% conﬁdence interval. The
degrees of freedom for our violent and non-violent datasets
were N0 ¼ 4975 and N0 ¼ 261; 006, respectively. Signiﬁcance
thresholds for a ¼ 0:05 and for N0 > 50 are given in Ang
and Tang [1] as Da
N0 ¼ 1:36
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
�pN0
, which yields Da
N0 ¼ 0:019
and Da
N0 ¼ 0:003 for our two datasets.
Fig. 4, found in Supplementary material, shows, for each
dataset, the observed CDF, bFðsÞ, and the null CDF, FðsÞ,
for s 6 104; as well as the maximum difference DN0 between
the two. Our violent dataset yielded a K–S test statistic of
0.0251, which is greater than the conﬁdence threshold of
0.019, and so we can reject the null hypothesis that violent inci-
dents are statistically independent. We can draw a similar con-
clusion with our non-violent dataset, which produced a K–S
test statistic of 0.016, which is greater than the threshold of
0.003. It should be noted that one cannot infer conclusions
about the precise value of s for which DN0 occurs (which
may not even be unique); the test can only reject the null
hypothesis and does not provide insight as to the time frame
of elevated repeat risk. However, ﬁnding a s for which
j bFðsÞ � FðsÞj > Da
N0 means, at the very least, that a sufﬁciently
large time window smax was chosen.
3. Social network repeat effects
Social networks are graph structures composed of nodes (in
our case, arrestees), and edges, which form links between these
nodes. Social networks can help explain observed local and
global patterns within these structures, and identify nodes
from which other nodes draw inﬂuence.
In this study each arrestee in a dataset deﬁnes a node hav-
ing a unique label within the social network. For purposes of
anonymization, we refer to each arrestee using a unique inter-
nal record (IR) number. When two or more subjects are
arrested as part of the same incident, their respective nodes
become connected in the social network. The edge connecting
this pair of nodes forms on the day the incident occurred; thus,
the social network is constantly evolving. The network is an
undirected graph, as there is an inherent symmetry between
co-arrestees: if IR1 is arrested with IR2, then IR2 is arrested
with IR1. For simplicity in this initial investigation, the edges
are unweighted (two subjects are either connected or not, and
no connection strength is assigned to the edge that connects
them). Although our network is dynamic, unweighted, and
undirected, the analysis to follow can readily be adapted to
other types of networks.
Although we will separately analyze the repeat behavior of
violent and non-violent crimes, we use a single, common social
network for all arrestees. We measure the separation between
two subjects in the social network using the geodesic distance
between their nodes, i.e., the minimum number of edges that
must be traversed to move between the nodes. It should be
noted that the network contains isolated cliques, i.e., subsets
of nodes having edges that do not connect to any node outside
the subset. Our network contains nearly three million nodes
and 900,000 edges. The largest geodesic distance between any
two connected nodes is 37, the largest isolated clique contains
474 nodes, and the smallest isolated cliques consist of just one
node.
3.1. Near-repeat counting method
Our process of measuring near-repeat time intervals is a com-
plicated one that is best explained by way of an example.
Fig. 5, found in Supplementary material, shows the incident
timelines of two subjects, IR1 and IR2, who become immedi-
ate neighbors in the network after becoming linked by a co-
arrest 100 weeks into the time period studied. In our study,
we used the ﬁrst four years (208 weeks) of data as an initial
network setup, or ‘‘burn-in” period, during which the network
evolves without taking measurements. This is to ensure that
the measurements are taken from a network in steady state.
In the example in Fig. 5, after the burn-in period, IR1 is
arrested in week 209, and his immediate neighbor in the net-
work, IR2, is arrested in week 245. Thus we obtain a measure-
ment
of
the
wait
time
between
arrests
of
s ¼ 36
ð245 � 209 ¼ 36Þ, indicated in Fig. 5 with a blue line connect-
ing the two incidents. The next arrest occurs in week 212, again
involving IR1, after which the soonest arrest of IR2 is again in
week 245. Therefore the next measurement of wait time is
s ¼ 33 (245 � 212 ¼ 33). Now the arrest of IR2 in week 245
becomes the instigating incident for the arrest of IR1 in week
275, and s ¼ 30 is recorded (275 � 245 ¼ 30). Both of the sub-
jects are arrested in week 275, and in this scenario, we count
Chicago’s criminal social network
157
each arrest as being the instigating incident for the other and
hence, s ¼ 0 is recorded twice. The counting procedure contin-
ues in this manner.
An absence of network data for IR1 and IR2 in week 275
indicates that the two arrests are related to separate crime inci-
dents (as is the case for the two arrests in week 201). This is
signiﬁcant because we keep track of the elapsed time since
the two were linked and allow the link to expire if this time
exceeds four years. By removing connections that become
‘‘stale” after several years, we maintain a network with relevant
relationships. A link may be renewed should the subjects be
arrested together again. In the present example, IR1 and IR2
are linked in week 100 and the link is never renewed. Thus, their
link expires in week 308, shown as a vertical dashed line in the
ﬁgure, and no measurements are taken beyond that time. By
choosing an expiration time equal in duration to that of the net-
work burn-in time, the network temporal window is held con-
stant in duration; it is never longer or shorter than four years.
This example illustrates the counting method for arrestees
separated by a geodesic distance of n ¼ 1 in the social network,
but the method is similar for greater values of n. Algorithm 1
in Supplementary material gives the pseudocode algorithm to
obtain the wait time distribution for any n P 1.
In a near-repeat analysis (in contrast to our exact-repeat
analysis), we would not expect the time intervals to be expo-
nentially distributed should the null hypothesis of event inde-
pendence be true. This is because the arrests of two subjects
in
a
single
incident
violate
the
requirement
of
non-
simultaneity. If independent events are allowed to occur simul-
taneously, then the time intervals between events will not be
exponentially distributed [21]. Nevertheless, statistical testing
of our observed distributions can be done using Monte Carlo
simulations to estimate a null distribution.
3.2. Testing for elevated clustering in time and geodesic distance
The goal of this section is to determine whether the observed
near-repeat
distributions
for
different
geodesic
distances
pnðsÞ exhibit elevated clustering when compared to the null
hypothesis of no event dependence across time and geodesic
distance. Originally developed to detect only spatial clustering,
the O-ring statistic [13,23] and Ripley’s K [23] are spatial
descriptive statistics, with roots in epidemiology, that can be
extended to detect clustering in a spatiotemporal sense [2,15].
We calculated both statistics using our observed distributions,
and in order to compare the statistics to those under the null
hypothesis, we performed Monte Carlo simulations in which
the dates of the subject-date 2-tuples are randomly permuted.
Reshufﬂing the date data is a common strategy in this situation
when the null distribution is unknown. Originally applied in
Besag and Diggle [3], this strategy was also implemented in
Ratcliffe and Rengert [20] to evaluate near-repeat shooting
patterns in the city of Philadelphia, PA.
Let sij
n be the time interval between incidents i and j given
that the arrestees are separated by geodesic distance n. The
O-ring statistic for distance n is given by the following:
OnðsÞ ¼ 1
~kN
X
i–j
Iðsij
n ¼ sÞ;
ð3Þ
where N is the total number of incidents, ~k is the so-called
‘‘point density,” and Ið�Þ is the indicator function
Iða ¼ bÞ ¼
1;
a ¼ b;
0;
a – b:
�
In the traditional spatial case, the point density ~k is usually
chosen as the average number of points per unit area. Doing
so gives the researcher a meaningful and convenient way to
quantify the spatial clustering relative to that expected by a
Poisson process. However, as explained earlier, there is no rea-
son to believe our data follow a Poisson process; however,
analogous to the spatial case, we can still deﬁne ~k as a rate esti-
mated as N divided by the total number of subjects divided by
the total number of weeks in the study.
In the context of near repeats, the summation in Eq. (3) is
simply a count of the number of pairs of arrests occurring
exactly s weeks apart involving subjects separated by geodesic
distance n. We have already performed this count; it is
Nn � pnðsÞ. Therefore, we can express the O-ring statistic in
Eq. (3) as
OnðsÞ ¼ 1
~kN
Nn � pnðsÞ:
ð4Þ
The closely related Ripley’s K function is a cumulative count
of time intervals and can be expressed similarly as
KnðsÞ ¼ 1
~kN
X
i–j
Iðsij
n 6 sÞ ¼
X

OnðtÞ:
ð5Þ
The K and O-ring statistics, while similar, answer slightly
different questions. For example, if we hypothesize that
near-repeat effects only last for a certain duration and then
‘‘expire,” and the accumulating nature of the K statistic should
identify the time at which the effect expires. In this case, we
would expect elevated K statistics at short time intervals and
moderate K statistics falling within conﬁdence intervals at lar-
ger time intervals. The O-ring is more of an instantaneous met-
ric identifying speciﬁc times of heightened near-repeat risk. An
elevated O-ring statistic at, say, s ¼ 4 weeks would imply clus-
tering of near-repeat incidents four weeks after instigating inci-
dents and does not confound with the O-ring statistics at larger
values of s. Both statistics are of interest to us; therefore we
consider both in our analysis.
We ﬁrst consider our violent dataset, and plot the observed
O-ring and K statistics for n ¼ 1; 2; 3 and 0 6 s 6 208 in Fig. 6,
in Supplementary material. For comparison to the null
hypothesis, we randomly permute the dates of all arrests while
holding the subjects ﬁxed, and, with the new data, calculate
and plot the O-ring and K statistics. This process is repeated
for 95 random permutations for the sake of constructing a
95% conﬁdence envelope, also plotted in Fig. 6. Randomly
permuting the dates has the effect of observing how O-ring
and K statistics would appear should there be no spatiotempo-
ral relationships [20].
We observe from Fig. 6 elevated O-ring and K statistics
within the ﬁrst 25 weeks for the cases of n ¼ 1; 2 neighbors,
with the effect extending past 80 weeks for the K statistic.
For the n ¼ 3 case, the ﬁgure shows that the statistics are com-
pletely within the envelope of what can be expected under the
null hypothesis and are therefore not statistically signiﬁcant at
the 95% conﬁdence level. Not shown are the statistics for
n ¼ 4 neighbors for which we also found no signiﬁcant
dependence.

Next we consider the non-violent dataset for which we con-
ducted the same analysis as for the violent dataset. The results
are shown in Fig. 7, in Supplementary material. For n ¼ 1; 2,
the ﬁgure shows that the O-ring statistic falls outside of the
95% conﬁdence envelope for small values of s during which
the statistic exceeds the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval.
For larger n, the O-ring statistic falls entirely within the
conﬁdence envelope and is therefore not statistically signiﬁ-
cant at those values of n. The ﬁgure also shows an elevated
K statistic for n ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4 and a K statistic values that are
not signiﬁcant for n ¼ 5. We repeated the analysis for n ¼ 6
and n ¼ 7 and found that neither the O-ring nor the K
statistic showed signiﬁcant event-dependence effects in either
case.
3.3. Discussion
The above pioneering approach of fusing the O-ring and K
statistics with a social network analysis provides knowledge
of the temporary inﬂuence one has on his peers within the net-
work. This inﬂuence may be described by the strength of the
inﬂuence – that is, the maximum geodesic distance for which
the inﬂuence is observed – and its persistence, i.e., for how
long, temporally, the inﬂuence is observed.
Since the O-ring statistic is, as explained previously, a mea-
sure of instantaneous effect, it provides insight concerning the
time scales of repeat incidents in our Chicago datasets. For
instance, the O-ring statistic is elevated for our violent dataset
during roughly the ﬁrst 25 weeks for n ¼ 1, indicating (possibly
for the reasons outlined in the introduction) an increased
chance of a violent repeat crime occurring within about six
months of an initial violent crime for subjects directly con-
nected in the network. During this time, we observe 58% more
repeat incidents than expected by chance. The K statistic
reaches a maximum separation from its conﬁdence envelope
during this time period before it begins to approach and ﬁnally
penetrates the envelope at about 90 weeks. Thus the total num-
ber of violent repeat crimes separated by less than 90 weeks is
more than what would be expected by chance alone.
A similar argument can be made for the violent n ¼ 2 case
in which the O-ring statistic in Fig. 6 implies an elevated prob-
ability of violent repeat crimes occurring within just two
months of an initial violent crime. During this time, we observe
70% more repeat incidents than expected by chance. The K
statistic demonstrates an elevation in the total number of vio-
lent repeat crimes separated by less than 80 weeks. Finally, our
results for n ¼ 3 and n ¼ 4 (n ¼ 4 not shown in the ﬁgure)
demonstrate no statistically signiﬁcant violent near-repeat
effects; thus the concept of ‘‘near” for violent crimes may be
limited to arrested individuals within two degrees of network
separation.
For the non-violent dataset, the O-ring statistic falls outside
of the conﬁdence envelope for neighbors of distances n ¼ 1
and n ¼ 2; and is entirely contained within the envelope for
larger n. For n ¼ 1; the elevated O-ring statistic at s ¼ 0 and
s ¼ 1 demonstrates an increased risk during the ﬁrst and sec-
ond weeks following an instigating incident. In fact, there
are 28% more near-repeat incidents in the ﬁrst two weeks in
the dataset than is predicted by the null hypothesis. Similarly,
for n ¼ 2 neighbors, the elevated statistic at s ¼ 0 implies an
increased risk during the ﬁrst week following an instigating
incident. There are 17% more near-repeat incidents in the ﬁrst
week than predicted by the null hypothesis.
The K statistics in Fig. 7 show a near-repeat effect which
decreases in both time and network space. For n ¼ 1 neigh-
bors, more near-repeat crimes are observed within 22 weeks
of instigating incidents than would be expected by chance;
however, this time frame decreases as subjects become further
separated. For example, there are more repeat crimes than
expected only for the ﬁrst 20 weeks for n ¼ 2, 10 weeks for
n ¼ 3, and 8 weeks for n ¼ 4, and the number of crimes are
as expected for n ¼ 5 and n ¼ 6 (n ¼ 6 not shown in the ﬁg-
ure). During these time frames, we see 10.47% more crimes
than expected for n ¼ 1, 4.91% for n ¼ 2; 3.06% for n ¼ 3,
and 2.96% for n ¼ 4. The K statistics show repeat effects at
n ¼ 3 and n ¼ 4 while the O-ring statistics do not. This is
because the two statistics answer slightly different questions.
The K statistic ﬁnds elevated crimes for the n ¼ 3 and n ¼ 4
cases accumulated up to 10 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively;
however, according to the O-ring statistic, there is no single
week during these periods in which we should expect an ele-
vated number of repeat crimes.
4. Conclusion
This work is motivated by our interest in identifying factors
that may be predictive of an individual’s involvement in future
violence to enhance the predictive models we have developed
as part of the Chicago Police Department’s predictive policing
program. Speciﬁcally, we have developed a very successful pre-
diction model that evaluates the crime risk of individuals with
very severe patterns of involvement in crime.
This paper demonstrates conclusively that an individual’s
crime risk increases for a period of roughly 25 weeks (about
6 months) following a crime involving a person within two
or less degrees of separation from an individual involved in
that crime. To make practical use of this ﬁnding, we are cur-
rently in the process of revising our prediction model by
including new variables pertaining to ﬁrst- and second-degree
connections, as well as a weighting function that gives greater
emphasis to the effect of recent crime incidents, as opposed to
those in the more distant past. In addition to the practical sig-
niﬁcance for our current project, the ﬁndings of this paper pro-
vide us with fundamental insights about patterns of crime and
its temporal and interpersonal behavior, for both violent and
non-violent crime types.
In this work, to test for the presence of a social-network
near-repeat effect, we conducted statistical analyses of arrest
data to measure exact-repeat and near-repeat effects within
Chicago’s criminal social network for both violent and non-
violent crimes. For exact-repeats, we modeled the situation
in which arrests are independent of one another as a Poisson
process, and therefore inter-arrival times were compared to
an exponential distribution. We selected the distribution’s rate
parameter to minimize the residual sum of squares and quan-
tify the goodness-of-ﬁt using the popular K–S test. The K–S
test rejects the null hypothesis of independence for both of
our datasets with 95% conﬁdence.
We measured near-repeat effects by considering how the
effects spread through a social network. Each node in the net-
work is a unique arrestee, and two nodes become connected
should two subjects be arrested as part of the same unlawful
Chicago’s criminal social network
159
incident. With the network in place, we recorded the time
intervals between repeat incidents, this time keeping track of
‘‘distances”, or the degree separation between graph nodes.
By recording these geodesic distances, we allowed for the sep-
arate examination of temporal and spatial effects using Rip-
ley’s K and O-ring statistics. In order to compare these
statistics to those of a null distribution of no dependence
among incidents (across time and geodesic distance), we ran-
domly permuted arrest dates and then recalculated the test
statistics. The results showed elevated repeat effects that
decrease over time and geodesic distance within the network.
For violent crimes in particular, we have observed that the
near-repeat effect extends to neighbors separated by a geodesic
network distance of n ¼ 2, with the effect most prominent for
neighbors of n ¼ 1. Further, we have seen that this effect
expires at most 25 weeks after an instigating crime. Therefore,
when considering the role one individual’s crime plays on the
risk of a second individual, we must only concern ourselves
with crimes from n ¼ 1 and n ¼ 2 neighbors, from at most
25 weeks ago. As explained earlier, these ﬁndings will inform
future predictive models for identifying individuals at high risk
for future violence.
