A cluster is a segment [a,b] of particles with a density of y, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 and a length of

(incompressible). F is a state function.

2. Ring network 
A ring network is a set of rings on the plane. Rings touch each other in the common nodes. Multiplicity 
(number) of touches in one node is not more than two. Let’s classify ring networks by number of touches, 
number of common nodes for one ring. This value is constant, except rings, which are located on the border of 
the network. Besides, the notion "regular networks" includes equidistribution of common nodes on the ring. 
3. Isolated movement of uniform clusters 
Isolated movement of clusters in the ring network is a movement of each cluster on its own ring in a 
certain direction with the rule FIFO (first input, first output) of common nodes. Let all clusters be uniform. 
That is, they have equal density and, therefore equal velocity. Since the relative measure of the set of initial 
conditions, that lead to the competition of clusters for a common node within a limited period of time, equal 
to zero, we will not consider possible scenarios of settling conflicts. However, if it is significant, we can 
consider the equiprobable method of regulating movement of two clusters through a common node.

4. Quantitative characteristics of movement 
Quantitative characteristics of movement both on a separate contour and in the network as a whole are 
considered. As previous researches have shown[1],[2],[3], the movement in such networks, and for close 
movement rules of masses, has a number of interesting properties, such as self-adjustment of the system with 
minimization of conflicts (synergy), complete stoppage of movement (collapse), spectrum of velocities and 
others. 
Further the average velocity in the network v*
nw is a relative measure of moving clusters in the fixed 
moment. Since each cluster either stops or moves with equal velocity, the average velocity is equal to constant 
v0 with relative measure of those part of clusters, which is moving now. Further let be 
v0 �1
. 
Similarly, the average velocity on the ring, with assumptions we have made above, is a relative measure 
of time in movement conditions of appropriate cluster. There are possible local manifestations of synergy and 
collapse, and other scenarios of complicated movement, which is also an object of research.

If xi, 0 ≤ i ≤ 1 are the lengths of clusters, every initial condition where a common node belongs to only one 
cluster is acceptable. 
Proposition 5.1: If x1 + x2  ≤ 2π, then for all acceptable initial positions, the system goes into a synergy 
state during the time of a complete turn. 
Proof: Is evident. 
Proposition 5.2: If x1 + x2  > 2π, then

Proof: The time of the clusters passage through the common node is equal to x1 + x2, with velocity equal to 
1. The time of a complete turn of each cluster during free movement is equal to 2π. Thus, the relative part of 
movement is defined by equation (1). 
6. Two-element closed necklace 
The simple variant of the network with two nodes on each contour is considered. 
Proposition 6.1: If x1 + x2  ≤ 2π, then synergy starts after limited period of time for all initial conditions. 
Proof: Is evident. 
Proposition 6.2: If min(x1,x2) > π, then collapse starts for all acceptable initial conditions. 
Proof: If the cluster K2 is approaching common node B. Then K1 must go through this node at this period 
of time, since node A is occupied by K2. Obviously, K2 can't go through B and stops, so K1 can't go through A. 
Proposition 6.3: If min(x1,x2) < π, then

Proof: Similar to the proof of proposition 5.2. 
7. Open necklace with 2n rings 
For comparison movements in the closed and open necklaces, agreed direction of movement and agreed 
coordinates on the contours are assumed.

Proposition 7.2: If � I = 1, …, 2n – 1; xi + xi+1 < 2π, then there are initial conditions, that are leading to 
synergy. 
Proof: The biggest cluster is selected. Further, it is connected to the neighbor cluster. Each neighbor is 
connected to their neighbor cluster and this gets a conflict-free distribution for the open necklace at the initial 
moment of time.

Proof: Proper neighbor node can’t supply both clusters during any period of time, if cluster movement is

then there are initial conditions, that are leading to collapse for a short period of time. 
Proof: Structure from Fig. 5. It is significant to note that any cluster can be turned against the direction of 
movement and the system goes from partial to absolute collapse. 
Proposition 8.2: If

then for all initial conditions the collapse will start in a time period equal to half of the turnover period. 
Proof: If any i-cluster is located in both nodes, then at the current time (i-1) and (i+1) clusters are located 
in one node and the same arrangement with appropriate neighbor clusters. Then there is a cluster with length 
greater than π. This cluster is the last one without a node in this odd chain, so we receive a contradiction. 
Proposition 8.3: If 
xi l2n

then there are initial conditions, that are leading to synergy. 
Proof: Follow from Fig. 5. 
Proposition 8.4: If � I, 1 ≤ I ≤ 2n then xi + xi+1 ≤ 2π, is true and there are initial conditions that lead to 
synergy in a time period, equal to the turnover period. 
Proof: The structure from  Fig. 5. All clusters are located symmetrically to (for example) position π/2 at 
the initial period of time. 
9. Potential flow function 
A closed necklace consisting of 2n rings is considered. The location of the cluster has been described on 
each contour by the indicator function f (t,x,K) = {1, x � K; 0, x � K}, Ki = [ai (t),bi (t)], fi (t,x) = f (t,x,Ki). 
The potential flow function is a function

where all contour pairs with one common node are summate. 
Some properties for function U are specified.

Proposition 9.1: 
(1) U(t) ≥ 0, and U(t)=0 �  Ki ≡ Kj, for any two contours with common node.

(3) Uij(t) is a continuous piecewise-linear function of time with a tilt tangent of 0, ±1. 
Proof: Is evident. 
Proposition 9.2: If |Ki| ≡ d, i=1,..2n, and d ≤ π. Then the function: 
(1)  U(t) does not decrease. 
(2)  For any initial conditions by the limit period of time T any pair of neighbor clusters Ki and Kj doesn't 
intersect and U(t) is equal to the maximum possible value 2nd. 
Proof: For both closed and open two-element necklaces this feature is verified using the following method: 
currently, each node is assigned one of three values Xi:1, if the proper item is nearly equal to t and is constant. 
Thus, there is a defined partially-linear function in the ordered and consecutively numbered set of nodes with 
values 0,1,-1, according to vectors X = (X1,..., X2n). It's easy to see, that the sum of coordinates of this 
periodical vector gives us a criterion of monotony U(t):

There is a one-to-one correspondence between each coordinate -1 of vector X and coordinate 1. Indeed, 
coordinate -1 means, that neighbor contours don't interact, and are in anti-phase, moreover one of the clusters 
is located before the node, for example, on the right. Thus, on the right of coordinate -1 there is coordinate 1. 
While on the left of coordinate -1 there can't be coordinate -1. So, the sum of coordinates of vector X is non-
negative. From another point, there are nodes with interacting contours if the system didn't reach maximal 
value. In this case, in order for the rate of change of the potential function to be equal to zero, it is necessary 
for interacting clusters and neighbor clusters with a negative velocity to be located in a definite location, that 
excludes constancy of the potential function. 
Proposition 9.3: If |Ki| = d, i=1,..2n, d ≤ π, then for every initial condition � T* < ∞, that V(t) ≡ 2nd = 
maxV(t)
 
� t > T*. 
10. Program modeling 
The newly developed NODE model software allows for the creation of a cluster movement simulation in a 
closed necklace consisting of 2n rings. You can locate clusters, specify length and density of clusters and set 
the number of rings in the necklace n. Adjacent nodes are marked by a vertical line, which is crossing proper 
contours. 
The software calculates and simulates a movement of clusters and creates a diagram of the potential 
function U(t). 
As a result, by means of the NODE model software, some statements about the potential function U(t), 
previously specified, are proven. Particularly, we proved that the function U(t) is a monotonous function and 
it reaches its maximal value 2nd in all initial conditions in a limited period of time.
