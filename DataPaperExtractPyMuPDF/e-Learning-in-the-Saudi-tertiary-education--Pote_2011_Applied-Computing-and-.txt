Abstract
The advent of the Internet in the twenty-ﬁrst century has led to
remarkable changes in several aspects of our lives. This advanced technology
has become an essential tool of communication and information, thus offering
unique advantages to both educators and students. Despite a recent educational
revolution in Saudi Arabian educational systems, the issue of access to higher
education still remains one of the more enduring challenges. The need for more
delivery modes that take education to learners wherever they are, and not within
the boundaries of the campus, is thus a necessity. e-Learning could dramatically
increase access to tertiary education and training, especially for those learners
who were once denied learning opportunities for any reason, such as health, dis-
tance or the like. Yet, successful implementation of e-learning requires an under-
standing of the issues that promote the effective use of the technologies. This
article discusses the factors that inﬂuence e-learning in Saudi higher education
through analysing the perceptions and attitudes of Saudi university students
(n = 531). It reports the results of a survey conducted to investigate the accep-
tance of e-learning in a Saudi higher education institution as perceived by univer-
sity students. The ﬁndings demonstrated that attitudes toward e-learning,
subjective norms, perceived behavioural control as well as e-learning systems
attributes were critical determinants of students’ behavioural intention to use

1. Introduction
The new advancement in communication and information technologies has made
an impact on some aspects of today’s societies. Largely, commerce, politics and
education have been undeniably inﬂuenced (Garrison and Anderson, 2003; Khan,
2005). Terms like the global village, information society and knowledge society
symbolize the new realties and change in modern societies. Education facilitated
by the new ICT or e-learning is transforming learning and instruction forms
(Garrison and Anderson, 2003) in ways ‘‘that extend beyond the efﬁcient delivery
or entertainment value of traditional approaches’’ (Garrison and Anderson, 2003,
p. 2). For this reason, more and more educational institutions around the world
are embracing e-learning systems and investing heavily in this sector. In Saudi
Arabia, the government has launched a national plan for the utilizsation of infor-
mation technology (IT). The plan urges, ‘‘the implementation of e-learning and
distance learning and all their prospective applications in higher education’’
(National Centre for e-Learning and Distance Learning, 2008). Furthermore, a
national centre for promoting e-learning was established to fulﬁl the following
goals:
To develop infrastructure for e-learning.
To collaborate with higher education, government and corporate partners to
solve e-learning problems.
To provide complete e-learning solutions.
To develop QA standards for e-learning.
To develop rules and regulations for e-learning.
To establish awareness of e-learning programs (National Centre for e-Learning
and Distance Learning, 2008).
However, effective use of e-learning only occurs ‘‘when users choose to migrate or
move from less efﬁcient systems to relatively more advanced and more beneﬁcial
innovations’’ (Ndubisi, 2006). Investments in the infrastructure, staff IT training
and content development may not be sufﬁcient to ensure a successful adoption
and use of e-learning (Ndubisi, 2004). Several studies have highlighted that under-
standing the factors that inﬂuence users’ acceptance and use of e-learning is impor-
tant for a better implementation and use of e-learning. The purpose of this study,
therefore, is to investigate the factors that inﬂuence e-learning acceptance by Saudi

university students. This paper is constructed as follows: ﬁrst, it will give a brief ac-
count of e-learning. Second, it will describe the theoretical framework of this study.
Third, it will present the research model and hypotheses. Then a subsequent section
on the research methodology will follow. Next, the ﬁndings will be presented and dis-
cussed in the light of research hypotheses. Finally, some implications are offered.
2. e-Learning
e-Learning refers to ‘‘the use of new multimedia technologies and the Internet to
improve the quality of learning by facilitating access to resources and services as
well as remote exchanges and collaboration’’ (Holmes and Gardner, 2006).
e-Learning can take place totally online in virtual environments or in a mix of vir-
tual and face-to-face environments; a mode entitled ‘blended learning’. e-Learning
has the potential to impact positively on education. It provides great opportunities
for both educators and learners to enrich their educational experiences (Holmes
and Gardner, 2006). Individuals who were disadvantaged for geographic, physical
or social circumstances have increasingly better educational chances via e-learning.
Furthermore, e-learning supports synchronous and asynchronous communications
in various formats ranging from text, voice and audio. In addition, supported by
the openness and ﬂexibility of the Internet, e-learning provides the teaching and
learning transactions with unfathomable amounts of information independent of
the pressure of time and the constraints of distance (Holmes and Gardner, 2006).
3. Theoretical framework
Explaining human behaviours have been a topic of vast research. The research
conducted by Ajzen (1985) and Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) to understand human
behaviour has been of paramount impact in psychology and other social sciences
disciplines. The theories of Reasoned Action (TRA) (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975)
and Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985) have been used extensively to explain
numerous behaviours. Among the most prominent extensions of these theories is
Davis’ (1989) the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that addresses technol-
ogy acceptance and use behaviours. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
has attracted substantial attention and found to be robust in explaining the accep-
tance and use of various technological innovations [e.g. Internet-based courses
(Arbaugh, 2000), websites (Koufaris, 2002) and the Internet (Shih, 2004)]. The the-
oretical framework of this study is based on these prominent theories. The follow-
ing section gives a brief account of them.
3.1. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)
The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) was proposed by Fishbein and Ajzen
(1975) to explain human behaviours. It postulates that the key determinant
e-Learning in the Saudi tertiary education: Potential and challenges
33
of an individual’s behaviour is his or her intention, which is in turn a function
of two determinants, attitude toward the behaviour and subjective norm.
Attitude toward the behaviour is deﬁned as ‘‘the individual’s positive or nega-
tive evaluation of performing the behaviour of interest’’ (Ajzen, 2005, p. 118).
Subjective norm is deﬁned as ‘‘the person’s perception of the social pressures to
perform or not to perform the behaviour under consideration’’ (Ajzen, 2005,
p. 118). However, Ajzen (1985) others realised that the theory was not sufﬁcient
and had a limitation. TRA is capable of explaining only volitional behaviours
(Godin and Kok, 1996). If the behaviour is not completely under volitional
control, even if the individual is highly motivated by his or her attitudes and
subjective norm, he or she may not actually perform the behaviour as a result
of some other constraints. Ajzen (1985) proposed a modiﬁed version of TRA to
deal with this weakness. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was proposed
to explain behaviours in which individuals have partial volitional control. The
new concept of TPB was termed Perceived Behavioural Control and it refers to
the person’s perceived ability to perform the behaviour of interest (Ajzen,
2005). According to the new theory of Planned Behaviour, individuals’ inten-
tion to perform a behaviour is a combination of their attitude toward perform-
ing the behaviour, their subjective norm and their perceived control of that
behaviour. Generally, individuals intend to perform a behaviour when ‘‘they
evaluate it positively, when they experience social pressure to perform it and
when they believe that they have the means and opportunities to do so’’ (Ajzen,
2005, p. 118). There is a vast literature that applied TRA and TPB to investi-
gate and predict various behaviours. Yoh et al. (2003) examined consumers’
intentions to use Internet apparel and found that TRA is a robust model with
a strong predictive power. In addition, Ndubisi (2004, 2006) has applied TPB
to online learning adoption and found the theory to be a good predictor of
adoption behaviours.
3.2. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
Davis (1989) proposed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) speciﬁcally to
explain technology acceptance and usage behaviours. TAM postulates that an
individual’s acceptance and use of a technology is determined by the attitudes to-
ward the technology. In addition, TAM posits that two basic perceptions of the
technology also have inﬂuence on the acceptance and usage behaviours, namely,
perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. These two constructs are anteced-
ents to one’s attitude. Perceived usefulness refers to ‘‘the degree to which a person
believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance’’
(Davis, 1989, p. 320)). Perceived ease of use refers to ‘‘the degree to which a person
believes that using a particular system would be free from effort’’ (Davis, 1989,
p. 320)). TAM has been applied to diverse technologies and has been found to
be a robust model (Ndubisi, 2004, 2006; Venkatesh, 2000).

4. The research model and hypotheses
This research proposes a model for explaining and predicting students’ acceptance
of e-learning. Based on the theories of TPB and TAM, the proposed model
includes constructs and relationships which may prove to be important in the
context of e-learning. These constructs are grouped into four factors: individual,
system, social and institutional. The individual factor includes three demographic
characteristics of the students (i.e. gender, mode of study, place of residence and
faculty), attitude, Internet experience and self-efﬁcacy. The e-learning system fac-
tor includes some attributes of e-learning, speciﬁcally, usefulness, ease of use,
accessibility, ﬂexibility and interactivity. The social factor includes a subjective
norm. The institutional factor includes university support. Fig. 1 shows the re-
search constructs and the hypothesized relationships between them.
Based on the abovementioned theories, the following hypotheses were
postulated:
H1: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and attitude toward
e-learning.
H2: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and subjective
norm.
H3: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and Internet self-
efﬁcacy.
H4: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and university
support.
H5: There is a relationship between intention to use e-learning and perceived
e-learning accessibility.

self-efﬁcacy.
H13: There are differences between the students in their intention to use e-learning
based on their demographics.
5. Methodology
5.1. Data collection method
To collect the data for this research a survey employing questionnaire technique was
used. A total of 531 questionnaires were distributed and collected during class
hours. Ethical issues, such as respondents’ consent and conﬁdentiality were ensured.
5.2. Instrumentation
The questionnaire consisted of three sections. The ﬁrst section collected informa-
tion about the students’ Internet experience and self-efﬁcacy. The second section
elicited information on their perceptions and attitude toward e-learning. The third
section gathered some demographic information. The items of the questionnaire
were adopted from previously validated instruments (Ajzen, 1985; Davis, 1989;
Moore and Benbasat, 1991; Stoehl and Lee, 2003). Respondents were asked to
rate their perceptions and attitude using a 7-point Likert scales ranging from
1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. Statements measuring self-efﬁcacy
used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = no conﬁdence to 5 = Very high
conﬁdence. Experience was captured using three items measuring duration and
frequency of using the Internet.
5.3. Data analysis techniques
Descriptive statistics were used to describe and understand the data. Multiple
regression analysis was used to test the research model. In addition, t-test and
ANOVA were employed to examine the differences between the students based
on their demographics. Regression analysis assumptions including normality,
36
K.Al-Siraihi Al-Harbi
linearity, multicollinearity and homoscedasticity were examined (Tabachnick and
Fidell, 2007). No violations of these assumptions were detected. Similarly, the
assumptions for the t-test and ANOVA were also met.
5.4. Psychometric properties of the instrument
The reliability of the instrument was measured by using Cronbach’s alpha (see
Table 1). The instrument had a very high reliability, a = .97. The alpha coefﬁ-
cients for the sub-scales were also very good, exceeding the minimum threshold
recommended in the literature of 0.70, thus indicating good internal consistency
(Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007).
To conﬁrm the validity of the model’s key dimensions, principle components
analysis (PCA) was carried out. Prior to performing PCA, the suitability of data
for factor analysis was examined. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin value was .932;
exceeding the minimum recommended value of .6 (Hair et al., 2006). The Bartlett
test of sphericity reached statistical signiﬁcance, supporting the factorability of the
data (Hair et al., 2006). Guided by conceptual and practical considerations, the
study accepted factor loadings of .40 and above which Hair et al. (2006) were con-
sidered important. The oblique rotation was used as it represents the clustering of
variables more accurately (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007). Forty-three items out of
the original 44 were loaded on 11 factors with a total variance of 70%. One expe-
rience item was dropped because of poor loading. Key dimensions, items loadings,
Eigenvalues and variances are presented in Table 2.
6. Sample
A stratiﬁed cluster sample of students (n = 531) was randomly drawn from

7. Results of analysis
7.1. Sample proﬁle
Table 3 presents the demographic proﬁle of the survey respondents. Of those
who participated, 39% were male and 61% were female. Eighty-four percent
of the respondents were regular students and only 16% were enrolled as exter-
nal. These proportions mirror reality. Furthermore, the majority of the respon-
dents (76%) were from the city. With regard to their Internet experience, 56% of
the students described themselves as having high Internet experience. This is not
surprising since the respondents are young university students who had taken
earlier Internet and computer courses during high school. Only less than 3%
of the sample reported no Internet experience. Table 3 also summarises the type
of Internet connection the students reported. DSL connection (54%) is the pre-
vailing type, whilst satellite connection is the least used (3.4%), probably due to
its high costs.
7.2. Explaining intention to use e-learning (BI)
A multiple regression analysis was undertaken for intention to use e-learning and
its proposed determinants in this research (attitude, subjective norm, self-efﬁcacy,
university support and perceived e-learning accessibility). The two constructs of

self-efﬁcacy and perceived accessibility constitute the perceived behavioural con-
trol (PBC) construct proposed in TPB. As theorized, the research model explained
a signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in BI (Table 4). The model accounted for
43% of BI’s variance and this is considered a large effect (Cohen, 1988). Looking
at the individual determinants of BI, attitude (b = .32), subjective norm (b = .22)
and university support (b = .18) had all signiﬁcant inﬂuence on BI at the .001%
level. Perceived e-learning accessibility (b = .12) had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on BI
at the .01% level, whereas Internet self-efﬁcacy (b = .083) was signiﬁcant at the
.05% level. Therefore, hypotheses 1–5 were supported.
7.3. Explaining attitude to using e-learning
As proposed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the two constructs of
perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) explained a signiﬁ-
cant percentage of variance in attitude, R2 = .46% (Table 5). According to Cohen
(1988) this is a large effect. PU had a strong signiﬁcant effect on ATT (b = .33).
PEOU had even a stronger inﬂuence on ATT (b = .40). Both results of this anal-
ysis gave support to hypotheses 6 and 7.
7.4. Explaining perceived usefulness (PU)
Hypotheses 8 and 10 were supported as perceived interactivity (PI) (b = .40) and
perceived ﬂexibility (PF) (b = .43) were found to have strong signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on the perceptions of e-learning usefulness at the .001% level as shown in Table 6.

These constructs accounted for 56% of the variance in PU. The effect size of this
index is much larger than typical (Cohen, 1988). On the other hand, Internet expe-
rience (IE) (b = .06) was not found to have a signiﬁcant relationship with PU,
thus hypothesis 9 was rejected.
7.5. Explaining perceived ease of use (PEOU)
The model also hypothesises that the perceptions of ease of use (PEOU) are inﬂu-
enced by Internet self-efﬁcacy (SE) and experience of using the Internet. It was
found that SE has a strong signiﬁcant inﬂuence on PEOU (b = .36), whereas
IE has a small but signiﬁcant effect on PEOU (b = .147) at the .01% level. Both
constructs accounted for .23% in PEOU variance (Table 7). This is considered a
medium size effect (Cohen, 1988). Thus, hypotheses 11 and 12 were supported.
7.6. Differences between the students
To examine the differences between the students in their intention to use e-learning
based on their demographics, a series of t-tests and ANOVA were utilised. To see
if there is difference between male and female students regarding their intention to
use e-learning, an independent samples t-test was conducted. Table 8 shows that
male students were signiﬁcantly different from female students on their intention
to use e-learning (p = .002). Male students demonstrated greater intentions to use
e-learning than female students. However, the magnitude of the difference in the
means was very small (g2 = 0.02). Further, to see if the students are different in
their intention to use e-learning based on their place of residence, another t-test
was carried out. No statistically signiﬁcant difference was found between the

students of the different habitats. Another t-test was performed to see if there is
difference in intentions based on the mode of study. Table 8 also reveals that exter-
nal students have greater intention to use e-learning than regular students
(p = .000). The effect of size was very small (g2 = 0.03) (Cohen, 1988). Finally,
a one way between groups ANOVA was conducted to see if the students of the
different faculties are different in their intention to use e-learning. A statistically
signiﬁcant difference was found among the different faculties, F(11, 519) =
3.435, p = .000. The effect size calculated using eta squared was .06, which is a
medium effect according to Cohen (1988). Post hoc comparisons using Tukey
HSD test indicated that the mean score for the students in the faculty of economics
and administration (M = 5.8134, SD = .90377) was signiﬁcantly different from
the students of the faculty of Arts and Humanities (M = 5.0942, SD =
1.29397), the students in the faculty of Home Economics (M = 4.9023,
SD = 1.35078) and the students in the faculty of science (M = 4.7353, SD =
1.45037). These signiﬁcant differences support hypothesis 13.
8. Discussion
This study proposed a model to explain and understand Saudi university students’
intention to accept and use e-learning. It adopted Ajzen’s (1985) theory of planned
behaviour as well as Davis’ (1989) TAM as its theoretical framework. Students’
intention (BI) was found to be very well explained by the determinants of behav-
ioural intention as proposed by Ajzen (1985). Attitude is an important factor that
inﬂuences BI to use e-learning. This result is similar to previous ﬁndings (Stoehl
and Lee, 2003), which have shown that attitude toward performing behaviour
has an inﬂuence on the intention to carry out this behaviour. In other words, stu-
dents who hold favourable attitude about using e-learning are more inclined to ac-
cept and use this innovation. The results also showed that the inﬂuence of
important groups such as instructors or peers was signiﬁcant. This result is in line
with the results reported in a previous research (Taylor and Todd, 1995) that

found subjective norm to be important in inﬂuencing acceptance and usage of an
innovation, particularly in the early stages of adoption when prospect adopters
have little experience from which to form attitudes.
Further, self-efﬁcacy, and perceived e-learning accessibility were proposed in
this research to represent the construct of perceived behavioural control (PBC).
The results revealed that SE has an impact, though very small, on BI. This implies
that the students’ conﬁdence of using the Internet may have an inﬂuence on their
intention to adopt e-learning. Ma and Liu (2005) and Rezaei et al. (2008) found
similar results, yet, they reported that Internet self-efﬁcacy was found as a strong
determinant of e-learning adoption and usage. Perceived e-learning accessibility,
which corresponds to the second construct of PBC, was found signiﬁcant and thus
inﬂuencing intentions to use e-learning. This implies that if the university students
feel that they have ready access to e-learning (i.e. speedy Internet connection with
affordable costs, the necessary equipments), they will be more encouraged to use
e-learning (Abdel-Wahab, 2008). The ﬁnal determinant of BI suggested by our
model is university support (US), which was found to have a statistically signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence on students’ intention to use e-learning. This result suggests that
the students will accept and use e-learning more readily if the university supports
the e-learning initiative. This study further conﬁrms the important role of institu-
tional support reported in previous research (Selim, 2007).
The two constructs of TAM, namely PU and PEOU were tested for their inﬂu-
ence on ATT and were found to be signiﬁcantly impacting attitudes. This gives
further support to the robustness of TAM. Moreover, in an attempt to understand
PU, perceived ﬂexibility (PF), perceived interactivity (PI) and Internet experience
(IE) were proposed as antecedents of PU. The two constructs of PF and PI were
found to be important in forming PU perceptions. However, PU was not signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuenced by prior experience with the Internet. Students’ experience with
the Internet over time will not increase the perceptions of usefulness. Stoehl and
Lee (2003) reported similar results. To explain PEOU, IE and SE were postulated
as antecedents of this construct. The results demonstrated that Internet experience
signiﬁcantly impacted the perceptions of PEOU. In other words, the students’
experience with the Internet over time will increase the perceptions of ease of
use (Stoehl and Lee, 2003). In addition, Internet self-efﬁcacy was also found as
a strong factor inﬂuencing PEOU. This ﬁnding implies that students with higher
conﬁdence in using the Internet will perceive e-learning as easier to use. This con-
curs with the ﬁndings of Ma and Liu(2005) that users strongly anchor ease of use
perceptions to their SE. Finally, in exploring the differences between the Saudi stu-
dents in their intention to use e-learning, gender, mode of study and faculty
emerged as personal characteristics that are associated with intention to use
e-learning. A signiﬁcant gender variation was found for the intention to use
e-learning supporting prior research (Ong and Lai, 2006). Saudi male students
showed more liking to use e-learning than the female students. In a study con-
ducted by Wagner et al. (2005) the students’ status of study (part-time or full-time)

was found to have an impact on perceptions of on-line learning. Similarly, the cur-
rent study found a signiﬁcant difference between external and regular students in
their intention to use e-learning. External students showed greater intention to use
e-learning than regular students. The attractiveness of e-learning for external
students is maybe due to the beneﬁts of e-learning systems, such as their ﬂexibility
and interactivity (Taylor and Todd, 1995; Ndubisi, 2006). Furthermore, the
students were found different in their intention to use e-learning based on their
faculty.
9. Conclusion
In summary, this research sought to determine the factors that inﬂuence Saudi uni-
versity students’ intention to use e-learning. The ﬁndings showed that e-learning
acceptance is inﬂuenced by several factors. The results indicated that the students’
attitude toward e-learning is the most important factor in determining students’
intention to use e-learning. The students’ decision to use e-learning is also deter-
mined by their subjective norm, i.e. the inﬂuence of the important people around
them. Moreover, perceived e-learning accessibility plays a role in shaping the stu-
dents behavioural intention regarding e-learning acceptance. University support of
the e-learning initiative as well as the students’ conﬁdence of using the Internet
inﬂuence the students’ intention to use e-learning. Furthermore, the perceptions
of e-learning usefulness, ease of use were found signiﬁcant in forming an attitude
toward e-learning. Similarly, the perceptions of e-learning ﬂexibility and interac-
tivity were found important in shaping the perceptions of e-learning usefulness.
In the same way, the perceptions of ease of use were inﬂuenced by experience
and self-efﬁcacy. Finally, the students showed differences in their intention to
use e-learning based on their gender, mode of study and faculty. Male, external
and economics and administration students demonstrated stronger intentions to
use e-learning.
10. Implications of the ﬁndings
As attitude toward e-learning was found to have a strong impact on the intention
to use e-learning among the students, policy-makers should attempt to build po-
sitive attitudes among the potential e-learners such as male and external students.
One way of achieving this goal is by highlighting the usefulness of this mode of
learning to potential users. One of the greatest advantages of e-learning as per-
ceived by the students is that it gives university students greater ﬂexibility in time
and place (Ndubisi, 2006). Moreover, e-learning enhances interactivity, i.e. com-
munication between the students among themselves and with their tutors. As a re-
sult, designers of e-learning systems should pay attention to these beneﬁts and
design e-learning programmes that offer ﬂexibility and interactivity. In addition,
attitude toward e-learning is inﬂuenced by the perceptions of e-learning ease of
44

use. In other words, potential users are more likely to adopt and use e-learning if
they deem it easy to use (Ndubisi, 2006). This suggests that designing easy to use
systems can lead to a better adoption of e-learning among the students. Equally
important to the acceptance of e-learning is the inﬂuence of the society. As e-learn-
ing is still new, the students have limited knowledge of this service. The society,
thus, may provide the students with an alternative source for judging e-learning.
Educating the society (e.g. family and instructors) with the beneﬁts of e-learning
can thus facilitate its acceptance.
Perceived e-learning accessibility emerged in this research as an important
factor of e-learning acceptance. The students are more likely to accept and use
e-learning if they think they have easy access to the system. Thus, e-learning
suppliers (e.g. the university) should ensure trouble-free access to e-learning.
The university can increase students acceptance of e-learning by providing training
for the students on using the Internet as well as by making available Internet
access points across the university and also by offering technical support. Finally,
since some groups of students (e.g. males and external) showed more demand to
use e-learning, attention should be given to these groups and make every effort
to meet their requirements and high need for e-learning. Equally important, is
to direct attention to the other groups of students who showed less interest in
e-learning.
11. Limitations
This study had some limitations. First, e-learning in Saudi Arabia is still in its in-
fancy with a paucity of information on its use at the time of the study. Thus, the
greatest part of pertinent literature comes from other nations and may not truth-
fully explain the situation in Saudi Arabia. Second, the current study relied on one
sample that had its unique features and may not be totally representative of the
broader population. This may affect generalising the ﬁndings. Furthermore, this
study utilised only self-reported measures. Although this method has been repeat-
edly employed in the past as a way of measuring attitude and perceptions, it is nec-
essary to be aware of the weaknesses and issues associated with this method.
