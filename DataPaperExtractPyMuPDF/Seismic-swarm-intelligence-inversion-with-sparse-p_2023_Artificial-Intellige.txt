Seismic inversion, such as velocity and impedance, is an ill-posed problem. To solve this problem, swarm in-
telligence (SI) algorithms have been increasingly applied as the global optimization approach, such as differential 
evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Based on the well logs, the sparse probability distribution 
(PD) of the reflectivity distribution is spatial stationarity. Therefore, we proposed a general SI scheme with 
constrained by a priori sparse distribution of the reflectivity, which helps to provide more accurate potential 
solutions for the seismic inversion. In the proposed scheme, as two key operations, the creating of probability 
density function library and probability transformation are inserted into standard SI algorithms. In particular, 
two targeted DE-PD and PSO-PD algorithms are implemented. Numerical example of Marmousi2 model and field 
example of gas hydrates show that the DE-PD and PSO-PD estimate better inversion solutions than the results of 
the original DE and PSO. In particular, the DE-PD is the best performer both in terms of mean error and fitness 
value of velocity and impendence inversion. Overall, the proposed SI with sparse distribution scheme is feasible 
and effective for seismic inversion.   
1. Introduction 
Seismic inversion is an important area of geophysical research in 
regional, global and exploration problems. Using artificial or natural 
seismic data, the seismic inversion estimates unknown subsurface pa-
rameters, such as velocity, density, quality factor, impedance, and 
reflectivity. Due to the band-limited nature of the source wavelet, the 
acquired seismic data is typically band-limited. Consequently, the 
seismic inversion is ill-posed (Wang, 2011; Wang et al., 2018). To solve 
this problem, additional assumptions on the model parameters are 
required. For example, the sparsity assumption is popular to solve the 
seismic inversion (Gholami and Sacchi, 2015; Kazemi et al., 2016; Zhou 
et al., 2015), especially for the earth model of layered medium. 
To solve the seismic inverse problem, the classical optimization al-
gorithms based on gradient descent is sensitive to the initial model and 
easy to be trapped in a local minimum (Ma, 2002). In addition, it is 
difficult and time-consuming to fine tune the regularization parameters 
to obtain a fast convergence rate (Zhou et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2020). 
In contrast to the gradient-based optimization algorithms, the global 
optimization approaches do not require the computation of the gradient 
or an accurate initial model. Global optimization has been increasingly 
applied to geophysical problems (Sen and Stoffa, 2013). Swarm intelli-
gence (SI) algorithms are a set of global optimization approaches. SI is 
the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems that 
often are inspired by biological systems such as ant colonies, bird 
flocking, and fish schooling (Blum and Merkle, 2008). Many SI algo-
rithms have been introduced and successfully applied over the past 
decades. For example, differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm 
optimization (PSO) are two notable SI algorithms. DE is a popular robust 
and efficient SI algorithm (Storn and Price, 1997). On the other hand, 
PSO is another optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and effi-
ciency (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995). In geophysical inversion, DE and 
PSO algorithms have been widely used since the early 1990s (Semnani 
et al., 2009, Wang and Gao, 2012, Gao et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2016; 
Wardhana and Pranowo, 2022). 
To obtain the unknown subsurface parameters, the SI algorithm 
searches directly for a solution in a search space S of candidate solu-
tions. In the case of constrained optimization, a solution is found in the 
feasible region f, where f ⊆ S. If the probability distribution (PD) of the 
solution is known, the f is easy to construct. But the analytical PD of the 
parameters is undefined for the seismic data. On the other hand, well 
logs including acoustic and density can be obtained from the subsurface

resource exploration and the earth deep drilling in the continent and 
ocean. Considering the layered earth model, the sparsity assumption of 
reflectivity is feasible. In a depositional area, a probability density 
function (PDF) of the reflectivity can be estimated from the acoustic and 
density logs of a well. In the same depositional area, the reflectivity 
distribution can be assumed to be spatial stationarity. Therefore, based 
on the PDF of reflectivity, the shape of the f can be constrained, 
providing more accurate potential solutions for the seismic inversion. 
In this study, we proposed the scheme of the SI algorithms with PD 
constraint, such as sparse distribution, to solve the seismic inversion 
problem. For the sake of comparison, we focus on two SI algorithms 
including DE and PSO with PD constraint, named DE-PD and PSO-PD 
respectively. In this scheme, we construct a probability transformation 
that keeps the distribution of the model parameter as the same as the PD 
of the well data due to the spatial stationarity of the reflectivity distri-
bution. Under the same condition, numerical and field examples show 
that the DE-PD and PSO-PD estimate better inversion solutions than the 
results of the conventional DE and PSO. In particular, the DE-PD is the 
best performer in the seismic inversion. 
2. Method 
2.1. Seismic inversion problem 
In 1D seismic inversion, unknown subsurface parameters mtrue are 
typically estimated by minimizing a waveform misfit function J between 
model data d and observation data dobs. The form of J : RN→ R can be 
expressed as 
J = ‖d − dobs‖q
q,
(1)  
d = T (m),
(2)  
dobs = T (mtrue) + n,
(3)  
where q > 0, n denotes the additive noise, and T denotes a mapping 
operator between the model m and the data d. For the layered earth 
model, m denotes the earth’s reflectivity. The reflectivity of ith layer can 
be calculated by 
mi = Ii+1 − Ii
Ii+1 + Ii
,
(4)  
where Ii denotes the seismic impedance. The seismic impedance can be 
written as 
Ii = ρivi,
(5)  
where ρi denotes the density of a rock, and vi denotes the compressional 
wave velocity. 
Sometimes, the density can be simplified as a constant in a seismic 
inversion. Therefore, the velocity, impedance and reflectivity can be 
estimated by using seismic inversion in the layered earth model, 
respectively. The choice of inversion parameters of the earth model 
mainly depends on the detailed geological challenge. 
To solve this inversion problem, the estimation of m usually can be 
reformulated by an optimization problem 
min
m∈Rn‖m‖p
p, s.t. ‖d − dobs‖2
2 ≤ σ2,
(6)  
where p > 0, ‖m‖p
p∶ = ∑n
i=1|mi|p, denotes the l p norm (if p ≥ 1) or quasi 
norm (if 0 < p < 1), and σ2 denotes the noise level. 
In this study, considering the priori information of reflectivity, an 
optimization problem with PD constraint can be formulated as 
min
m∈Rn
⃦⃦P(m) − P
(
m0)⃦⃦p
p, s.t. ‖d − dobs‖2
2 ≤ σ2,
(7)  
where m0 is an a priori information of the reflectivity, and P denotes a 
probability density estimated from well logs. To maintain the same PD 
between m and m0, we proposed to apply a probability transformation in 
an updated global optimization approach. The implementation of the 
updated SI algorithms is presented in the next section. 
2.2. SI algorithms with PD constraint 
In general, standard SI algorithms should have three basic steps. In 
the first step, the initial population of agents is randomly generated from 
the solution representation. Each agent represents one solution. In the 
second step, each agent in the population is evaluated by the fitness 
value calculated by the misfit function. The fitness values of the popu-
lation rank the agent within the population for selection. In the third 
step, a new population is updated by the perturbing of agents in the 
existing population. 
In order to keep the same prior PDF of solutions in the optimization 
process, we proposed to improve the SI algorithms. As shown in Fig. 1, 
two extended operations (red dashed box), the PDF library and the 
probability transformation, are added. The updated SI algorithms with 
PD constraint usually have five basic steps. 
The creating of the PDF library is the first step in the updated SI 
algorithms, as shown in Fig. 1. Before the original first step, we extract 
the PDF library of the parameter mwell from the well logs. The PDF li-
brary is defined as

dashed box.

mwell, respectively. Then, the probability density P is written as

In the Equation (8), providing n≫k, the parameter mwell has a sparse 
distribution. 
The processing of the probability transformation is the fifth step in 
the updated SI algorithms, as shown in Fig. 1. After the original third 
step, in order to keep the PDF of the model parameter m and the PDF of 
the parameter mwell consistent, the probability transformation f can be 
defined as 
mk

)
,
(15)  
where mk
i,j,SI denotes the model parameter calculated by the update of 
standard SI algorithms, and mk
i,j denotes the model parameter calculated 
by the probability transformation f. The probability transformation f is 
defined as 
f = G−1(P(m)),

where 
P(m)

G can be defined as

Mathematically, our proposed PD constraint is independent on a specific 
SI algorithm. In the other words, these two extended operations can be 
inserted into any standard SI algorithms. Considering the efficiency and 
popularity, the standard DE and PSO are chosen for updating in this 
study. 
In the standard DE, the following are the main operators.

where ε1 and ε2 are two uniform random vectors within [0,1], α and β are

According to the scheme as shown in Fig. 1, the standard DE and PSO 
are easily improved to the DE-PD and PSO-PD. Figs. 2 and 3 show the 
updated workflows of DE-PD and PSO-PD, respectively. Note that the 
parameters of the original DE and PSO algorithms may be not be optimal 
in all numerical examples, because we prefer to show the advantages 
and disadvantages of the extended constraint of PD in the DE-PD and 
PSO-PD algorithms. Therefore, the parameters of four SI algorithms, 
such as the number of problem dimensions, the population, and the 
maximum iteration, should be set as the same for the next comparison in 
this study. 
3. Numerical examples 
3.1. 1-D model 
We firstly use the case of a 1-D model numerical example to test the 
performance of four SI algorithms including the DE, the DE-PD, the PSO, 
and the PSO-PD. This model is a part of the Marmousi2 model (Martin 
et al., 2006) whose geological parameters are measured from the pe-
troleum sedimentary basin. 
Fig. 4(a) shows this 1-D velocity model with 700 m, which has been 
converted into the time domain by the travel time. For four SI algo-
rithms, the number of problem dimension, the population, and the 
maximum iteration is 120, 40 and 200, respectively. The initial velocity 
model is random, which ranges from 1.0 km/s to 2.4 km/s. Using a 35- 
Hz Ricker wavelet, the results of the velocity inversion are shown in 
Fig. 4(a). 
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the comparison of the velocity inversion by the 
DE (Yellow), the DE-PD (Red), the PSO (Cyan), and the PSO-PD 
(Magenta) with the true velocity, the mean errors are 0.5580, 0.3370, 
1.0260 and 0.3876, respectively. In this model, we note that the PD of 
reflectivity is sparse (Fig. 4(b)). Due to the constraint of reflectivity PD, 
the convergence rates (fitness values) of the DE-PD and the PSO-PD are 
faster than the convergence rates of the DE and the PSO (Fig. 4(c)). 
Meanwhile, the fitness value of DE-PD is larger than that of PSO-PD in 
the first 30th iterations, and then the fitness value of DE-PD is smaller 
than that of PSO-PD in the next 170 iterations. Thus, the estimated ve-
locity of DE-PD is better than the result of PSO-PD, while the runtime of 
DE-PD is longer than the runtime of PSO-PD. 
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the interesting targets include a thick gas 
reservoir near 0.15 - 0.21 s and a thin oil reservoir near 0.92 - 0.93 s. The 
velocity reduces quickly at these gas and oil layers, where it is difficult to 
estimate the subsurface parameters accurately, seeing the results of the 
DE and the PSO. However, the results of DE-PD and PSO-PD can capture 
the lowest velocity in the thick gas layer. Especially, the DE-PD works 
well in the thin oil layer. Overally, the DE-PD performs best in the ac-
curacy of estimation and convergence in this numerical case. 
In addition, we add white Gaussian noise to the 1-D noise free 
inversion (synthetic seismic signal) to compare the robustness between 
the DE, the DE-PD, the PSO, and the PSO-PD. In this study, more than 
100 independent trials are processed where the signal to signal-to-noise

ratio (SNR) level is a random value between 10 dB and 20 dB. The pa-
rameters of four SI algorithms are the same as those of noise free 
inversion. 
The results of more than 100 independent experiments are shown in 
Table 1. The results of runtime, fitness and error are the average of 
several independent trials. In order to reduce the time cost in the more 
than 100 independent trials, we adopted the parallel computation of 
multi-core processor. 
As shown in Table 1, the runtime of DE-PD (102.68 s) is five times as 
large as that of DE (19.77 s), the fitness value of DE-PD (0.3250) is 
approximately two less than that of DE (0.5322), and the mean error of 
DE-PD (0.1555) is two times less than that of DE (0.3316). Similarly, the 
runtime of PSO-PD (85.81 s) is almost 13 times as large as that of PSO 
(6.68 s), the fitness value of PSO-PD (0.4046) is two less than that of PSO 
(1.0013), and the mean error of PSO-PD (0.1834) is four times less than 
that of PSO (0.7892). Totally, the DE-PD performs best in the accuracy of 
estimation and convergence, but its runtime is the largest. Thus, the long 
runtime of SI algorithms with PD constraint is one of the drawbacks in 
this study.

3.2. 2-D layer model 
We also estimate impedances of 2-D seismic section based on the part 
of the Marmousi2 model (Fig. 5(a)). In this 2-D layered model, the 
lowest impedance area (black lens) can be interpreted as a gas charged 
sand channel. As an example, this small-scale model has only 75 traces. 
The initial velocity model is random ranging from 1.0 km/s to 2.4 km/s. 
Due to multiple traces, we also adopted the parallel computing of multi- 
core processor to improve the computation speed of post-stacked seismic 
inversion with the known wavelet. 
The compared results of four SI methods are shown in Fig. 5. The 
mean errors of them are 0.3582, 0.1986, 0.5115 and 0.3350, respec-
tively. With the sparse distribution of the reflectivity model (Fig. 5(f)), 
the estimated seismic impedances of DE-PD and PSO-PD are better than 
the results of DE and PSO. Especially, the seismic impedance estimated 
by DE-PD shows the exact edges of the gas charged sand channel (black 
lens area) and several thin layers, as shown in Fig. 5(c). 
Based on the comparison of the above numerical examples, we can 
mark three interesting points about our proposed method. (1) The DE- 
PD performs best in the accuracy of estimation and convergence 
among the four SI algorithms. (2) The early fitness value of DE-PD is

estimated by (b) DE, (c) DE-PD, (d) PSO, and (e) PSO- 
PD with the true impedance model, the mean errors 
are 0.3582, 0.1986, 0.5115 and 0.3350, respectively. 
(f) The PDF of reflectivity is sparse. Interfaces of lens- 
shaped gas reservoir (black area) and multiple thin 
layers can be more clearly detected in the impedance 
estimated by the DE-PD.

larger than that of PSO-PD, and then the fitness value of DE-PD is smaller 
than that of PSO-PD in further iterations. (3) The runtime of DE-PD is the 
largest, and that of PSO-PD is the second. 
3.3. Seismic inversion in Cascadia margin gas hydrates 
Finally, we applied the SI algorithms to seismic inversion of seismic 
data acquired from a gas hydrates survey on the northern Cascadia 
margin offshore Vancouver Island, Canada. Detailed seismic reflection 
surveys have provided supporting data for gas hydrates on the northern 
Cascadia margin (Riedel et al., 2001). As shown in Fig. 6, seismic 
experiment and sites have been implemented by the IODP Expedition 
311. It is significant to determine the origin of the bottom-simulating 
reflector (BSR) in the seismic reflection data (Yang et al., 2022). The 
BSR may indicate the base of the high velocity hydrate layer 
(Andreassen et al., 1997). 
In this study, we focus on the IODP site U1327 (red circle) with a 
time interval from 1.85 s to 2.20 s, As shown in Fig. 7(a). Due to the high 
velocity, a typical BSR formation can be detected between 2.0 s and 2.05 
s. For the gas hydrate sediments, the PDF of the reflectivity still is sparse 
(Fig. 7(b)). 
For four SI algorithms, the number of problem dimension, the pop-
ulation, and the maximum iteration is 100, 40 and 300, respectively. 
The initial velocity model ranges from 1.4 km/s to 2.0 km/s. As shown in 
Fig. 7(a),comparing the estimated velocity by DE (Yellow), DE-PD (Red), 
PSO (Cyan), and PSO-PD (Magenta) with the true velocity, the mean 
errors are 0.2801, 0.0699, 0.4225, and 0.0908 respectively. Due to the 
constraint of sparse PD, accuracies of the DE-PD (Red) and the PSO-PD 
(Magenta) are higher than the original DE (Yellow) and PSO (Cyan) 
(Fig. 7(a)), while the convergence rates of the DE-PD and the PSO-PD are 
faster than convergence rates of the DE and the PSO (Fig. 7(c)). 
Compared with other methods, the DE-PD performs best both in the 
accuracy of estimation and convergence, which shows that the DE-PD is 
available to solve the seismic inversion for gas hydrate detection. 
4. Conclusion 
To keep the priori sparse distribution of reflectivity, we proposed the 
constrained scheme of seismic swarm intelligence inversion, especially 
two targeted DE-PD and PSO-PD algorithms. In this constrained scheme, 
due to the spatial stationarity of the sparse distribution of the reflec-
tivity, a probability transformation is constructed, which can keep the 
distribution of model parameters as the same as the PDF library 
extracted from well logs. Under the same parameters, four SI algorithms, 
including DE, the DE-PD, the PSO, and the PSO-PD, are applied in 
marmousi2 and gas hydrates data. The results of velocity and impend-
ence inversion show that the DE-PD and PSO-PD estimate better solu-
tions than the conventional DE and PSO. In particular, the DE-PD 
performs best in terms of the accuracy of estimation and speed of 
convergence among the four SI algorithms. However, the main disad-
vantage of the DE-PD is the largest computation time. In the next, the 
proposed DE-PD will be accelerated by parallel computing with GPUs.
