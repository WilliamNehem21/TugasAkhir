Abstract 
Finite element analysis can research the change of the structure and the interior field intensity of human and animal body 
organs and tissues through simulation experiment. We use finite element analysis software to analyze the spinal cord 
surface potential and research the transmission feature of signals generated by interneurons in spinal cord which are 
related with body motion control and sensory processing. A three dimensional model of electrical source in rat’s spinal 
cord was built, the influence on potential distribution on spinal cord surface caused by position changes of electrical 
source in transverse direction and dorsoventral direction was analyzed and calculated. We obtained the potential 
distribution curves of spinal cord surface and compared the results with data from animal experiments, verifying the 
feasibility of scheme of locating the excitatory through potential distribution on spinal cord surface.

system. It can produce neuronal circuits of self-excitation sustained behavior, such as walking, breathing, 
chew, etc. And it is the center control unit of the rhythmic motion[1]. Spinal cord interneurons play an 
important role in the body motion control and sensory processing. They provide not only the plasticity for the 
restructuring of the spinal cord loop but also play a vital role in recovery of spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. 
Theoretically, if we exert direct stimulation at some points or sensory input in the uninjured spinal cord CPG 
loop, rhythmic motion under damaged parts can be restored [2],[3]. We think that the diverse positions of the 
excitatory neurons in the spinal cord result in the diversity of potential distribution on spinal cord surface. In 
return, if we know the relationship between the location of the excitatory neuron and the regularity of 
potential distribution on spinal cord surface, then we can locate the excitatory neuron in the spinal cord 
through regularity of potential distribution on spinal cord surface we obtained before. 
Therefore, this article is based on the finite element analysis software . We built a three dimensional model 
of electrical source in rat’s spinal cord, and the influence on potential distribution on spinal cord surface 
caused by position changes of electrical source in transverse direction, dorsoventral direction and rostro 
caudal direction was analyzed. 
2.Distribution calculation model on spinal cord surface 
2.1.The three-dimensional model of rat spinal cord 
In order to study the transmission characteristics of nerve signals in the spinal cord and establishing of the 
nerve electric source model, various morphologic parameters of rat spinal cord were assessed. Experimental 
animals: Sprague Dawley rats of clean grade supplied by Nantong University Laboratory Animal Center. We 
selected L2 which controls hind limbs movement as the modeling section. Figure 1 (a) shows the slice of L2 
(bar = 500�m). Origin of coordinates locates in the central canal, the rightward transverse direction is the 
positive direction of X axis and the dorsal side of the dorsoventral direction is the positive direction of Y axis. 
The coordinates of the key-points on the outline of the right side L2 are shown as below(unit: �m) : 
grey matter:(0,0); (520,400); (1040,0); (1200,400); (1300,900); (720,1400); (400,1200); (300,880); (0,660), 
white matter�(20,-540); (800,-940); (1780,0); (0,1360). 
 
Fig.1. (a)The L2 segment slice figure in lumber spinal cord of rat; (b) Three dimensional model of spinal cord 
Spinal cord segmental model was built in the Maxwell three dimensional model of electrical source 
according to the morphologic parameters of rat spinal cord (See figure 1 (b)).The size of simulation model is 
2560�m 2300�m 3000�m, then the model was meshed into tetrahedron units. The established three-
52

dimensional finite element model is consistent with the morphology of slice and can be rotated, scaled and 
observed in different angles. 
2.2.Material attributes of the three-dimensional model 
After the three-dimensional model of the spinal cord was built we set electrical conductivity properties of 
tissues. Because the resistance effect of nerve fiber is much greater than the capacitance effect of spinal cord, 
so the latter can be neglected. The conductivity of gray matter is 0.23 S/m and the conductivity of white 
matter is 0.60S/m (vertical), 0.083 S/m (horizontal). 
3. Research on the simulation of potential distribution on spinal cord surface 
Foreign scholars used activity-dependent labeling, the localization of spinal cord neurons active during 
locomotor activity, they found mainly labeled cells in L1-L6 located bilaterally near the central canal and in 
the medial intermediate zone [4],[5],[6].In the cat, the responses to intraspinal microstimulation of the lumbar 
spinal cord have been studied at the level of limb kinematic responses, muscle activation, or single joint 
torques with stimulation delivered in the ventral portion(ventral lamina
�,and lamina
�-�)[7]. So we choose 
�-
 layer, an area consists of motor nucleus clonies comprised of big type motor neurons and small type 
�
interneurons which control skeletal muscles, as shown in figure 2,the part enveloped by blue dashed line in 
the right side of gray matter of spinal cord. 
The influence on potential distribution on spinal cord surface caused by position changes of electrical 
source in transverse direction and dorsoventral direction was researched. We recorded the potential on spinal 
cord surface in accordance with the direction of red dashed arrows shown in figure2.

3.1. The influence on potential distribution on spinal cord surface caused by position changes of electrical 
source in transverse direction 
In research of the influence on potential distribution on spinal cord surface caused by position changes of 
electrical source in transverse direction, the position moves a distance of equal proportion, such as 3%, 6%, 
9% of the transverse direction. Suppose A (324�m,-200�m,50�m) and B (432�m,-200�m,50�m), C (540�m, 
-200�m,50�m), D (648�m,-200�m,50�m), E (756�m,-200�m,50�m) respectively are electrical sources along 
the transverse direction shown in figure 2, generating 8 mV nervous impulse. We can see in figure 3 that

spinal cord surface potential mainly concentrates on range of 137�V�169�V, the closer the electrical sources 
are to the dorsal median suleus on sagittal plane, the more conspicuous the peak voltages are in the 
distribution curves and there is no peak voltage if the electrical sources are distant from the sagittal plane. 
That is to say, the spinal cord surface potential is on a rise from left to right. According to the results, if we 
find the data got from the experiment appear to be monotonic, it shows that the position is distant from the 
sagittal plane, on the contrary, if some of the data shows extreme high voltages, it shows that the position is 
close to the sagittal plane.

3.2. The influence on potential distribution on spinal cord surface caused by position changes of electrical 
source in dorsoventral direction 
In research of the influence on potential distribution on spinal cord surface caused by position changes of 
electrical source in dorsoventral direction, the position moves a distance of equal proportion, such as 3%, 6%, 
9% of the dorsoventral direction. Suppose F(540�m,-62�m,50�m), G(540�m,-131�m,50�m ), H(540�m,-
200�m,50�m ), I(540�m,-269�m,50�m ), J(540�m,-338�m,50�m )respectively are electrical sources along 
the dorsoventral direction shown in figure 2, generating 8 mV nervous impulse. We can see in figure 4 that 
spinal cord surface potential mainly concentrates on range of 138�v�169�V, the trend of the distribution 
curves maintain unchanged while electrical sources are moving along the dorsoventral direction, just the 
potential values are bigger when the electrical sources are close to the dorsal part.

4. The experiment of recording the potential on spinal cord surface 
To verify the feasibility of confirming the location of excitatory neuron in the spinal cord through potential 
distribution on spinal cord surface, we conducted the experiment of recording the potential on spinal cord 
surface with rats. The recording electrode we used were self-made acupuncture needle electrodes, with a 
diameter of 0.16mm and coating material of excellent biocompatibility(Parylene insulating layer) on surface. 
4 needles were fixed with silicone and kept them parallel with a 0.5mm-pitch between each other. The needle 
electrodes could properly cover the spinal cord surface. We used signal generator MASTER-9 to generate 
double-polarity pulse whose negative pulse width is 200�s, and an ISO - Flex isolator to generate current of 
0.3 mA�1.5 mA to stimulate the right sciatic nerve (increased by 0.2mA a time). Synchronous record 
software (LabChart signal recording system) was used to record potentials collected form needle electrodes, 
as shown in figure 5.

The potential distribution recorded on spinal cord surface was shown as figure 6. After repeated 
experiments we found that potentials on spinal cord surface would basically increase with the increase of the 
stimulated current. Except the 0.9mA stimulated current, under the rest of the stimulated current the potential 
distribution also showed a trend of rising from left to right, which resembled with the simulation results that 
the potential distribution on the surface of the spinal cord is on a rise from left to right.

Ansoft to analyze potential distribution on spinal cord surface after the interneurons activated by external 
stimulation acquiring the influence on potential distribution on spinal cord surface caused by position changes 
of electrical source in transverse direction and dorsoventral direction. 
compared the results with data from animal experiments, verifying the feasibility of scheme of locating the 
excitatory neuron through potential distribution on spinal cord surface. In the future work, we can enlarge the 
number of electrodes in transverse direction and dorsoventral direction to make the results more accurate and 
make preparation for locating the active interneurons through potential distribution on spinal cord surface.
