Abstract
Ensuring the quality of food, particularly seafood has increasingly become an important
issue nowadays. Quality Management Systems empower any organization to identify, measure,
control and improve the quality of the products manufactured that will eventually lead to improved
business performance. With the advent of new technologies, now intelligent systems are being devel-
oped. To ensure the quality of seafood, an ontology based seafood quality analyzer and miner
(ONTO SQAM) model is proposed. The knowledge is represented using ontology. The domain
concepts are deﬁned using ontology. This paper presents the initial part of the proposed model –
the analysis of quality test parameter values. Two algorithms are proposed to do the analysis –
Comparison Algorithm and Data Store Updater algorithm. The algorithms ensure that the values
of various quality tests are in the acceptable range. The real data sets taken from different seafood
companies in Kerala, India, and validated by the Marine Product Export Development Authority
of India (MPEDA) are used for the experiments. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated
using standard performance metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. The results obtained
show that all the three measures achieved good results.

1. Introduction
In seafood processing industries, control measures are adopted
to ensure the safety and quality of products. Various quality
assurance standards exist to guarantee the safety and quality
of goods. Some of them are International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point
(HACCP), Quality Management Program (QMP), Total
Quality Management (TQM), etc. [3]. So the adoption of

proper quality control systems is mandatory in any seafood
organization that deals with food processing and distribution.
Seafood exporters in developing countries have experienced
serious problems complying with progressively stricter food
safety and quality requirements for importers. So the author
proposed ONTO SQAM, a knowledge-based model to ensure
the quality of the seafood.
Knowledge-Based Systems are expert systems that utilize
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) techniques to generate knowledge
from the data, analyze the data and convert it into meaningful
information, thereby acting as a human expert. Ontologies
propose an efﬁcient knowledge representation technique in
Artiﬁcial Intelligence systems. Ontologies provide sound rea-
soning systems. The deﬁnition of ontology follows as a ‘‘for-
mal, explicit speciﬁcation of a shared conceptualization” [1].
Ontologies were developed in AI to facilitate knowledge shar-
ing and reuse [2]. Ontologies provide a formal semantics for
the description of many concepts involved in the domain and
relations between these concepts [6]. The knowledge base of
the proposed model contains information about the seafood,
details of the test parameters, values, etc. It is implemented
using different ontologies. The ontologies analyze the quality
test results, and a better, and detailed quality report is gener-
ated automatically by the system.
Every seafood organization is conducting organoleptic,
microbiological, and chemical checks at all stages of seafood
production. The standard values are used to compare the
results of all the above tests, and the management takes
appropriate measures when the quality is found to be poor.
Currently, the companies do these procedures manually.
But there is a possibility that sometimes the test values
obtained will not be in the acceptable range. It happens due
to several reasons such as test equipment failure, insufﬁcient
incubation and input errors. Currently, in the seafood indus-
try, no electronic checks are done to ﬁgure out these types of
mistakes that can happen at the initial stage. Also, the
laboratory technologist is not comparing the test value with
the values obtained in the past for similar trials. So in the
proposed model, two algorithms are suggested to do the
initial analysis of quality test parameter values. The aim of
this is to understand about any errors or quality issues at
the beginning stage itself. A comparison algorithm is pro-
posed to ensure the validity of the test procedures and the
accuracy of the values obtained. Data store update algorithm
updates the data store with a minimum acceptable value and
maximum value for each test. If there is a signiﬁcant differ-
ence between the values currently generated and the previous
values, the system alerts the technologists to check the test
procedure or to repeat the tests again. In the proposed
ONTO SQAM model, different algorithms are proposed for
analysis, mining, and prediction of data. This paper presents
only the initial part of the proposed model – the analysis of
quality test parameter values.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 com-
prises of the materials and methods. The section describes the
design of ontologies, analysis of quality test parameter values,
and the proposed algorithms. Section 3 includes results and
discussions. It illustrates the data sets used, the performance
of the algorithms on the selected data sets and the values of
performance metrics. Section 4 presents the conclusion which
is followed by references.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Knowledge modeling - design of ontologies
Ontologies deﬁne the semantics of the concepts identiﬁed in a
domain. There is no single method to develop an ontology.
This research follows the approach proposed by Noy and
McGuinness in the development of ontologies [4]. Many inter-
esting ontologies are available on the web in different domains,
particularly in the medical domain. Such ontologies enable
information sharing, and other applications reuse them. But
in seafood domain, no relevant ontologies exist. So the ontolo-
gies used in the proposed model are developed from scratch.
The proposed ONTO-SQAM model comprises of three
ontologies: the Seafood ontology, Test Speciﬁcations ontology,
and Seafood Integrated Ontology. Fig. 1 presents the taxon-
omy of Seafood ontology.
The parent classes in Seafood ontology are the central con-
cepts in the domain such as product types, ﬁsh categories,
country of export and type of tests. Country, Fish, Product,
Test, etc., are the main classes of the ontology. Each of these
main classes consists of different subclasses according to their
types. The main ﬁsh categories included in the ontology are
Bony
Fish,
Cephalopods,
Crustaceans,
Molluscs,
and
Scombridae. The various seafood under each category is the
instances of the particular class. For example, the instances
of Cephalopods are Cuttleﬁsh, Octopus, Squid, etc. Fig. 2 shows
Cephalopods class and its individuals (instances).
Similarly,
the
Test
subclass
consists
of
subclasses
such as chemical, microbiological and organoleptic. Each of
these classes, in turn, consists of further subclasses as given
in Fig. 1.

141
Fig. 3 shows the taxonomy of Test Speciﬁcations Ontology.
It contains the test standards of seafood and sanitation items
such as water, ice and salt used during the seafood processing.
Quality Checking tests are of two types – Internal Test and
External Test. The speciﬁcations are different for internal tests
and external tests. External-Test and Internal-Test are the two
sub-classes of the Test-Speciﬁcation ontology. Under each of
these classes, we have subclasses to represent sanitation item
and
seafood
item.
Internal-Test-Non-Food
and
Internal-
Test-Seafood are the two subclasses of Internal-Test class.
Test-Spec-Raw-AllCountries
and
Test-Spec-Uncooked-
Frozen are the two primary classes of Internal-Test-Seafood
class. For each category of raw seafood, the test speciﬁcations
are independent of the country of export. So the ﬁve subclasses
of Test-Spec-Raw-AllCountries represent the test speciﬁcations
of ﬁve categories of seafood included in Seafood ontology. But
in the case of frozen seafood, each country of export has its
standards for speciﬁc seafood. So a subclass is deﬁned for each
country under the class Test-Spec-UncookedFrozen and for
each of those classes, subclasses are deﬁned to include the test
standards of particular seafood.
Seafood Integrated Ontology is a storehouse of each pro-
duct test ﬁle with the corresponding test report. This ontology
is used by the proposed Data Store Update algorithm to
update the test values as explained in the later sections.
2.2. Analysis of quality test parameter values – proposed model
Fig. 4 shows the proposed model to analyze the test parameter
values. Initially, the laboratory technologist conducts tests
(organoleptic, microbiological and chemical) as usual, and
the sample results are input to the proposed model. The model
generates a product test ﬁle (owl ﬁle) that contains the test
parameters and the results of each sample. It produces a new
ﬁle for each test sample, which contains the test parameters
and the obtained parameter values.
Before checking the values with the test standards stored in
the Test Speciﬁcations ontology, the comparison algorithm
(Analysis I) analyzes the parameter values. This checking does
ensure that the obtained values are in the acceptable range.
Data store update algorithm updates the acceptable values
for a particular test in the data store. The permitted value
for each test item is computed by the data store update algo-
rithm using ontology data and Test Speciﬁcations ontology.
These values are stored in the Data Store, making it available
for fast retrieval. The comparison algorithm compares the cur-
rent test values with the values retrieved from the data store. If
the values are not in the permissible range, the laboratory tech-
nologists provide necessary alerts.
If the values are in the acceptable range, the product test ﬁle
is validated (Analysis II) as per the speciﬁcations stored in the
Test Speciﬁcations ontology. Table 1 shows the microbiologi-
cal, organoleptic and antibiotic test parameters with their stan-
dards to check the quality of molluscs raw material.
The test quality standards for validation are implemented
using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) [7]. Fig. 5 shows
the rule in SWRL to validate the Molluscs. The microbiologi-
cal tests check the presence of ‘TPC’, ‘Vibrio Cholera’,
‘Vibrio-Parahaemolyticus’, ‘E-Coli’ and ‘Staphylococcus-Aur
eus’ in molluscs. Organoleptic factors are ten in number, listed
from 6 through 15 in Table 1. Paralytic shellﬁsh poisoning
(PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellﬁsh Poisoning (DSP) are two major
biotoxins associated with shellﬁshes such as clams, mussels and
oysters. These 19 parameters determine the overall quality of
the raw material. The technologist compares the values
obtained with the tolerance limit. The acceptance/rejection of

raw material is taken based on the comparison. A comprehen-
sive quality report is generated describing the quality of the
product tested. This report tells the acceptance status of the
test input sample.
2.3. Proposed algorithms to analyze the test parameter values
The Test Speciﬁcations ontology stores the microbiological,
chemical and organoleptic test standards (min_value and max_-
value). So these test standards are available only during the
Analysis phase. Also due to scalability issues of ontology, it
is time-consuming to every time retrieve the test standards
directly from the ontology. So a data store update algorithm
is proposed to compute the permitted value for each test item.
The above algorithm stores the updated min_value and
max_value of each test in the data store, making it available
for fast retrieval. When the laboratory technologist inputs the
value, a comparison algorithm retrieves the permitted range
of the concerned test from the data store. The comparison
algorithm checks whether the value entered by the user is within
the allowable range, by comparing the test input value with
min_value and max_value available in the data store.
2.3.1. Data store update algorithm
Table 2 shows the proposed Data Store Update algorithm. The
purpose of this algorithm is to update the data store with an
acceptable minimum and maximum value for each test. In the
beginning, the algorithm retrieves the corresponding past test
values from the ontology. Then the algorithm removes the
duplicates and sorts the values. The next step is to set a
minimum value and a maximum value. The Test Speciﬁcations
ontology outputs the standard test limits (min and max) of the
concerned test. The algorithm compares the minimum of the
past test values with the standard minimum limit retrieved from
the ontology and accordingly sets the min_value. Similarly, it
sets the max_value. The algorithm also computes the variance
of the test values. In the end, it updates the computed values
min_value, max_value, and the variance in the data store. This
algorithm is executed periodically as per the system settings
so that the data store contains the updated values.
2.3.2. Comparison algorithm
Table 3 shows the proposed comparison algorithm. The pur-
pose of this algorithm is to ensure the validity of the test pro-
cedures and the accuracy of the values obtained. So this
comparison is not made with the standard limits of the test.
Instead, the comparison algorithm checks the test values with
the values in the data store. The algorithm retrieves the
min_value and max_value of the current test from the data
store and compares with the current_value. If the current_value
is within the permissible range, it means that the values are
known. Otherwise, the algorithm checks the range of variation
of the test values from the data store values. For this, it com-
putes the range and standard deviation. The algorithm
retrieves the variance stored in the data store and calculates
the standard deviation. Next step is to identify the severity
of the error. If the current_value is lesser than the min_value,
the

is lesser than (min_value � range), the algorithm alerts the
technologists that there is a chance of error. If both the above
conditions are false, it means that the current_value is not
acceptable, and the algorithm generates the concerned alerts.
Correspondingly the technologists can check the test values
or can repeat the test. Similarly, if the current_value is greater
than the max_value, the algorithm checks further as mentioned
above and generates concerned alerts. Once we have a large
number of test values and their reports in the data store, the
comparison algorithm gets a collection of test values so that
it can set the min_value and max_value. So the accuracy of
the comparison algorithm is increased as more data accumu-
late in the data store.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Datasets
The data sets used are taken from different seafood companies
in Kerala, India, which exports seafood and seafood products
to all around the world. The Marine Product Export Develop-
ment Authority of India (MPEDA) validated the data sets.
The data sets consist of details of seafood purchased from var-
ious landing centers. It includes the purchase date, seafood
type, landing center code, quantity, importer details, microbi-
ological, chemical, organoleptic test details and details of sea-
food exports to different countries. The experiment used three
datasets of seafood families namely, Bony Fish, Cephalopods,
and Molluscs. Each family includes different types of seafood,
and each group contains valid and invalid data.
Table 4 presents the statistics of the data sets.
3.2. Performance metrics
The performance of the proposed comparison algorithm is
evaluated using the statistical measures such as Precision,
Recall, and Accuracy [5].
Precision is the ratio of the number of valid samples cor-
rectly retrieved to the total number of samples extracted as
valid.

The tables below present the results. It shows the observed
results and the predicted ones along with the performance met-
rics (see Tables 5–7).
For Bony Fish dataset, the algorithm identiﬁed 37 test sam-
ples correctly as true positives and ten samples as true nega-
tives. It wrongly lists two valid test samples as having
problems in the test values. The algorithm incorrectly outputs
three invalid test samples as within the allowable limit.
For Cephalopods data set, the algorithm correctly listed 74
test samples and 12 test samples as true positives and true neg-
atives respectively. It wrongly classiﬁed two positive test sam-
ples as negative, and ﬁve negative test samples as positive.
For Molluscs data set, the algorithm correctly outputs 15
test samples as known values. The algorithm correctly recog-
nized 3 test samples as ‘probable error’ or ‘unacceptable value’.
One sample whose test value was in the acceptable range was
output wrongly as ‘probable error’. The number of samples
whose test values were outside the range identiﬁed as ‘known
value’ is 2.
3.3. Performance analysis and comparison
Fig. 6 shows the overall measures of Precision, Recall, and
Accuracy in identifying the initial errors in test values using
the proposed algorithms. The precision values of all data sets
are obtained in the range 0.88–0.94 with the least precision

4. Conclusion
The paper presents the initial phase of a proposed model
ONTO SQAM, an ontology-based model to ensure the quality
of seafood. Two algorithms are proposed to check the param-
eter values at the initial stage. It helps to understand about any
errors or quality issues at the beginning. The Data Store
Update algorithm updates the acceptable minimum and
maximum value of a test in the data store. The Comparison
algorithm compares the new test values with these updated val-
ues to ensure that the test values are in the acceptable range.
Later, the actual comparison of the test values with the test
standards stored in the ontology is performed. The perfor-
mance metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are used
to evaluate the performance of the model. The experimental
results obtained on the datasets show that all the three
measures achieved good results.
