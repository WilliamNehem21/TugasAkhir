Energy lost due to shadow in the absorber plate of solar collectors can decrease the solar energy gain. In some
studies, mathematical modeling was applied for calculating the energy gain reduction due to shadow in ﬂat-
plate solar collectors. In this study, ANN method was developed for modeling the energy gain reduction. Multi-
layer Perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer and a range of neurons (5–30) by two training algorithms (LM
and BR) and tangent sigmoid activation function (TanSig) were used by help of K-fold cross validation method.
In the ﬁrst section, six set of solar collector dimensions were used (1×1; 1×1.5; 1×2; 1.5×1.5; 1.5×2 and 2×2).
In the second section all the range of dimensions were used as the inputs. The results of the ﬁrst section showed
that MLP with BR training algorithm can predict the energy gain reduction with minimum MAPE and RMSE in all
the categories. The best results related to (1.5×1.5) dimension that achieved a MAPE of 0.15 ± 0.09% and RMASE
of 4.42 ± 2.43 KJm−2 year−1, respectively. The results of the second section indicated that BR is a better training
algorithm than LM. The MAPE and R2 factors for the best topology (5-27-1) were 0.0610 ± 0.0051% and
0.9999 ± 0.0001, respectively. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that height has the biggest impact
on total energy gain reduction due to shadow in ﬂat-plate solar collectors. Finally, the results of this study indi-
cated that by using ANN and decrease the energy lost, the efﬁciency of solar collectors can be increased in all
applications such as industry and agriculture.

1. Introduction
Fossil fuels are not good sources for future energy supply because of
limited resources, price ﬂuctuations, environmental pollution, etc.
(Fadaei et al., 2018). So, the human should ﬁnd another replacement re-
source for energy generation. Solar energy can be continuously used by
humans because of its cleanliness and abundance (Kalani et al., 2017).
Between all the solar energy systems, solar collectors and especially
ﬂat-plate solar collectors are widely used by people as a cheap and inex-
pensive energy system for warming air and water (Al-Waeli et al.,
2019). They are simpler to manufacture, they receive direct and indirect
radiation and do not require solar trackers (Kalogirou, 2014). Solar col-
lectors can be used in agriculture and industry. In agriculture, the green-
house extended the use of solar energy from post-harvest to crop-
production (Taki et al., 2018a). Today greenhouses are ubiquitous
with a huge variety of designs providing a wide range of modiﬁed cli-
mates for plant growth. Solar energy also ﬁnds use in agriculture in
solar water pumping for irrigation and in the desalination of brackish
water (Farhadi and Taki, 2020). Solar cooking has taken the use of
solar energy in the food production chain directly to the end-user.
Broader industrial uses of solar energy have also tended to be linked
to food and beverage production because the temperatures required
can be satisﬁed readily in many climates by a well-designed solar ther-
mal system. Non-agricultural technologies such as solar furnaces have
considerable potential but have had limited practical use to-date (Taki
et al., 2018b).
Flat-plate solar collectors typically have one or two layers of trans-
parent glass on the absorber plate to reduce losses due to convective
air ﬂow (Dufﬁe and Beckman, 2013). This transparent glass is located
at a distance from the absorbent plate. Increasing this distance reduces
convective losses. But, it creates shadows on the absorbent plate and re-
duces the absorption radiation of the sun and ultimately decreases the
performance (Farhadi and Taki, 2020). This distance is suggested in
some researches between 4 and 5 cm (Nahar and Garg, 1980). The
best distance can be calculated by shadow estimation, which has been
done in previous research by Farhadi and Taki (2020). In this study,
the authors decided to introduce a fast and accurate method for calcu-
lating the energy gain reduction in ﬂat-plate solar collectors due to
shadow by using Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).
AI with some simplistic modeling of real neural systems, is widely
used for solving various science problems. The scope of AI application

is so wide (Taki et al., 2018a). It covers classiﬁcation to applications,
such as interpolation, estimation, detection, etc. (Rohani et al., 2019;
Amini et al., 2020). Maybe the most important advantage of this method
is its high speed and acceptable accuracy than traditional mathematical
methods (Alonso et al., 2012). Nowadays various models of AI including
Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adap-
tive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and …, are used in most as-
pects of engineering science (Elsheikh et al., 2019). ANNs are dynamic
systems that transmit empirical knowledge or the law behind the data
into a network structure. These systems learn general rules based on
the calculations of the numerical data or examples and are intelligent
systems (Alonso et al., 2012). The scientists predict that ANN will be
used in the future in all aspect of human life because of its ability to
modeling the linear and nonlinear systems as well as the need for no
preconditions (Rohani et al., 2018).
Application of AI in solar energy systems in some studies was evalu-
ated. Table 1 indicates some of the recent researches on different types
of solar energy systems using AI. In a research, ANN with three hidden
layers was used for evaluation the output of Photovoltaic Thermal
(PV/T) air collector (Dimri et al., 2019). In this study, ANN applied for
prediction the output ﬂuctuating (thermal and electrical energy gain
and also overall thermal energy and exergy gain). The results indicated
that the traditional techniques were complex compared to ANN
method. The ANN model based on the three inputs (global, diffuse and
ambient solar radiation) showed a reasonable prediction accuracy
(MSE = 0.086) and (R = 0.9997). Some other researchers used differ-
ent types of ANN models for PV/T systems and reported reasonable pre-
diction accuracy than traditional methods (Jia et al., 2019). In another
study, ANN was used to predict the output in parabolic trough solar col-
lector tube (Heng et al., 2019). The results showed that ANN is fast and
accurate prediction method for calculating the exit temperature in par-
abolic trough solar collectors. Some others studies showed the ANN
method is accurate, fast and reliable (Rohani et al., 2019; Al-Waeli
et al., 2019; Amini et al., 2020; Rohani et al., 2018; Taki et al., 2018b).
1.1. Scope, innovations and structure
Based on the above literatures and Table 1, this research attempts to
apply ANN for calculating the energy gain reduction due to shadow in
ﬂat-plate solar collectors. This study considers all the latitudes and the
dimensions of the ﬂat plate solar collectors. So, the results can be useful
for all the solar energy engineers in the world. Main goals of this
research are: Application of ANN-MLP model using two training algo-
rithms include Levenberg Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization
(BR), Application of K-fold cross validation method for increasing the
accuracy and reliability of the results and sensitivity analysis for indicat-
ing the share of the inputs on output changing.
It is also the ﬁrst attempt to investigate the application of ANN for
calculating the energy gain reduction in one of the solar energy systems.
In this study, Section 2 shows the methodology of the article – focusing

on data, ANN method and statistical parameters. Section 3 report the
results of ANN method with real data and also presents a guideline of
future researches. The last section is the overall conclusions and recom-
mendations of this study.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Data collection
Flat-plate solar collectors are getting more attention every day due to
their simplicity and reasonable price. The absorber plate in these collec-
tors is enclosed to reduce heat loss with a transparent glass above and
heat-insulated walls from around. But often shadow covers some part of
absorber plate, which reduces the performance. In the previous study
(Farhadi and Taki, 2020), a mathematical model was used to determine
the factors affecting shadow formation (latitude, tilt angle and collector
dimensions). The results showed that height and width had the highest
effect and latitude had the least share in shadow formation. In the present
study, the authors try to estimate the energy loss due to shadow in ﬂat-
plate solar collectors using AI. The required data was extracted from the
study of Farhadi and Taki (2020). In the ﬁrst step, the data were catego-
rized based on the dimensions. So, based on the Table 2, six categories
were selected based on the popular and practical purpose.
In the second section, all the data were used for analysis (Table 3). In
this section, more than 8000 rows of data were extracted and prepared
for ANN analysis.
2.2. Artiﬁcial neural network
The MLP neural network will generate the output vector (zq) for each
q (q = 1.2.3…Q) by receiving the input vector (xq). The goal is to adopt
the correct network parameters to achieve the actual output that is
close to the desired output with high accuracy (Ranjbar et al., 2013). In
this study, basic Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was used for learning
the network. Initially, the data were randomly divided into two groups:
training set (60% of total data) and test set (40% of total data). If this seg-
mentation does not produce the desired results, this step can be repeated
again. Before applying the raw data, the data must be normalized, be-
cause the learning algorithm with the raw data cannot produce the suit-
able results. When using the Tangent Sigmoid (TanSig) activation
function, the best data conversion range is [−1 to +1]. Linear normaliza-
tion was used to convert the data (Rohani et al., 2018):

where, x is the raw and xn is normalized data, xmax and xmin are the
maximum and minimum values of the primary data, and rmax and rmin
are the upper and lower limits of data ranges, respectively.
In this study two training algorithms were used: Levenberg
Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian regularization (BR). Due to the high
speed of network response and avoidance of complexity, a single layer
network was used in this study (Ranjbar et al., 2013). The number of
neurons in hidden layer increased as the results improved and was con-
sidered constant after the error increased. In this study, the maximum
number of neurons in hidden layer was 30. Fig. 1. shows the overall
structure of MLP model with all the components in this study.
2.3. K-fold cross validation
In this research, K-fold cross validation method was used for increas-
ing the conﬁdence of ANN outputs. In this method, the validation data
are divided into different categories of K, based on their type and num-
ber, and are evaluated by each algorithm. In each step, K subsets is used
for accreditation and the others (K-1) are applied for training
(Rodriguez et al., 2010). This K procedure is repeated and all data are
used for training and validation (in this study, K = 5). Finally, the aver-
age results are validated as a ﬁnal estimation. Application of K-fold as a
stochastic subdivision in this method can increase the distribution in
the ANN process and makes the neural network normally used as a
practical method with acceptable results (Taki et al., 2018a). In some
studies, this method was used and the authors reported that the results
can be used in the experimental sections because of reliability (Taki
et al., 2018b; Rohani et al., 2019; Amini et al., 2020).
In order to evaluate the performance of ANN-MLP model, Mean Ab-
solute Percentage Error (MAPE), coefﬁcient of determination (R2), Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Efﬁciency Factor (EF) were used
(Rohani et al., 2019):

Where dj is the jth component of the actual output for the jth pattern;

output and n is the number of variable outputs. A model with the smallest
RMSE, MAPE and largest EF is considered to be the best. Also, MATLAB
software 2018a was used to analyze neural network and regression
methods. Fig. 2 shows the whole procedure of methodology in this study.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The best algorithm for MLP
In this study two training algorithms were used for MLP model (LM
and BR). The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is a method for ﬁnd-
ing the minimum of a multivariate nonlinear function that has become a
standard method for solving the least squares problem in nonlinear
functions (Najaﬁ et al., 2009). Bayesian Regularization (BR) algorithm
is more robust than other traditional algorithms such as standard
back-propagation and can decrease the need for long cross-validation.
BR is a mathematical process that change a nonlinear regression into a
well-posed statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression. The
advantage of BR is that this method is robust and the validation process,
such as back propagation, is unnecessary (Amini et al., 2020). For trans-
fer function, TanSig was used. This type of transfer function is very pop-
ular and many researchers applied this method in ANN studies (Taki
et al., 2018b; Ranjbar et al., 2013; Rohani et al., 2019). In the ﬁrst section,
six types of data based on the collector dimensions were used for
modeling. Two training algorithms and several number of neurons in
hidden layer (1,2, 3….,30) were used for ANN process. Fig. 3. shows
the results of MLP model with two training algorithm (LM-BR) to pre-
dict the energy lost due to shadow for different dimensions of ﬂat-
plate solar collectors. As the results show, the BR algorithm has the bet-
ter performance than LM in all the six categories. The MAPE factor was
varied between 0.119%–0.267% and 0.879%–1.87%, for BR and LM algo-
rithms, respectively.
The results show that the BR algorithm can make accurate output
data and based on the K-fold cross validation, this model (MLP-BR)
can use in real experimental applications. So for other analysis, the BR

was used. Fig. 4 shows the RMSE and EF factors for the best neuron in
the hidden layer by BR algorithm. The results of Fig. 5 show that for
the six dimensions (1×1; 1×1.5; 1×2; 1.5×1.5; 1.5×2 and 2×2) the
best topologies are: 5-14-1; 5-15-1; 5-8-1; 5-18-1; 5-16-1; 5-10-1, re-
spectively. The lowest RMSE is related to (1.5×1.5) dimension. Also
this dimension has the highest EF (0.9999). The results of this ﬁgure
show that the number of neurons in the hidden layer can play an impor-
tant role in the ﬁnal performance but the higher number of neurons in
the hidden layer is not always a reason for increasing the efﬁciency
and accuracy of the neural network model. Table 4 shows the overall
performance of MLP model for the best neurons in the hidden layer by
BR algorithm in the train and test phases. The results of Table 5 show
that MLP model with proposed structure can predict the energy lost
due to shadow for all the dimensions with high accuracy. For ﬂat-plate
solar collectors with (1.5×1.5) dimension, MLP model can use with
higher performance than other dimensions.

There is not any similar research about collectors but in other appli-
cations, some researchers reported similar results about ANN models.
For example, Kalogirou (2006), applied ANN model to estimate the col-
lector performance parameters and reported that this method can use
with high precision. Also the authors indicate that the performance of
ANN can be improved by more training and use other new and sufﬁcient
algorithms.
In a similar study, ANN models (MLP and RBF) were applied to pre-
dict the output yield of wheat production (Taki et al., 2018b). The results
showed that ANN models can use with high performance to predict the

wheat yield for the next cultivation. In another study, Ghritlahre and
Prasad (2018), developed MLP and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
models to predict the heat transfer of two different types of roughened
solar air heaters. The results showed that ANN models with 5-10-1 to-
pology can predict the heat transfer characteristics with high accuracy
(R2 = 0.9953) than MLR. In another study, ANN-MLP model was used
to predict the performance of solar chimney ﬁlled with phase change
materials (Fadaei et al., 2018). The results showed that the correlation
coefﬁcient between the actual and predicted data was more than 0.99
and also the relative error is less than 3%.
In the second section, all the data based on the Table 2 were used for
ANN analysis. In this section the effect of data size can be evaluated. So
as the last section, the TanSig transfer function with LM and BR training
algorithms and the different number of neurons in hidden layer
(1,2,3…,30) were used for ANN modeling. Table 5 shows the results of
MLP-LM model with different number of neurons in the hidden layer
in train, test and total phases.
The results of Table 6 indicated that, the best topology with highest
performance is 5–20-1. Total MAPE and R2 for this structure are
1.0397 ± 0.2888 and 0.9970 ± 0.0017, respectively. Based on the
Table 5, the MAPE of MLP-LM structure in total phase was varied be-
tween 1.0397 and 1.3982%. Also, this table show that the data size of
training has not a signiﬁcant effect on total MAPE of MLP-LM structure
in this study. So the analysis was repeated for MLP-BR model with
same structure of MLP-LM (Table 6). The results of Table 6 show that
MAPE and R2 at total phase for the best topology with MLP-BR structure
(5–27-1) are 0.0610 ± 0.0051% and 0.9999 ± 0.0001, respectively.
MAPE for different number of neurons in the hidden layer is varied be-
tween 0.0610 ± 0.0051 to 0.8664 ± 0.1482%. The results of MLP-BR
analysis show that the standard deviation in train, test and total phases
is very low compared with the same results of MLP-LM. The MAPE for
the best topology (5–27-1) in MLP-BR is more than 16 times lower
than the same MAPE for the best topology by MLP-LM (5–20-1).
Table 7 shows a brief comparison with all statistical parameters be-
tween the best topologies by LM and BR training algorithms.
Fig. 5.A shows Cross-Correlation of predicted and actual values by
the best topology (5–27-1) and B: shows the convergence diagram of
this topology at train, test and validation phases. Fig. 5A shows that
after 677 repetitions, the MSE for train, test and total phases reached
to the minimum value and MLP-BR model was learned to predict the
output with lowest error. Also the next section (B) shows that this to-
pology can accounted more than 99% of total actual variability in the
real data. The correlation coefﬁcient between the actual and predicted
data in train, test, validation and total phases are very high. So, this
model can show the relation between the inputs and output with high
accuracy and can be accepted for experimental applications. Many re-
searchers reported that the ANN model could solve problem equation
and predict the results with high accuracy in all aspect of sciences
(Elsheikh et al., 2019). Sözen et al. (2008), applied ANN method to eval-
uate the performance of ﬂat-plate solar collector and reported that the
maximum deviation between the actual and predicted data by ANN
model was about 2.55%.
3.2. Sensitivity analysis
In the last section, the sensitivity analysis was evaluated for MLP-BR
structure. By sensitivity analysis, the share of each inputs on the output
can be calculated. Fig. 6 shows the sensitivity analysis for MLP-BR
(5–27-1) in this study. As it can be seen, the share of height on the en-
ergy gain reduction due to shadow in ﬂat-plate solar collectors, is higher
than other parameters. This is similar to the result of mathematical
modeling (Farhadi and Taki, 2020). So, ﬁnding the best height in all
the dimensions and in all the latitudes and tilts, is a main factor for op-
timization the energy lost due to shadow in ﬂat-plate solar collectors. By
the results of this study, engineers can ﬁnd the energy lost in ﬂat-plate
solar collectors in the world and the optimum dimensions and height
can be ﬁnd by ANN model before construction. The authors strongly
suggested to adopt the best ANN models for every county based on
the local dimensions of ﬂat-plate solar collectors and decrease the en-
ergy lost and improve the efﬁciency of solar collectors.

4. Conclusion
In this study, ANN-MLP method was developed for modeling the en-
ergy gain reduction due to shadow in ﬂat-plate solar collectors. Two
training algorithms (LM-BR) with TanSig transfer function and K-fold
cross validation method were used for ANN modeling. Four statistical
parameters including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (RMSE), Efﬁciency Factor (EF) and correlation of deter-
mination (R2) were used for evaluate the precision of ANN model. The
inputs including Latitude, Length, Width, Height and tilt were extracted
from Farhadi and Taki (2020). In this study, two scenarios were evalu-
ated. In the ﬁrst scenario, the dimensions (Length×Width) were divided
into 5 categories including (1×1; 1×1.5; 1×2; 1.5×1.5; 1.5×2 and 2×2)
and in the second, all the range of dimensions (Length: 0.5–2.5 and
Wight: 0.5–2.5 m) were used in the inputs data. The results showed
that MLP-BR has the lowest MAPE and RMSE than MLP-LM in the two
scenarios. MAPE for different number of neurons in the hidden layer
was varied between 0.0610 ± 0.0051 to 0.8664 ± 0.1482% in the second
scenario. Also, the best topology was (5–27-1) that achieved to MAPE
and R2 of 0.0610 ± 0.0051% and 0.9999 ± 0.0001, respectively. The re-
sults of sensitivity analysis indicated that height has the biggest effect
on the output (42%) followed by tilt (37%) and latitude (14%). The re-
sults of this study showed that ANN method can predict the output
data with reasonable accuracy and also combination the K-fold cross
validation with ANN can increase the reliability of the ANN outputs.
