Abstract 
Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an integration of physical processes with computation and communication. CPS connects 
the virtual world with physical world. It has the ability to add more intelligence to social life. A CPS integrates physical 
devices, such as sensors and cameras, with cyber (or informational) components to form a situation-integrated analytical 
system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in the real-world scenarios. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can 
be a vital part of CPS as strong sensing capabilities can be one of the major driving factors for CPS applications. Still CPS 
is considered as a nascent technology and there are many challenges yet to be addressed. These challenges are often posed 
due to the complexity of communication, computation and the uncertainty of physical processes. CPS can have wide 
ranging applications, such as smart medical technology, assisted living, environmental control and traffic management. 
Unfortunately, no unified architecture for CPS has yet been developed, primarily due to variations among the applications. 
In CPS healthcare application, a wide range of medical sensors are used, however these sensors generate a large number 
of false alarms. These false alarms add confusion and reduce the efficiency of overall healthcare service. Although a few 
CPS healthcare architectures have been proposed for healthcare application they all lack of efficient false alarm detection. 
In this paper, a novel false alarm detection architecture is proposed in CPS for healthcare applications.

1. Introduction 
Cyber Physical System (CPS) is attracting a lot of attention in recent years and is being considered as an 
area of emerging technological revolution. It combines computation and communication capabilities with the 
physical world. CPS was identified as a key research area in 2008 by the US National Science Foundation 
(NSF) and was listed as the number one research priority by the US President’s Council of advisors on 
science and technology [1]. CPS has close connections with sensors, processing and networking. The recent 
advances in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and medical sensors are making CPS a powerful candidate for 
healthcare applications including in-hospital and in-home patient care [2]. These advances promise to provide 
CPS the ability to observe patient conditions remotely and take actions regardless of the patient’s location. A 
lot of research is being conducted on medical sensors [3], [4]. These medical sensors are able to collect vital 
patient information containing health data. Different wireless sensors can also be used for patient observation. 
Collected data are sent to a gateway via wireless communication medium. Wired sensors can also be used, 
however wireless sensors provide much more flexibility and comfort to both the caregiver and the patients. 
The data collected by the sensors can be stored in a server and made accessible to clinicians. Security is a 
vital concern here as patient data is confidential from legal and ethical perspectives. As medical data can be 
vital for saving a patient’s life, all data should be readily available and accessible to authorized medical 
personnel anytime from anywhere. Medical sensors must alert the physician in case of emergency. At present, 
medical sensors generate considerable amount of false alarm. To the best of our knowledge, there are few 
false alarm architectures developed for CPS healthcare applications. In this paper, a novel false alarm 
detection architecture is proposed for healthcare applications in CPS and explore the challenges associated 
with its practical implementation. The proposed architecture utilizes an approach to detect and minimize false 
alarms generated by the patient monitoring sensors. We begin section 2 with an overview of some 
background of CPS and sensor alarm. In section 3, the false alarm detection architecture for the healthcare 
applications is proposed. This section also explores different parts of the proposed architecture. Section 4 
presents the results. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper. 
2. Related Work 
CPS has been gathering pace in recent years with the academia, industry and government being attracted 
to it as a promising field of research [5]. The growing importance of CPS comes from the need to resolve 
some of the critical issues faced by various sectors, such as rapidly increasing healthcare costs, environmental 
concerns, energy scarcity or mission critical requirements where timely monitoring and controlling are in 
high demand. With the capability to integrate WSNs from different domains, CPS can be the driving force to 
move the cyber world closer to the physical world. Connecting the two worlds in a meaningful manner will 
require regular exchange of critical information in timely and reliable fashion. WSNs can use the internet and 
cellular communication networks to connect to distant areas. Recent developments in embedded systems can 
contribute significantly meeting some of these demands. Increasing number of embedded microprocessors is 
currently being used in the new generation of smart devices. Considerable amount of research work is being 
performed on different aspects of CPS. Although CPS, embedded systems e.g. WSN and MANET have some 
similarities, there are some differences which are given in table 1:

A few works have been done on the CPS healthcare application [6], [1]. The CPS architecture proposed in 
[7], [8] investigated different applications such as assisted living, monitoring network etc. They emphasize on 
reliable data analysis, event detection and security. They also stated that CPS architectures must be reliable 
and capture a variety of physical information. An innovative paradigm can be built around the notion of being 
“globally virtual, locally physical” which expresses that manipulation of physical world but control and 
observation is done securely across virtual network [9]. [1] proposed a CPS architecture called CPeSC3 
(cyber physical enhanced secured wireless sensor networks integrated cloud computing for u-life care). This 
architecture is composed of three main components, namely 1) communication core, 2) computation core, and 
3) resource scheduling and management core. They adopted cloud computing technology in the context of 
healthcare application. But they lack the details of alarm system of sensing data which is addressed in our 
proposed architecture. CPeSC3 doesn’t highlight on complete reliability of system which is vital for any CPS 
healthcare application. 
In [10], authors tried to answer the limitation of CPeSC3 but failed to propose a complete CPS architecture. 
A promising framework has been proposed in [11] where automated secure framework of community cloud 
would provide cheaper healthcare service with the end-goal of better health outcomes. But in their 
architecture, the issue of alerting the physicians in emergency has been left unanswered. 
This high rate of alarm generation in independent threshold alarm system also creates false alarms. False 
alarm causes fatigue to the caregivers. Since, CPS in this healthcare scenario will consider different types of 
sensors an approach needs to be taken for reliable coexistence of heterogeneous sensors. In [20], the authors 
proposed a Tru-Alarm method based on battle ground situation, which can find out trustworthy alarms and 
increase the feasibility of CPS. Once the locations of objects causing alarms are estimated, an object-alarm 
graph is constructed and trustworthiness inferences are carried out based on link information in the graph. 
Simulation results validated that their method can effectively filter out noises and false information and 
guarantee the accuracy of meaningful alarms. To determine the trustworthy alarms, an improved method can 
be used to detect and reduce the false alarms. As vital information is assessed to determine the state of the 
patient and multiple sensors may provide different data, trustworthiness analysis can be a useful tool. 
3. Proposed False Alarm Detection Architecture in CPS Healthcare 
The main phases of our proposed architecture are shown in Figure 1. This framework for sensor alarm 
architecture in CPS healthcare application integrates physical and virtual capabilities through the phases of 
sensing, computation and communication. Recent technology advances in integration and miniaturization of 
physical sensors, embedded microcontrollers, radio interfaces on a single chip, wireless networking and 
micro-fabrication have enabled a new generation of wireless sensor networks suitable for many applications 
[2]. Many medical sensors and wearable health monitoring devices are playing an important role in healthcare 
57
 Shah Ahsanul Haque and Syed Mahfuzul Aziz /  AASRI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  54 – 61 
applications [2, 3, 12-14]. Constituent blocks of our proposed alarm architecture are explained in the 
following subsections. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1  Proposed alarm architecture 
In the proposed healthcare alarm system, the status of a patient is classified as Normal, Intensive, Critical 
or Highly Critical. As shown in figure 1, a status will be decided based on the reception of threshold alarms 
from different vital sensors. It is expected that the alarms associated with a patient are related to each other 
[15]. It is unlikely to have a scenario where only one alarm will be activated leaving other alarms inactive. 
Let us consider a scenario where four vital signs are used for patient monitoring. If one vital sign crosses the 
threshold value but remaining three vital signs are stable, the alarm will not be generated. All vital signs or a 
predetermined number of vital signs must cross the threshold in order to activate the alarm. Using classifiers 
can improve the situation. Adopting multiple threshold alarms for vital patient signs, this alarm generation 
rate can be reduced depending on the number of vital sign classifiers. As each vital sign is connected to each 
other and comparison is done using the classifiers, the rate of alarm generation is minimized. 
3.1. Computation 
Doctors or clinicians play an important role in the CPS healthcare application. In this application they need 
to monitor and observe patients from anywhere and anytime. They need the ability to access the required 
patient data accurately. In case of hospital scenario, large-scale and complex computation and communication 
is necessary so that doctors can easily collect patient data by bio-sensors from hospitals and remote 
observation centres. It is necessary to execute some algorithms for reduction of data bottleneck, calculation of 
data size etc. to ensure system efficiency. Threshold based alarm is a suitable method for false alarm 
detection. In this method, the presence or the absence of the reference value is deducted from the comparison 
between the output and predetermined threshold value. Mathematically, the probability of detecting the alarm 
is integral of signal with noise in probability density function. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       (1)  
 
Similarly, the probability of false alarm, PF, is the probability of sample value when the reference value is 
absent.

Based on that, we get the two probability density functions applicable either on the reference value or on 
the noise value alone which is in the presence or absence of the signal.

We apply equation 6 in each classifier of our proposed alarm architecture using which the decision set 
determines the final decision on false alarm. 
4. Results 
MATLAB simulations have been conducted to determine the approximate threshold alarm generation. For 
10, 100, 1000 and 10,000 incidents and the threshold level taken as 1, one vital sign of the threshold alarm 
can raise up to 30% for 10 incidents and It can be up to 15.6% for 10,000 samples. The rate of alarm 
generation is high enough for the caregivers to attend in healthcare application. Simulation result for 100 
incidents is shown in figure 2(a). Comparative analysis for the four sets of incidents is shown in figure 2 (b).

5. Conclusion and Future Works 
A false alarm detection architecture for CPS healthcare application has been proposed. It aims to combine 
the threshold alarm method with multiple classifiers in decision set. In addition, the proposed architecture 
aims to answer some unanswered questions such as completeness, false alarm detection and accurate alarm 
generation. The architecture proposes to utilize multiple classifiers and compare those with vital health data 
from patients for detecting false alarm of medical sensors. It proposes a framework that is expected to 
perform better in regards of accuracy, efficiency and smart alarm system. In future we plan to explore the 
security issue and implement prototype architecture in a healthcare scenario.
