Rapid socio-economic changes in China, such as land conversion and urbanization, are creating new scopes for
the application of precision agriculture (PA).An experiment to assess the economic beneﬁts of two precision ag-
riculture methods was applied for one year – precision seeding and precision seeding with land leveling. Whilst
the results for this were positive, of itself it did not provide evidence of longer terms gains. The costs of land level-
ing are accrued in a single year but the beneﬁts could carry over into subsequent years. Thus, in this case if the PA
method provides carry over beneﬁts to future years, the economic assessment would incorrectly assign all the
costs to a single year of beneﬁts i.e.the beneﬁt-cost ratio would be underestimated. To gauge whether there
was carry over beneﬁts in future years we looked at NDVI and GUI as proxies for future year beneﬁts. For the sin-
gle year experiment, our results showed that: (1) Winter wheat yield was increased 23.2% through the integra-
tion of precision seeding and laser leveling technologies.(2) Both the single technology and the integrated
technologies signiﬁcant reduced the concentration of soil ammonium nitrogen at the depths of 60 cm; (3) The
beneﬁt/cost ratio's of the treatments exceeded that of the baseline by approximately 10% which translated to
an increase of several hundred US$ per hectare. The NDVI analysis showed that the effect of laser land leveling
could last to the next two years. When considering the multi-year impact of land leveling, the beneﬁt/cost
ratio of PSLL will increase to 23.5% and 22.9% with and without laser land leveling subsidies. Making clear the eco-
nomic beneﬁts of using PA technologies will likely promote application of the technologies in the region.

1. Introduction
It has become increasingly challenging to produce more food with
limited land, water and environmental resources to meet the needs of
a rapidly growing population. The purpose of precision agriculture
(PA) is to improve the economic and environmental beneﬁts of agricul-
ture and to reduce harm to the environment, under the premise of crop
yield, quality and food safety (Cassman, 1999; Li, 2008; Gebbers and
Adamchuk, 2010; Schieffer and Dillon, 2015). Current technologies of
precision agriculture mainly involve the combined application of infor-
mation technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical infor-
mation Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and
sensors placed on agricultural machines for laser land leveling, planting,
variable rate fertilizer application, harvesting, and spraying, as well as
water-saving irrigation facilities. However, there are few studies about
the evaluation of PA in the ﬁeld. In China, the potential impacts of PA ap-
plication in terms of yield, quality and farm incomes have not yet been
fully demonstrated which is likely an important factor constraining its
promotion (e.g. Kuehne et al., 2017).
Seeding is the most important part of the crop production process
since it directly impacts germination, crop growth and yield, thus affect-
ing crop productivity and the ensuing economic beneﬁts (Ansari et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2010). Precision seeding is the key to promoting PA, as
well as the prerequisite and basis for promoting other precision applica-
tions: irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting (Li et al., 2005). Precision
seeding technology can not only improve the germination rate, save
seeds (Yazgi and Degirmencioglu, 2007; Karayel, 2009), optimize popu-
lation density, and increase crop yields (Giannini et al., 1967; Raoufat
and Matbooei, 2007; Karayel, 2009), but also reduce labour inputs
such as thinning which all lead to improved farm incomes (Zhao et al.,
2010). A key determinant affecting seeding success is the quality of
land preparation (Ahmed et al., 2014). Laser land leveling machines

can ensure precise farmland leveling, effectively improving the micro-
topographical conditions of farmland, thus laying the foundation for
precision seeding (Xu et al., 2007). In general, it can increase crop yields
(Rickman et al., 1998; Jat et al., 2006), improve the efﬁciency of fertilizer
and water use (Jat et al., 2006; Choudhary et al., 2000; Ahmed et al.,
2014; Ashraf et al., 2017), and thereby increase economic beneﬁts (Jat
et al., 2009; Ashraf et al., 2017). There are some concerns that laser
land leveling affects the soil salinity and fertility of the soil since during
laser land leveling some top soil is removed from the crest and moved to
the trough (Walker et al., 2003). Ashraf et al. (2017) indicated that there
was no signiﬁcant difference for available nitrogen, phosphorous, potas-
sium and organic matter in level and unlevel ﬁelds.
Most previous research focus on the application effects and eco-
nomic beneﬁts of applying one single technology with little research fo-
cusing on integrated technologies. No attempt has been made to study
the effects on the integrated precision seeding and laser land leveling
technologies in China. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impacts
of precision seeding and its integrated technologies with laser land
leveling on the winter wheat yield, residual soil nitrogen and the result-
ing economic beneﬁts. Winter wheat is a common crop in the central
plains of China. The experiments were conducted in Henan Province
in which the total wheat production and per unit yield are both the
highest in China. It further aims to study the carry over effect of the
land leveling component. That is, the beneﬁts of land leveling are still
apparent 2–3 years after the initial cost of leveling.
We report on a one year study of the inputs and outputs from trials
of precision seeding (PS), precision seeding with land leveling (PSLL)
and compare the results with conventional farming. To capture the
carry over effect of land leveling, and to enhance the single year of eco-
nomic data, we adopt remote sensing approach to capture its impact in
subsequent years. Remote sensing technology can provides various
yield-directly related crop parameters for crop condition and yield fore-
casting, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which
closely related to the vegetation vigor, has been recognized for its ability
to monitor crops and as an estimator of crop yields since early 1980s
(Bastiaanssen and Ali, 2003; Labus et al., 2002).
2. Materials and methods
The research method is composed of two parts: part one is to carry
out a one-year ﬁeld experiment to obtain the yield, nitrogen residue ap-
plication effect, economic beneﬁts of precision sowing, and laser ﬂat +
precision sowing; part two is to use the four-year remote sensing data
to study the multi-year effect of laser leveling, and ﬁnally evaluate the
economic beneﬁt obtained from the multi-year cost sharing correction
test. See Fig. 1 for speciﬁc method ﬂow.
2.1. Site descriptions
The experimental work was undertaken at the 2011 National Collab-
orative Innovation Pilot for Modern Agriculture (113°58′26″E, 34°12′
06″N), located in Chang'ge City, Henan Province, China. This area typi-
cally deploys a winter wheat-summer maize rotation. The north tem-
perate continental monsoon climate dominates, with a mean annual
temperature of 14.3 °C, a mean annual rainfall of 711.1 mm, and a
mean annual frost-free period of 217 days. The soil is medium textured:
topsoil (0–20 cm) organic matter is 18.40 g kg−1, alkali-hydrolyzable ni-
trogen is 101.22 mg kg−1, rapidly available phosphorus is 9.83 mg kg−1,
rapidly available kalium is 98.44 mg kg−1, and soil pH value is 7.65.
2.2. Experiment design
Fig. 2 shows the ﬁeld layout of the experiment, the treatments and
the sampling points. The experiment comprised three land leveling
and seeding treatments: precision seeding (PS), integrated precision
seeding and laser land leveling (PSLL), and local large-scale conven-
tional farming (C). The size of the main plot was 300 m × 150 m with
sub-plots of 50 m × 50 m. There were 18 sampling points in each treat-
ment. PS equips conventional planters with a wheat seeding moni-
toring system and a GPS navigation system developed by the
National Engineering Research Center for Agricultural Information
Technology (NERCITA) for accurate seeding (Fig. 3). This allows
precision control of seeding evenness, and row straightness. The

1PJ-2500 laser land leveling machinery developed by NERCITA was
used for non-longitudinal cross slope leveling (Fig. 4), with a width
of 2.5 m and a leveling accuracy of 2 cm. Other treatments used con-
ventional machines for land leveling.
The winter wheat variety for testing was Xi Nong 979. It was planted
on October 5th, 2014. The seeding density of PS and PSLL were 195
kg ha−1, and C was 225 kg ha−1 all with row spacing at 16.5 cm. Base
fertilizer was applied at 750 kg ha−1 (N: P: K = 23:16: 6) and another
225 kg ha−1 compound fertilizer was applied in early March 2015 fol-
lowing rainfall in the jointing stage. The wheat was irrigated once only
during its growth period by local farmers using conventional hose sprin-
klers (commonly known as the “little white dragon”) (Sui et al., 2005).
The amount and timing of irrigation, fertilization, topdressing, spraying
and other management measures of the winter wheat during its grow-
ing period were identical for all the three treatments. During October
2014 to July 2017, laser land leveling and precision seeding was applied
once in PSLL in October 2014.
2.3. Sample collection and measurement method
For each treatment there were 18 sampling points with a spacing of
50 m × 50 m by a handheld GPS (Trimble Juno 3B). At maturity, the
wheat was harvested manually at 1m2 around the sampling points.
The grains were threshed using a plot thresher, dried in a batch grain
dryer and weighed. Grain yields of wheat was reported at 12% moisture
content. Some of the grain was then crushed, mixed, sifted and mea-
sured for the Kjeldahl nitrogen content by using the Kjeldahl method
(Helrich, 1990), and further converted to crude grain protein content
with a conversion factor of 6.25. Concurrently, soil samples were
taken from three spots randomly chosen around the sampling points,
using an auger with a diameter of 5 cm to collect soil samples at 0–60
cm soil depth (20 cm per layer), placed in a ziplock bag and brought
back to the lab. Soil moisture was measured in an oven at 105 °C. Nitrate
and ammonium nitrogen were extracted from fresh soil by using 1 mol
L−1 KCL solution. Soil nitrate and ammonium concentration were mea-
sured using a ﬂow analyzer (Seal AA3).
2.4. Economics analysis
The economic analysis considered all inputs, including the service
charge for cultivation, the cost of seed, fertilizer, pesticide (irrigation
water in the experimental area was free of charge) and farm manage-
ment costs. Land preparation, planting, fertilizer and pesticide applica-
tion, irrigation, and harvesting were all undertaken by agricultural
machinery cooperatives and farmers' cooperatives. Thus, labour inputs
were already included in these paid services. The farm belongs to

Henan Food and Oil Group, so management costs refers to wages paid to
those management personnel of the Group responsible for land man-
agement. The total cost for each treatment was estimated using the fol-
lowing equation:
TCC ¼ C1 þ C2 þ C3, Ci ¼ ∑

I ¼ Ii ∗ Pi

Where TCC = total cost of cultivation, C1 = agricultural material
cost, C2 = agro-mechanization service cost, C3 = managerial pay; i =
agricultural inputs e.g. seed, fertilizer, pesticide, Ii = amount of the ith
agricultural input, Pi = price of the ith agricultural input.
Gross returns (GR) were calculated by multiplying grain yield by
minimum support price of wheat (0.4 US$ kg−1) offered by the govern-
ment of China. Net returns (NR) were calculated as the difference be-
tween gross returns and the total cost of cultivation (NR = GR - TCC).
The beneﬁt/cost ratio computed by dividing the GR TCC.
2.5. Remote sense data
NDVI parameters during March to May can provide good estimates
of winter wheat condition and yield in the North China Plain (Zhao
et al., 2012). Given the aim of PSLL to produce a uniform seeding and
growth we consider that PSLL will reduces spatial variability and accel-
erates the crops growth than under conventional farming approaches.
This study used a new remote sensing monitoring index-Growth Uni-
formity Index (GUI) (Song Xiaoyu, 2009) developed from NDVI to
judge the growth condition levels of the wheat and to assess the carry
over effects.
2.5.1. Data collection
GF-1 satellite images from 2014 to 2017 covering the study area
were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey website
and Land Observation Satellite Data Service Platform (Table 1).
2.5.2. Data processing
With the support of ENVI (The Environment for Visualizing Images),
preprocessing of the GF-1 data included radiance calibration, atmo-
spheric correction, RPC orthgraph correction and geometric correction.
For the geometric corrections, high-deﬁnition digital images were se-
lected as the base map, image to image method was used for correction.
The NDVI value for the study area was calculated by the BandMath func-
tion of ENVI. The NDVI was calculated from these individual measure-
ments as follows:
NDVI ¼ ρNIR−ρR
ρNIR þ ρR
ð2Þ
Where, NIR is the band 4 of GF-1 image and Red denotes band 3 of
GF-1image.
2.6. Growth uniformity index
The Growth Uniformity Index (GUI) was calculated as follows. The
value of GUI is between 0 and 1, higher values indicate a better and
more uniform growth.

the minimum value of the coefﬁcient of variation of NDVI at the same
time phase; NDVICV max is the maximum value of the coefﬁcient of
variation of NDVI at the same time phase.
2.7. Data analysis
The result of grain yield, crude protein and residual nitrogen were
shown to obey normal distributions. Data were subjected to analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and analyzed using the general linear model pro-
cedure of the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS16.0). Treat-
ment mean values were separated by Fischer's protected least
signiﬁcant difference (LSD) test at P ≤ 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Grain yield and crude protein
A visualization of the experimental plot yields is shown in Fig. 5. Of
all the 18 sampling points in each of the three treatments, 33% of PS
had a grain yield higher than 8000 kg ha−1 compared to 83% of PSLL
and only 22% of C. In terms of average yield, PS increased winter
wheat grain yield by 7.8%, but the effect was not remarkably, while
PSLL signiﬁcantly increased by 23.2% (Fig. 6a). Average crude protein
content of PS, PSLL and C were 13.6%, 13.6% and 13.7% respectively,
the difference was not signiﬁcant (Fig. 6b).
3.2. Residual nitrogen
After the winter wheat harvest, soil residual nitrate nitrogen concen-
tration decreased as soil depth increases, under all treatments (Fig. 7a).
However, compared with conventional farming, precision agricultural
practices tend to have lower soil residual nitrate but this difference
was not signiﬁcant. Compared with C, the soil residual nitrate nitrogen
concentration at the depth of 0-60 cm in PS and PSLL was 7.9% and
4.9% lower respectively.
Soil residual ammonium nitrogen concentration at different soil
depths was similar in all treatments (Fig. 7b). It was slightly higher in
soil at the 20-40 cm depth than other layers. Precision agricultural prac-
tices signiﬁcantly reduced the soil ammonium nitrogen concentration
(P ≤ 0.05). PSLL was more effective than PS in reducing the soil ammo-
nium nitrogen concentration. Soil ammonium nitrogen concentration
at the depth of 0-60 cm in PS and PSLL was reduced by 26.3% and
38.2%, respectively, and there were no signiﬁcant differences under
the two treatments.
3.3. Within ﬁeld spatial variability
Table 2 describes the differences between the plot treatments. The
coefﬁcient of variation suggests that the within ﬁeld spatial variability
of soil residual nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen (inorganic ni-
trogen) concentration of 0–20 cm layer was much higher than that for
protein content or yield. Spatially the inorganic nitrogen concentration

has no signiﬁcant correlation with crop yield and protein content (R2 <
0.3). Spatial variability of winter wheat yield is lower under PS and PSLL,
compared with that under C, with the spatial variability of yield being
the lowest under PS. PS and PSLL did not reduce the spatial variability
of grain protein content and inorganic nitrogen concentration in the
surface soil (0–20 cm).
3.4. Economic beneﬁts
Estimates of the inputs and their costs are shown in Table 3 and the
total costs and beneﬁts of the treatments are shown in Table 4. The total
cost of cultivation for C were 1380.3 US$ ha−1 which were lower than
those for PS and PSLL. Compared with C, PS and PSLL had additional
costs of laser land leveling, seeding monitoring and GPS navigation.
For this study, these costs were calculated as service charges, among
which the laser land leveling charge was 185.6US$ ha−1, and seeding
monitoring and GPS navigation charge was US$23.2 per hectare. The
Chinese government currently subsidies laser land leveling. Taking
Tianjin for example, the rate of the government subsidy is US$116.0
per hectare (Agricultural Bureau of Tianjin, 2015). Therefore, the fees
of precision agriculture for PS and PSLL were 92.8US$ ha−1 with laser
land leveling subsidies and 208.8US$ ha−1 without laser land leveling
subsidies.
As shown in Table 4, the beneﬁt/cost ratio of C is 1.95 (Gross Beniﬁt/
Total Cost of Cultivation). PS increased this by 7.3% to 2.09, while the
combined strategy of PSLL increased by 16.7% to 2.27 with laser land
leveling subsidies or 8.1% to 2.11without the subsidies. Compared to C,
the net return under PS increased by 15.5% (202.4 US$ ha−1). The in-
crease under PSLL was over 40% with subsidies (546.4US$ ha−1) or
over 30% (430.4 US$ ha−1) without laser land leveling subsidies.
3.5. Carry-over effect
The NDVI results using the GF-1 data are shown in Table 5. The coef-
ﬁcient of variation (CV%) value of PSLL is lower than C in 2015 and 2017,
are lower than PS in 2015–2017 suggesting a more consistent of the ex-
periment results of crop yield, The CV value of PS is lower than C only in
2015. These results are consistent with the GUI value. However, the PS
treatment suffered serious pest attack in 2016, with the PSLL treatment
also slightly affected, especially on the east side nearest to the PS treat-
ment (PSLL is in the west of PS as shown in Fig. 2). Removing the east
margin of PSLL affected by pests in 2016 from the analysis, the value
of C.V. and GUI of PSLL improved to 4.68% and 0.62 respectively which
superior to those for C. Therefore, it can be concluded from the above
analysis that applying laser land leveling in year one has positive
carry-over effects to at least the third year but that the effect of precision
seeding alone is unstable.
Thus, in the case of considering the carry-over effect of laser land
leveling, the cost of laser land leveling could shared equally of three
years, then the beneﬁt/cost ratio of PSLL will increase by 20.9% to
23.5% and by 21.1% to 22.9% with and without laser land leveling
subsidies.

4. Discussion
4.1. Grain yield and crude protein
Our results indicate that precision seeding and integration of preci-
sion seeding and laser land leveling technologies could increase grain
yield of winter wheat by 7.8% and 23.2%, respectively. These results
are in agreement with previous studies that suggest crop yield increases
of 5% -40% through the application of precision seeding or laser land
leveling technologies, as well as improving the efﬁciency of water and fer-
tilizer usage (Li et al., 1999; Yao, 2004; Li et al., 2005; Jat et al., 2006, 2009;
Hashimi et al., 2017). PSLL was more effective than PS in increasing the
yield and is attributed to the following aspects. Firstly, laser land leveling
improves farmland ﬂatness (Aquino et al., 2015) which makes planting
depth even, improves crop germination and its growth environment
(Burce et al., 2013; Marlowe et al., 2013), and enhances the effect of pre-
cision seeding. Secondly, precision seeding ensures the uniformity of
seeding amount and row space (Yazgi and Degirmencioglu, 2007), thus
reducing re - seeding rate and lapsus seeding rate, improves germination,
optimizes the crop population density, and the better effect of laser land
leveling could be achieve. In summary, laser land leveling and precision
seeding complement each other are win-win for the crop yield. Crop
grain quality depends not only on its genotype, but also on the environ-
ment and crop cultivation practices (Souza et al., 2004; Otteson et al.,
2008). The results of this study show that PS and PSLL had wheat protein
content comparable to that from conventional farming.
4.2. Residual nitrogen
Soil nitrate and ammonium nitrogen residues after harvest increase
the risk of nitrogen leaching losses (Fang et al., 2006). Previous research
has found that PA technologies, by increasing nitrogen utilization efﬁ-
ciency, can reduce soil nitrogen residues (Chen, 2003; Diacono et al.,
2013). But there are also studies suggesting that PA technologies cannot
reduce soil nitrate nitrogen residues (Ferguson et al., 2002; Link et al.,
2006). In this study, PS and PSLL tend to reduce the level of soil nitrate
and ammonium nitrogen residues after the winter wheat harvest
(Fig. 5). In particular, the two treatments signiﬁcantly affected the am-
monium nitrogen concentration. The main reason is that the two PA
treatments signiﬁcantly increase wheat yields, which absorb more ni-
trogen, thereby reducing the nitrogen residues (Hatﬁeld, 2000;
Thrikawala et al., 1999). PSLL was less effective than PS in reducing ni-
trate nitrogen, mainly because the laser land leveling process compacts
the farmland with multiple passes of the machinery, increasing the soil
density, slowing down the moisture downward inﬁltration (Ahmed
et al., 2014), and resulting in retention of the nitrate nitrogen that
moves easily with water in the surface soil. However, PSLL was more ef-
fective than PS in reducing the ammonium nitrogen concentration,
mainly because winter wheat grows better under PSLL, more nitrogen
is absorbed and unlike nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen does not
move easily with water.
4.3. Within ﬁeld spatial variability
NDVI perceive the temporal and spatial variability of wheat yield
(Labus et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2012; Lopresti and Bella, 2015), the
value of the physiological indexes (C·V) of yield (experiments data
and NDVI perceive) shows that compared with conventional farming,
PS and PSLL could reduce the spatial variability of winter wheat yield
in 2015. Precision seeding can improve the uniformity of the seeding
(Arzu et al., 2007; Karayel, 2009; Zhao et al., 2014), and laser land level-
ing can facilitate more uniform land for seeds, fertilizers, chemicals and
other agricultural inputs (Brye et al., 2004; Ashraf et al., 2017). Both
technologies contribute to reduce the spatial variability of winter
wheat yield. But under laser land leveling, previous sub-surface soil
layers may be exposed to the surface, and increase near-surface spatial
variability among soil chemical, physical, and biological properties
(Brye et al., 2004; Aquino et al., 2015) which may be the reason of

wheat yield spatial variability under PSLL is higher than under PS. And in
2016 and 2017, the NDVI C.V of PSLL were lower than C, but that of PS
were not. Because a one-time application of laser land leveling lasts
3–4 years (Ashraf et al., 2017; Aryal et al., 2015).
4.4. Economic beneﬁts
The economic impact of PA technologies on commodity crops with
low prices (such an wheat and maize) is generally positive. The net an-
nual income, obtained from laser land level ﬁelds (two in rice-wheat ro-
tation and three in the maize-wheat rotation), was 32% higher, as
compared to that from unlevel ﬁelds (Ashraf et al., 2017). Experimental
results in the rice-wheat rotation ﬁeld show that the application of laser
land leveling technology increases farmers' annual income by $145
ha−1 (Jat et al., 2009). Application of multiple PA technologies can
achieve higher earnings than single technology applications (Finck,
1998; Lowenberg-De-Boer, 2000). Walker et al. (2003) and Abdullaev
et al. (2007), however, reported that the net income was negative dur-
ing the ﬁrst year mainly because of cost incurred on laser land leveling
was recovered in one wheat season only. This study estimates positive
beneﬁt/cost ratios and net return of different PA treatments compared
to conventional farming.
Actually, it is not imperative to level the ﬁelds every year thereby
adding to the cost of production. Ashraf et al. (2017) study shows that
there is no need to level the ﬁelds at least upto 3 years. Aryal et al.
(2015) supposed that a one-time application of laser land leveling
lasts at least 4 years. This study use the remote sense image found
that the laser land leveling lasts at least 3 years, and than the beneﬁt/
cost ratio of PSLL will increase about 5% percent.
The agricultural policies play a role in farmer's decision (Touza et al.,
2008; Barnes et al., 2016), developing policies by the governments that
encourage social services such as subsidies for PA technologies can help
further promote the popularization and application of PA technologies
in China.
5. Conclusions
(1) Compared with the local conventional large-scale farming, both
precision seeding and integration of precision seeding and laser
leveling increased the yield of winter wheat, with the latter
being signiﬁcantly and more effective. They could also reduce
spatial variability of yield at the same time. With respect to
crop quality, the PA methods had no deleterious impact on the
grain protein content of the in-season wheat crops.
(2) Precision seeding and integration of precision seeding and laser
leveling reduced the soil nitrate and ammonium nitrogen con-
centration at 0-60 cm layer after the wheat harvest compared
with conventional farming to reduce ammonia volatilization
and nitrate nitrogen leaching loss risk.
(3) In terms of economic beneﬁts, precision seeding increased the
beneﬁt/cost ratio by 7.3%, while integration of precision seeding
and laser leveling increased the beneﬁt/cost ratio by 16.7% with
laser land leveling subsidies in place or 8.1% without the subsi-
dies. Net return under precision seeding increased by 15.5%
(202.4 US$ ha−1). The increase under precision seeding and
laser land leveling was over 30% (430.4 US$ ha−1) without
laser land leveling subsidies or over 40% (546.4 US$ ha−1) with
subsidies. As a one-time application of laser land leveling lasts for
3 years, after spilt the cost of laser land leveling between 3 years,
The beniﬁt increase under PSLL was raised 554.2 US$ ha−1 without
subsidies or 592.8 US$ ha−1with subsidies compared to C, both
over 40%.
With respect to future research, further studies to evaluate the effec-
tiveness and efﬁciency of different integrated precision agriculture tech-
nologies should be undertaken. These should include variable
fertilization, variable spraying, variable irrigation and other measures,
as well as methods of awareness raising of the higher economic and en-
vironmental beneﬁts for dryland farming in the central plains of China.
