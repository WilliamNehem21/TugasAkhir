The use of artiﬁcial intelligence models in predicting the moisture content reduction in the drying of potato
(Ipomoea batata) slices was the focus of this work. The models used were adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems
(ANFIS), artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM). The parameters considered
were drying time, drying air speed and temperature. The capability and sensitivity analysis of the three models
were evaluated using the correlation coefﬁcient (R2) and some statistical error functions such as the average rel-
ative error (ARE), root mean square error (RMSE), Hybrid Fractional Error Function (HYBRID) and absolute aver-
age relative error (AARE). The result showed that the three models demonstrated signiﬁcant predictive
behaviour with R2 of 0.998, 0.997 and 0.998 for ANFIS, ANN and RSM respectively. The calculated error functions
of ARE (RSM = 1.778, ANFIS = 1.665 and ANN = 4.282) and RMSE (RSM = 0.0273, ANFIS = 0.0282 and ANN =
0.1178) suggested good harmony between the experimental and predicted values. It was concluded that though
the three models gave adequate predictions that were in good agreement with the experimental data, the RSM
and ANFIS gave better model prediction than ANN.

1. Introduction
The need for food security is one of the global challenges of our time.
In addition to insufﬁcient production of needed agricultural products,
one of the major challenges with the issue of food security is inadequate
post-harvest processing and insufﬁcient preservation techniques. This is
in addition to the fact that most of the agricultural food crops are perish-
able and seasonal. If these agricultural products are not adequately pre-
served and stored, they will spoil and become unhealthy for human
consumption. Food preservation is very important because it enhances
preservation, storage and easier transportation of such agricultural
products while mitigating unexpected rise in prices of agricultural prod-
ucts (Akinola et al., 2006).
Spoilage of agricultural products is caused mainly by the activities of
the microorganisms and enzymes in the food. The growth of the micro-
organisms normally leads to faster rate of spoilage. The presence of
water in the form of moisture content is the major factor that aids the
growth and activities of the microorganisms because it increases their
metabolic activities. Without water or in the presence of limited amount
of water, agricultural products will become inhospitable for the micro-
organism and inhibit their growth and activities thereby preserving
the product for a longer time (Rajeev et al., 2012).
The sweet potato (Ipomoea batata) is highly nutritious and is rich in
carbohydrates, digestive starch, essential amino acid, etc. It equally con-
tains some important elements such as calcium, iron, potassium etc.
which are necessary for proper maintenance of the human body.
Nigeria is one of the biggest producers of potato. Ugonna et al. (2013)
reported that Nigeria is the fourth biggest producer of potato in Sub-
Saharan Africa with production yield of about 843,000 t per year. The
major drawback in potato production is that it decays easily after har-
vesting due to its high moisture content which aids the growth and ac-
tivities of microorganisms. Hence, there is need to increase its
preservation especially through drying.
Drying is one of the post-harvest handling processes that involves
the removal of moisture from products due to simultaneous heat and
mass transfer (Onu, 2017). Drying is a thermo-physical process that
can reduce the moisture content to a minimal acceptable limit that hin-
ders the growth and activities of microorganisms in agricultural prod-
ucts (Ravinder et al., 2014; Sajith and Muraleedharan, 2004; Shahzad
et al., 2013; Wankhade et al., 2012). Moisture content removal should
be done in such a manner that desired quality of the product is not af-
fected for prolonged time (Correia et al., 2015; Brooks et al., 2008,

Akanbi et al., 2006). The drying of potato can be enhanced by optimizing
the major factors involved. This will lead to more efﬁcient and cost ef-
fective preservative method.
Response surface methodology (RSM) is an advanced tool for devel-
oping, improving and optimizing a process where an output variable de-
pends on several input variables (Nwabanne et al., 2017; Mansour and
Mostafa, 2011). RSM reveals the interactive relationships between the
process parameters and needs only relatively few experimental runs
to determine the optimum response and propose a predictive model
(Adepoju and Olawale, 2014; Ohale et al., 2017). As an improved sys-
tematic approach to process variation, RSM considers all the input var-
iables involved simultaneously and their effect on the response in a way
that is difﬁcult to depict with mathematical formulations (Onu, 2014;
Okpe et al., 2018). RSM has been used in optimizing several processes
such as the extraction of Terminalia catappa L. kernel oil (Agu et al.,
2020); in predicting the optimum process parameters for production
of activated carbon from rice husk (Iheanacho et al., 2019), in adsorp-
tion of malachite green using Nteje clay (Onu and Nwabanne, 2014),
in optimizing chromium VI reduction by isolated acinetobacter (Nur
et al., 2019), in determining the optimum extraction yield of Ferulago
angulata through supercritical ﬂuid (Gholamhossein et al., 2016).
Artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is an information processing para-
digm whose functioning is inspired by the technique used by the brain
and other biological nervous systems in processing information (Assidjo
et al., 2008). It was derived from artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) research in
the efﬁcient description of multivariate nonlinear processes with ade-
quate data and the application of correct training algorithm (Mingyi
et al., 2017). An artiﬁcial neural network usually has input layer
(consisting of the input variables), hidden layers (neurons), and an output
layer (the output). ANN is usually applied in complex systems because it
is robust and effective with special ability to describe nonlinear relation-
ships between the independent variables and the dependent variable by
the training and retraining of the input-output systems (Nur et al.,
2019; Pareek et al., 2002). Artiﬁcial Neural network modeling is essen-
tially black box in nature with the major merit being that it employs mul-
tiple input variables in predicting output variables even without prior
knowledge of the process relationships (Mojtaba et al., 2012). Further-
more, in application of engineering to agriculture, it serves as a better al-
ternative for conventional empirical modeling based on linear and/or
polynomial regressions (Ngankham and Ram, 2011). ANN was employed
in predicting the quality characteristics of apples during convective dehy-
dration (Karina et al., 2013), in optimum extraction of artemisinin from
Artemisia annua (Josh et al., 2014), in predicting the microwave-assisted
extraction procedure (Mansour and Mostafa, 2011).
Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) is an adaptive net-
work that is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system (You et al.,
2017). It is an artiﬁcial intelligence model that has effective self-learning
function and mechanism (Ling et al., 2014). ANFIS is a nonlinear compu-
tational intelligent system that adapts itself by forming rules to survive
with changing environment and uncertainty. It is a synergetic system of
fuzzy inference and artiﬁcial neural network that uses a generated inﬂu-
ential tool from numerical data to predict output (Adem et al., 2018;
Ling et al., 2014). The major strength of ANFIS is that it enhances fuzzy
controllers with self-learning capability for achieving minimum steady
state error (Kiran and Rajput, 2011).
Therefore, the aim of this work is to contribute to the ongoing efforts
in ensuring food security by modeling the predictive behaviour of mois-
ture content reduction in potato drying using ANN, RSM and ANFIS
models which will enhance the post-harvest preservation of potato.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sourcing and preparation of samples
Fresh potato tubers used in this work were sourced from the local
Eke Awka market in Anambra State, Nigeria. The tubers were washed,
peeled, sliced to a thickness of 1.5 mm. The slices were then washed
to remove dirt.
2.2. Drying experimental procedure
The drying experiment was conducted using a conventional hot-air
dryer fabricated in Faculty of Engineering, Nnamdi Azikiwe Univeristy,
Awka, Nigeria. One of its features is that the temperature and air veloc-
ity can be regulated. One hundred grams (100 g) of the sample was used
for each run of the experiments. The fan and heater were started and
allowed to run without load until a stabilized (steady) drying tempera-
ture and air speed were observed in the drying chamber. Thereafter, the
drying chamber was loaded with the samples for the experiments. The
actual temperature of the drying chamber was 30 °C lower than the set
temperature of the dryer. The speed of the air was measured by a speed
meter (hot wire anemometer, model 20004 AHYK, China), with the pre-
cision of 0.01 m/s, while the temperature was measured by digital ther-
mometer and the mass of the sample was obtained using a digital
weighing balance (M-Metlar, model M311L, China). Three replicates
of the experiments were conducted and the average used to reduce ex-
perimental error.
2.3. Determination of moisture content
The moisture content was determined by using the gravimetric
method as given in eq. 1.
MC ¼ M1−M2
M2
� 100
ð1Þ
where MC is the moisture content of the sample after drying in dry basis
(d/b), M1 is the initial mass before drying, M2 is the mass after oven
drying.
2.4. RSM, ANN and ANFIS modeling
The three most commonly used RSM methods are the Box-Behnken,
central composite design (CCD) and the factorial design (Mohammad
et al., 2014). CCD is a ﬁve-level design that incorporates the axial points
in the design of the experimental runs while the Box-Behnken and the
factorial design are three-level designs. The RSM modeling was per-
formed by applying the CCD. This was done to study the interactive ef-
fects of the independent input variables on the moisture content which
serves as the response. The independent input variables were drying
time (minutes), drying air speed (m/s) and drying temperature (°C).
These independent variables were varied at ﬁve different levels: +1
and −1 (factorial points), 0 (center point) and +α and −α (axial
points). The coded values of the process parameters were determined
by the equation given by Rajeshkannan et al. (2012) in Eq. (2).
Ni ¼ Xi−Xo
ΔX
ð2Þ
where Ni is the coded value of the ith variable, xi is the real value of the
ith test variable, xo is the real value of the ith test variable at the center
point, Δx is the step change of the variable. The values of the ﬁve factor
levels of the three input variables were given in Table 1.

The aim of the optimization was to minimize the moisture content
which will increase its shelf life and preservation. Design expert version
11.0.1 was used in generating the factor levels and the experimental
runs, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis.
The quadratic model was used to express the behaviour of the sys-
tem response which is the moisture content (Y) as a function of the in-
dependent input variables in Eq. (3). The input variables were drying
time (X1), drying air speed (X2) and temperature (X3).

2 þ β22X2
2 þ β33X3

þ β12X1 X2 þ β13X1X2 þ β23X2X3 þ ε
ð3Þ
where β0 is the offset term or model constant; β1, β2, β3 are the linear or
ﬁrst order terms; β11 β22 β33 are the pure quadratic or squared terms;
β12 β13 β23 are the interactive terms of the quadratic function; ε is the
random error term that allows uncertainties between the experimental
and predicted values.
According to Arulkumar et al. (2011), the total number of experi-
mental runs N, in CCD is given by Eq. (4).
N ¼ 2n þ 2n þ nc;
ð4Þ
where n is the number of independent factors or input variables and nc
is the number of center points or null points chosen. The term 2n corre-
sponds to the core (factorial) points, 2n corresponds to the star-like or
axial points and nc corresponds to the center points. Therefore, by
using six (6) center points, a total of twenty (20) experimental runs
were utilized in the optimization process. This consists of 8 core points,
6 star-like points and 6 center points. The distance of the star-like point,
α, used was 1.316. The center points aids in minimizing experimental
error while allowing the reproducibility of the data (Khodadoust et al.,
2014). The star-like points or axial points were used for the rotatability
of the experimental runs which makes the variance of the model predic-
tion to be equidistant from the design center (Sahu et al., 2010). The ex-
periments were performed in random in order to avoid systematic
error.
The acceptability of the quadratic model depended on the p-value of
the analysis of variance and the value of the correlation coefﬁcient (R2).
The difference between the experimental and the predicted values was
utilized in determining the signiﬁcance of the regression model ob-
tained. The three-dimensional (3D) surface plots were employed in
the study of the interactive effects of the input variables.
The ANN and ANFIS were simulated by utilizing the Neural Network
of MATLAB 8.5 software 2015 version. The ANN design can be satisfacto-
rily modeled using the RSM generated experimental data (Mourabet
et al., 2014; Nazerian et al., 2018). Thus, twenty (20) experimental
runs were used in the ANN modeling. The input layer consisted of dry-
ing time (minutes), drying air speed (m/s) and temperature (°C) while
the corresponding moisture content served as the target or output layer
as seen in Fig. 1.
About 70% of the experimental runs were used to train the net-
work, 15% was used in testing the network while the remaining
15% was used to validate the result. These represented 14 experi-
ments, 3 experiments and 3 experiments respectively. According
to Kiran and Pragnesh (2016), using more data sets in training re-
duces processing time in ANN learning and improves the generali-
zation capability of models. The 15% used in testing the network
was to provide an independent measure of network performance
during
and
after
training.
In
the
validation,
the
network
generalization was measured by network validation and halted
when generalization stopped improving in order to avoid over
ﬁtting.
The learning algorithm utilized in modeling the ANN process was
the Levenberg-Marquardt. In order to enhance reduction of network
error, the response and the input variables were normalized between
0 and 1 (Mourabet et al., 2014). Trainlm was used as the training func-
tion because it regularizes the bias value using the algorithm of the
Levenberg-Marquardt.
The appropriate number of hidden neurons was determined by trial
and error method with the aim of getting the lowest possible error be-
tween the predicted and the measured values. Large number of neurons
leads to unwanted over-ﬁtting and complicated network topology
while very few neurons reduces the convergence rate of the network
(Mingyi et al., 2017).
The ANFIS model was stimulated as a ﬁve-layered neural net-
work that employed the fuzzy inference system principle. Fig. 2 is
the ANFIS architecture. The nodes in the ﬁrst and ﬁfth layers repre-
sent the overall input and output variables respectively. The nodes
in the second layer acted as the membership function for the input
variables while the neurons in the third layer represented fuzzy
rules indicating the preconditions and the consequences of the
rules. Each individual node in the fourth layer was an adaptive
node with a node function. The ﬁfth layer was made up of only
one node that gave the summation of the incoming signals as the
overall output.
The model predictions by the RSM, ANN and ANFIS were compared
by plotting the comparative parity plots of the model prediction with
the experimental data. Equally, some statistical models were used to
evaluate the magnitude of the error between the experimental values
and the predicted values.
In addition to the correlation coefﬁcient (R2), the error functions
used include Average relative error (ARE), root mean square error

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Experimental result
The experimental result of the design matrix together with the
coded and actual factors was given in Table 2. The experiments were
used to evaluate the single and interactive effects of the drying time,
drying air speed and drying temperature on the moisture content re-
duction of potato. The lowest moisture content of 18.9% dry basis (db)
was obtained at drying time of 180 min, drying air speed of 3.5 m/s
and dryer temperature of 90 °C.
3.2. Modeling and prediction using RSM
The linear, two factor interaction (2FI), quadratic and the cubic
models were compared to determine the model that best described
the drying process in Table 3. The suggested best model was based on
the model with the lowest standard deviation value and the highest cor-
relation coefﬁcient. The cubic model was aliased because the CCD does
not contain enough runs to support a full cubic model (Oguanobi
et al., 2019). The model ﬁtting using regression analysis showed that
the quadratic model best described the relationship between the output
and input variables with relatively high correlation coefﬁcient (R2) of
0.9961 and standard deviation of 1.49. The same trend of quadratic
model was reported in extraction of artemisinin from Artemisia annua
(Josh et al., 2014)
The adjusted R2 of the quadratic model was 0.9925 which was in
good agreement with the predicted R2 of 0.9651. The adjusted R2 was
very close to R2 which indicated good correlation of experimental data
(Samaram et al., 2015; Mazaheri et al., 2017; Betiku and Ajala, 2014).
The relatively small PRESS statistic of 196.92 suggests that the quadratic
model best ﬁts the data point and can be used to navigate the design
space (Nwabanne et al., 2017). Therefore, the quadratic regression
model of the drying process was given in their actual values in Eq. (2).
The regression terms with positive sign indicated synergistic effect,
while those with negative sign indicate an antagonistic effect (Onu
and Nwabanne, 2014). The model quadratic model in terms of the ac-
tual factors was given in Eq. (10).

The p-value gave information whether a statistical hypothesis is sig-
niﬁcant or not and how signiﬁcant it is (Agu et al., 2020). The model F-
value of 280.27 and p-value of b0.0001 showed that the quadratic
model chosen was signiﬁcant. The individual model terms were tested
for their signiﬁcance based on the p-values of each term. A signiﬁcance
level of 95% was chosen hence, all the terms whose p-values are b0.05
were
signiﬁcant
otherwise,
they
were
termed
insigniﬁcant
(Gholamhossein et al., 2016).
Relatively lower p-value and higher F-values showed better signiﬁ-
cance effect of the model term on the response (Josh et al., 2014; Tan
et al., 2008). Therefore, all linear terms of drying time (X1), drying air
speed (X2) and temperature (X3), the interactive terms of X1X2, X1X3
and X2X3 and the squared terms of X1
2 and X3
2 were signiﬁcant. Only
the squared model term of X2
2 was found to be insigniﬁcant. The
model term found to have the signiﬁcant effect on the response was
drying time (X1) followed by temperature (X3) while the interaction
of X2X3 and the squared term of X3
2 have the least effect on the response.
The insigniﬁcant model term was eliminated and the ﬁnal quadratic
model equation was given in Eq. (11).

The coefﬁcient of variation (C.V.) of 3.06% obtained shows the repro-
ducibility and repeatability of the quadratic model since its numerical
value was b10% (Chen et al., 2011). Adequate precision of 65.209 sug-
gests adequate model efﬁcacy because it is N4 (Oguanobi et al., 2019;
Krumar et al., 2007).
The Normal plot of Residuals and the Predicted vs Actual plots in
Fig. 3 (a and b) are graphical estimations that compares of the nature
of the residuals depicting the correlation between the experimental
values and the predicted value. The plot of predicted against actual re-
vealed that the points were closely distributed to the straight line of
the plot. Therefore, it is concluded that the residuals followed a normal
distribution (Iheanacho et al., 2019). The Normal plot of Residuals
showed that the points were ﬁrmly aligned to the straight line of the
plot however; some little disperse like a “S” shape was observed as an-
ticipated (Nwabanne et al., 2017). These plots show minimal diver-
gence of the points from the diagonal.
The response surface plots were utilized in investigating the main
and interactive effects between the combination of the independent fac-
tors and the response (Iheanacho et al., 2019; Nwabanne et al., 2017).
This was done by varying any two of the input variables while keeping
the other constant at its null point. The three dimensional (3-D) plots of
the interactive effects are shown in Fig. 4 (a–c). Fig. 4 is the interactive
effect of temperature and drying air speed. The two factors showed sig-
niﬁcant combined effect on the moisture content reduction of the dry-
ing process. Minimal moisture content was observed at temperature
of about 75 °C and drying air speed of 2.5 m/s. The ﬁgure equally
depicted that the combined effect was mainly as a result of singular ef-
fect of temperature because the drying air speed showed little effect.
Fig. 4b is the plot of the interactive effect of temperature and drying
time while Fig. 4c is for drying air speed and temperature. These two ﬁg-
ures show that the interactive effects of these combinations are

relatively less signiﬁcant than that of temperature and drying air speed.
It was found that increasing the drying time reducing the moisture con-
tent of the potato slices. Again, drying air speed seems to have the least
effect on the drying process among the three independent factors con-
sidered. The elliptical nature of the 3D curves suggested good correla-
tion between the two variables (Iheanacho et al., 2019). These results
indicated that the quadratic model selected is appropriate for the
modeling. Similar trend was reported by Oguanobi et al. (2019).
3.3. Modeling and prediction using ANN
The drying process was equally modeled using the Artiﬁcial Neural
Network. As explained earlier, 70% of the experimental runs were
used for training of the neural network while the rest were used for test-
ing and validation. This was to prevent over-training and over-
parameterization (Jamil et al., 2018). The correlation coefﬁcient and
the minimum value of mean squared error (MSE) were used as perfor-
mance check to determine the optimum number of neurons in the hid-
den layer. MSE is the mean squared difference of the output and input.
Correlation coefﬁcient values (R2) was used to validate the correlation
between input variables and the output. These two were used to mea-
sure the predictability of the artiﬁcial neural network (Agu et al.,
2020). Through trial and error method, the number of neurons for opti-
mal performance was obtained as ﬁve in the trainlm algorithm.
Gholamhossein et al. (2016) reported six neurons for efﬁcient extrac-
tion of Ferulago angulata.
Based on enough neurons (5) in the hidden layer and the consis-
tency of the input data, a two-layer feed-forward neural network with
sigmoid hidden neurons and linear output neurons were employed in
multi-dimensional mapping of the process inputs in Fig. 5.
The regression plots with respect to the targets for the training, val-
idation, testing and overall network process are presented in Fig. 6. A
mean square error (MSE) of 0.0000396 and correlation coefﬁcient of
0.99947 was obtained for the training. The correlation coefﬁcient ob-
tained was very close to that reported by Gholamhossein et al. (2016).
Correlation coefﬁcients of 0.9343, 1.000 and 0.9698 were equally ob-
tained for the validation, testing and overall neural network process re-
spectively. The ﬁt is reasonably good for the data sets, with correlation
coefﬁcient values in each case were very close to unity. The data fell rea-
sonably along a 45-degree line, where the network outputs were equal
to the targets. Based on these performance values, it was concluded that
the network response was satisfactory and that the output adequately
tracked the target in the drying of potato.
The plot of the best validation performance was presented in Fig. 7.
The performance of the network process for validation was analyzed
to determine the reliability of the training process. The training network
showed a validation performance with mean square error of 0.00656 at
epoch 4. This did not indicate any over-ﬁtting problem with the training
network since the error was very small.
3.4. Modeling and prediction using ANFIS
The ANFIS model was structured using a hybrid-learning algorithm
that encompasses the least square and the gradient method. Data

normalization was implemented before the training of the ANFIS model.
Twenty seven fuzzy rules, nine input membership functions and twenty
seven output membership functions were employed as shown in Fig. 8.
The training was completed at epoch 2 with average training error of
0.03574 and average testing error of 0.57092. Kiran and Rajput (2011)
reported a training error of 0.011555 at epoch 135 when modeling the
effectiveness of an indirect evaporative cooling system. The total num-
ber of parameters was 54 which were evenly distributed between the
linear and nonlinear parameters. The ANFIS model predicted the mois-
ture content with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.998.
3.5. Comparison of the performances of the RSM, ANN and ANFIS models
The experimental values were compared with the predicted values
of the RSM, ANN and ANFIS models in Table 5. In most of the axial and
starlike combinations, the ANFIS model gave a residual of zero. The
highest positive and negative residuals of 7.95 and −15.92 were
observed in the ANN model. The three models were found to be reason-
ably accurate in predicting the moisture content of the drying process
though the ANFIS with many residual of zero gave the best prediction.
The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated with closeness
of the correlation coefﬁcient to unity. Furthermore, smaller values of
ARE, RMSE, HYBRID and AARE values indicates better predictive capac-
ity. The statistical error analysis was given in Table 6.
The R2 values of RSM and ANFIS were 0.998 showing better correla-
tion than that of ANN which was 0.970. The ARE value of the ANFIS was
smaller than that of the RSM. The RMSE values were 0.0273, 0.0282 and
0.1178 for RSM, ANFIS and ANN respectively. This result showed that
the RSM and ANFIS gave better signiﬁcant prediction than the ANN in
the drying of potato slices. RSM was reported to be better than ANN in op-
timizing the design parameters for a V perforated bafﬂe (Sunil, 2015)
though in most other cases, ANN gave a better prediction than RSM.
3.6. Model optimization and validation
Optimum moisture content value of 31.995% was predicted at a dry-
ing time of 180 min, drying air speed of 3.5 m/s and dryer temperature
of 60 °C. The test re-test experimental validation technique was
employed in validating the predicted optimal value. The experiment
was carried out in triplicate and an average value of 32.65% was ob-
tained. This showed close agreement with the predicted optimal value.
4. Conclusion
RSM, ANN and ANFIS models were used to predict the moisture con-
tent reduction of potato slices in a hot-air drying process. CCD was
employed in the RSM analysis where a quadratic model with R2 value
of 0.9980 was obtained. Drying time had the most signiﬁcant singular
effect on the drying process followed by temperature. ANN model

gave R2 of 0.970 with 5 neurons in the hidden layer. Mean square error
of 0.00656 was obtained at epoch 4. ANFIS model also showed good pre-
dictive behaviour with R2 of 0.998 and average training error of
0.03574 at epoch 2. The comparative analysis showed that the RSM
and ANFIS were better in predicting the moisture content reduction of
potato drying.
