Selecting the best solution to deploy an ambulance in a strategic location is of the important variables
that need to be accounted for improving the emergency medical services. The selection requires both
quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Fuzzy set based approach is one of the well-known theories that
help decision makers to handle fuzziness, uncertainty in decision making and vagueness of information.
This paper proposes a new decision making method of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting
(IT2 FSAW) as to deal with uncertainty and vagueness. The new IT2 FSAW is applied to establish a pref-
erence in ambulance location. The decision making framework deﬁnes four criteria and ﬁve alternatives
of ambulance location preference. Four experts attached to a Malaysian government hospital and a uni-
versity medical center were interviewed to provide linguistic evaluation prior to analyzing with the new
IT2 FSAW. Implementation of the proposed method in the case of ambulance location preference suggests
that the ‘road network’ is the best alternative for ambulance location. The results indicate that the pro-
posed method offers a consensus solution for handling the vague and qualitative criteria of ambulance
location preference.

1. Introduction
Ambulance services and paramedic are very signiﬁcant in soci-
ety as they could save hundreds of lives daily by responding to
emergency calls. They operate from stations that normally located
in diverse areas to a medical center or hospital. With the assistance
of control centers that responded to emergency calls, ambulances
are dispatched when required. Ambulances are not always based
in a building, but often at a very rudimentary location, such as
parking lots [1]. More importantly, they are periodically rede-
ployed to ensure a better coverage at all times. According to a
study [2], a facility (ambulance) that is near a request point pro-
vides a better quality of coverage to that demand point than a facil-
ity situated a long way from that request point. Generally,
ambulances do not patrol on streets between calls, but once they
dispatched to the scene of an incident, they may be diverted to a
more important call. Study of ambulance is part of emergency
medical services (EMS). EMS is deﬁned by the National Board of
Health and Welfare as ‘‘health care provided by healthcare profes-
sionals within or adjacent to the ambulance” [3]. EMS is one the
essential measures to optimize the safety of patients and also for
sustaining human well-being. EMS is known as pre-hospital treat-
ment and also known as services provided by hospital for emer-
gency services to transport patients with illness and injuries to
the hospital immediately to reduce patients’ mortality, disability
or suffering [1,4]. Management of the efﬁcient EMS system is very
critical and deserves particular attention by system planners [5].
The availability of an ambulance at a location may inﬂuence a
chance of survival despite the minute difference of ambulance’s
arrival. Ambulance location is in a stochastic environment where
the request calls arrive at the control center in a random manner.
Travel time for a certain journey may contain randomness; the ser-
vice time at the request call’s scenes and hospitals is also uncer-
tain. The above mentioned typical process of ambulance request
and ambulance fulﬁllment processes as well the uncertain environ-
ments complicate the process of determining the strategic location
for ambulances.
Recently, many efforts have been made to strengthen emer-
gency management, particularly with respect to the placement of
ambulances. A parallel tabu search heuristic [6,7], and stochastic

optimization model [8,9] and local search heuristic [10] are among
the methods used in redeployment problem for a ﬂeet of ambu-
lances. Recently, a study [11] proposed a dynamic ambulance man-
agement model for relocating idle ambulances that incorporate
different performance measures related to response times. Study
[12] used approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to solve
ambulance dispatching and relocation problem. The ADP model
has reduced the response time in the city of Vienna, the capital
of Austria to 12.89%. This improvement is due to the main source
for improvement which are the dispatching and relocation deci-
sions. Study [13] adapted maximum expected coverage location
problem model to determine the strategic location for a mobile
ambulance in Shah Alam Selangor. Study [14] successfully imple-
mented maximal covering location problem using local Open-
StreetMap geodata together with Dijkstra, Quick Hull and Greedy
Adding algorithms to solve the ambulance location selection in
Johor Bahru Malaysia. Very recently, [15] analysed relocation
strategies of ambulances using Double Standard Model to ensure
a fair comparison of their performance. The above review supports
the assertion that ambulance location management is tantamount
to operational research problems. According to [16], emergency
management
is
often
conceptualized
as
a
complex
multi-
objective optimization problem where an emergency situation is
solved with limited resources. Therefore, the ambulance location
problem is indeed a problem where multiple qualitative resources
need to be considered concurrently.
It is shown that the existing literatures mostly deal with a
speciﬁc operation, including ambulance placement with the aim
to make an improvement for EMS. The methods used for the
improvement varied from typical operations research methods to
computational intelligence methods depending on respective
research frameworks. However, the methods of multi-criteria deci-
sion making (MCDM) in the case of ambulance locations are rarely
discussed despite the multiplicity in ambulance locations and
qualitative criteria. Simple additive weighting (SAW) is one of
the weighted based MCDM methods. This method is also known
as a weighted linear combination or scoring method. One of the
advantages of SAW method is proportional linear transformation
of the raw data where the relative order of magnitude of the stan-
dardized scores remains equal. This method was used by [17] to
accelerate
the
mechanism
through
eliminating
unnecessary
trade-offs. By using SAW method, a combined consequence of
issues having high variation was obtained. As an extension of
SAW, another weighted based MCDM method is fuzzy simple addi-
tive weighting (FSAW). The FSAW method depends on fuzzy num-
bers rather than the crisp numbers. It utilizes trapezoidal fuzzy
numbers to show any imprecision in scores and weights. The FSAW
method applies fuzzy weighting to approach experts’ preferences.
In literature, the FSAW has been successfully applied in diverse
applications (see, for example, [18–23]. However, in many practi-
cal cases, it is pretty challenging for experts to express their pref-
erences using one layer fuzzy membership function of type-1
fuzzy sets (T1 FS). Most of the existing FSAW methods are built
from linguistic terms based on T1 FS. In reality, some decision
might not be given as an exact relative crisp scale. The linguistic
interval scales are used instead. The authors decide to use interval
type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FS) scale for expressing linguistic evaluation
due to the fact that the IT2 FS provides more ﬂexibility to present
uncertainties than T1 FS. Furthermore, IT2 FS can be used as an
indicator of uncertainty where the larger length of the interval
may capture more room of uncertainty that happened during the
process of information gathering from the decision makers [24].
In this paper, the authors are motivated with the advantages of
the FSAW and IT2 FS and desirous of exploring the possible merger
of these two entities in MCDM framework. This proposed method
can be seen as a FSAW framework where interval type-2 fuzzy
numbers are used in linguistic scales. The introduction of IT2 FS
in the FSAW gives a new look to the FSAW framework. The pro-
posed method of interval type-2 FSAW is an extension of interval
fuzzy additive weighting where T1 FS is substituted with IT2 FS.
An IT2 FS is described by the footprint of uncertainty where this
footprint is bounded by the lower membership function and upper
membership function [25]. This footprint adds a new description of
uncertainty. In addition, rather than the direct computation of typ-
ical defuzziﬁcation method, our proposed method applies the
fuzzy ranking method as to reduce T2 FS to T1 FS. This proposed
approach allows each decision matrix is made with trapezoidal
IT2 FS as a measurement scale instead of using classical trapezoidal
fuzzy numbers to represent the judgment scales and the weights of
criteria. Unlike the FSAW method, we used the fuzzy ranking
method based on IT2 FS as a reduction method. By incorporating
fuzzy ranking method, this method offers a more detailed and
comprehensive procedure. Although we used the IT2 FS linguistic
scales and fuzzy ranking method, the proposed method is made
without loss of generality the FSAW procedure. The proposed
method could be employed to solve ambulance placement problem
where limited qualitative resources and stochastic environment
are present. The proposed method also inclusively considers
experts’ ambiguities, uncertainties and vagueness in evaluating
ambulance location. Speciﬁcally, this paper aims to develop a
new FSAW decision making method based on IT2FS (IT2 FSAW)
and its application to a case of ambulance location preference in
EMS management. The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we present some basic notations and deﬁnitions
that are needed in this paper. In Section 3, we present the proce-
dures of the proposed method based on fuzzy SAW, IT2 FS and
fuzzy ranking method. The proposed method is then applied to
the case study for evaluating ambulance location preference. The
implementation of this application is presented in Section 4. Sec-
tion 5 concludes.
2. Preliminaries
This section introduces the elementary deﬁnitions and concepts
of type-2 fuzzy set theory and fuzzy ranking method.
Deﬁnition 1 [26]. A type-2 fuzzy set eA in the universe of discourse
X is characterized by a type-2 membership function leAðx; uÞ where
eA ¼ fððx; uÞ; leAðx; uÞÞj8x 2 X; 8u 2 Jxg;
ð1Þ
x 2 X; u 2 Jx; Jx
represents
the
main
membership
of
x;
Jx 2 ½0; 1�; leAðx; uÞ represents the secondary grade of ðx; uÞ and
0 6 leAðx; uÞ 6 1. The type-2 fuzzy set eA also can be denoted as:
eA ¼
Z
x2X
Z
u2Jx
leAðx; uÞ=ðx; uÞ;
ð2Þ
where x 2 X; u 2 Jx; Jx # ½0; 1� and RR represents the uniﬁcation over
all admissible x and u. A type-2 membership function is three-
dimensional and the third dimension (i.e., leAðx; uÞÞ which offers a
degree of freedom in managing uncertainties.
Deﬁnition 2 [26]. Let eA be a type-2 fuzzy set in the universe of
discourse X denoted by the type-2 membership function leA. If all
the secondary grades leAðx; uÞ of eA are equal to 1, then eA is called
an interval type-2 fuzzy set. It symbolically shown as:
eA ¼
Z
x2X
Z
u2J
1=ðx; uÞ;
ð3Þ

L. Abdullah et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 14 (2018) 65–72
where x 2 X; u 2 Jx; Jx # ½0; 1� and RR denotes the union over all
admissible x and u.
Deﬁnition 3 [26]. Vagueness of an interval type-2 fuzzy set eA can
be denoted by the uniﬁcation of the main memberships in a cir-
cumscribed area. This area is called as ‘‘footprint of uncertainty”.
It is shown as follows:
FOUðeAÞ ¼ [x2XJx;
ð4Þ
eAuðxÞ ¼ FOUðeAÞ;
8x 2 X
ð5Þ
eALðxÞ ¼ FOUðeAÞ;
8x 2 X
ð6Þ
The FOUðeAÞ represents the ‘‘footprint of uncertainty” of the interval
type-2 fuzzy set eA. The eAU and eAL represent the upper membership
function (UMF) and the lower membership function (LMF) that
enclosed FOUðeAÞ, respectively, eAUðxÞ 2 ½0; 1�; eALðxÞ 2 ½0; 1�; eALðxÞ 6
eAUðxÞ and x 2 X.
A type-1 fuzzy set be a distinct case of interval type-2 fuzzy sets
because the membership function of uncertainties (i.e. FOUðeAÞÞ is
disappeared.
Deﬁnition 4 [27]. The UMF of an IT2 FS and the LMF of an IT2 FS
are type-1 membership functions respectively.
The UMF of IT2 trapezoidal fuzzy set and the LMF of IT2 trape-
zoidal fuzzy set are shown in Fig. 1.

3. The proposed method
The fuzzy simple additive weighting (FSAW) was introduced to
handle uncertainty in linguistic judgment [29–32], where fuzzy
numbers are employed instead of the crisp numbers. In evaluation
processes of decision making, the fuzzy set theory is germane to
subjective judgment and quantitative assessment compared to
classical
evaluation
method
which
is
applying
crisp
values
[33,34]. The FSAW utilizes trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to show
any fuzziness in scores and weights. Unlike FSAW, the interval
type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are utilized in the proposed
method. The proposed method encompasses three stages. In the
ﬁrst stage, the evaluations of alternatives with respect to criteria
and weights of criteria are expressed in IT2 FS. In the second stage,
the weight for each criterion is computed with the aim to construct
weighted
decision
matrices.
In
the
third
stage,
ranking
of
alternatives is determined using the fuzzy ranking method. The
six-step procedure that considered the three stages is proposed
as follows.
Step 1: Establish a committee of experts who are familiar and
experienced with an MCDM problem. Identify the criteria to
be used in the MCDM evaluation. Introduce the linguistic vari-
ables to access criterion importance or degree of importance for
individual criteria.
Step 2: Construct the decision matrix Yp of the p-th decision
maker, and build the aggregated fuzzy rating (AFR) matrix
respectively.

an

FS,
1 6 i 6 m; 1 6 j 6 n; 1 6 p 6 k and k represents the number of
decision makers.
Step 3: Create the weighting matrix Wp
of the criteria
of the p-th decision maker and compute aggregated fuzzy
weight (AFW) W;
Let ~~wp
i ¼ ðai; bi; ci; diÞ;
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m be the linguistic weight
speciﬁed to the subjective criteria C1; C2; . . . ; Ch, and objective cri-
teria Chþ1; Chþ1; . . . ; Cn by decision maker Dt.

k
is
an

type-2
fuzzy
set,
1 6 i 6 m; 1 6 p 6 k: k represents the number of experts.
Step 4: Defuzzify the fuzzy weights of every criteria by normal-
izing the weights and build the weight vector. In order to defuz-
zify the weights of fuzzy criteria, the ‘signed distance formula’ is
used [35].
Defuzziﬁcation of W is represented as:
dðWjÞ ¼ 1

j þ ~~w3

j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n

4. Application to ambulance location preference
A committee of four experts has been identiﬁed and was invited
to provide a qualitative evaluation using linguistic variables per-
taining to EMS. The experts were interviewed in four different ses-
sions in order to tap their evaluation regarding the preference of
ambulance deployment with respect to the criteria in EMS. The lin-
guistic evaluation is truly practical, especially in the presence of
qualitative criteria [18]. The experts in this case are a medical ofﬁ-
cer at a public university medical center, an emergency depart-
ment ofﬁcer and two medical ofﬁcers attached to the emergency
department of a government funded hospital in Kuala Terengganu,
Malaysia. All the four experts have more than ﬁve years of experi-
ence in ambulance management and emergency department. Pro-
ﬁles of the experts are presented in Table 1.
The experts are required to evaluate the relative measurement
of alternatives with respect to criteria using interval type-2 linguis-
tic terms. The alternatives of the case are road network ðA1Þ; petrol
station ðA2Þ; parking lot ðA3Þ; public clinic ðA4Þ; and highway ðA5Þ:
Apart from the alternatives, several qualitative criteria also play
their parts in emergency management. The selected criteria are
response
time
ðC1Þ;
demand
ðC2Þ;
coverage
area
ðC3Þ;
and
ambulance workload ðC4Þ: These alternatives and criteria are
retrieved from several related research. For example, [36] used a
real-world road network from Teleatlas which is reachable by car
to test a formulated mixed integer program. Study [1] suggested
parking lot as a possible ambulance location. Study [14] used road

network and petrol station as possible location sites to place an
ambulance. Study [13] used government buildings and petrol sta-
tions as their landmarks in order to determine the strategic loca-
tion for mobile ambulance. Studies [37,38] investigated the
location of the ambulance cases along the highway with the pur-
pose to reduce the mean user response time and the inequality
of the ambulance workloads. The hierarchy structure of the deci-
sion making problem is depicted in Fig. 3.
The proposed IT2 FSAW method to determine the best ambu-
lance location is composed in the following steps.
Step 1: A team of experts comprises three medical ofﬁcers (D1,
D2, D3) and an emergency department ofﬁcer (D4) were asked to
evaluate the alternative for ambulance location preference. The
experts utilized the linguistic terms in Table 2 to rate the alter-
natives with admiration to each criterion. The linguistic vari-
ables are presented as IT2 FS.
Based on the linguistic terms in Table 3, the experts also provide
fuzzyratingsofalternativeswithrespecttoeachsubjectivecriterion.
Table 4 shows the ratings of alternatives with respect to indi-
vidual subjective criteria evaluated by four experts.
Weights of the criteria evaluated by the expert team can be seen
in Table 5.
Step 2: By using the information in Table 4, and the formulation
in Eq. (9), the decision matrices Y1; Y2; Y3 and Y4 for the alter-
natives A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 are obtained.
Construct the aggregated fuzzy ratings matrix, Y using Eq. (10)
and the information in Table 2. It is presented in the following
matrix.
where ~~f is the average of linguistic evaluation.
Step 3: Acquire the weighting matrix, W1; W2; and W3; using
the information in Table 4 and substitute it into Eq. (11).
Evaluate the aggregated fuzzy weights (AFW) W; using Eq. (12).

Ranking values RankðeeA iÞ and ranking of alternatives can be obtained
using Eq. (18), Eq. (19) and Eq. (20). It is shown in Table 6.
According
to
the
framework
of
IT2
FSAW,
RankðeeA1Þ >
RankðeeA4Þ > RankðeeA3Þ > RankðeeA2Þ > RankðeeA5Þ; the preference order
of the alternatives A1; A2; A3; A4 and A5 is A1 > A4 > A3 > A2 > A5;
where the symbol ‘‘>” means superior to. The road network A1
(0.3896), represents slightly higher than other alternatives. There-
fore, the A1 is the best ambulance location for deployment of an
ambulance. The order of the rest alternatives is public clinic, parking
lot, petrol station and highway. This preference order is obtained
from the implementation of the proposed method with the linguistic
data. It is better to have a comparable analysis as to check the
consistency of the preference order. The similar linguistic data sets
are iterated to two other MCDM methods. Speciﬁcally, the proposed
method is comparable with FSAW and IT2-FTOPSIS. The summary of
the preference orders of the proposed method against the other two
methods is presented in Table 7.
The preference orders of the proposed IT2-FSAW method and
the other two methods are slightly inconsistent. The FSAW utilized
linguistic terms represented by T1 FS where its membership func-
tions are totally crisp thereby, it is weak in handling uncertainty.
The limitation of T1 FS saw the preference order obtained using
FSAW method is slightly inconsistent with the result obtained
using the proposed method. As IT2 FSAW, the IT2-FTOPSIS also
used the similar IT2 FS, but they differ in weight determination
for each criterion. This might explain the small inconsistency in
preference orders among the three methods.
5. Conclusions
Locating ambulance is one of the most important issues in the
emergency management. Due to rapid growth of population, many
researchers initiate work to identify the most strategic location in
deploying ambulances, which in return, can beneﬁt the residents.
Hence, ambulance services are urged to seek and recognize the suit-
able and strategic location for the beneﬁt of people. At the same
time, the services also may minimize the loss of precious life. A good
ambulance location can guarantee the arrival of an ambulance to the
emergency call scene within a deﬁned time threshold. Because of
time pressure, lack of experience and personality, experts often eval-
uate the criteria and alternatives in the case of ambulance location
using the linguistic variable. In this paper, we have proposed an
interval type-2 fuzzy simple additive weighting to evaluate ambu-
lance location selection. The linguistic scale of interval type-2 fuzzy
set was used contrary to crisp numbers and type-1 fuzzy numbers to
express the experts’ evaluation for alternatives with respect to crite-
ria and the weights of each criterion. The use of interval type-2 fuzzy
sets makes the decision process considerably more practical. Fuzzy
simple additive weighting was employed to compute the weights
of criteria and fuzzy ranking method was adopted to rank the alter-
natives of strategic ambulance location. The proposed method has
the ability to capture the vagueness of human thinking style and
effectively solved multi-criteria decision making problems of ambu-
lance location selection. Particularly, it provides emergency depart-
ments with a ﬂexible manner to evaluate the strategic area for
locating ambulance under fuzzy environments. It was consensual

agreed on road networks as the most inﬂuential alternative in ambu-
lance location selection. Perhaps a reliable validating mechanism,
such as sensitivity analysis could be introduced to investigate the
stability of the suggested method. The implementation of the sug-
gested method to other real applications is still open for further
investigation.
