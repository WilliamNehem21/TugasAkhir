Abstract
The Civilian Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers often encounter problems of
interference and noise which degrade the receiver performance. The conventional methods of par-
allel code phase search acquisition with coherent, non-coherent and differential coherent detection
for weak signal acquisition fail to enhance the signal for all conditions especially, when the Carrier
to Noise ratio (C/N0) falls below 15 dB-Hz. Hence, the GPS receiver has to employ sophisticated
techniques to excise the noise and to improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the signal for fur-
ther processing. In this paper, a pre-ﬁltering technique of reduced rank Singular Spectral Analysis
(SSA) is proposed for noise excision and is processed through coherent, non-coherent and differen-
tial detection postcorrelation methods to retrieve the signal embedded in noise. Monte Carlo sim-
ulations carried out to examine the acquisition sensitivity at various power levels with the different
postcorrelation approaches indicate that the SSA combined with differential detection approach
provides a signiﬁcant performance improvement with lesser mean acquisition time. It has 96%
probability of detection at a worst signal power level of �159 dBm (i.e. C/N0 15 dB-Hz), compared
to other conventional methods.

GPS receivers are gaining popularity not only for their re-
conﬁgurability [2] but also provide an excellent research tool
for investigating and improving the receiver performance in
a wide range of conditions. Also software based GPS receivers
allow ﬂexibility in dealing with noise excision. The exploitation
of spectrum transforms and mathematical tools are more fea-
sible in software and faster performance is achieved [3]. The
signal acquired by a GPS receiver is deteriorated by interfer-
ence and receiver noise giving false information about the vis-
ibility of satellite and is unable to provide a precise position of
the user. This paper proposes an approach for signal acquisi-
tion enhancement based on software approach for a L1 GPS
receiver. The typical C/N0 value of an ideal GPS receiver
ranges from 37 to 45 dB-Hz. Under noisy conditions, the
GPS signal needs to be acquired with the power level ranging
from �160 dBW to �200 dBW [4]. In tracking stage of ideal
GPS receiver, signal strength up to 25 dB-Hz is allowed but
acquisition is limited to about 35 dB-Hz [5], so acquisition sen-
sitivity is more compared to tracking.
A variety of algorithms have been proposed for estimating
and acquisition of the weak signal. The wavelet de-noising
method coupled with differential coherent integration (DFC)
proposed by Lei et al. [6] achieved a worst case improvement
of 2 dB gain within 10 ms integration period at �176 dBW
(i.e. 28 dB-Hz) compared to traditional DFC algorithm. An
adapted acquisition algorithm depicted by Tian et al., based
on DFC with coherent integration time of 1 ms with 60
DFC accumulation is able to detect the weak signal up to
30 dB-Hz. By increasing the integration time to 5 ms and
10 ms, the extremely feeble signal of 22 and 20 dB-Hz is
detected with 90% detection [7]. The indoor and outdoor envi-
ronment acquisition capability of DFC algorithm is mentioned
by Ba et al. [4] with signal strength of �177 dBW (indoor) and
�155 dBW (outdoor) acquired with 179 and 1 ms integration
times. Yang and Tian [8] compared various weak signal acqui-
sition algorithms and reported coherent correlation with DFC
has larger output SNR 3–5 dB gain compared to other works
but there seems a high complexity in implementation. The iner-
tial navigation system (INS) aided acquisition algorithm can
successfully
capture
the
signal
with
C/N0
as
low
as
�150 dBm [9] while a Block Acquisition Method for C/N0 as
low as 21 dB-Hz [10]. A new peak ﬁnding algorithm [11] was
able to locate the peak location accurately and provides faster
performance in a software based acquisition for a C/N0 of
19 dB-Hz. Similarly, a block average model based on the accu-
mulation of synchronized and phase corrected signal blocks of
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was found suitable for Gaus-
sian noise, narrow band interference and weak signals [12].
Likewise, a Signal Existence Veriﬁcation Process was proposed
to detect and subsequently verify low power-received GPS sig-
nals even if the estimated code delay information had an offset
of half chip from the correct one based on the time–frequency
representation [13]. More recently, full bit acquisition algo-
rithm for software GPS receiver in a weak signal environment
was found capable of improving the C/N0 by 2 dB-Hz when
the noncoherent integration time equals 40 ms [14]. The earlier
reported weakest signal that can be detected in 4 s of data
using full bits method is with a C/N0 of 19 dB-Hz [10]. Signal
acquisition in the range of 15 dB-Hz can be accomplished by
increasing the integration time up to 20 s. But when the C/
N0 falls below 15 dB-Hz, performing acquisition with coherent
detection beyond 10 ms does not work due to data transition
problem in the navigation data decoding. Performing non-
coherent integration also goes in vain, since extending the inte-
gration time to 20 s to fulﬁll the required Processing Gain (Gp)
to more than 20 dB, delays the time to ﬁrst position ﬁx during
cold start conditions.
The present study investigates noise using Singular Spectral
Analysis (SSA), as a pre-ﬁltering approach which provides bet-
ter weak signal detection without changing the traditional
acquisition methods but with reduced mean acquisition time.
The SSA is used as it is a powerful technique for noise reduc-
tion irrespective of the environment whether it is stationary or
mobile, linear or non-linear, Gaussian or non-Gaussian and it
does not require prior assumptions about the data [15].
When the GPS signal is corrupted by an additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN), the worst case signal power level lies
in the range of �160 dBm. In order to boost up the processing
gain at lower SNR, different postcorrelation detection tech-
niques are used. The traditional postcorrelation detection
methods use coherent, non-coherent and differential detection
approaches. To address the conventional postcorrelation
detection techniques failing to recover a noisy GPS signal as
low as �159 dBm (C/No of 15 dB-Hz), the present study
employs postcorrelation techniques, combined with SSA for
weak signal acquisition enhancement (Fig. 1). In the presence
of noise, the GPS trajectory matrix becomes full rank. When
the rank is reduced to the minimum extent using reduced rank
SVD process it decomposes the data matrix into signal sub-
space and noise subspace. Keeping only the signal subspace,
the data matrix is said to be noise free. The residue matrix
(noise) is found by subtracting the reduced rank matrix from
the full rank trajectory matrix. However this rank reduction
destroys the structure (Toeplitz/Hankel) of the matrix, thus
demanding a step to re-establish the special structure of the
matrix. The rank reduction process is repeated k times, fol-
lowed by structure restoration till the minimum Frobenius
norm is achieved. The reduced rank SVD is known as Singular
Spectral Analysis (SSA) if the number of iteration is limited to
1, i.e., k = 1 [16].
The traditional postcorrelation detection techniques fail to
recover a noisy GPS signal of signal strength as low as
�159 dBm (C/No of 15 dB-Hz), therefore present investigation
combines postcorrelation techniques with SSA for weak signal
acquisition enhancement. The effectiveness of the SSA com-
bined with differential coherent method is compared to other
conventional methods in terms of processing gain and mean
acquisition time for various power levels.
2. Simulation results and analyses
The received GPS ‘L1’ signal from the Radio Frequency (RF)
front end is converted to Intermediate Frequency (IF) of
4.1304 MHz and sampled at a frequency of 16.367 MHz. For
1 ms of data, the number of samples can be found as 1/1000
of the sampling frequency i.e., 16.367 � 106/1000 = 16367
samples with a single bit resolution. To ensure good probabil-
ity of successful acquisition, we have conﬁned the N value as
16,367 samples. The digitized data obtained after analog to
digital conversion are given as the input to the acquisition pro-
cess to determine the code phase and Doppler frequency of vis-
ible satellites. The simulation parameters are mentioned in
Table 1.

2.1. Choice of window size (M) and rank (r)
The choice of setting window size (M) is based on the
W-correlation
value
qw ¼ ðxðrÞ;xðnÞÞw
kxðrÞkkxðnÞk ; where ðxðrÞ; xðnÞÞw ¼
Pn
i¼1wixðrÞ
i xðnÞ
i . If xðrÞ; xðnÞ are approximately separable and
qw � 0. Though there is no universal rule existing for the selec-
tion of the window length (M), it is generally accepted that
M 6 N/2.
For
ðkxðrÞ
F kÞ � kxðnÞ
F kÞ;
a
better
separation
is
achieved with larger M. However, too large values of M lead
to an undesirable decomposition which in turn yields mixing
of residual components. Sometimes small transitions in M
reduce the mixing and lead a better separation, hence SSA
analysis was repeated several times using different values of
M [17].
At extreme noise level (�159 dBm) the de-noising is based
on iterative SSA, initially the SVD is carried out with certain
window size (M1) which splits the trajectory matrix into signal
subspace (Xr) and noise subspace (Xn). The SVD is performed
with another window size (M2) on noise subspace where it is
decomposed into (X1
r) and (X1
n). This is continued up to sev-
eral window sizes and ﬁnally all the signal subspace compo-
nents (Xr) + (X1
r) + . . . (Xn
r) are added. This yields good
separation of signals from noise. By repetitive trials, the value
of M was chosen to be 13 for weak signal of �150 dBm and
250 for extremely weak signal of �159 dBm.
Normalized singular values for varying ranks are plotted as
shown in Fig. 2a for a GPS signal of power level �150 dBm. A

noise signal typically decreases with sequence of singular val-
ues. In our case a signiﬁcant drop in a singular value occurs
around the rank value of 2 which could be interpreted as a
start of noise ﬂoor.
Similarly the extreme weak GPS signal of power level
�159 dBm is tested and their normalized singular values for
varying rank values are plotted in Fig. 2b. A rapid drop in
the singular value occurs at the rank value of 2. So we have
chosen rank (r) as 1 for both cases of GPS signal. To under-
stand the effect of rank in restoration of weak GPS signals,
the noisy GPS signal of power level �150 dBm is applied to
the pre-ﬁltering based SSA approach. As per the deﬁnition
of SSA the number of iteration (k) is limited to 1. The recon-
structed GPS signal with rank values of 1, 2 and 3 for three dif-
ferent trajectory matrices, autocorrelation, covariance and
modiﬁed covariance are plotted in Fig. 3.
The autocorrelation method with rank 1 Hankel structure
based restoration provides a better version of the reconstructed
signal when compared other methods as shown in Fig. 3b.
Hence, this is selected for further processing of GPS signal.
The spectrum for an actual input GPS data at �130 dBm
(Fig. 4a) and noisy GPS data with �150 dBm power level
(Fig. 4c) for a sampling frequency of 16.367 MHz with an IF
of 4.13 MHz is shown in Fig. 4b and d respectively. The results
after application of SSA on noisy GPS data are shown in
Fig. 4e and f. From this we infer that the shape of the spectrum
after SSA is preserved and the center frequency is approxi-
mately located around 4.13 MHz. If the power level goes
below �159 dBm, i.e., for an extremely weak signal, the pre-
ﬁltering alone does not alleviate the detection of visible satel-
lites. Hence further enhancement by postcorrelation analysis
is required in the GPS receiver to fulﬁll the processing gain.
The simulation results for selection of the trajectory matrix
depending on the three performance metrics namely Mean
Square Error ð^eÞ, maximum correlation peak and Processing
Gain (Gp) are given in Table 7. Considering that the correla-
tion peak is a measure of perfect alignment of the incoming
GPS signal with the C/A code, higher correlation peak signiﬁes
maximum alignment between incoming signal and the local C/
A code replica indicating better acquisition. Processing gain is
the measure of total gain obtained after the signal acquisition
and indicates how well the trajectory matrix is able to acquire a
weak signal. Along with the processing gain Gp and correlation
peak, the other performance metric chosen is Mean Square
Error. The mean squared error ^e between the actual and the
estimated signal is given as ^e ¼ 1

For the three cases of trajectory matrices, autocorrelation,

where eþðnÞ and e�ðnÞ are the errors in the computation of
upper Hankel and lower Toeplitz matrices respectively.
The results demonstrate that the autocorrelation type of
trajectory matrix combined with differential detection in
GPS acquisition, achieves the maximum postcorrelation pro-
cessing gain of 20 dB at signal level of �150 dBm (Table 7)
which is more compared to covariance (17.3 dB) and modiﬁed
covariance (18.2 dB) methods. Similarly, autocorrelation type
of trajectory matrix has produced the highest correlation peak.
Though Covariance method is widely used in the SSA
approach [18], the autocorrelation method has a full version
of trajectory matrix that avoids the reacquisition of GPS data
by making 5 satellites to be visible. Also, the Minimum Mean
Square Error of 0.2346 is achieved by this method compared to
others approaches. The perfect alignment of pseudorandom
noise (PRN) code with the incoming signal has been achieved
for SVN 31 with high Gp. From the simulation results, it is
clear that this method is capable of correcting the code phase
of satellites. The combination of autocorrelation with differen-
tial detection is the best choice among the others to enhance
the signal in the worst case SNR level.
2.2. Performance comparison of SSA with other pre-ﬁlters
To demonstrate the efﬁcacy of SSA pre-ﬁltering, it is com-
pared with other pre-ﬁlters such as Butterworth, Chebyshev
and Wavelet techniques [6]. The ﬁlters are being tested with
an extremely weak GPS signal having SNR of �29 dB, a cen-
ter
frequency
of
4.13 MHz
and
sampling
frequency
of
16.367 MHz. A Butterworth ﬁlter of order 14 and Chebyshev
ﬁlter of order 5 are designed with a pass band width of
2.2 MHz. For a wavelet based ﬁltering, Haar wavelet with 8
level decomposition is used to de-noise the signal. A compar-
ison of SNRs and achieved gain using the different ﬁlters
shows that the Butterworth ﬁlter has obtained a gain of
5.8452 dB little more than Chebyshev ﬁlter and wavelet de-
noising is able to get only an additional gain of 0.3438 dB.
In contrast, the SSA pre-ﬁlter outperforms other methods with
an impressive amount of 23 dB gain (see Table 2).

2.3. Parallel code phase search acquisition scheme for single
msec data
A weak GPS signal with SNR of �150 dBm (C/N0 of 24 dB-
Hz) is tested with the circular correlation based traditional
FFT frequency domain technique. The Parallel Code Phase
Peak search algorithm for determining the threshold is being
used to determine the dominant peak [11] with the assumption
that if the difference between maximum value and second max-
imum value is large enough, the probability of false alarm will
be decreased.
The threshold condition for peak search is given in Eq. (2)
[11]

between 1st maximum and 2nd maximum peak values
should be greater than 0.3 and 0.15. In order to get a minimum
probability of false alarm 10�2, the thresholds VT1 and VT2
values are chosen as 0.99 and 0.25 respectively. In case, the
correlation output crosses the above predetermined threshold
with only one period time of C/A code, the GPS receiver can-
not produce an SNR gain to make a reliable detection. It is
observed that the weak signal detection with single msec data
does not satisfy the condition. As it fails to give a maximum
value of the decision statistic (S) and hence no satellites are
visible. The simulation results of testing one msec data for
Satellite Vehicle Number (SVN) 31 indicate that both with
SSA
and
without
SSA
fail
to
excise
the
noise
(Fig. 5a and b). For reasonable acquisition of signals around
35 dB-Hz with nominal amount of false alarm [5], single msec
data is sufﬁcient, still in order to meet the speciﬁed threshold
values for weak signal (<35 dB-Hz), longer duration data
are needed.
2.4. SSA combined coherent detection based post-correlation
approach
The coherent detection method is tested for �150 dBm power
level at 4 ms integration time. The method is unable to satisfy
the maximum value of the decision statistic (S) and poor cor-
relation performance of SVN 31 (Fig. 6a) and the data are
tested with the SSA method. Among the locally generated
32-PRN codes correlated with the incoming signal, only
SVN-31 crosses the peak condition (Fig. 6b) requiring mini-
mum of 4 satellites to ﬁnd out the user position. Increasing
the acquisition data length beyond 10 ms leads to data transi-
tion. Longer duration coherent detection increases number of
frequency bins to be searched which restricts extending the
integration time during weak signal conditions. As coherent
integration even when combined with SSA is not able to detect
weak signals less than C/N0 24 dB-Hz, therefore non-coherent
integration is next to study.

2.5. SSA combined noncoherent detection based post-correlation

The �150 dBm GPS data are tested for 40 ms duration nonco-
herent integration time. Fig. 7.a shows the non-coherent detec-
tion result of SVN 31 without SSA where the maximum value
of the decision statistic (S) is not arrived, the required thresh-
old conditions, and the signal is declared absent. While testing
noncoherent integration with SSA, only SVN-31 is found with
dominant peak (Fig. 7b). Studies have demonstrated that the
Signal Sensitivity increases roughly with square root of inte-
gration time [19] and a 10 ms longer integration time gives only
5 dB increase in sensitivity. Hence it is concluded that 100 ms
non-coherent integration correlation i.e. one tenth of second
data are required to acquire a signal having C/N0 up to
24 dB-Hz [5].
2.6. SSA combined differential coherent detection based
postcorrelation approach
The 16 ms duration noisy data are tested for differential coher-
ent detection approach at �150 dBm power level. The SVN-31
correlation performance is tested and it surpasses the threshold
value. But at lower power level (below �159 dBm) the decision
statistic (S) does not cross the predetermined threshold values
for SVN-31.This is because the noise independent property has
capability of removing the squaring loss up to certain SNR
values only. On examining Fig. 8a and b it is inferred that dif-
ferential coherent scheme is able to detect only one visible
SVN-31 for SNR level of �150 dBm. When the signal level
is weaker (�159 dBm), even an increase in integration time
to 100 ms does not make any satellite to be visible.
In the proposed work, the SSA approach is combined with
differential detection and ﬁve SVNs are visible and the decision
threshold conditions have been satisﬁed without any con-
straints. Perfect correlation has been achieved and many false
secondary peaks owing to noise are eliminated. The ﬁve SVNs
(2, 17, 26, 27, and 31) meet the threshold condition for the sig-
nal range of C/N0 24 dB-Hz and 15 dB-Hz (Table 3). Fig. 9a–e
shows the ﬁve SVN’s 3-D correlation and their corresponding
code phase i.e., perfect alignment with the C/A code samples is
plotted in Fig. 9f–j. Table 4 summarizes the comparison of the
results of 15 dB-Hz weak GPS signal tested with different
detection methods. The proposed method i.e. SSA combined
with differential detection performs better in obtaining visible
satellites for 16 ms weak GPS data and acquiring 5 SVNs to
initiate the tracking process. Even though the differential
detection scheme has dominant peak but the threshold condi-
tion 1 is not satisﬁed for all the SVNs. The code phase and
Doppler frequency comparison between different detection
techniques are listed in Table 5. The data show that the differ-

3. Acquisition sensitivity analysis
3.1. Processing Gain (Gp) estimation in software GPS receiver
The nominal signal strength of a typical C/A code receiver is
�130 dBm [20]. The noise ﬂoor for 1 kHz is at �144 dBm; thus
the corresponding SNR is 14 dB (�130 + 144). The input
power level of incoming GPS signal varies from �130 dBm
to �159 dBm and the locally generated PRN-31 is correlated
with incoming signal for the probability of false alarm (pfaÞ
of 10�2. The probability of detection and the Gp are computed
for different integration periods. The Monte Carlo simulation
is carried out for 10,000 trials to ensure the effectiveness of the
performance comparison between the three detection methods.
A weak GPS signal of �140 dBm (34 dB-Hz) i.e. SNR of
(�140 + 144) = 4 dB was set as power level. In order to
achieve nominal SNR of 14 dB, a gain of 10 dB is required,

hence signal must be averaged over a sufﬁciently long non-
coherent integration time (20 ms) to build up the SNR to a
reliable level (10 dB) (Fig. 10a). In a similar fashion, the power
is varied at different levels and the corresponding probability
of detection and the Gp are examined. The detection metrics
for the three detection methods have been presented in Table 6
for different values of signal quality. SNR after correlation is
also determined with longer integration times. The SNR com-

Theoretically noncoherent integration time of 20 ms is
enough to obtain the gain of 10 dB at �140 dBm, however,
50 ms is required to get the highest probability of detection
during the simulation. More than a second of data is required
to get the 100% of detection at the power level of �150 dBm.
As the required gain goes beyond 20 dB in the incredibly lower
SNR, an increment of 1000 ms integration time results only
in1.5 dB improvement in gain. So a group of data i.e. 20 s is
required to attain the gain of 25 dB which is practically impos-
sible. Processing non-coherent integration of 20 s data on a
Personal Computer (PC) of 1.46 GHz processor with 1 GB
memory runs 14 h time which delays the time to ﬁx the ﬁrst
position of the satellite in the acquisition stage. Such expensive
computations will be feasible only for off-line applications [5].
The differential detection scheme shows appreciable perfor-
mance compared to non-coherent detection with lower acqui-

sition time, however, for dealing with15 dB-Hz weak signal,
even after extending the integration time to 100 ms is not suf-
ﬁcient enough to meet the decision statistic and the detection
probability is around 0.68 only. On the other hand, the SSA
combined differential detection does well in the lower SNR
level. Fig. 10b shows the Gp improvement of 20 dB under the
power level 24 dB-Hz while performing 16 ms differential inte-
gration time combined with SSA. The pre-ﬁltering combined
differential coherent approach provides a signiﬁcant Gp of
29 dB within the integration time of 16 ms having 96% of
probability of detection under the signal level of �159 dBm.
An additional gain of 3 dB with a detection probability of
0.96 is being provided by the pre-ﬁltering combined differential
coherent method (Fig. 11) compared with the differential
detection approach in the signal range lower than C/N0
20 dB-Hz. Integration Time versus C/N0 is plotted where C/
N0 goes below the nominal level (Fig. 11b), the required
non-coherent integration time is in the order of 104 ms whereas
performing pre-ﬁltering combined differential coherent detec-
tion the required integration is about 20 ms.
3.2. Mean acquisition time computation
Mean acquisition time (Tacq) for coarse acquisition (C/A) code
is computed for a parallel code phase search acquisition system
[22].
Tacq ¼ ð2 � PdÞð1 þ kPfaÞ
2Pd
ðqsdÞ; q ¼ 2046 � 41
ð1=TcohÞ
ð4Þ
where sd is total GPS integration period, kPfa is false alarm
penalty time (by keeping k = 10), q is the total number of cells
to be searched in the bin and Tcoh = 1 ms for coherent, nonco-
herent and 10 ms for DFC. Using the Eq. (4), Tacq is computed
for different integration times. Fig. 11c shows that processing
20 s non-coherent data takes the computing time of 4.6785e
+05 s whereas utilizing 16 ms pre-ﬁltering combined differen-
tial integration method, the required gain is attained within
269.88 s of mean acquisition time.
3.3. Computation complexity
The initial step of formation of trajectory matrix requires com-
plexity of O (N2) operations. The multiplication of left singular
matrix with size N � (N � r), diagonal matrix of size (r � r)
and the right singular matrix with size M � M in the economy
SVD rank reduction step requires O (N3) operations. The ﬁnal
step of diagonal averaging in rank restoration requires O (N2)
computations. In total, a worst case complexity of O (N2) + O
(N3) + O (N2) = O (N3) operations are required for SSA algo-
rithm computation. While running the SSA algorithm on
1.46 GHz processor with 1 GB memory in MATLAB simula-
tor, the average computation time of SVD stage is only around
9.5773 s, rank reduction stage is 7.883210 s and reconstruction
stage is 6.767183 s. Hence total computation time of SSA is
only 24.227 s. The 16 ms DFC based parallel code phase
search acquisition algorithm takes 241.2868 s. Therefore the
total mean acquisition time for the SSA based differential
scheme for 15 dB-Hz C/No is 269.88 s as shown in Table 6.
Hence the inclusion of the SSA stage has signiﬁcantly
increased the overall computation time. Therefore with the
proposed approach, the extremely weak signal has been
acquired with less acquisition time without much increase in
computational time.
4. Conclusion and future work
The SSA based de-noising approach relies on ﬁnding the econ-
omy SVD of the autocorrelation trajectory matrix of noisy
input samples and maintaining the structure of the matrix by
applying suitable rank reconstruction (Toeplitz/Hankel) meth-
ods. On testing with noisy GPS signal, this method combined
with DFC efﬁciently handles lower power signal level of
�159 dBm with shorter integration time and achieves 3 dB
gain improvement within 269.88 s of mean acquisition time.
The detection of the number of visible satellites is increased
and also the re-acquisition of GPS data is avoided. From the
simulation results, the differential coherent detection technique
when combined with pre-ﬁltering corrects the deviation in code
phase and Doppler frequency of the visible SVN compared to
other conventional methods. The SSA based de-noising cou-
pled with DFC has an ability to recover the weak signals only
up to �159 dBm which is the limitation of current approach.
Therefore for an indoor environment, Independent Compo-
nent analysis can be used in the SSA signal decomposition step
for ﬁnding proper rotations of eigen triples in weak signal
separability.
