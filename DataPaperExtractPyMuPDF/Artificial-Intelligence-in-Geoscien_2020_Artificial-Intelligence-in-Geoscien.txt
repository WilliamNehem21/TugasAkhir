Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geosciences
Inaugural editorial
Welcome to the inaugural volume of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geo-
sciences (AIIG), the ﬁrst fully Open Access journal in the interdisciplinary
area between the geosciences and artiﬁcial intelligence. This issue fo-
cuses on the applications of machine learning (ML) methods to earth-
quake detection, to surface seismic data interpretation, spatial prediction
(or predictive modeling) in geosciences and ground motion.
Magrini et al., proposes a new ML algorithm to detect small, local
earthquakes in areas characterized by sparsity of receivers. Fouedjio ap-
plies to an England’s geochemical dataset a newly developed regression
random forest approach. Deep variational autoencoders (VAE) are used
by Li et al. to create synthetic seismic data and alleviate the problem of
lacking labeled seismic data for supervised seismic facies analysis. Zhou
et al. uses the mask propagation network (a multi-level convolutional
neural network) to reconstruct fault instance segmentation on 3D seismic
data. Finally, a data collection relating earthquake damage with seismic
shaking was proposed by Faenza et al., which can be used to recalibrate
fragility curves as well as to train machine learning models.
Overall, the ﬁrst issue reaches the goal of AIIG to serve as an inter-
national, interdisciplinary platform for sharing ideas and solutions
related to artiﬁcial intelligence and their applications to geosciences. We
aim to expand the range of topics covered in the next volumes to topics
such as remote sensing, marine and planetary sciences, in particular
counting on the increasing use of robots and smart sensors in geosciences.
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is one of the fastest growing disciplines in
information technology. Along with diversiﬁed data, AI-enabled tech-
nologies such as image processing, smart sensors, and intelligent inver-
sion, are being tested by researchers in a wide variety of geosciences
domains, such as geology, rock physics, seismicity, hydrology, ecology,
marine geosciences, planetary science, environment, remote sensing and
GIS, and related areas. Many aspects of machine learning are reaching
maturity, such as deep learning. Others are well established like regres-
sion, clustering and support vector machines. Sensors, robotics and other
tools that need AI to function independently from human intervention
are in their infancy. Geoscientists will have to increasingly adapt to
changes. We can expect many great and interesting new discoveries to
emerge from these two combined ﬁelds.
Our journal aims to cover all the topics of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in
geosciences, from robotics and sensors applied to Earth sciences, to the
vast range of machine learning algorithms and implementations used to
process Earth Sciences data. Another interesting ﬁeld that we welcome is
cloud computing and high-performance computing (HPC) in the context
of big data processing. Overall, we want to attract geoscientists who are
transitioning into the big data world, as well as data scientists who an-
alyses geo-related data.
To achieve these aims of the journal, AIIG will publish rigorously peer
reviewed scientiﬁc studies, technical ﬁndings, reviews, short communi-
cations, as well as perspectives on the theory and practice of artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) in geosciences within the following research areas, but
are not limited to:
� AI-based decision support systems
� AI-based precision geosciences
� Smart sensors and the Internet of Things
� Geosciences robotics and automation equipment
� Geosciences knowledge-based systems
� Computational intelligence in geosciences
� AI in geosciences optimization management
� Intelligent interfaces and human-machine interaction
� Machine vision and image/signal processing
� Machine learning and pattern recognition
� Neural networks, fuzzy systems, neuro-fuzzy systems
� Systems modeling and analysis
� Expert systems in geosciences
� Big Data and Cloud Computing in Geosciences
� Automatic navigation and self-driving technology
In addition, we also welcome suggestions and proposals for special
issues.
We will work closely with our editorial board and publishers, re-
searchers, scientists, engineers and practitioners. Our excellent board
member of editors, who are experts in a variety of ﬁelds related to the
different aspects of Earth Sciences as well as artiﬁcial intelligence,
quickly review or ﬁnd competent available volunteer reviewers to
guarantee the quality of our published papers. We promote every single
paper on social media–Facebook, Twitter, and so on. Papers that suc-
cessfully pass through the peer review process will be promoted every-
where in the ﬁrst two years.
We believe AIIG has the potential to rapidly grow into an interna-
tionally impactful journal which provides multiple values to the beneﬁt
of the research communities and society at large.
