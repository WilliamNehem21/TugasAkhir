Abstract 
This study presents a new algorithm for detecting dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals. The discrete multi-
frequency transform (DMFT) method with optimal phase was employed to reduce the DTMF detection computations. 
With the DMFT approach, the pass-band ripple is employed as a cost function, and the optimal phase can be obtained 
using the open-loop search method. Compared to the traditional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) approach, not only is a 
computational saving of 75% to 83% achieved, but spectrum efficiency is also maintained. These experimental results 
demonstrate the excellent performance of the DMFT method.

1. Introduction 
In a public switched telecommunications network (PSTN), dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling is 
widely employed for analog telephone dialing, data entry, voicemail systems, and remote control of various 
consumer electronics. DTMF signaling is used to transfer digital numbers. The PSTN system also defines 
additional tones to indicate the status of the calling process.  
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) specifications allow a frequency tolerance of 
approximately ±1.5% for valid DTMF tones. Thus, tones with an offset of ±3.5% must be rejected. However,

3. Experiment Results 
The DMFT method was proposed to improve DTMF detection computations. The computational 
requirements of the DFT method, Goertzel algorithm, and DMFT method are listed in Table 1. The 
computational savings provided by DMFT are superior to those of the traditional DFT and Goertzel approach. 
In general cases of DFT-based DTMF detection, the basis frequencies number approximately 4 to 6. Thus, 
using the DMFT approach, the computational saving is approximately 75% to 83%; this is a reasonably 
satisfactory result.

The frequency responses of the DMFT approach were also thoroughly analyzed. The stop-band ripple gsr, 
pass-band ripple gpr, and differential gain gps between the pass-band and stop-band and the optimal phase �ˆ  
are listed in Table 2. A frequency index of k = 11 and an FFT size of 256 were set. When L = 1, a general 
DFT approach was indicated. The stop-band ripple gsr was -9.89 dB. The differential gain gps between the 
stop-band and pass-band equaled 6.88 dB. When L = 2, the stop-band ripple gsr was -9.75 dB. The differential 
gain gps between the stop-band and pass-band equaled 6.70 dB. As shown in Table 4, the stop-band ripple, 
pass-band ripple, and differential gain for each L value are almost identical. This indicates that the frequency 
response performances of DFT and DMFT are almost the same. However, the computational savings provided 
by DMFT are greater, as shown in Table 1.

4. Conclusions 
The DMFT method with an optimal phase was proposed to reduce DTMF detection computations. A 
computational saving of 75% to 83% was achieved without declination of spectrum efficiency. The results 
showed that the performance of the DMFT method was superior to that of the DFT and Goertzel approaches. 
In the future, the phase and gain of the basis frequency components of the DMFT approach can be controlled 
more precisely to further improve DTMF detection.
