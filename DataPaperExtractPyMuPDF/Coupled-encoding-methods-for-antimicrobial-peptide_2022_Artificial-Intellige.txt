Current application of machine learning in the process of antimicrobial peptide discovery call for the reduction of 
the false positive predictions that are produced by the classiﬁcation models. Considering that the positive predic- 
tions of high conﬁdence drive modern experimental design, the model’s sensitivity is crucial to reduce the number 
of unnecessary in vitro tests. Furthermore, taking into account the expert-based design approaches that employ 
random mutations on conﬁrmed sequences, the machine learning models are required to distinguish between 
subtle diﬀerences among shuﬄed sequences. With the goal of reducing the false positive rate and improving 
sensitivity, we propose a hybrid approach to antimicrobial peptide prediction that utilizes combined encoding 
models. To this end, we implement models that employ both the physico-chemical features and sequence order- 
ing information to stress the importance of using both representations. We also investigate the usage of binary 
encoding for peptide representation purposes, a method that is insuﬃciently represented in related research, 
which proved to act as a viable low dimensional alternative to the one-hot encoding. Our results, supported 
by Cochran and McNemar statistical tests and Spearman correlation analysis, indicate that the sequence-based 
encodings complement the physico-chemical features and their synergic eﬀect yields improvement in terms of 
every evaluation metric. Finally, the proposed hybrid approach that combines physico-chemical features and bi- 
nary encoding using logical conjunction was shown to be superior to other single models by a factor of 2.96 in 
terms of fall-out and up to 6.1% in terms of precision. 
1. Introduction 
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also known as host defense peptides, 
are short chains of amino acids produced by the immune systems of 
living organisms. Their main purpose is to protect the host organism 
against external threats that are of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic 
origin [3,15] . Furthermore, some AMPs have displayed anticancer activ- 
ity [30] , which indicates that these naturally occurring defense appara- 
tus can be used to combat one of modern medicine’s biggest adversaries. 
Their origin reaches back to 1939 [3,29] , when René Dubos isolated a 
bacillus capable of attacking live gram-positive bacteria [12] . This bacil- 
lus was later named gramicidin [14] , and is now considered to be the 
ﬁrst discovered antimicrobial peptide [3,29] . 
In recent years, the research on antimicrobial peptides has gained 
more attention than ever [19] . This interest can be attributed to the 
alarming accumulation of drug-resistant microbes causing an increas- 
ingly large number of infections [34] . The extensive usage of traditional 
antibiotics, combined with the highly adaptive and mutable nature of

microbes, has led to the emergence of a new global health crisis [22,26] . 
According to the WHO, the antimicrobial resistance problem is lead- 
ing the world towards a post-antibiotic era [26] , and is set to become 
one of the leading causes of deaths [22] . Considering the potency and 
broad activity spectrum of AMPs, the scientiﬁc community is becom- 
ing progressively interested in turning these naturally occurring amino 
acid sequences into modern-day antibiotics. However, in vitro testing of 
peptides to potentially discover their antimicrobial properties is a time- 
consuming operation which also requires considerable resources [4] . 
Moreover, should there be a need to test hundreds, or even thousands 
of candidate peptides, the entire process of AMP discovery becomes very 
slow and inﬂexible. 
With the goal of faster discovery of new antimicrobial peptides, 
researchers have been combining the contemporary in silico testing 
methodologies with the traditional in vitro peptide evaluation to aug- 
ment their drug discovery workﬂow [35,41] . The general idea is to cre- 
ate machine learning models capable of discerning which peptides are 
more likely to present antimicrobial activity from the ones which are

less likely to do so. Using this newfound knowledge, garnered during 
the in silico testing process, researchers can then focus their in vitro test- 
ing eﬀorts onto the promising peptide candidates with high potential of 
having antimicrobial activity. When successful, this combined testing 
methodology leads to less in vitro testing, and more AMP discoveries. 
Moreover, this approach can be used to identify general antimicrobial 
activity, but also to further specify the exact type of activity for an AMP 
[40] . Lastly, the usage of evolutionary algorithms in this drug discovery 
process enables the in silico generation, and eventually in vitro synthesis 
of previously non-existent peptides with antimicrobial activities [42] . 
This paper compares and evaluates methodologies of peptide repre- 
sentation in the form of numerical vectors, with the aim to construct 
an augmented methodology that will be used to reduce the number 
of falsely identiﬁed antimicrobial peptides. The ﬁrst approach uses the 
physico-chemical descriptors of peptides computed from their amino 
acid sequences (referred to as the phys_chem method). The second ap- 
proach is a sequence-based approach which uses one-hot encoding and 
binary encoding of categorical variables to represent amino acids within 
the amino acid sequence (referred to as the one-hot_encoding and bi- 
nary_encoding methods). Furthermore, we introduce a third approach 
that uses both feature generation methods simultaneously to account for 
the physico-chemical descriptors of peptides and the exact ordering of 
amino acids within the amino acid sequence (referred to as the PC_one- 
hot and PC_binary methods). The methodologies are assessed and com- 
pared to stress out the importance of using both the physico-chemical 
features and the sequence order information when making AMP predic- 
tions. 
We propose an approach for reducing the number of non- 
antimicrobial peptides that make it into the in vitro testing phase. The 
rationale for our aim is that the expert will beneﬁt more from a ma- 
chine learning model that is able to accurately produce a few promising 
solutions than a model with higher overall accuracy that yields false pos- 
itives with high conﬁdence. The operation of logical conjunction is con- 
ducted between the predictions of the phys_chem model and encoding- 
based models in an eﬀort to minimize the fall-out metric, also known 
as the false positive rate (FPR). Our results indicate that this approach 
of combining the prediction of divergent models can indeed be used for 
the reduction of the false positive rate and act as a strong candidate for 
future applications in peptide discovery. 
2. Background 
The usage of machine learning for the purposes of predicting AMPs 
is a known interdisciplinary endeavour, however new caveats are con- 
stantly being uncovered, meaning there is always room for improve- 
ment. For instance, a common representation scheme in Artiﬁcial Neural 
Network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) prediction models is to use 
physico-chemical properties of peptides [20,37,39] . Another approach 
to create machine learning models that predict antimicrobial peptides is 
to utilize the compositional features of peptides in the form of PseAAC 
[7] . While both of these approaches represent valid resolutions to the 
problem of antimicrobial activity prediction, it has been argued that the 
usage of both physico-chemical and sequence order descriptors leads 
to the construction of models able to achieve even higher performance 
[32] . 
To this end, many researchers have used physico-chemical features 
in combination with various compositional descriptors to consider more 
peptide information while developing machine learning models. Com- 
positional features, along with structural and physico-chemical features, 
were used to develop an SVM-based classiﬁer for identifying AMPs and 
their functional types [21,40] . Considering that using only amino acid 
composition (AAC) does not contribute with suﬃcient amount of infor- 
mation, this particular model has also utilized the pseudo amino acid 
composition (PseAAC) descriptor. The diﬀerence between the two is 
that AAC loses all of the sequence order information, while PseAAC 
keeps the sequence order information, although only partially [9] . The 
pseudo amino acid composition descriptor is a commonly used compo- 
sitional descriptor, and has been used numerous times for AMP predic- 
tions [21,23,40,41] . 
To preserve as much sequence order information as possible, other 
encoding methodologies have been trialed, such as one-hot encoding 
that retains only the information about the order of amino acids [25] . 
A hybrid approach that used one-hot encoding paired with physico- 
chemical features to create numerical representations of peptides was 
successfully applied for the prediction of anticancer peptide activity [6] . 
Recent comparative studies [32,33] were conducted with the goal of 
summarizing and comparing known peptide encoding methods that are 
commonly used when approaching the task of biomedical classiﬁcation. 
To the best of our knowledge, binary encoding remains an unexplored 
and unused encoding scheme in the context of AMP prediction, which 
is why we chose to study its potential beneﬁts on the predictive perfor- 
mance. 
Finally, recent research reﬂects on the need to minimize the amount 
of false positives that the classiﬁcation models yield. Most recent studies 
tried improving the sensitivity of the predictive performance by fusing 
features using a logistic regression equation [18] and by applying rigor- 
ous classiﬁcation threshold on a Convolutional Neural Network model 
to select only the most promising peptides for the in vitro testing phase 
[41] . With this in mind, we propose a method of combining predictions 
of models based on diﬀerent types of descriptors (physico-chemical or 
compositional) in an eﬀort to reduce the false positive rate and improve 
the sensitivity of the model. 
3. Methodology 
This section introduces our methods and Fig. 1 visualizes the im- 
plemented workﬂow. We present our data sources and pre-processing, 
explain the feature extraction process, describe the model used for pre- 
diction, and outline which metrics were used for evaluation of model 
performance. Furthermore, Fig. 1 also shows how the feature generation 
methods were utilized to construct various datasets and which models 
were examined. 
3.1. Datasets 
The antimicrobial dataset was constructed by combining the non- 
patent positive instances from the Data Repository of Antimicrobial Pep- 
tides database (DRAMP) [31] and the negative instances from the 
UniProt database [11] . To ensure that the negative instances are not 
longer than 75 amino acids and are not fragments of longer sequences, 
the following query has been run in the UniProt database: “NOT key- 
word:antimicrobial length:[0 TO 75] fragment:no AND reviewed:yes ”. This 
query also ensures that the negative dataset contains reviewed and 
veriﬁed peptides ( “reviewed:yes ”) with no antimicrobial potency ( “NOT 
keyword:antimicrobial ”). UniProt closely monitors AMPs, so any pep- 
tides with detected antimicrobial activity would not be returned by this 
query. 
Data cleaning consisted of ﬁltering duplicated sequences, sequences 
that contained other than the 20 natural amino acids, and sequences 
whose length is considered an outlier. The outlier detection is set to 
preserve the range between the 5th and the 95th percentile of the posi- 
tive instances, which corresponds to sequences with length in the range 
between 10 and 75 amino acids with inclusive boundaries. The posi- 
tive set was reduced to 5043 instances out of the initial 5819, while the 
ﬁltered negative set contained 16,910 out of 24,751 original instances. 
The consistency of the sequence length distributions between the 
classes has been recognized as an important data ﬁltration step [38,41] . 
Fig. 2 a and 2 b illustrate the distribution of peptide lengths for the posi- 
tive and negative instances, respectively. The 16,910 negative instances 
are skewed towards the upper limit of the sequence lengths, while the 
5043 positive instances are more present in the lower limit of the se- 
quence lengths. This could lead to the model implicitly associating the

longer peptides with the negative class, and the shorter peptides with the 
positive class. Therefore, data pre-processing also involved distribution- 
based undersampling to reduce the eﬀect of divergent sequence length 
distributions of the positive and negative classes. The reduction of the 
instances from both classes resulted in a fully balanced dataset that con- 
tains 3480 positive and 3480 negative instances, which are equally dis- 
tributed with respect to sequence length as presented in Fig. 2c and 2d . 
To analytically check the distributions similarity between classes, we 
applied the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U statistical test, which con- 
ﬁrmed that their distributions indeed come from the same population, 
producing p -value of 0.84. The process of blending positive and negative 
instances into an operational dataset is depicted in Fig. 1 . 
3.2. Feature representation 
To establish the numerical representation of the peptides in the con- 
structed dataset, three feature generation methods were used. The ﬁrst 
method leverages the physico-chemical descriptors of peptides, while 
the other two methods are based on the ordering of amino acids in a 
sequence. 
3.2.1. Physico-chemical features 
The physico-chemical feature generation method is based on the cal- 
culation of peptide’s properties from the amino acid sequence, in a for- 
mat similar to FASTA. The categories of peptide descriptors and the 
number of their components are listed in Table 1 . In total, each peptide is 
described using 66 features that encompass hydrophobic, bulky, steric,

electronic, topological, structural, alignment and interaction properties, 
alpha and turn propensities, compositional characteristics, etc. To cal- 
culate these physico-chemical features of peptides, we have employed 
the Peptides package [27] , which is available for the R programming 
language. An important property of computed features is that each de- 
scriptor is calculated as the average value over the entire sequence. For 
example, in the case of Z-scales , each of the 20 amino acids has it’s own 
5 speciﬁc Z-scale values. To calculate the Z-scale values for a sequence 
such as “LMCTHPLDCSN ”, we compute the average of each of the 5 
Z-scale values over the entire sequence. The expression used by the Pep- 
tides package to calculate the Z-scales descriptor is shown in Eq. (1) , 
where 𝑁 represents the number of amino acids in the sequence, while

Although these features describe a peptide sequence from compo- 
sitional, electrostatic, structural, and other aspects, the very nature of 
their calculation signiﬁes that the physico-chemical descriptors are not 
always suﬃcient for representing a sequence. If we were to take the 
aforementioned sequence ( “LMCTHPLDCSN ”) and simply switch the 
places of the ﬁrst two amino acids ( “MLCTHPLDCSN ”), the Z-scale val- 
ues for these two sequences would be identical. Taking this into consid- 
eration, we can conclude that additional features are to be used if we 
were to eﬀectively capture the ordering of the amino acids within a se- 
quence. To help and reﬂect the ordering of the amino acids, this feature 
generation method is used in combination with the other two feature 
generation methods to create datasets for combined encoding models 
( PC_one-hot dataset and PC_binary dataset ). This method is also used to 
construct a single encoding dataset named the physico-chemical dataset . 
3.2.2. One-hot encoding 
The one-hot encoding is used to represent a categorical value as a 
vector of bits. Each bit represents one possible value, meaning the vector 
length is equal to the number of possible categories that we are dealing 
with. In the context of this paper, we are dealing with peptides com- 
prised of the 20 natural amino acids and the bit vector for a single amino 
acid has a ﬁxed length of 20 bits. Each of the 20 amino acids is position- 
ally assigned to one bit and to encode an amino acid in the bit vector, 
the assigned bit is set to 1, while all the others are set to 0. The amino 
acids were assigned to the bits in an alphabetical order: the amino acid 
that is alphabetically ﬁrst (A - alanine) is assigned to the last, rightmost

bit, while the amino acid that is alphabetically last (Y - tyrosine) is as- 
signed to the ﬁrst, leftmost bit. The full encoding of each amino acid 
is available in Table 2 . To construct the feature vector for each of the 
sequences, the bit vectors of all of the amino acids in the sequence are 
concatenated. 
This encoding scheme requires the amino acid sequences to be of 
ﬁxed length. Given that we have chosen a maximum length of 75 amino

acids, the feature vector of a one-hot encoded peptide will always have 
a total length of 1500, no matter what the actual length of the peptide 
is. Naturally, most of the peptides in the dataset are shorter than 75 
amino acids, as shown in Fig. 3 . To account for this, after the bit vectors 
of the amino acids have been concatenated, all remaining elements of 
the feature vector are set to -1. For example, a peptide composed of 40 
amino acids will be represented by an 800 bits long feature vector and 
the remaining 700 features set to the deﬁned value of -1. This method is 
used to construct the one-hot encoded dataset , which is dedicated solely to 
the one-hot encoding scheme. Also, to help mitigate the shortcomings of 
the physico-chemical approach, this method is also used in combination 
with the physico-chemical feature generation method to construct the 
PC_one-hot dataset . 
3.2.3. Binary encoding 
Similarly to one-hot encoding, the binary encoding turns categori- 
cal values into vectors of bits, which correspond to the assigned rank 
number of each category. In the context of this paper, these numbers 
range from 1 to 20, and are assigned using the alphabetical criterion of 
the single letter code of natural amino acids, as presented in Table 2 . 
Using the binary encoding scheme, each amino acid can be represented 
using exactly 5 bits. The binary encoding method approach diﬀers from 
the one-hot encoding method in that it uses a feature space that is 4 
times smaller. Considering the sequence limit of 75 amino acids, the 
feature vector will have a length of 375 features. Just like with one-hot 
encoding, the bit vectors of all amino acids are concatenated to form 
the feature vector, with any remaining features being padded with the 
value of -1. Should binary encoding be used on a peptide consisting of 
40 amino acids, the ﬁrst 200 elements of the feature vector would have 
a value of either 0 or 1, while the remaining 175 elements would be set 
to -1. 
Along with the construction of the binary encoded dataset , this en- 
coding scheme is also used to create another dataset with combined 
encodings named the PC_binary dataset . 
3.3. Prediction model 
The prediction model that was used in this research is the Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) with the RBF kernel. The SVM models are capa- 
ble of solving binary classiﬁcation tasks, and do so by ﬁtting a hyper- 
plane that separates the two classes. The main advantage of the SVM 
model is that it implicitly maps the data into higher dimensions us- 
ing the kernel trick, which enables the separation of classes in higher 
dimensions when the separation cannot be done in lower dimensions. 
The motivation for the use of SVM lies in the fact that it has been used 
numerous times for AMP prediction purposes [16,21] , and is widely re- 
garded as an advanced and well-performing model, even outside the 
ﬁeld of chemoinformatics [2,13,36] . To construct the optimal hyper- 
plane that separates the two classes, the SVM model relies on distances 
between the data instances. Taking this into account, it is important to 
scale the features down to similar scales. The one-hot encoded features 
and the binary encoded features already exist on similar scales because 
they can assume one of three values: -1, 0, or 1. On the other hand, the 
physico-chemical features have varying ranges. In the context of this re- 
search, the second component of the MSWHIM descriptor ( MSWHIM (2) ) 
has a range of [-0.18, 0.78], while the ﬁrst component of T-scales ( T (1) ) 
exists on a scale of [-8.78, 2.98]. Taking this into consideration, the 
physico-chemical dataset was scaled using the feature scaling technique 
of standardization, while the one-hot encoded dataset and binary encoded 
dataset were left unaltered. The PC_one-hot dataset and PC_binary dataset 
were only partially standardized: the physico-chemical features of the 
combined datasets were included in the standardization process, but the 
one-hot encoded and the binary encoded features were left in their orig- 
inal form. The z-score standardization function was implemented using 
the expression denoted in Eq. (2) .

𝑗 = 
𝑋 ( 𝑖 ) 
𝑗 − 𝜇( 𝑖 ) 
𝜎( 𝑖 ) 
, ∀𝑗 ∈ [1 , 𝑚 ] , 𝑖 ∈ [1 , 66] 
(2) 
The 𝑋 ( 𝑖 ) represents the i th raw, unstandardized feature, while 𝑋 
′( 𝑖 ) 
denotes the new, standardized version of the feature. As denoted in 
Table 1 , the total number of the physico-chemical features is 66, which 
is why 𝑖 spans in the range from 1 to 66. The 𝜇( 𝑖 ) and 𝜎( 𝑖 ) are the mean 
and standard deviation of the i th feature, respectively. This calculation 
will standardize each of the features to have a mean of 0 and a unit 
variance, enabling SVM to perform better [1] . 
The SVM classiﬁcation models were implemented using the scikit- 
learn Python library [28] . The hyperparameters of the models were op- 
timized using grid search during the nested cross-validation evaluation, 
which is why a range of optimal values may be identiﬁed, as for the 
amount of regularization (hyperparameter C ). The search has been con- 
ducted on hyperparameters C ∈ [0.1, 30], kernel ∈ {rbf, sigmoid}, 𝛾 ∈
{auto, scale}, shrinking ∈ {True, False}, and probability ∈ {True, False} to 
ﬁnd the best performing combination for each model of single and com- 
bined encodings. The hyperparameters that were identiﬁed as optimal 
for each encoding method are shown in Table 3 . 
3.4. Evaluation 
This section introduces all of the metrics that were used to evaluate 
the performance of the binary classiﬁcation models. We provide each 
metric’s description, as well as the calculation which deﬁnes the metric. 
We will be using the commonly used abbreviations for the confusion 
matrix elements: true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive 
(FP), and false negative (FN). 
As presented in Table 4 , we have utilized some of the commonly used 
metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. We have also employed the 
F 1 score, a metric that mitigates the precision/recall trade-oﬀ [5] , in- 
dicating that high values for both metrics are needed to prove that a 
model is truly performing well. These metrics can be intuitively inter- 
preted, and can provide a reasonably good insight into general model 
performance. However, a more comprehensive metric is needed to ob- 
jectively evaluate a model’s performance [8] . To this end, we have used 
the Matthews Correlation Coeﬃcient (MCC), which is an often used met- 
ric for measuring the performance of binary classiﬁers. The MCC calcu- 
lation in Table 4 gives a number in the range of [-1, 1]. In a machine 
learning context, a value of -1 represents extremely poor model per- 
formance, while 1 signiﬁes that the model performs perfectly. Due to 
their mathematical nature, other metrics run the risk of giving exces- 
sively optimistic classiﬁcation results. MCC tends to avoid this type of 
exaggeration [8] , which is why it was included as an indicator of model 
performance in this research. Finally, since recent research reﬂects on 
the need for lowering the amount of false positives produced by AMP 
prediction models [18,21] , we have also included the fall-out metric,

also known as the false positive rate (FPR). Unlike the other metrics 
used in this research, lower values of the FPR are indicative of a better 
model performance. In the context of this research, a low FPR means 
that a model produces less in vitro testing candidates which do not ac- 
tually have antimicrobial properties. 
The assessment of diﬀerences in prediction probabilities between an- 
alyzed models was achieved by the non-parametric Spearman’s rank- 
order correlation, which measures the strength and direction of a mono- 
tonic relationship between paired data [17] . The yielded correlation co- 
eﬃcient 𝑟 𝑠 takes on a value within the range [-1, 1], with the following 
interpretation of its absolute value: 
• 0 . 0 ≤ |𝑟 𝑠 | < 0 . 2 - very low correlation, 
• 0 . 2 ≤ |𝑟 𝑠 | < 0 . 4 - low correlation, 
• 0 . 4 ≤ |𝑟 𝑠 | < 0 . 6 - moderate correlation, 
• 0 . 6 ≤ |𝑟 𝑠 | < 0 . 8 - strong correlation, 
• 0 . 8 ≤ |𝑟 𝑠 | ≤ 1 . 0 - very strong correlation. 
The advantage of Spearman’s correlation is that it does not require 
the data to be normally distributed nor does it assume linear relation- 
ship between the observations [24] . To investigate whether the binary 
predictions of the analyzed models come from the same distribution, we 
have utilized the Cochran’s Q statistical test. In a machine learning con- 
text, this test can be used to check for statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences 
between the predictions of three or more models, with a conﬁdence level 
of 95% [10] . Upon rejecting the null-hypothesis of Cochran’s Q test, the 
McNemar test with Bonferroni correction is applied for pairwise com- 
parison to further specify models which display signiﬁcantly diﬀering 
predictions. 
4. Results 
This paper demonstrates how various peptide representation tech- 
niques have been scrutinized, compared, and combined in an eﬀort to 
produce prediction models capable of identifying antimicrobial peptides 
with low tendency for false positives. Firstly, we set out to investigate 
whether the AMP classiﬁcation task may be solved by simple process of 
clustering the peptides into two categories using their length and amino 
acid composition as dependent variables. The K-means algorithm was 
applied in the attempt to cluster the peptides into two groups which 
were then compared with the two categories of positive and negative 
antimicrobial instances. The second approach was to cluster the data us- 
ing the physico-chemical features from the dataset that was constructed 
as presented in the workﬂow from Fig. 1 . Both attempts resulted with 
Rand index of 𝑅 ≈ 0 . 5 , proving this task not to be a trivial one and the 
necessity of using prediction models of higher complexity. In addition, 
we conﬁrmed that the under-sampling technique yielded datasets that 
are not biased by peptide length. 
The classiﬁcation models were evaluated using a balanced dataset 
containing matching amounts of antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial 
peptides. To allow for a fair and objective comparison of the chosen 
methodologies, SVM was the prediction model of choice, being the dom- 
inant approach in related work, and hyperparameter tuning based on the 
grid search optimization process has preceded the testing of the models. 
The evaluation approach of choice was nested 10-fold cross-validation . 
The dataset is randomly split into 10 folds, after which the model is 
trained, tuned and tested 10 times, with each fold being used for testing 
once. Before model evaluation, the model’s hyperparameters are opti- 
mized on the 9 training folds, ensuring that the test fold is completely 
left out from the hyperparameter tuning and model training processes. 
To compare the approaches as objectively as possible, the fold split- 
ting was done identically for each of the methods, meaning each of the 
folds across all of the trialed datasets contain the same sets of peptides. 
Finally, each metric is calculated as an average of the metric values that 
were produced in each of the 10 runs. Besides the average, the stan- 
dard deviation is calculated for each of the metrics as well. The results 
that have been acquired through the evaluation of the models developed 
using the described approaches are presented in Table 5 . 
4.1. Combining model predictions 
Considering the fact that both the phys-chem model and the sequence- 
based models are known to yield highly accurate predictions, we have 
set out to jointly employ them in order to improve the sensitivity, i.e. 
fall-out of the prediction model. The predictions of the phys-chem and the 
one-hot_encoding models have been put through the operations of logi- 
cal conjunction ( multi_comb_1 ) and logical disjunction ( add_comb_1 ). The 
multi_comb_1 approach uses the logical AND operation to classify a pep- 
tide as antimicrobial only if both the phys-chem and the one-hot_encoding 
models classify the peptide as antimicrobial. Similarly, the add_comb_1 
method uses the logical OR operation to classify a peptide as antimi-

crobial if at least one of the two models classiﬁes it as antimicrobial. 
This combined workﬂow is depicted in Fig. 4 , and the results that the 
proposed methodologies have produced are presented in Table 5 . 
The usage of these approaches introduces a precision-recall trade-oﬀ. 
The multi_comb_1 approach is the most rigorous one. Less peptides are 
classiﬁed as antimicrobial, but those that are classiﬁed as antimicrobial 
are more likely to be true positives. This has the eﬀect of increasing the 
precision, but lowering the recall. Conversely, the add_comb_1 is a more 
liberal approach. More peptides are classiﬁed as antimicrobial, however 
at the cost of producing more false positives. This approach will decrease 
the precision, while increasing the recall metric. Analogously, the phys- 
chem model is also combined with the binary_encoding model to construct 
the multi_comb_2 and the add_comb_2 methods. 
4.2. Comparing prediction probabilities 
To compare the output probabilities that each of the individual, non- 
combined models have yielded, we have subtracted them. As presented 
in Fig. 5 , the diﬀerences for all compared models are centered around 
0, indicating that the prediction probabilities are similar. This was con- 
ﬁrmed by the Spearman’s correlation analysis, which yielded correla- 
tion coeﬃcients 𝑟 𝑠 of 0.732, 0.782, and 0.859 for models compared in 
Fig. 5 a, Fig. 5 b, and Fig. 5 c, respectively, indicating their strong and 
very strong relationship. 
Taking the variances and Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcients into ac- 
count, the relationship between sequence-based approaches is stronger 
than between them and the phys-chem model. The Cochran’s Q statisti- 
cal test compared the classiﬁcation predictions of the three models, and 
with the p -value of 1.28e-09 it revealed there exsists a statistically sig- 
niﬁcant diﬀerence between at least one pair of models. The McNemar 
statistical test with the Bonferroni correction was used to identify that 
this result is due to the diﬀerences between the phys-chem model and 
the sequence based models ( Fig. 5 a,b), while the diﬀerence between the 
one-hot_encoding and the binary_encoding models was not identiﬁed as 
signiﬁcant ( Fig. 5 c). 
4.3. Permuting highly probable sequences 
An additional round of model evaluation on de novo generated se- 
quences has been conducted to verify the sensitivity of the models. Upon 
evaluation of the phys-chem model, peptides that were predicted as an- 
timicrobial with high certainty (probability 90% or higher) in any of 
the testing folds were singled out, and used as the basis for creating the 
permutation set . Among the 1737 peptides that satisﬁed this criterion, 
66 of them were chosen, randomly selecting one peptide for each of the 
viable peptide lengths ( length ∈ [10 , 75] ). Their amino acid sequences 
were randomly shuﬄed 10 times to create 10 new peptides, for a total 
of 660 new peptides in the permutation set . We additionally conﬁrmed 
that none of the 660 newly generated sequences appear in the training 
dataset. 
Considering that the 66 chosen sequences come from various test- 
ing folds, we made sure that the permutations are given to the same 
model as it’s original peptide. In a sense, we have created a new testing 
dataset with 660 peptides of unknown antimicrobial activity for which 
we wanted to test the models’ sensitivity. The output prediction prob- 
abilities have been compared as presented in Fig. 6 . The overlaid his- 
tograms in Fig. 6 a,b reveal that the predictions of the sequence-based 
models are scattered across the entire probability range, while the pre- 
dictions of the phys-chem model are grouped in the 𝑃 ∈ [0 . 9 , 1 . 0] range. 
This is due to the phys-chem model’s insensitivity to amino acid order 
in the sequence, which is why the model outputs identical probabili- 
ties for all permutations, emphasizing the importance of sequence or- 
der information once again. Fig. 6 c shows the diﬀerences in prediction 
probabilities for the binary_encoding and one-hot_encoding models, and 
exhibits a grouping around 0, with a variance of 𝜎2 = 0 . 086 . The predic- 
tions of the three models have also been compared using the Cochran’s 
Q statistical test which has conﬁrmed that a signiﬁcant diﬀerence exists 
between at least one pair of the examined models (p-value = 5.18e-55). 
Subsequently, the McNemar statistical test with the Bonferroni correc- 
tion has revealed that a signiﬁcant diﬀerence exists between all models. 
Finally, the Spearman’s correlation coeﬃcients are 0.06, -0.02, and 0.43 
for models compared in Figs. 6 a, 6 b, and 6 c, respectively. This conﬁrms 
that although there is a certain degree of similarity (moderate corre-

lation) between the one-hot_encoding and the binary_encoding models, a 
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence exists between their predictions. 
5. Discussion 
The focus of this paper is the ability of AMP prediction models to 
discern between sequence permutations, and their ability to maintain a 
low false positive rate. The means of achieving this aim are the numer- 
ical representations of peptides used to develop SVM models capable 
of distinguishing peptides with antimicrobial properties. We have ana- 
lyzed the traditional approach based on physico-chemical features and 
two sequence-based approaches that use categorical variable encoding 
techniques to encode amino acids into bit vectors. Although all of the 
single models have produced fair results according to Table 5 , the one- 
hot_encoding shown better overall performance over the phys_chem and 
binary_encoding models by a margin of 3.5%, referring to the accuracy 
metric. In the context of this research, we argue that a trade-oﬀ is intro- 
duced regarding the chosen approach and the results which the adopted 
approach outputs. The sequence-based methods produce better results, 
however they are limited by the fact that the sequence lengths must 
be limited with an upper bound. On the other hand, the calculation of 
physico-chemical features does not require such limitations, though it 
does indeed produce inferior results. 
In addition to this, the results convey that the one-hot_encoding model 
has outperformed the binary_encoding model by 3.5%, with respect to 
accuracy. Another essential factor that needs to be taken into account 
when interpreting these results is data dimensionality. The feature vec- 
tor of the one-hot_encoding model is four times larger than that of the 
binary_encoding model (1500 against 375). The data dimensionality is- 
sue may prove to be crucial should we analyze longer proteins instead 
of shorter peptides. The one-hot encoding scheme might also prove to 
be infeasible for long sequences and small datasets, as the number of 
features might exceed the number of observations. Furthermore, taking 
into consideration that Fig. 5 suggests that the binary_encoding model 
produces probabilities similar to the ones of the one-hot_encoding model, 
we conclude that the binary encoding scheme can function as a viable, 
sustainable, and well-performing alternative to the one-hot encoding 
technique in the context of AMP prediction. 
Another noticeable trend is that the combination of the physico- 
chemical and sequence encoding features undeniably leads to better 
results. The PC_one-hot model displayed better performance than the in- 
dividualistic phys-chem and one-hot_encoding models by margins of 4.4% 
and 0.9%. Analogously, the PC_binary model has outperformed phys- 
chem and binary_encoding models by 3.4%. This leads us to deduce that 
the peptide’s physico-chemical descriptors and the amino acid order- 
ing information both have an important role in the classiﬁcation of 
peptides. 
Finally, we have made an eﬀort to combine the predictions of the 
contrasting methods to guide the models towards the improvement of 
the recall, precision, and fall-out metrics. The logical disjunctions of the 
phys-chem model and the sequence-based models create the add_comb 
approaches which produce a larger set of potentially antimicrobial pep- 
tides. More in vitro testing candidates are produced, inevitably leading 
to a larger number of false positives as well. On the other hand, the 
multi_comb approach is based on the logical conjunction of the models. 
This method produces a smaller set of candidates that make it into the 
in vitro testing phase, but the ones that are to be tested in vitro have a 
higher chance of actually having antimicrobial properties. This method 
of prediction aggregation can be used to reduce the number of false pos- 
itives, which enables the faster discovery of new antimicrobial peptides 
during in vitro testing. 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper, we have explored the usage of diﬀerent methods for 
the numerical representation of peptides with the goal of developing 
machine learning models that are able to diﬀerentiate between antimi- 
crobial and non-antimicrobial peptides. We point out the characteristics, 
advantages, and disadvantages of each of the representation method- 
ologies, namely the physico-chemical descriptors, one-hot and binary 
encoding and their combinations. We emphasize the importance of us- 
ing the calculated physico-chemical descriptors of the peptides together 
with the encoded amino acid sequences to preserve both the intrinsic 
chemical properties, as well as the amino acid ordering information, 
through the implementation of combined encoding strategies that uti- 
lize both of the aforesaid feature generation techniques. Furthermore, 
with the goal of reducing the number of false positives generated by the 
prediction models, we propose workﬂows that combine the predicted 
outputs of the diverging methods. Our case study showed that the pro- 
posed combined encoding models and hybrid models outperform the 
single encoding models in every evaluation metric. The performance of 
single models on the permutation set has demonstrated that the physico- 
chemical features are insensitive to shifting amino acids within a se- 
quence, which justiﬁes the usage of combined and hybrid models. Fi- 
nally, comparing the one-hot encoding and binary encoding methods, 
we argue that binary encoding acts as an eﬀective alternative to one- 
hot encoding, while introducing a performance-dimensionality trade- 
oﬀ. The binary encoding method produces results which are inferior to 
the ones of the one-hot encoding method, but with the advantage of 
reducing the data dimensionality by 75%. 
This paper also advocates the importance of analyzing the perfor- 
mance of predictive models from the expert’s point of view, in the 
sense that false positive predictions of high conﬁdence are more costly 
than the false negative ones because the former ones may lead to un- 
necessary experimental expense. To achieve the aim of minimizing the 
false positive rate, we propose hybrid models named multi_comb_1 and 
multi_comb_2 that require both the physico-chemical descriptors-based 
model and the one-hot encoding-based model to agree on declaring a 
peptide as positive. The results have shown that this methodology is 
superior to other single models by a factor of 1.82 to 2.96 in terms of 
fall-out. It also exhibits the improvement of precision between 3.3 and 
6.1%.
