Abstract 
The Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, or WiMax, is a wireless communication technique based on IEEE 
802.16 standards. Its advantage of sending high-data rates over long distances, while using a single base station to cover a 
large area, has made this technique a flexible and reliable solution for public wireless networks. In this paper, a current-
bleeding Gilbert Cell down-converter mixer is proposed for WiMax direct-conversion receivers. With 5.1 dB of 
conversion gain, 1.5 dBm of IIP3, 36 dBm of IIP2 as well as 11.6dB and 8.4dB of single sideband and double sideband 
noise figure, respectively, the proposed 0.15mm InGaAspHEMT mixer largely meets the WiMax standards as 
demonstrated though successful comparison with published designs.

1. Introduction 
The ever-increasing demand for secured high-speed high-data rates communication links, preferably 
accessible through laptops and smartphones via wireless connections, is making the Worldwide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access, or WiMax, one of the most promising technologies to explore. 
Furthermore, WiMax systems can cover long distance areas with fewer base stations compared to other 
wireless technologies, thus involving lower costs in maintenance, operation, and management (J. Malleket al.,

2010). In WiMax technologies, the most widely-used RF transceiver is the Direct-Conversion Architecture 
mainly because of its high level of integration and less component requirements, leading to reduced power 
dissipation (Huanget al., 2007; Antonopouloset al., 2008; Atallahet al., 2007). 
In a WiMax receiver, the down converter mixer is one of the most important devices to consider. 
Depending on the desired performance, various parameter objectives should be targeted while designing a 
mixer, such as high conversion gain, 1dB compression point (P-1dB), port-to-port isolation, input second-
order intercept point (IIP2) and input third-order intercept point (IIP3) as well as low noise figure (NF) and 
voltage supply. In practice, these parameters cannot be achieved simultaneously. So, based on design 
constraints and standard specifications, different mixer types and topologies can be considered.  
However, the Gilbert-cell down converter mixer is one of the most suitable for WiMax applications (Wei 
et al., 2010;Hsiao et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2010). In fact, The Gilbert-cell mixer exhibits major advantages over 
single and single-balanced mixers due to inherent port isolation, relatively high gain, moderate linearity, and 
efficient cancellation of even-order harmonic distortion. 
In the last few years, significant work has been done to improve the Gilbert cell mixer performance, 
leading to folded mixers, current reuse mixers, and current bleeding mixers. In this paper, a current-bleeding 
Gilbert Cell down-converter mixer is proposed for WiMax direct-conversion receivers. The design was 
achieved using the 0.15mm InGaAspHEMT technology processfrom Win Semiconductor Crop.0. With 5.1 
dB of conversion gain, 1.5 dBm of IIP3, 36 dBm of IIP2 as well as 11.6dB and 8.4dB of single sideband and 
double sideband noise figure, respectively, the proposed mixer largely meets the WiMax standards as 
demonstrated though successful comparison with published designs. 
2. Proposed Mixer Design 
Gilbert cell mixers are widespread utilized due to their high port isolation, excellent gain, and cancellation 
of all even harmonics. However, they require staking more transistors leading to more bias supply and power 
dissipation as well as poorer noise figure and linearity (Krcmaret al., 2007;Su et al., 2008). Therefore, some 
techniques have been proposed to enhance the conventional Gilbert cell mixer performance, leading to folded 
mixers, current reuse mixers, and current bleeding mixers (Krcmaret al., 2007;Su et al., 2008; Karanicolas, 
1996; Lin et al., 2006). 
In this work, the current bleeding technique has been retained as a suitable tool to improve the mixer 
response. In the proposed design (Fig. 1), the RF signal is applied to the gate of the differential transistors 
(M1 and M2). Such configuration produces relatively constant gain, cancels the even harmonics, and converts 
the M1 and M2 RF input signal voltage to output current. The LO signal is applied to M3-M6. These 
transistors operate near pinch-off region in order to accomplish the multiplication of the RF amplified signal 
with the LO signal.  
A current mirror stage (M9 and M10) provides the required current for the circuit. Finally, two source 
follower buffers (M7 and M8) areadded to match the IF+/IF- outputs with baluns. 
In order to get high conversion gain, the RF transistors should be larger than the LO transistors. On the 
other side, large size transistors increase DC and LO power consumption.  
Therefore, a current bleeding block (R1 and R2) was added to M1 and M2 to enhance the conversion gain 
by increasing the current in the RF stage. This current should be enough to operate M1 and M2 in the 
saturation region while reducing the current in the LO stage; therefore, the voltage is dropped in the load 
resistors R6 and R7.(Tsai et al., 2007;Khyet al., 2010; Wuet al., 2010). 
The transistor is sized based on minimum noise figure, power consumption and maximum frequency, i.e., 
2×25 μm. Moreover, such small transistor size provides the ability to apply the current bleeding to reduce the 
circuit voltage.

3. Results 
The mixer design, achieved in the commercial circuit simulator Agilent-
InGaAspHEMT technology process provided by Win Semiconductor Crop.0. A link budget was performed to 
deduce the desired specifications for the down-converter mixer to be designed (Table 1). The simulator was 
set up for input signal frequency from 3.493 to 3.507 GHz and LO signal frequency of 3.5 GHz in order to get 
the IF output frequency of 7 MHz. As seen in Fig. 2 (a) an optimum LO power of -3 dBm allows reaching the 
highest conversion gain value, i.e., 7.3 dB.  
However, as displayed in Fig. 2 (b), the above LO power gives a relatively high single sideband noise 
figure of around 10 dB. Therefore, as compromise, we selected a LO power of 0 dBm, corresponding to a 
conversion gain of about 6 dB and a noise figure of 9.3 dB for single side band and 6 dB for double sideband, 
respectively. Figure 3 shows an IIP3 of 1 dBm while the IIP2 was found to be 39 dBm.
