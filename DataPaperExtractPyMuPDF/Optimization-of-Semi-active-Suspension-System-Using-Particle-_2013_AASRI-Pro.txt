1. Introduction 
The main function of a suspension system is to provide the shock absorption in automobiles. Besides 
carrying the weight of the vehicle, it attempts to minimize or eliminate vibrations that may be induced by a 
variety of sources including road surface irregularities, aerodynamics forces and non-uniformity of the 
tire/wheel assembly [1]. The development of electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR) fluids has 
materialized the manufacturing of controllable dampers. The use of active and semi-active suspensions has 
increased because the passive suspension systems cannot meet the conflicting requirements [2]. 
During the last decades, fuzzy logic has implemented very fast since the first paper in fuzzy set theory, 
which is now considered to be the seminal paper of the subject, was written by Zadeh [3], who is considered 
the founding father of the field. Mamdani [4] developed Zadeh`s work and demonstrated the application of 
Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) for a small model steam engine. It is difficult to control the parameters of the 
fuzzy logic control system through manual procedure. Therefore, important scaling factors are tuned by means 
of an appropriate optimization technique.  Particle swarm optimization (PSO) method performs better in terms 
of convergence and computation time. This technique has been widely used in engineering problems [5]. 
This paper presents quarter car passive and semi-active suspension systems modeled in Simulink. The 
inputs and output of optimized fuzzy logic controller are normalized and gain factors are incorporated in the 
system. The gain factors are evaluated by performing off-line tuning method using PSO technique. Based on 
the optimized parameters, the maximum output of the damper is selected. Various models are designed on the 
basis of various control algorithms. All the models are compared for road handling and ride comfort. Section 2 
describes modeling of the systems along with the implementation of PSO technique. Section 3 discusses the 
simulation results while Section 4 presents the conclusion.  
2. Modeling of Systems  
This section explains the modeling of systems. The block diagram of PSO tuned fuzzy logic control system 
is described in Fig. 1.

2.1. Quarter Car Parameters and Road Profile 
The quarter car model has two degrees of freedom. In order to simulate the systems, quarter car parameters 
have been taken from reference data [6]. Road disturbance profile comprising a pulse is modeled for carrying 
out a comparison between passive and fuzzy logic based suspension systems as shown in Fig. 2.

2.2. Optimized Fuzzy Logic Controller 
For a semi-active suspension model, the damping coefficient needs to be varied. In order to incorporate the 
modulation of damping coefficient, a fuzzy logic controller is incorporated in the design scheme. 
Fuzzification interface, fuzzy rule base, decision making logic and defuzzification interface are the main 
blocks of a fuzzy logic system.. 
Fuzzification involves transformation of crisp values into linguistic variables that are further manipulated 
by fuzzy rule base and decision making process. Defuzzification transforms the linguistic variables back to 
crisp values that are fed into the plant again. In current research, the proposed fuzzy logic controller takes two 
inputs; relative displacement and relative velocity, while output of the controller is desired damping 
coefficient. Each of the inputs comprises three membership functions; N (triangular), Z (singleton) and P 
(triangular), while the output variable consists of three membership functions; S (triangular), M (Gaussian) 
and L (triangular). 
Based on the three membership functions of each input variable, a total of nine rules are formulated. All 
the input and output variables have been normalized having ranges of [-1,1] and [0,1] respectively. Mamdani 
inference system is selected employing centroid defuzzification method. 
2.3. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 
PSO is a bio-inspired technique based on the behavior exhibited by swarms of birds and schools of fish. 
The algorithm searches through an n-dimensional problem in order to optimize an objective function. The 
163

strength of this technique is attributed to its relative simplicity and better convergence to reasonable solutions 
with avoidance of local minima. The swarm comprises a fixed number of particles that develop a 
collaborative search of an optimal solution. 
Each particle optimizes a set of three scaling factors; A, B and C. Libest indicates the best known position 
for each particle while Gbest denotes the corresponding best known position for the complete swarm. The 
position of each particle (pi) is updated by velocity (vi) in the k+1 iteration, as given by (1) and (2).

3. Simulation Results and Discussion 
This section describes the simulation results followed by a detailed discussion. The fuzzy logic controller 
is designed in Matlab Fuzzy Tool Box while simulations are performed in Simulink. The PSO algorithm is 
programmed in Matlab and executed to determine the three optimized gain factors. Parameters used for PSO 
algorithm are described in Table 1.

3.1. Systems based on Various Control Algorithms 
In order to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy logic based semi-active suspension systems, fuzzy based 
skyhook, groundhook and hybrid systems have been developed and simulated. The skyhook system is based 
on the strategy of minimizing the vibrations of suspension, groundhook system controls the vibrations 
experienced by the tire and the hybrid system is designed on the combined strategies of both the systems. 
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 depict the performance results of various systems based on control algorithms in response 
to pulse road disturbance. Tire displacement is a good indicator of road handling while suspension 
displacement is a measure of ride comfort.

Values of important performance parameters of various control algorithms have been tabulated in Table 2 
in relation to pulse road disturbance. The shaded values indicate percent overshoot while the non-shaded 
values indicate the stabilizing time expressed in seconds. Furthermore, top two values in each grid relate to 
the initial disturbance and the bottom ones correspond to the second part of the disturbance.

Shaded cells indicate percentage overshoot 
Unshaded cells indicate stabilizing time in seconds 
The optimized fuzzy system outperforms all other systems in the domain of suspension displacement. 
There is no overshoot and the system gets stabilized rapidly in relation to other systems in comparison. 
Therefore, the optimized fuzzy system gives the best ride comfort among all the control algorithms. Passive 
system does not stabilize at all in case of suspension displacement. Fuzzy hybrid combines the strategies of 
skyhook and groundhook control algorithms. In terms of tire displacement, the best stabilizing time periods 
are depicted by the optimized fuzzy logic system while groundhook offers the minimum percent overshoot. 
However, optimized fuzzy system is still comparable with the groundhook system in vehicle handling. 
4. Conclusion 
The paper has demonstrated successful application of hybrid artificial intelligence techniques in designing 
a semi-active suspension system. Both passive and semi-active suspension systems have been modeled in 
Simulink. The input and output membership functions of optimized fuzzy system have been normalized 
because of the incorporation of scaling factors. The performance of optimized fuzzy logic controlled system is 
much better in comparison with the passive system and other control schemes in terms of road handling and 
ride comfort.
