Abstract 
This paper make the explained variables our financial stress index consist of the synchronous variables financial systemic 
risk, and make the explanatory variables the macroeconomic variable, currency credit variable, asset price variable and the 
macroeconomic variable of correlative economic powers, then use stepwise regression method to establish the financial 
systemic risk best predict equation, thus set up the reasonable and practical financial systemic risk early-warning index 
system; besides, use the best prediction equations predicts the financial systemic risk status in 2011. The predicted results 
show that Chinese financial systemic risk is on the rise in the first three quarters and higher than the peak of 2008; 
financial systemic risk start to decline since the fourth quarter.

1. Introduction. 
Financial security is the core of the national economic security, and ensuring financial security that is the 
core of financial risk prevention and control. Financial risk early-warning mainly analyses and forecasts the 
possibility of the financial assets loss and the damage of the financial system in the financial operation 
process.

But what the financial risk really terrible is that it not only influences the current, it will also produce the 
subsequent effect in the after-operation. And the current domestic and foreign research seldom considers that 
these factors will have a lagging effect in financial risk. 
So, based on the research about the factors which have the hysteresis effect in financial risk both at home 
and abroad, this paper restudies the issue, ensure the hysteresis factors which have significant influence in 
financial risk. This paper aims to put forward a kind of early-warning model considering the hysteresis factors, 
raise the connection between the financial risk and hysteresis factors, make the model researched from the 
analysis of hysteresis factors, and improve the accuracy of forecasting the financial risk. 
2. Regional financial risk factors 
2.1 Regional financial risk factors analysis. 
Regional financial risk that not only influenced by the external factors, but also be restricted by specific 
economic environments and market structure in this area. Imbalance development in regional economy and 
finance will make the financial risk having a strong regional characteristic. Otherwise, the resistance ability to 
local risk of regional finance is weaker; the local financial turmoil could trigger regional financial crisis and 
even national financial crisis. 
However, financial risk factors operate with an obvious lag. Regional financial crisis would produce a 
lagging effect of impact and influence to the whole financial system and the substantial economy.  
So the article chooses the factors which produce a lagging effect to the regional financial to have index 
analysis, and based on this to construct a regional financial risk early-warning model integrating lagging 
factors’ return.  
2.2 Regional financial risk factors’ index design. 
Regional financial crisis exists diffusivity, the regional financial crisis would cause wholesale financial 
crisis, even the global financial crisis. This financial crisis caused by America’s subprime crisis evolves from 
part to entire word, transmits from the developed countries to the emerging market countries and developing 
countries, and spreads from the financial territory to the substantial economy territory.  
Economic growth has enormous influence to the financial crisis, and we often use economic monetized 
degree to measure a country’s economic development level. 
According to our country’s commonly used method at present, namely using the method M2 (generalized 
currency)/GDP to show the economic monetized index. We could calculation the result as following:  
Table 1.  Chinese economic monetized index

Source: established according to phases of “China Statistical Yearbook” and “1999 China Statistics 
Bulletin”. 
From the calculated results, we see that along with the rapid development of the economy, Chinese 
economic monetized growth situation was very significant, in other words, currency relations as a form of 
economic relations has got a fair degree of deepening and generalization in our country. 
M2 not only reflect the reality purchasing power, but also reflect the underlying purchasing power. We 
commonly use DM2 (generalized currency growth rate) to measure M2. 
Another important content of economic growth is foreign trade. Foreign trade is the core of various 
countries’ foreign economic relations, which plays an irreplaceable role in the economic development of all 
countries. Import and export trade’s balance of payments of a country is the important part of current account 
in its international payments; it is also the significant factor which could affect countries’ balance of payments. 
Foreign trade multiplier theory of Keynesian economics suggests that exports produce double 
aggrandized effect to national income and output, and the imports produce double shrank effect to its national 
income. The scale of the trade balance would eventually affect the economic development in China, and then 
influence the financial risk indirectly. 
In addition to factors related to the economic growth, banking, estate and other factors might also have a 
lagging effect in financial risk. The expansion of the commercial banks’ credit would accumulate bigger risk, 
the impact of small financial crisis would make the centralized outbreak of the borrowers’ credit risk, it also 
could make the problems about the increasing uncertainty risk of estate market’s development completely 
exposed. 
Meanwhile, the international oil price, the economic growth and the deposit interest margin that trading 
close with China will also have a certain effect in financial risk condition. 
3. Regional financial risk early-warning model 
3.1 Financial risk early-warning model analysis.  
Due to the factors that influence the financial risk have obvious lagging, we could first build up a general 
regression model with a lag dependent variable. 
Considering about diffusivity of regional financial risk, so this paper we choose our comprehensive 
index of financial systemic risk, namely Financial Stress Index of China(CFSI in short),to be the explained 
variable in the financial risk early-warning model. 
The first to propose the concept of financial stress and construct financial stress index is the economists 
Illing and Liu in Canadian Bank. According to the description of Illing and Liu (2003):”Financial stress is a 
continuous variable, its extremum is called financial crisis”. The financial stress will increase with the 
increase of expect financial loss, risk or uncertainty. 
According to the lagging-influence factors of financial risk and referring to the literatures, the 
explanatory variables are eventually determined: CFSI lagging variables (AR (K)), GDP (GDP), GDP growth 
(DGDP), economic monetized degree (MRATE), broad money growth rate (DM2), balance of trade 
(TRADEBASA), 
the 
bank 
credit 
balance

country(SODCSA), 
Chinese 
estate 
price 
index(HOUSEPINDEX), international crude oil prices rate(OIL), Japanese GDP growth rate(JPDGDP), the 
one-year deposit spreads between China and the United States(DR). 
3.2 The established of the financial risk early-warning model.  
According to the explanatory variables, the explained variables and the correlation between the indexes, 
431
 KeNa Zhu et al. /  AASRI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  428 – 434 
we optimize the regression model:  
In formula (1), CFSIt-k represent CFSI lagging K issue, Xt-ki represent other explanatory lagging K 
issue. Through the stepwise regression analysis, using T-test, R2-test, DW test, AIC information judgment 
and others, choosing the best combination of variables and the optimal forecasting equation. The statistics test 
indexes in the equation are the best. In 5 percent of the significant level, all explanatory variables have passed 
the T-test; the goodness-of-fit of the equation is higher, R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are 0.970219 and 
0.949745, parameter sequence is smooth. According to the results of the table below, we can get the following 
best prediction equation of the financial stress index: 
CFSIt=38.65159+0.421267AR�4�+0.43508DGDPt-4+0.39413HOUSEPINDEXt-4-4.745299OILt-4

Table 2 The regression results of best prediction model in Chinese financial stress 
4. Experimental analysis.  
Using the Eviews software, we can check out the actual value, prediction and residual of our financial 
stress exponent, and compare the relation between actual value and prediction of our financial stress exponent 
from 2004 to 2010, the table is below: 
432  
 KeNa Zhu et al. /  AASRI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  428 – 434 
Figure 1 The actual value and predictive value of our financial pressure exponent 
Figure 1 shows the relation between the actual value and predicitive value in our financial stress 
exponent from 2004 to 2010, seeing from the figure, the two values are highly anastomotic. Visibly,the 
accuracy of the prediction equation is quite satisfactory. 
Through the search of literature, we can obtain the data of the explanatory variables in 2011, the 
following Table 3 
Attention: the data of 2011 is the first half year, the growth is also the year-on-year increase 
Now we use the equation (3), taking the data above inside, and then forecast our financial stress in 2011. 
The result is available: 
Table 4: The Predicted value of CFSI in 2011 
The result shows that in 2011, the financial stress exponents are all higher than the highest since 2002, 
namely the financial stress is greater than the four seasons in 2008. In the first three quarters in 2011, our 
financial stress exponents will keep growing, the third quarter will achieve the maximum 20.96625, and the 
financial stress will have the trend of decline since the last quarter of 2011. Table 4 shows that we use the 
equation (2) and get the four quarters’ predictive value of our financial stress exponents in 2011. Figure 2 
reveal the trend of annual financial stress exponents’ prediction in our country. 
433

Figure 2: The trend of our financial stress exponents’ prediction 
The regression result shows that the GDP growth, real estate price index, broad money growth, the credit 
balance, the balance of international trade will have positive influence in financial stress exponents, and the 
price of crude oil rate of change, SUMGDP, the ratio of broad money and GDP, the one-year deposit spreads 
between China and the United States and Japanese GDP growth will have negative influence. Due to the 
collinearity existed between the explanatory variables; the consistent of the explanatory variables may not 
correspond to the actual situation. But, the collinearity will not affect the explanatory variables as a general 
CFSI to the predictive result. 
5. Conclusion 
On the basis of the research of Illing and Liu (2003), this paper ensure the measure index of financial risk 
by the financial stress exponents constructing by synchronization index of financial risk, confirm the 
explanatory variables the financial stress exponent itself and the economic and financial index having 
prescience, and then with the aid of empirical methods to construct the financial stress index early-warning 
model. The model shows that the explanatory variables lagging four quarters (there are two variables were 
lagging six quarters and eight quarters) can better fitting our financial pressure exponent trend. That is, 
according to the known current financial stress exponent and other value of explanatory variables, we can use 
the model to predict the financial stress exponents of the future four quarters. 
Financial stress exponent CFSI can accurately measure our financial systemic risk; the corresponding 
explanatory variables can also be obtained timely and accurately. Indeed, the best prediction equations of the 
financial systemic risk or the financial systemic risk early- warning system is simple and easy to the financial 
systemic risk prediction, and has great practical value.
