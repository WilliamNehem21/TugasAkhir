The agrochemical application with conventional sprayers results in wastage of applied chemicals, which not only
increases the economic losses but also pollutes the environment. In order to overcome these drawbacks, an
image processing based real-time variable-rate chemical spraying system was developed for the precise applica-
tion of agrochemicals in diseased paddy crop based on crop disease severity information. The developed system
comprised of web cameras for image acquisition, laptop for image processing, microcontroller for controlling the
system functioning, and solenoid valve assisted spraying nozzles. The chromatic aberration (CA) based image
segmentation method was used to detect the diseased region of paddy plants. The system further calculated
the disease severity level of paddy plants, based on which the solenoid valves remained on for a speciﬁc time du-
ration so that the required amount of agrochemical could be sprayed on the diseased paddy plants. Field perfor-
mance of developed sprayer prototype was evaluated in the variable-rate application (VRA) and constant-rate
application (CRA) modes. The ﬁeld testing results showed a minimum 33.88% reduction in applied chemical
while operating in the VRA mode as compared with the CRA mode. Hence, the developed system appears prom-
ising and could be used extensively to reduce the cost of pest management as well as to control environmental
pollution due to such agrochemicals.

1. Introduction
Pest management is an essential part of the crop cultivation cycle for
better crop yield. The conventional sprayers apply the agrochemicals at
a uniform rate, which leads to excessive, injudicious, and less effective
utilization of applied chemicals. This uniform spraying results in wast-
age of applied chemicals and ﬁnally increases the cost of disease control.
The extended amount of applied chemicals pollutes the environment
and adversely affects the health of agricultural workers and food con-
sumers. Besides, it also results in the development of heritable resis-
tance in pests against pesticides (Park et al., 2007). The intervention of
advanced technologies such as sensors, microcontrollers, and software
tools in agriculture, allow the precise use of the applied chemical by reg-
ulating the application rate according to the site-speciﬁc requirement.
This method is called the variable-rate application (VRA), and it can sig-
niﬁcantly reduce the amount of applied chemicals and the cost of dis-
ease control.
In a variable-rate application system, the application rate of input
chemical could be varied using either the map-based approach or
sensor-based approach. In the map-based approach, a preset site-
speciﬁc map of desired properties is used to control the application
rate. While, in the case of a sensor-based approach, the information of
desired properties is collected on-the-go using sensors, and the applica-
tion rate is regulated according to the processed information. However,
the suitability of these approaches mainly depends on the nature and
objectives of a particular site-speciﬁc farming task. In general, the
map-based approach is preferred for the properties that almost remain
the same for an extended period or change quite slowly, such as organic
matter and soil texture. On the other hand, the sensor-based approach is
preferred for the quickly changing soil properties and crop characteris-
tics (Ess et al., 2001).
In the case of variable-rate chemical spraying for plant disease con-
trol, the map-based approach is not practically appropriate, as the dis-
eases spread across the whole ﬁeld very rapidly. Hence, the accuracy
of sample data and the derived disease maps are time-sensitive, which
means that the disease distribution may have changed by the time the
map is prepared. These maps are also not readily available to make
timely decisions on disease control, mainly due to the laborious and
time consuming conventional visual plant disease estimation methods
(Dammer et al., 2008). Moreover, the operational performance of the
map-based variable-rate spraying system is affected by the accuracy of
positioning devices, which is not the case with the sensor-based ap-
proach. In the sensor-based approach, no additional costs for labor

and data management are required. Tackenberg et al. (2018) also em-
phasized that the detection of crop disease and spraying should be per-
formed in one single real-time working cycle, due to the fast-
propagating nature of the pathogens. Therefore, the sensor-based
variable-rate chemical application is preferred for disease control tasks.
So far, very few studies related to the variable-rate chemical applica-
tion for plant disease control have been reported. Dammer and Ehlert
(2006) developed and tested a real-time variable-rate fungicides
spraying system for disease control in cereal crops. They used CROP-
Meter (Ehlert et al., 2003) as a target detection sensor. This sensor signal
was linearly correlated with the leaf area index; hence, the input chem-
ical application rate was adjusted according to the leaf area index
values. However, in the decision making for variable-rate chemical ap-
plication, the heterogeneous distribution of plant diseases within the
ﬁeld was not taken into consideration, and the applied chemical appli-
cation rate was varied according to the leaf area index instead of the dis-
ease distribution. Moreover, the Crop-Meter sensor always remained in
contact with the crop while spraying, which could be more difﬁcult to
operate as compared to the non-contact type on-the-go target detection
sensors.
The image processing technique with the real-time machine vision
system is one of the most commonly used on-the-go target detection
methods for variable-rate spraying. Its high precision, quick response,
and low input cost are made it more popular and widely acceptable in
the area of agricultural automation. In the past, this target detection
method was extensively used in various real-time variable-rate
spraying systems for site-speciﬁc pest management, but most studies
were focused on the herbicide application for weed control (Tian,
2002; Gerhards and Christensen, 2003; Gerhards and Oebel, 2006;
Tangwongkit et al., 2006; Bossu et al., 2008; Tewari et al., 2014;
Dammer, 2016; Chandel et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Özlüoymak et al.,
2019; Partel et al., 2019; Rehman et al., 2019). The image processing
technique was also well-applied in several crop disease detection stud-
ies (Tucker and Chakraborty, 1997; Sena Jr et al., 2003; Dammer et al.,
2011; Patil and Bodhe, 2011; Barbedo, 2014; Barbedo et al., 2016;
Singh and Misra, 2017; Schor et al., 2017), but most of these studies
were conducted in laboratory conditions.
In recent years, some studies related to the image processing based
precision spraying system for crop disease management have been re-
ported. Esau et al. (2014) developed a machine vision-based variable-
rate sprayer for spot-application of fungicide in wild blueberry ﬁelds.
The developed system differentiated the bare spots from foliage (wild
blueberry plants and weeds) in real-time using the image processing
technique, and the chemical was sprayed only over the foliage portion.
Oberti et al. (2016) tested an agricultural robot equipped with
precision-spraying end-effector and machine vision-based disease-
sensing system for spot spraying over the diseased grapevine canopy
area. The testing results showed the reduction in pesticide use from
65% to 85% as compared to conventional homogeneous spraying of the
canopy. Tackenberg et al. (2016) developed a camera sensor-based
variable-rate fungicide spraying system for the wheat crop. In this
study, the disease variability across the ﬁeld was not taken into consid-
eration for variable-rate fungicide spraying; instead, the chemical appli-
cation rate was varied according to the sensor measured green coverage
level. Berenstein and Edan (2017) designed a human-robot collabora-
tive sprayer for site-speciﬁc spraying of grape cluster targets. They de-
veloped
a
target
detection
algorithm
based
on
simple
color
thresholding and implemented that algorithm using Matlab software
for detecting the artiﬁcial custom targets for spraying. The test results
revealed that the developed spraying system reduced the quantity of
sprayed material by 50%. Samseemoung et al. (2017) developed and
tested an image processing based variable-rate chemical sprayer
assisted with a remote monitoring system for disease and pest-
infested coconut plantations. They developed an image processing algo-
rithm to estimate disease density, and the corresponding required
amount of chemical was applied to the target area.
The above literature reviews show that the image processing tech-
nique with necessary electronic hardware and spraying system could
be successfully employed for variable-rate spraying of agrochemicals
in diseased crops. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop an
image processing technique based real-time variable-rate chemical
spraying system for ensuring the precise use of input chemical based
on the plant disease severity level. In order to achieve this goal, the pres-
ent study was carried out under the following speciﬁc objectives (1) To
develop an image processing algorithm for real-time estimation of plant
disease severity level. (2) To develop a variable-rate spraying system for
the precise application of agrochemicals based on plant disease severity.
(3) To evaluate the performance of the developed variable-rate chemi-
cal spraying system in ﬁeld conditions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Variable-rate chemical sprayer prototype
The variable-rate chemical sprayer prototype was designed and de-
veloped for agrochemical application in two crop rows simultaneously.
The prototype comprised of two web cameras (Logitech Pro 9000) for
image acquisition in each row, a Laptop (4GB RAM, Intel Core i5 CPU,
and Windows 8 operating system) for image processing; a 5 L plastic
tank for chemical storage purpose; a pump; two 12 VDC normally
closed solenoid valves; two spray nozzles; two relay switches; a prox-
imity sensor; an Arduino Uno microcontroller board; and a battery. All
of these components were assembled on a manually operated cart for
pesticide application in paddy ﬁelds. The developed variable-rate chem-
ical sprayer prototype is shown in Fig. 1.
In this prototype, cameras were mounted on the telescopic arrange-
ment to adjust their position according to the height of target plants and
connected to the laptop through 1.5 m long USB 2.0 cables. The sprayer
prototype was equipped with two hollow cone nozzles, one for each
row. The cameras were positioned 0.25 m in front of the spray nozzles
to compensate the time lag between the image acquisition and the
real-time spraying of agrochemicals. A 12 VDC ﬁxed displacement
pump was provided to maintain the ﬂow of liquid inside supply tubes.
The solenoid valves were placed upstream side of the individual spray
nozzle to control the applied amount of input chemical by remaining
open for a speciﬁc time duration when needed. An Arduino Uno micro-
controller board was used to control all sensors and actuators. One 12
VDC relay switch was provided to ON/OFF each solenoid valve according
to the control signal received through the microcontroller. A 12 VDC op-
erated inductive type proximity sensor was installed on the ground
wheel of the developed prototype to sense the traveled distance and
triggers the image acquisition units to capture the new images. Power
supply to the entire system was provided with the help of a 12 VDC
Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) battery.
2.2. Estimation of paddy plant disease severity using image processing
technique
In the present study, the white-tip disease (Aphelenchoides
besseyi Christie), which is one of the most common diseases of
paddy with visually distinct foliar symptoms, was taken into consid-
eration. The characteristic symptoms of white tip disease appear
after tillering, and leaf tips become chlorotic or whitened for a length
of up to 5 cm (Elazegui and Islam, 2003). The web cameras, provided
in each row, captured the RGB images of paddy plants with the image
resolution of 640 × 480 pixels. In order to protect the image scenes
against direct sunlight and minimize the chromatic color changes
during the image acquisition in the ﬁeld, both the image scene and
the image acquisition device were provided with the covering of
green cloth. In the past, several researchers applied the similar ap-
proach to minimize the effect of varying natural illumination condi-
tions in the ﬁeld during image capturing (Aggelopoulou et al., 2011;
22
V.K. Tewari et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 21–30
Ahmed et al., 2012; Haug et al., 2014; Mahmud et al., 2019). The
green color background also avoids false detection and minimizes
the noises in the image capturing area and allows an accurate seg-
mentation of the region of interest. All the images of paddy plants
used for algorithm development were captured between 7.30 AM
to 10.00 AM on 9th March 2018 in paddy research farm at the agri-
cultural and food engineering department, IIT Kharagpur, India. The
light illumination values inside the covered area were recorded
using a digital lux meter (Metravi 1334, Metravi Instruments Pvt.
Ltd., India), which were varied from 270 lx to 400 lx. The captured
paddy crop images were subjected to a series of image processing
steps for plant disease detection and real-time estimation of plant
disease severity level. The Image Processing Toolbox of MATLAB
R2014b software was utilized for real-time image processing.
2.2.1. Plant diseased area segmentation based on chromatic aberration
(CA) method
In the present study, a chromatic aberration (CA) based color image
segmentation algorithm was developed for detecting the diseased re-
gion in paddy crop. The proposed image segmentation algorithm
consisted of three steps, i.e., color component extraction and analysis,
selection of characteristic operator, and thresholding segmentation
(Hu et al., 2009).
Color component extraction and analysis: Initially, the red (R),
green (G), and blue (B) components of the lesion region, healthy re-
gion, and background were extracted from the original captured RGB
image and plotted in the form of box-plot, as shown in Fig. 2. From
this ﬁgure, it can be observed that the R and G pixel values of the
lesion region are signiﬁcantly different from that of the healthy re-
gion and background. Hence, the RGB color space model can be
used for differentiating the diseased region from the healthy region
and background.
Selection of characteristic operator: Based on the above information,
the various combinations of R, G, and B components were tested to
identify the white tip disease of the paddy plants. Finally, a CA equation
(Eq. (1)) was found most suitable for differentiating the lesion region
from the healthy region and background.

where CA is chromatic aberration value; R denotes red component in
RGB color space; G denotes green component in RGB color space; and
B denotes blue component in RGB color space.
The CA values of the lesion region, healthy region, and background,
which were calculated using Eq. (1), are shown in Fig. 3. From this ﬁg-
ure, an apparent deviation of CA values of the lesion region can be ob-
served from that of the healthy region and background. Hence, the
lesion region could be successfully segmented from the healthy region
and background based on its CA values.
Thresholding segmentation: In this step, the captured RGB image
was converted into a binary image using the color threshold method
by selecting a suitable threshold value (T) of the CA. In order to seg-
ment the lesion region from the healthy region and the background,
an appropriate threshold value of the CA, i.e., T = 0, was chosen from
Fig. 3, as the overlapping of CA values of lesion region and healthy

ation based segmentation function is deﬁned as follows:

where, T is the threshold value of chromatic aberration, and f(x,y) is the
value of the pixel (x,y) in the ﬁnal binary image obtained after implemen-
tation of the color thresholding technique. In the binary image, the white
color portion (the pixel value is 1) represents the lesion region, and the
black color portion (the pixel value is 0) represents the healthy region
and background.
2.2.2. Plant disease severity estimation
In order to determine the required amount of input chemical and for
making the spraying decisions, the disease severity of the paddy plants
needs to be observed. The disease severity is deﬁned as the disease in-
fected area of a sampling unit (leaf or plant surface) and expressed as a
percentage or proportion of the total area (Nutter Jr et al., 1991). Thus,
by utilizing the image processing approach, the disease severity of
paddy leaves was given by the ratio of total pixels of the diseased region
to the total pixels of leaves region and computed using Eq. (3)
(Weizheng et al., 2008).

The ﬂowchart of the developed image processing algorithm for the

paddy crop image and corresponding obtained binary image after
color thresholding are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. The
whole leaf area was determined by altering the contrast value of the
RGB image and then segmenting the region of interest, as shown in
Fig. 5(c) and (d).
2.3. Decision-making algorithm for variable-rate chemical application
In common pest management practices, the agrochemicals are
sprayed uniformly throughout the ﬁeld at the recommended dos-
ages (L/ha), mentioned on the product label, for crop disease control.
These recommended dosages usually have a high efﬁcacy even if the
weather conditions are favorable for disease spread, and the same
degree of disease control could be achieved with a lower dosage in
case of low crop disease pressure present at the time of spraying
(Dammer and Ehlert, 2006). In the decision-making algorithm ap-
plied in this study, the required chemical application rate was de-
cided on-the-go according to the measured plant disease severity
level. For this purpose, the plant disease severity was classiﬁed into
three categories, i.e., low, medium, and high, and a reduction coefﬁ-
cient of the recommended application rate was assigned for each cat-
egory to determine the reduced application rates of agrochemical for
variable-rate spraying. The plant disease severity categorization
threshold limits and the corresponding reduction coefﬁcient values
are given in Table 1. These values can be reprogrammed by the
user for any speciﬁc plant disease. In this study (Table 1), 33% of
the recommended application rate was selected as the base rate
and assigned for the low (0–5%) plant disease severity level. The
other two chemical dosages, i.e., 67% and 100% of the recommended
application rate, were assigned for the medium (5.1–20%) and high
(20.1–100%) plant disease severity levels, respectively.
In variable-rate spraying operation, the required amount of
chemical per hill and the opening time duration of the solenoid

where a denotes the required amount of agrochemical per hill, mL

tion rate; A represents the recommended application rate of agro-
chemicals, L/ha; d denotes hill density per square meter area of the
ﬁeld, hills/m2; ts represents the opening time duration of solenoid
valve, s; Qs indicates the ﬂow rate of liquid through solenoid valve,
mL/s.
2.4. Variable-rate chemical spraying system operation cycle
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed in MATLAB environ-
ment for easy monitoring of the developed spraying system by the op-
erator, as shown in Fig. 6. This GUI displays the original image as well
as the processed image with plant disease severity values and the re-
quired amount of input chemical for both rows in real-time. The
operator can modify the recommended application rate, row to row
spacing, and hill to hill spacing, and he also has an option to adjust the
threshold limits for the plant disease severity categorization (Fig. 7).
The functional block diagram of the developed variable-rate chemi-
cal spraying system is shown in Fig. 8.
During the variable-rate chemical spraying operation, initially, the
web camera captures the paddy plant image and stores it in the laptop,
where the lesion region of plant leaves is identiﬁed. The processed out-
put in terms of disease severity is determined using the developed
image processing algorithm. The category of plant disease severity is de-
cided according to threshold limits, and this information is then sent to
the Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller assigns the reduction
coefﬁcient of the recommended application rate according to the cate-
gory of disease severity. Further, it computes the required amount of
chemical to be sprayed and the opening time duration for each solenoid
valve to supply that amount using Eqs. (4) and (5). After this, the micro-
controller then sends a 5 VDC signal to the respective relay switch,
which further actuates the associated 12 VDC solenoid valve, and the re-
quired amount of input chemical is sprayed on the diseased paddy
plants. As the developed prototype moves forward and covers a dis-
tance of 200 mm, the proximity switch mounted on the ground wheel
sends the signal to the microcontroller, which further triggers the cam-
era to capture a new image, and the cycle is repeated.
2.5. Performance evaluation of developed system
The operational performance of developed sprayer was evaluated
in terms of percentage reduction in applied chemical per unit area
during the variable-rate application (VRA) mode as compared with
the constant-rate application (CRA) mode. For this purpose, the de-
veloped sprayer was operated in both the operational modes, and

the corresponding chemical application rates were measured. The
agrochemical used in this study was monocrotophos 36 SL. The
spray solution was prepared by mixing 60 mL of agrochemical in
30 L of water. The spraying of chemical solution was carried out at
the recommended application rate, i.e., 1000 mL/ha (Kumar and
Sivakumar, 1998). The experimental ﬁeld had planting geometry of
20 cm × 20 cm (row to row × hill to hill) and the total area of
300 m2. The whole ﬁeld area was subdivided into ﬁve subplots of
3 m × 20 m each, and the spraying operation was carried out in all
of the subplots. Initially, during the CRA mode, the developed
prototype was operated without activation of cameras and other
control functions, and both spraying nozzles remained open
throughout the spraying operation. Then, the sprayer was operated
in the VRA mode by activation of cameras and other control func-
tions. In this case, the nozzles were not kept open all the time; in-
stead, their opening or closing was controlled by the actuation of
respective solenoid valves, and the opening time duration was de-
pendent on the plant disease severity level. Before each test, the stor-
age tank was ﬁlled with spray solution up to a speciﬁc mark, and the
amount of used chemical was measured by reﬁlling the storage tank

up to that particular mark again. The amount of chemical consump-
tion was recorded for all ﬁve subplots in both the operational modes.
The distance between image capturing point and spraying nozzles
was 250 mm, and the total time lag between the image acquisition
and the spraying was found to be about 800 ms. Hence, the maximum
speed of operation was limited to 0.9 km/h. Therefore, the speed of op-
eration in both the operational modes was maintained at about 0.9 km/
h. The reduction in applied chemical per unit area in the VRA mode as
compared with the CRA mode was calculated using Eq. (6).

3. Results and discussion
The ﬁeld tests of the developed prototype were carried out in both
the VRA and CRA modes (Fig. 9). Initially, the developed prototype
was operated in the CRA mode, during which the average chemical ap-
plication rate was observed as 504.17 L/ha with a relative standard de-
viation of 1.75%. The developed prototype was then operated in the VRA
mode by activation of cameras, during which the chemical application
rate was varied from 296.67 L/ha to 338.33 L/ha. The average chemical
application rate during the VRA mode was found to be 319.5 L/ha
with a relative standard deviation of 5.11%. The percent reduction in ap-
plied chemical per unit area was varied from 33.88% to 40.47% dur-
ing VRA mode as compared with the CRA mode, as given in Table 2.
Hence, the developed system showed a minimum 33.88% chemical sav-
ing as compared with the conventional uniform spraying. The chemical

saving achieved with the developed prototype could be stochastic and
primarily depends on the existing variability in plant disease severity
within the ﬁeld. If the degree of disease severity is high throughout
the ﬁeld, then the chemical saving will be low.
The spraying operation results obtained in VRA mode were also
compared with that in the CRA mode using a statistical term, relative
deviation (RD), which is deﬁned as follows (Kumar et al., 2017):

where Ac is the chemical application rate in CRA mode, L/ha; Av is the
chemical application rate in VRA mode, L/ha; and N is the number of
observations.
The relative deviation of the amount of chemical used per unit area
between VRA and CRA modes was found to be 36.65%, which showed
a signiﬁcant deviation in the amount of chemical applied during both
the operational modes. The two-sample t-test was also performed for
comparing the means of chemical application rates in both the opera-
tional modes. The t-test result indicated that the spraying operation in
VRA mode was resulted in signiﬁcantly less amount of chemical con-
sumption as compared with that in the CRA mode (p ≤ 0.05). Thus,
the developed variable-rate chemical spraying system showed promis-
ing results in terms of chemical saving as compared with the conven-
tional uniform spraying.
Although, the ﬁeld testing results indicated that a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in applied chemicals could be achieved with the developed
variable-rate chemical spraying system. However, with the existing po-
sition sensing method to trigger the camera for capturing the new
image, the plant spacing deviations could lead to errors in spraying op-
erations. The developed prototype can be further improved by modify-
ing the camera trigger unit using some object detection sensors like the
ultrasonic sensor or infrared sensor, which can minimize the errors due
to plant spacing deviations. In this study, the performance evaluation of
the developed sprayer was primarily concentrated on the percentage
reduction in applied chemical during VRA mode as compared with the
CRA mode. However, for a detailed analysis of the developed sprayer's
performance, the spray deposition tests need to be carried out in future
studies. Further research and experimentation are required to analyze
the effect of variable-rate chemical spraying on crop yield and disease
occurrence.
4. Conclusions
A manually operated real-time variable-rate chemical sprayer was
developed to apply the chemical dosages corresponding to the plant
disease severity level. The variable-rate chemical sprayer prototype
comprised of pump, solenoid valves, spray nozzles, relay switches,
web cameras, microcontroller board, Laptop, and 12 VDC battery. The
image processing technique was used to identify the diseased region
of the paddy plants and also determine their disease severity level.
The ﬁeld performance of developed sprayer prototype was evaluated
in terms of percentage reduction in applied agrochemical during the
VRA mode as compared with the CRA mode. The ﬁeld testing results
showed a minimum 33.88% chemical saving while operating in VRA
mode as compared with the CRA mode. Hence, the developed system
provides a potential solution to the farmers to avoid wastage of input
chemicals, which could ﬁnally increase their proﬁtability as well as re-
duce environmental pollution.
