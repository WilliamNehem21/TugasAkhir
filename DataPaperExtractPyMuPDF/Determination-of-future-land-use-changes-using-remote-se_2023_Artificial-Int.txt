Land use and land cover (LULC) changes refer to alterations in land use or physical characteristics. These changes 
can be caused by human activities, such as urbanization, agriculture, and resource extraction, as well as natural 
phenomena, for example, erosion and climate change. LULC changes significantly impact ecosystem services, 
biodiversity, and human welfare. In this study, LULC changes in Davao City, Philippines, were simulated, pre-
dicted, and projected using a multilayer perception artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) model. The MLP-ANN 
model was employed to analyze the impact of elevation and proximity to road networks (i.e., exploratory maps) 
on changes in LULC from 2017 to 2021. The predicted 2021 LULC map shows a high correlation to the actual 
LULC map of 2021, with a kappa index of 0.91 and a 96.68% accuracy. The MLP-ANN model was applied to 
project LULC changes in the future (i.e., 2030 and 2050). The results suggest that in 2030, the built-up area and 
trees are increasing by 4.50% and 2.31%, respectively. Unfortunately, water will decrease by up to 0.34%, and 
crops is about to decrease by approximately 3.25%. In the year 2050, the built-up area will continue to increase 
to 6.89%, while water and crops will decrease by 0.53% and 3.32%, respectively. Overall, the results show that 
anthropogenic activities influence the land’s alterations. Moreover, the study illustrates how machine learning 
models can generate a reliable future scenario of land usage changes.   
1. Introduction 
Land use and land cover (LULC) change is a critical research topic 
that holds significant understanding in transforming the Earth’s surface. 
LULC change encompasses actions such as deforestation, urbanization, 
and agricultural expansion that alter the Earth’s surface and signifi-
cantly impact ecosystems and climate change. According to a study by 
Houghton et al. (2012), LULC change significantly contributes to global 
carbon and water cycle alteration. Land use refers to the utilization that 
land serves, for example, recreation, agriculture, wildlife sanctuary, and 
many more (Saputra and Lee, 2019). Land cover refers to the top layer of 
the earth, including built-up infrastructure, vegetation, water, bare soil, 
and many more. Resource management monitoring depends on the 
identification and delineation of the land cover. This can be achieved by 
correctly recognizing the LULC, which must first be established through 
monitoring the baseline thematic data obtained from ground cover in-
formation. Land use management must use both the baseline data map 
and the subsequent change map during monitoring to identify the recent 
extent of land type and to recognize the land use changes from time to 
time. With this, LULC monitoring is usually performed using surveys, 
computer simulations, and modeling. 
Modeling and simulating LULC changes provide valuable baseline 
information for forecasting future development scenarios. These models 
can assist in land use planning by identifying land use problems such as 
degradation and deforestation (Ren et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2016). Land 
use changes have long been crucial to urban planning. As a result, a vast 
amount of research is focused on understanding these changes by 
identifying the primary key drivers that influence the changes A study 
by Verburg et al. (2004) proposes the need for innovative techniques to 
accurately measure the effects of neighboring areas, considering the 
complexity of the land use systems. Furthermore, this study underscores 
the significance of integrating temporal dynamics to achieve a higher 
level of integration across models examining land use changes. These 
models include transportation, demographic, erosion, and groundwater, 
all impacting land use cover. 
The land use changes have significantly impacted human activity 
patterns, influencing the potential for current and future inhabitation 
(Losiri et al., 2016). Recently, several studies focused on the

transformation of LULC in the Asian continent. Zhu et al. (2022) used 
Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to track and forecast 
land use changes. Likewise, Kelly-Fair et al. (2022) Used this tool, in 
conjunction with multicriteria analysis (MCA), to integrate of various 
factors by assigning weights based on decision-makers or planners’ in-
puts. As a result, this approach makes evaluating each criterion’s rela-
tive effects on the LULC modeling easier. However, the subjectivity of 
the input for the weights is a limitation in the model (Chang et al., 2018). 
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach may be employed to 
address the weakness of multicriteria analysis. In the work of Saputra 
and Lee (2019), an ANN model was used to simulate multiple land-use 
changes and complex land-use systems. It was utilized to predict LULC 
changes while considering the influencing factors. 
In a recent study, Cabrera and Lee (2022) suggested the localization 
of coastal zone management implementation due to the distinctiveness 
of the coastal environment. Hence, this study estimates future land use 
changes in a highly urbanized coastal city in the southern part of the 
Philippines. The researchers expect to offer insightful information for 
the area’s future developments by analyzing the current LULC patterns 
and applying various modeling techniques, such as GIS and remote 
Sensing. 
2. Related literature 
LULC changes are occurring rapidly in Southeast Asian (SEA) coun-
tries, generally associated with population growth, economic develop-
ment, and competing demands for land (Lambin et al., 2003). The most 
common changes include urban expansion, loss of agricultural land, 
re/deforestation, logging, and many more (Vadrevu et al., 2019). This is 
evident in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, where large-scale 
deforestation for palm oil plantation expansions has been happening 
continuously to address the demands of palm oil in the international 
market (Koh and Wilcove, 2008). On the other hand, most developing 
countries, aside from small-scale deforestation caused by indigenous 
agriculture due to poverty, also suffer from rapid urbanization (Seto 
et al., 2022). These drivers of LULC changes vary widely in the SEA 
region. Understanding the variation of LULC is achieved by continually 
monitoring the geographic distribution of the land use pattern. Remote 
Sensing (RS) with GIS application, urban pattern detection using GIS, 
and ANN algorithm to generate LULC, were applied to understand the 
land changes. 
2.1. Satellite imagery classification algorithms and remote sensing 
application 
RS measures a region’s radiation and reflects from a distance to 
survey and monitor its physical features. Remotely sensed imagery of 
the Earth is gathered using specialized cameras. A GIS is designed to 
capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or 
geographic data (Chao et al., 2022). GIS can identify and investigate the 
configuration of urban expansion concerning the land use pattern 
(Handayani et al., 2018). 
RS data with various spatial resolution and image analysis tech-
niques have been applied to monitor urban expansion (Handayani et al., 
2018). RS data images are multispectral and contain rich spectral in-
formation, which has always been essential data in LULC research (Ren 
et al., 2019). In multispectral data, the most appropriate bands and color 
combinations are selected to facilitate the interpretation process of in-
formation extraction (classification) (Ren et al., 2019). A band config-
uration of red (4), green (3), and blue (2) is used in the natural color 
composite. It accurately reproduces what the human eye can see. 
Near-infrared (5), red (4), and green (3) make up the composite color 
infrared band. For studying vegetation, this band combination is helpful. 
SWIR-1(6), SWIR-2(7), and red(4) are the components of the short-wave 
infrared combination. Green tones are used to depict the vegetation in 
this collage. The agriculture band combination uses frequencies 6, 5, and 
2 for agricultural monitoring. 7, 6, and 2 are the bands best for identi-
fying geological structures. The 4, 3, and 1 band combination is helpful 
for studies of aerosols, bathymetry, and the coast. Establishing a clas-
sification system suitable for the study area is the basis of remote sensing 
classification using GIS image classification techniques (Chang et al., 
2018). There are many sources of the S dataset. Thus, it creates ambi-
guity and unreliability in standardizing the dataset for LULC research. 
The classified images need to be compared with the actual data (i.e., 
ground control point data) to ensure the reliability of the classification 
results (Ren et al., 2019). Then, the confusion matrix’s kappa coefficient 
(K) and other accuracy tests are used to evaluate the classification 
accuracy. 
The study of Handayani et al. (2018) applied geospatial analysis 
using multi-spatial resolution data to determine the urban expansion of 
Surabaya, Indonesia. This study used several RS images to generate 
LULC change. The accuracy assessment was tested to the 500 ground 
truth points using post-classification to produce overall accuracy (OA) 
and K. Likewise, in the study of Sharma et al. (2018), a GIS-based in-
tegrated modeling approach was demonstrated to analyze the spatial 
pattern of LULC. 
Another method for LULC classification that makes use of the 
phenology of RS (MODIS) pictures and the pattern similarity of time 
series of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) variations is the k-means 
method (Sato et al., 2019). The MODIS has a high temporal observation 
frequency but limited geographic resolution. The MODIS image is suit-
able for vegetation dynamics analysis (Sato et al., 2019), like typhoons 
and other natural calamities, due to its short monitoring interval. 
A study for the impact of land cover change on ecosystem services in 
a tropical forested landscape used Landsat images (Talukdar et al., 
2020), the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), and Landsat 
8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). It 
used the maximum likelihood algorithm to classify the LULC type of the 
RS datasets. Moreover, the LULC accuracy assessment was verified using 
random sampling points (Sharma et al., 2018). According to Johnson 
et al. (2015), the residential regions might also be extracted from the 
Landsat imagery using unsupervised segmentation parameter optimi-
zation (USPO). A random forest method can be helpful in accurately 
evaluating the LULC classification of the Landsat imagery (Cengiz et al., 
2023). Tran et al. (2019) study applied the object-based image classifi-
cation method to the high-resolution images of drought and human 
impacts on LULC change in the coastal areas of Vietnam. 
Several image classification techniques can be applied to LULC 
classification in high and multispectral imagery. The conformity of the 
type of satellite image and the suitable image classification technique is 
not presented here. Therefore, no study asserts that any technique is the 
most suitable and accurate for the LULC classification. 
2.2. Artificial neural network (ANN) to generate LULC 
The utilization of the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm 
presents a robust approach to modeling complex behaviors (Pijanowski 
et al., 2002). Unlike the multivariate approach, the ANN algorithm does 
not necessitate assumptions regarding spatial autocorrelation and 
multi-collinearity of the data (Pijanowski et al., 2002). This makes it 
particularly advantageous for predicting future land use patterns. The 
ANN algorithm proves valuable in geospatial land use studies due to its 
ability to capture complex non-linear interactions and effectively handle 
extensive datasets. In recent years, employing ANN models for fore-
casting land use changes has gained popularity. By comprehensively 
modeling the intricate interactions between land use and environmental 
factors, ANN offers enhanced precision and reliability. The environ-
mental factors influencing land use include climate change, soil degra-
dation, deforestation, urbanization, and water resource availability. 
Climate pattern variations directly impact land use and subsequently 
influence alterations in agricultural practices (FAO, 2007; Vorosmarty 
et al., 2000). Soil degradation, which affects agricultural productivity

and restricts land suitability for certain uses, can trigger land use change 
(Jie et al., 2002). Deforestation for urbanization, agriculture, or logging 
disrupts land use patterns and ecological equilibrium (Lambin et al., 
2003). The rapid expansion of urban areas contributes to losing open 
spaces and green landscapes (Seto et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2022). 
This study investigates the multilayer perception artificial neural 
network (MLP-ANN), which has gained recognition as a highly reliable 
neural network model. MLP-ANNs have demonstrated their effective-
ness in pattern recognition and classification tasks (Amgoth et al., 2023; 
Dinda et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2020). The neural network model en-
compasses an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer (Bocco 
et al., 2014; Isabona et al., 2022; Megahed et al., 2015). MLP-ANNs are 
widely used in LULC analysis. The MLP-ANNs’ strength is the ability to 
deal with the complexity and non-linearity of LULC data, making them 
suitable for analyzing and classifying land use patterns using remotely 
sensed imagery. These models use spectral, and spatial information from 
satellite imagery, as input to the models. MLP-ANNs can learn to asso-
ciate these input features with specific LULC classes through training. 
This enables accurate classification and analysis of LULC patterns. The 
MLP-ANN model was used in the study to manage and analyze large 
datasets and make land use change projections. The study aimed to 
forecast land use changes by leveraging the strengths of MLP-ANN 
models. 
3. Study area 
3.1. Study area 
Davao City (as shown in Fig. 1) is a 1st class city, with an annual 
average income of at least 500 million pesos or roughly 9 million USD. It 
is also categorized as a highly urbanized city in the southern part of the 
Philippines. Davao City boasts the largest land area in the country, with 
a total land area of 2443.61 km2 (Cabrera and Lee, 2022). Notably, it is 
home to Mt. Apo, the highest mountain in the Philippines. It is also the 
most populated city on Mindanao Island and the third most populous 
city in the Philippines (Cabrera and Lee, 2022). It has a population of 1, 
776,949 (PSA, 2020). The city serves as Mindanao’s leading trade, 
commerce, and industry hub. 
3.2. Data, maps, and criteria 
The data used in this study comprise road networks, a digital 
elevation model (DEM), and two LULC maps for 2017 and 2021 (see 
Table 1). The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM (SRTM DEM) was 
used in this study. The road map was obtained from the Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). The LULC maps were ob-
tained from the ESRI land cover generated from Sentinel-2 10-m reso-
lution (https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcover/). The elevation and 
distance to the road network were utilized as the exploratory data for 
LULC modeling (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). The land use classifications are 
shown in Table 2. 
4. Methodology 
Fig. 3 serves as a visual representation of the methodological 
framework utilized in this study, providing an overview of the processes 
and approaches employed. Within this figure, The 2017 and 2021 maps 
from ESRI (https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcover/) are featured, 
serving as valuable data sources for the analysis. 
The final map (i.e., LULC, 2021) is produced using the ANN model 
from several images taken throughout the years. This approach allows 
for the integration of temporal information and can improve the land 
cover map’s overall accuracy by capturing seasonal vegetation cover 
variations. In recent years, ANN modeling for land cover mapping has 
been demonstrated to be effective. Chen et al. (2020) used a machine- 
learning model trained on the Sentinel-2 dataset with an accuracy rate 
of 92.41%. This shows that the machine learning model effectively 
classifies and analyzes satellite imagery datasets. 
The study used the ANN model to evaluate the impact of elevation

and distance to the road network on the LULC maps. This study used the 
elevation and distance of the road network datasets. These are raster 
datasets. The changes in each LULC category were determined by 
superimposing these rasters on top of the existing LULC maps. This 
process will detect the changes in the land. Then, a transition matrix was 
used to show the proportions of pixels that transitioned from one LULC 
category to another. A transition matrix is a tool in change detection 
studies. It allows identifying patterns and trends in land use change over 
time. The comparison of the two rasters helped examine the relationship 
between LULC. Thus, it provides valuable insights into the dynamic 
changes in LULC. This insight contributes to a better understanding of 
the factors influencing LULC dynamics and assists land management and 
planning. 
The created map was evaluated to determine the quality of the LULC 
classification. The kappa coefficient (KC) and overall accuracy (OA) 
metrics were used to evaluate the LULC map. The OA is the percentage 
of correctly classified observations according to pixels in the classifica-
tion. The OA also indicates how well the model predicts the true cate-
gory across classes. The OA was computed using Equation (1). 
OA = Sk
S x 100
(1)  
where k represents the area of interest, Sk is the number of correct 
samples, and S is the total sample. 
Furthermore, the KC is frequently used to evaluate and assess the 
correctness of LULC maps. It was used to compare a simulated LULC map 
to a reference LULC map from 2021. The KC assesses the agreement 
between the two maps while accounting for the probability of chance 
agreement. The following Equation (2) was used in computing the KC 
index.

KC = Po − Pe
1 − Pe
(2)  
where Po is the proportion of observed agreements, and Pe is the pro-
portion of agreements expected by chance (Saputra and Lee, 2019). 
In this example, the KC is used to validate the simulated 2021 LULC 
map against the reference map of the real 2021 LULC map. KC allows 
evaluation of how well the ANN model predicted the area’s current land 
cover. Furthermore, following the validation process, future LULC maps 
for 2030 and 2050 were estimated by assuming the continuation of the 
current land use change patterns. The weights utilized in simulating the 
2021 LULC map were applied to the neural network in simulating future 
LULC changes. This can give current and future insights into the po-
tential land use pattern and provide an understanding of land use 
planning and management decisions.

5. Results and discussion 
5.1. Transition and prediction scenario 
A transition matrix was used as an input in a neural network analysis 
to quantify the rate of change in LULC. The neural network created the 
final LULC output by calculating the likelihood of change in each input. 
The relative proportions of various LULC categories between 2017 and 
2021 were compared to produce the LULC transition matrix, shown in 
Tables 3 and 4. 
The transition matrix values show the changes from each classifica-
tion to another classification. The transition modeling from 2017 to 
2021 depicts that water, trees, built area, and rangeland increase over 
time. In contrast, the changes in the land have a detrimental impact on 
the flood vegetation, crops, bare ground, and clouds. The built area 
classification has the highest positive increase of the land with 
approximately 2.56% or 240.669 km2, while the crop classification 
decreases around 0.79% or 101.265 km2. 
This information helps us understand the patterns and trends of 
LULC changes over time. By analyzing the LULC transition matrix, 
decision-makers can plan and implement effective, sustainable land use 
management and conservation strategies. Moreover, the insights 
generated from the neural network model can be leveraged for various 
purposes, such as urban planning, environmental management, and 
natural resource management. 
In summary, this study aimed to utilize an ANN model to predict 
future LULC in 2021 by considering exploratory maps such as the dis-
tance from road networks and elevation. The accuracy of the predictions 
was evaluated by comparing the predicted LULC for 2021 with the 2021 
LULC map obtained from ESRI. The results demonstrated a high level of 
accuracy, with a percentage of correctness of 96.68% and a Kappa score 
of 0.91. This shows that the projected and actual maps are very close, as 
presented in Fig. 4. The similarities between the two maps were almost 
indistinguishable. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the 
method in forecasting future LULC changes. 
5.2. Projected scenario 
The prediction maps show the projected land use scenario in 2030 
and 2050 (see Fig. 5). Table 5 gives the square meters and percentages of 
the land changes based on the 2017 baseline map. The four maps are 
shown in Fig. 5. 
The 2017 baseline map is in the top-left, while the 2019 LULC is in 
the top-right of the image. Moreover, the bottom-left and bottom-right 
are the predicted LULC for 2030 and 2050, respectively. 
According to the projections, the built area and tree cover are ex-
pected to increase by approximately 4.50% and 2.31% by 2030. How-
ever, crops will drastically decrease by up to 3.25%, or approximately 
464.203 km2 will be lost. Furthermore, the water, flood vegetation, bare 
ground, clouds, and rangeland will decrease around 0.34% (753.48 
km2), 0.04% (796.40 km2), 0.20% (445.17 km2), 2.00% (447.14 km2) 
and 0.96% (214.22400 km2), respectively. 
In 2050, the built area will continue to increase to 6.89% or 
approximately 337.02 km2. In contrast, the trees will decrease from 
2.31% in 2030 to 0.62% in 2050. This demonstrates how land changes 
are affected by human activities. This result also reflects that Davao City 
is driving toward heavy industrialization and urbanization in the future. 
The agricultural related classification like crops, flood vegetation, bare 
ground, and rangeland will be heavily affected in the future; around 
738.83 km2, 877.60 km2, 480.94 km2, and 309.00 km2 will be lost, 
respectively. Water-related classifications (i.e., water, flood vegetation, 
and cloud coverage) are also affected. Table 5 shows the complete 
percentage change in these classifications. These findings have impor-
tant implications for the city’s future land use planning and resource 
management. As Davao City continues to grow and change, it is crucial 
to consider the long-term impact of these developments and implement 
sustainable practices to minimize harm to the natural environment and 
ensure a balanced relationship between human activities and the 
environment. 
6. Conclusions 
The LULC is essential as a basis for resource monitoring and planning 
activities. The LULC can assist in developing plans to balance develop-
ment and conservation. This study applies the MLP-ANN model to pre-
dict changes in LULC in Davao City, Philippines. 
The elevation and distance to the road network are derived from 
DEM and used as exploratory maps to train the MLP-ANN model. The 
exploratory maps for 2017 and 2021 show significant impacts on land 
changes in the simulation. The accuracy rate and Kappa index show that 
the predicted and actual maps for 2021 are in very high agreement. The 
MLP-ANN model was also employed to forecast how land will be used in 
2030 and 2050. 
The prediction models for 2030 and 2050 show a high increase in the 
built area, up to 6.89%, based on the 2017 baseline map. The trees 
classification will increase by approximately 2.31% in 2030, but it will 
slightly increase in the year 2050. Meanwhile, the crop area will 
decrease to around 464.203 km2 (3.25%) and 738.83 km2 (3.32%) in 
2030 and 2050, respectively. This indicates that human activities in-
fluence the LULC change from agricultural land classifications to the 
built area. 
The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the complex 
land use patterns of highly urbanized coastal cities like Davao City in the 
Philippines. Urbanization is the primary reason for the decline in crops 
and other agricultural and natural landscapes, emphasizing the impor-
tance of proper land use planning to balance development and envi-
ronmental conservation where humans and the environment co-exist. 
The use of the MLP-ANN model in this study provides a valuable tool 
for predicting future changes in the landscape. However, the results can 
be improved by including the impact of climate change and other 
meteorological and hydrological parameters. Addressing these limita-
tions will broaden the understanding of how land use patterns evolve in 
Davao City and help inform future sustainable development strategies.
