Abstract 
Task of automatic reconstruction of three-dimensional objects by drawing views presented. The algorithm based on a 
boundary representation of three-dimensional models. The algorithm consists of the following steps: automatic separation 
of the drawing per the views, determination of three-dimensional coordinates of vertices, definition and marking of wire 
model primitives, reconstruction of model faces and model elements. The fundamental concept of the algorithm is to find 
the structural elements of three-dimensional model with usage of pre-specified patterns. The templates are described by 
means of matrices. Matching algorithm uses invariants: the number of vertices, type of edges.

1. Introduction 
For the moment, a large number of the technical drawings, submitted in both paper and electronic form are 
accumulated in the archives of the enterprises. An additional point is that the development of many objects 
often begins with the drawing instead of three-dimensional model usage. Two-dimensional drawings are often

difficult to understand, they are inconvenient to update and the ones can not serve as a basis for further 
developments with computer systems usage.  
The three-dimensional computer model of the object, which can be used for development of supervisor 
programs, engineering analysis, visualization, etc., is one of the components of electronic model of product. 
The modern CAD-systems have the following bevy of tools to generate the three-dimensional models “with a 
clean slate”: Boolean operations, the operations of object-oriented modeling, 2.5D-operations, modification 
operations of vertices, edges and faces. Practically all CAD-systems allow the generation of drawings with 
usage of three-dimensional model. However, generation of three-dimensional model per drawing causes the 
designers difficulties, related to the lack of software. 
2. Survey of algorithms of three-dimensional reconstruction per technical drawing 
All algorithms of three-dimensional models regenerating per drawings can be divided into two groups: 
CSG- and B-rep approaches. CSG-oriented (constructive solid geometry) approach uses “top to bottom” 
regenerating strategy (Geng, 2002; Cicek, 2004; Lee, 2005; Wang, 2007; You, 2008; Xie, 2009). The 
approach is based on the fact that each three-dimensional object can be built with usage of specific two-
dimensional primitive in a hierarchical manner. Patterns are found in the drawing, which will serve as a base 
and they will be used for transformation into three-dimensional model. That done, the designed primitives are 
collected in the resulting three-dimensional model, using the Boolean operations. The disadvantage of CSG-
oriented approach is the fact that with its usage it is difficult to recognize the basic primitives on complex 
drawings. As well as, it is difficult to imagine the surfaces of complicated shape, when using the CSG-
geometry.  
B-rep-oriented (bounding representation) approach uses “ascending” technology. B-rep-oriented 
algorithms generally consist of the following steps: generation of possible three-dimensional vertices from 
drawing; edges synthesis per received coordinates of vertices; design of faces from edges, lying in plane; the 
formation of three-dimensional object from faces (Masuda, 1997; Shin, 1998; Watanable, 1998; Liu, 2001; 
Golovin, 2007).  
Boundary representation provides considerable opportunities for modeling of object complex geometry, it 
is impossible to reach when using of CSG-approach. However, when using B-rep-representation the more 
storage space for storage and processing of data is required. An additional point is that, the created model is 
logically less stable, in other words it is possible to build controversial configurations. 
The existing algorithms of reconstruction per drawings are characterized by the following characteristics: 
the degree of operator involvement in the reconstruction process, the surfaces geometry, the number of views 
on the drawing, the possibility of error correction, the sections processing, etc.  
The analysis has shown that existing approaches are generally designed for the objects with sufficiently 
simple geometry. These algorithms often do not allow performing of reconstruction of polygonal surfaces, 
fillets, slots, holes. In this paper the algorithm, which allows recognizing these structural elements on the basis 
of predetermined patterns, is presented. 
3. Automatic reconstruction algorithm using patterns 
Presented algorithm is developed on the basis of B-rep-representation that provides the significant 
opportunities as to the description of the complex shape geometry. The fundamental concept of the algorithm 
is to find the structural elements of three-dimensional model with usage of pre-specified patterns. The 
templates are described by means of matrices. On the basis of the patterns, such elements as holes, slots, 
chamfers, etc. are described.

The developed algorithm processes the data of vector drawing, saved in DXF (Drawing eXchange Format - 
format of drawings exchange) format. The algorithm consists of the following steps. 
Step 1. Drawing read of vector file. The primitives’ parameters (values of vertex coordinates, radius, 
centers of circles, etc.) are read off. 
Step 2. Automatic separation of the drawing per the views. The algorithm operates for the drawings, 
consisting of three views: front view, top view and view from the left. In this case, the location of the drawing 
primitives in reference to horizontally and vertically moving straight lines shall be checked. For example, the 
process of the drawing separation into the main view and the view from the left is finished when there are the 
primitives that are on the left and on the right from the straight line that is described by the equation 
x � A
. 
At that this straight line does not intersect any primitive of the drawing. In this case, for each vertex of the 
primitive either condition 
xi � A
 or condition 
xi � A
 shall be met. Similarly, the drawing separation into 
the main view and top view is carried out. 
Step 3 . Finding of the coordinates of the vertices of the three-dimensional model on the basis of view (Fig. 
1). If the main view to indicate as  F (Front), left-side view  as L (Left), top view as T (Top), then it is 
possible to determine the three-dimensional coordinates of the vertices from the following conditions: 
T
F
x
x
�
, 
L
F
y
y
�
, 
L
F
z
z
�
. It is understood that the drawings are designed in the CAD-system with usage 
of standard tools: object snap, snap to grid, etc. Any inaccuracy in the creation of the primitives leads to an 
ambiguous interpretation of the image. 
Step 4. Definition and marking of wire model primitives. The wire model consists of the segments of 
straight lines, arcs, circles, splines, etc. If at least two primitives’ projections on views coincide, then there are 
corresponding to primitive vertices, the coordinates of which are computed at step 3. Description of the 
primitive in three-dimensional space shall be fed into memory and it shall be assigned with number. 
Step 5. Definition and construction of reconstructed object model faces. The face is constructed on the 
basis of the closed loop of primitives, belonging to the same plane. The closed loop must consist of as low as 
practicable number of primitives. 
Step. 6. Definition and construction of structural components of the model on the basis of patterns. Each 
typical element can be determined on the basis of the adjacency of three-dimensional primitives (segments of 
straight lines, circles and arcs), extracted from the drawing. We will assume the primitives that have the 
common vertex as incidence ones.

Each structural component can be represented by wire model (Table 2). The relative positions of the 
primitives can be described on the basis of the incidence matrix. Each column describes vertex V, and the row 
is the edge E (arc, circle, segment of the straight line). Last two columns describe the number of vertices 
adjacent to edge K and edge type P. The figure that determines both adjacency of primitives and their 
designation on the drawing is at the intersection of row and column.

4. Matching of the incidence matrix 
Matrix of model and matrix of primitive are compared. Invariants are used to reduce computations. 
Invariants are the number of vertices and type of edge.  The algorithm consists of the following steps: 
Step 1. All edges are defined in matrix. Compares the values  of K and P (Figure 2 (a)); 
Step 2. Adjacent edges found in matrix (Figure 2 (b)).  
Step 3. All adjacent edges form 3D-primitive.

5. The results of the reconstruction  
On the basis of the information, extracted from the drawing, the matrices shall be developed and they shall 
be compared with patterns, stored in the system. If the patterns parameters coincide, then it is possible to 
conclude as to the presence of one or another structural component. Further, the boundary representation of 
component form is created. As test example, the drawing, shown in Figure 1 (�) was taken. The result of 
reconstruction of views is shown in Figure 1 (b).

6. Conclusions 
The developed algorithm is fully automatic one and it operates only with the drawings, presented in vector 
form. The algorithm presents high requirements to the accuracy of drawing construction, the one treats 
invisible lines and curved surfaces. It is necessary to describe the patterns of all primitives that can occur, 
when simulating, so that the system would be fully universal for various geometrical shapes. Test modules of 
the system are developed in the terms of AutoLISP language for AutoCAD system.
