energy efficiency. And at present the strong intelligent power grid in planning and construction is just meet 
this demand. 
From technology development and application perspective, Strong intelligent power grid is the network 
which makes the high-voltage electric network for the backbone network frame, all levels of the coordinate 
power grid network for the foundation, communication and information platform for the support, with 
information technology, automation, interactive features; and includes all aspects of power system generation, 
such as transmission, substation, power distribution, power and scheduling; and to achieve a high degree of 
integration of the power flow, information flow, business flow, "the fusion of modern power grid[1]. 
1. Power load forecasting under the background of intelligent power grid 
In the intelligent power grid, the user will be an integral part of the power system, and it is an important 
feature for the intelligent power grid to encourage and facilitate participation in the power system operation 
and management. In the construction and management process of intelligent power grid, it is much more 
important and urgent to do the high quality power load forecasting, and the predictive accuracy is closely 
related to the interests for system operation and users.  
Based on high quality power load forecasting results, the power supply enterprises work out a reasonable 
real-time pricing according to the grid load rate to manage users to guide their electricity consumption to 
balance the relationship of power supply and demand, making load shifting to improve the system load rate, 
and to ensure power quality and reliability of power supply and improve the security and stability of the grid. 
In addition to provide more accurate, timely variable electricity price information to intelligent power grid 
users, to provide them sufficient power consumption cost and power network operation state information, then 
the users could have many schemes to arrange their reasonable and economic power consumption[2]. 
2. MV optimum combined model 
Power load forecasting is to make the demand prediction for electricity in the future based on the known 
requirement, considering the political, economic, climate, energy alternative factors, etc. The power system 
load forecasting is more complicated due to changes in energy used in the intelligent power grid environment. 
Therefore it needs to choose a better precision prediction method to complete the work. 
In a long period, the prediction precision is difficult to meet the requirements which used single forecasting 
method. Relatively, combination forecast model has a higher predictive performance and a smaller risk of 
extreme prediction errors. 
�1�the Gray Model 
The Grey Model is an effective prediction model, constituted only by the first order differential equation 
which contains a single variable. The theory has been proved that this method has many advantages, such as 
required less sample data, high prediction precision, simple calculation and verifiable, when the basic data is 
strictly index increase [3].

�2�The trend fitting model 
The trend fitting model is fitting one curve according to the known historical material, which reflects 
growing trend in original data itself. Then according to the simulation trend curve, it can estimate the 
corresponding moment predictive value for the future requirement. 
�3�the MV optimum combined model 
Optimal combination forecast is the method which selects appropriate weight for some results by other 
methods to make the weighted average. This paper mainly determines the weights for different prediction 
method based on Variance-covariance method�MV�[4]�and the principle are as follows: 
Assuming

3. Example Analysis 
The history data of power load in certain city from 1995 to 2010 was used in the following part to check 
the accuracy of the established combined model. 
�1�the grey model 
Based on the data of power load in certain city from 1995 to 2007 and the theory of grey model, the 
predicted installed capacity from 2008 to 2010 is shown in Table 1. 
�2�Trend fitting model 
The prediction using trend fitting model was performed based on the data of power load in certain city from 
1995 to 2007. The steps were shown as follow: 
First, the category of data should be analyzed, as Fig.1 shows. 
Fig.1 the power load change trend chart in 1995-2007 
Then, the trend fitting was performed based on the trend of the cave in Fig.1 and the statistics from 1995 to 
2007. A quadratic function was used to perform the fitting test based on the result that was got through many 
modal of fitting and the principle that the closer the R2 to 1, the better the result is. The result of prediction 
through trend fitting was shown as follow:

The range of R2 was from 0 to 1, it represented the fitting degree between prediction and reality. When R2 
was very close to or equal to 1, its reliability was high, and it was called the coefficient of determination. In 
this case, R2=0.990, which meant that the fitting degree was good. Finally, the prediction of data from 2008 
to 2010 was given in Table 1. 
�3�MV optimization combinatorial model 
The weights of grey model and trend fitting were calculated based on the theory above:

Results got through MV optimization combinatorial prediction were shown in Table 1:  
�4�Precise inspection of model 
The average error inspection was introduced to perform the precise inspection of the three models above, 
and results were shown in Table 1:

As shown in the Table 1, in terms of

, the precise of MV optimization combinatorial prediction 
model was higher than the others. Thus, under the new situation of intelligent power grid construction, the 
MV optimum combined model can get the more excellent power load forecast management. 
4. Conclusion 
By comparing the gray model, the trend fitting model and MV method, MV method is more accurate in 
forecasting than other methods used only one method. Under the new situation of the deepening intelligent 
power grid construction, the high accuracy of the prediction model could guide load forecasting management 
and enhance comprehensive benefits.
