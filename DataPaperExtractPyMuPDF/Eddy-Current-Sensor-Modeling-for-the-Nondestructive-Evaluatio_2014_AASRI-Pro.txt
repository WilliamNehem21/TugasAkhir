1. Introduction 
Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is an important parameter in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) for 
the structural integrity assessment of structures containing cracks and singular stress fields [1]. SIF gives a 
measure of the intensity of the stress field in the crack tip region. It gives also the possibility to analyze a 
crack growth or a catastrophic failure if a load is applied to the structure [2]. The stress intensity factors can 
be calculated using stress and strain analysis or parameters that measure the energy released by crack growth. 
SIF can be estimated analytically or using numerical techniques [3, 4].Analytical methods are more complex 
to calculate SIF, however, they have some advantage; an analytical solution can be applied for a range of 
crack lengths and on the other hand, numerical techniques require the calculation of stress or strain field for 
each crack length corresponding to each value of SIF.  
Stress and strain fields for a given structure can be calculated using several techniques [5]. The most 
common and available ones can be found in several commercial packages employing the Finite Element 
Method (FEM) [6] or the Boundary Element Method (BEM) [7]. Nowadays, new techniques based on mesh 
less methods such as the Extended Finite Element Model (XFEM), are emerging and have several advantages 
compared to the traditional methods, particularly in problems of fracture mechanics [8]. 
2. J-Integral  
To determine the energy quantity that describes the elastic-plastic behavior of materials, Rice [9] 
introduced a contour integral or a line integral that encloses the crack front as shown in Figure 1.

In using J-integral method, a program is developed to calculate the stress intensity factors,

3. Displacement extrapolation  
The displacement extrapolation method was developed to obtain crack tip singular stresses and stress 
intensity factors using only nodal displacements of elements around the crack tip [10]. The near crack tip 
displacement field may be expressed as a series function of the stress intensity factor, the position to the crack 
tip as well as the orientation to the crack propagation direction.

This technique is used when the model includes singular elements and where extrapolation can be done 
inside these elements in order to take into account the singularities they induce [11].Using this method, we 
can determine the SIF by detecting the crack opening displacements������� ������ ����� �����. These latest are 
obtained using the nondestructive technique by Eddy current in order to extrapolate the corresponding 
nodes�� �,��� �[2]

One can notice from equations (12) and (13) that the magnetic potential and the density of the induced 
currents are in the same direction. Induced currents have only one component, which can be obtained by 
substituting equations (8) into equation (11) and equation (13) into equation (6);

Where Js represents the density of the current sources. Equation (14) refers to the magneto-dynamic equation. 
All the above expressions are written in a form such that they can be used in the finite element formulation 
using electromagnetic equations. This weak form is considered as being a boundary integral, which makes it 
possible to define natural boundary conditions. Then, discretization of the latest uses polynomial of order two, 
which can lead to the following system;

where[A] is the vector column sum of values of A
� , [J] is the matrix vectors of source. [S]and[T]are square 
matrixes starting from the geometry of the device. 
5. Simulation of one (sensor - plate non-magnetic) without crack 
Consider the test of a non-magnetic tube without a crack, characterized by a permeability equal to unity, a 
high conductivity 36.7ms, excited by a sinusoidal current of density J = 2.67 106 A/m, and a frequency of 1 
kHz. The results of simulation are shown in figures 2, 3, and 4. The control by Eddy currents requires the use 
of very high frequencies.

6. Results interpretation 
Figure3 shows the variation of the impedance Z and KI with respect to the propagation of crack’s depth. It 
is obvious that the difference in impedance �Z is dependent on the crack’s depth. The latter is proportional to 
the increase of �Z. Moreover, SIF KI is evaluated when the depth decreases with �Z leading to a decrease of 
KI. Then, the depth of defection influences the impedance. Figure 4 shows the variation of the impedance Z

crack’s width; when the latter increases �Z decreases, and vice versa.

7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we studied the usefulness of Eddy current sensors as a tool to control cracks and micro cracks 
in materials. The simulations performed in this study led to the following conclusions: 
-
Determination of the impedance in only one point is not enough to confirm the presence or the 
absence of a defect for two types of materials (non-magnetic or magnetic). This behavior leads us to 
the evaluation of the impedance along the tube.  
-
Detection of an external defect requires the energy of the sensor using high frequencies. 
-
The position of defect (internal, middle or external) has a large effect on the impedance. Obtained 
results show the great sensitivity of the differential sensor with respect to the detection of the surface 
defects. However, the major disadvantage of this type of sensor lies in the fact that it is unable to 
detect a defect located between two reels. 
-
Determination of SIF is an important parameter in detecting singularities in a given model.
