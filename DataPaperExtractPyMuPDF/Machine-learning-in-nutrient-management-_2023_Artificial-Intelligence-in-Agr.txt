In agriculture, precise fertilization and effective nutrient management are critical. Machine learning (ML) has re-
cently been increasingly used to develop decision support tools for modern agricultural systems, including nutri-
ent management, to improve yields while reducing expenses and environmental impact. ML based systems
require huge amounts of data from different platforms to handle non-linear tasks and build predictive models
that can improve agricultural productivity. This study reviews machine learning based techniques for estimating
fertilizer and nutrient status that have been developed in the last decade. A thorough investigation of detection
and classiﬁcation approaches was conducted, which served as the basis for a detailed assessment of the key chal-
lenges that remain to be addressed. The research ﬁndings suggest that rapid improvements in machine learning
and sensor technology can provide cost-effective and thorough nutrient assessment and decision-making solu-
tions. Future research directions are also recommended to improve the practical application of this technology.

1. Introduction
Agriculture is the main source of food, income, and employment for
developing countries and their rural populations, especially in Africa
Preethi et al. (2020); Tapsoba et al. (2020); Collier and Dercon (2014);
Rejeb et al. (2022). Given current population growth, pressure on agri-
cultural systems will continue to increase Kamilaris et al. (2017);
Bharath et al. (2022). Many countries are agrarian and their economies
are based primarily on agricultural productivity Salami et al. (2010);
Livingston et al. (2011). African agriculture, for example, is inﬂuenced
by various factors such as climate, geography, water scarcity, spatial var-
iability of soils, and policies Aworka et al. (2022); Diao et al. (2010);
Olanipekun et al. (2019); Jayne et al. (2010). Despite the population ex-
plosion and increasing demand in the last century, farmers still suffer
from large economic losses due to under-fertilization Chivenge et al.
(2022); Jha et al. (2019). Although the amount and quality of experi-
mental data is constantly increasing, researchers are still unable to
integrate it, analyze it, and make the best decisions possible. Modern

agriculture proves that the introduction of new technologies has solved
many problems that farmers have faced in the last decades Liakos et al.
(2018); Patrício and Rieder (2018); Adnan et al. (2019); Elavarasan
et al. (2018); Babaie Sarijaloo et al. (2021). Technology transfer centers
that promote the adoption of new agricultural management practices
and the use of sensors, drones, and low-cost satellite imagery for pest
control and better fertilization should help improve the welfare of
smallholder farmers Kuijpers and Swinnen (2016); Holzworth et al.
(2015). The rise of new data-intensive scientiﬁc ﬁelds has led to this
modern agriculture, which now generates large amounts of data due
to the multitude of sensors deployed in experimental ﬁelds. Traditional
data processing techniques are not up to the ever-increasing demands
of smart agriculture, making it difﬁcult to extract useful information
from numerous ﬁeld experiments and soil tests.
Machine learning (ML) is an emerging technology that can help dis-
cover patterns in large data sets Sarker (2021). This technology makes
predictions directly from given data Ayodele (2010); Singh et al.
(2016). ML Algorithms can predict yields using fertilizer rates, genetic
data, and environmental and land management variables. Advances in
machine learning, a subﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence, are beneﬁting agri-
culture. The digital transformation of agriculture is evolving in parallel
with artiﬁcial intelligence systems in various aspects, optimizing the
ever-growing data coming from numerous sources, not only in crop dis-
ease detection, which has received the most attention from data scien-
tists Barbedo (2019). In the area of nutrient management, it is possible
to integrate and interpolate various pieces of information that have
never been explored for this purpose before. This improves the overall
understanding of agricultural systems, including nutrient requirements,
and also allows economic aspects to be incorporated into decisions.
Accurate diagnosis of current crop nutritional status and nutrient re-
quirements plays a critical role in overall farm management and im-
pacts not only the environment, but also the economic sustainability
of the farm Goulding et al. (2008); Monaghan et al. (2007); Fairhurst
et al. (2007); Dhal et al. (2022). Yield loss, under-utilization of natural
resources, decline in soil organic carbon content (OC), lower carbon
use, and other problems can be caused by either nutrient excess or de-
ﬁciency. Accurate diagnosis would beneﬁt farmers on many levels, in-
cluding yields, fertilizer recommendations, and revenue.
In this paper, we review ML based fertilizer estimation and nutrient
status algorithms developed in the last decade. Commonalities in this
area are identiﬁed, weaknesses are discussed, and possible solutions
and future perspectives are proposed. A thorough review of detection
and classiﬁcation approaches was conducted, which served as the
basis for a detailed assessment of key challenges that remain to be
addressed. This review is organized as follows: Section 2 presents
the most common machine-learning algorithms, feature selection
approaches, and performance metrics used in the reviewed work. In
Section 3, the most common features for nutrient management and fer-
tilizer recommendation studies and the methodology for study selec-
tion are presented, along with the ML-based algorithms used by each
approach. Finally, Section 4 discusses the advantages and disadvantages
of using ML in nutrient management.
2. Machine learning
Machine learning is a branch of artiﬁcial intelligence in which the
computer, referred to as a machine, learns to perform various tasks au-
tomatically Venkataraju et al. (2023). ML combines mathematical
modeling and complex algorithms to perform tasks by learning from
existing data. ML has been successfully applied in many ﬁelds that re-
quire classiﬁcation, prediction, and recommendations Abioye et al.
(2022). For example, it provides farmers with soil quality monitoring
tools and personalized recommendations based on experimental and
ﬁeld data. ML uses features extracted from known experimental input
data to develop models capable of predicting the desired outcome
from new data. Machine learning can be divided into three main
categories supervised learning, unsupervised learning and Reinforce-
ment learning depending on the desired outcome El Allali et al. (2021).
In supervised learning, an input is mapped to an output based on a
training dataset Venkataraju et al. (2023), as shown in Fig. 1. In the
case of regression, the output is a value, while the output of classiﬁca-
tion is a class. Unlike supervised learning, which is task-oriented, unsu-
pervised learning is data-oriented, meaning that the goal is to identify
patterns in data sets based on a set of features Rainville et al. (2014).
One of the most common applications of unsupervised learning models
is clustering, where data with similar patterns are grouped into clusters.
Recently, Deep Learning (DL) has gained traction in the machine
learning world as computational power is no longer a hurdle Ahmad
et al. (2022); Durai and Shamili (2022). DL is used in either supervised,
unsupervised or semi-supervised environments. Unlike the algorithms
of classical ML, which often require pre-processing of data, Deep Learn-
ing can bypass this step and is therefore better suited for unstructured
data such as images. The data is often used directly, eliminating the
human factor and automating the feature extraction step. A key advan-
tage of DL is its ability to analyze huge unlabeled datasets, making it an
invaluable tool for Big Data Analytics Najafabadi et al. (2015).
2.1. Machine learning algorithms
With advances in machine learning algorithms, even the most com-
plicated regression and classiﬁcation problems can now be solved
Tesfaye et al. (2021). In addition, many of the algorithms are available
on a number of open source platforms designed speciﬁcally for ML. Re-
gression is a part of supervised learning that provides a prediction of an
output variable as a function of input variables that are usually known
and available in these subcategories. There are many algorithms used
in almost all ﬁelds, e.g., linear regression (LR), least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator (lasso), logistic regression, and stepwise regres-
sion. Many complex algorithms have seen the light of day to solve much
more complex problems, such as multivariate adaptive regression
splines.
Classiﬁcation is another important type of supervised learning that
uses models to predict a discrete label instead of a continuous output.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an algorithm that classiﬁes data
instances by constructing a linear separation hyperplane John et al.
(2020); Karimi et al. (2006). To improve classiﬁcation, SVMs use a
kernel function to transform the original feature space into a higher-
dimensional feature space. Classiﬁcation, regression, and grouping
have all been performed with SVMs. SVMs are useful in a variety of
applications because they overcome the difﬁculties of overﬁtting that
occur in high-dimensional spaces and are based on global optimization.
Support Vector Regression, Least Squares Support Vector Machine and
Successive Projection Algorithm Support Vector Machine are the most
commonly used SVM algorithms.
Decision tree (DT) based algorithms use trees to gradually group the
dataset into smaller homogeneous subsets (subpopulations) while cre-
ating an associated tree graph. Each branch of the tree graph displays
the result of a particular pairwise comparison for a particular attribute,
while each internal node represents the comparison itself. After follow-
ing the path from root to leaf, the leaf nodes show the ﬁnal judgment or
prediction (expressed as a classiﬁcation rule). The classiﬁcation and re-
gression trees, the automatic chi-square interaction detector, and the it-
erative dichotomizer are the most common learning techniques in this
category.
The Random Forest algorithm (RF) is also widely used and consists
of a sequence of decision trees. The result predictions are combined
for better predictive performance. DT can be either a regression algo-
rithm or a classiﬁcation algorithm and represents many suboptimal
solutions. Based on a set of decision rules that follow a tree-like architec-
ture, it can make recommendations based on classiﬁed data.
Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are also supervised models com-
monly used for regression and classiﬁcation Zupan (1994); Zou et al.

(2008). ANNs use radial basis function networks, perceptron algo-
rithms, and backpropagation to build predictive models Griffel et al.
(2022). Deep ANNs, also called deep learning (DL) or deep neural net-
works (DNNs), are a relatively new branch of machine learning research
that enables computer models to represent complex data at multiple
levels of abstraction by using numerous processing operations Dharani
et al. (2021). The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is also a well-
known Deep Learning algorithm that was ﬁrst used to classify images
Wu (2017); Kattenborn et al. (2021). CNN creates an artiﬁcial neural
network that can autonomously learn and make intelligent decisions
by automatically extracting the most appropriate features from input
sequences and layering techniques Al-Ajlan and El Allali (2018a);
Farooque et al. (2023). One of the most attractive features of Deep
Learning is that feature extraction is often performed by the model it-
self. DL Models have greatly improved prediction in several ﬁelds, in-
cluding agriculture Subeesh et al. (2022); Raouhi et al. (2022); Bedi
and Gole (2021); Paymode and Malode (2022).
2.2. Feature selection
The ﬁrst step in any ML experiment is to extract impactful features
from the raw data Chandrashekar and Sahin (2014); Dash and Liu
(1997). The goal of feature extraction is to ﬁnd the most informative
group of features (unique patterns) to improve the effectiveness of
the classiﬁer. Feature extraction, also called feature engineering, ex-
tracts features from the original data to achieve accurate classiﬁcation.
Feature extraction is an important step in ML as classiﬁcation perfor-
mance can decrease if features are not carefully selected Kebonye
et al. (2022).
Feature selection, commonly known as dimensionality reduction
(DR), is a technique used in supervised and unsupervised learning to
construct a reduced dimensional representation of a dataset while
maintaining as much discriminative information as possible. To prevent
the implications of excessive dimensionality, it is frequently used before
building classiﬁcation or regression models. There are many feature se-
lection methods in supervised learning, classiﬁed into three categories,
as shown in Fig. 2. The most commonly used DR techniques are princi-
pal component analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS),
and linear discriminate analysis (LDA). However, algorithms based on
metaheuristic approaches such as genetic algorithms (GA) are gaining
ground in the ﬁeld of feature selection.
The goal of feature selection is to extract all useful information from
the data. The features are then used in the training phase to build the ML
model. Feature selection chooses the smallest possible subset of features
from the original set of features to maximize generalizability. Given
many independent variables, the feature selection function selects a
subset of variables on which to focus a learning algorithm. The model-
based approach considers the correlation structure among predictors
and assigns a value to each feature indicating how useful or important
it is for model construction. The performance of the model would not
be affected if features of little or no importance were eliminated. To
reduce dimension and select the most acceptable features for classiﬁca-
tion, dimension reduction can be paired with a feature extraction
algorithm Al-Ajlan and El Allali (2018b). On the other hand, Deep
Learning uses an alternative architecture that incorporates the process
of feature extraction from the data into the learning phase LeCun et al.
(2015); Al-Ajlan and El Allali (2018a). This crucial step has a signiﬁcant
impact on the results, as it can improve the performance of the model by
removing unnecessary and redundant features. The model becomes less
complicated and the likelihood of bias and error is decreased by reduc-
ing overﬁtting. The model gives more realistic recommendations by
selecting the most relevant features.

2.3. Performance metrics
In order to measure the performance of machine learning algo-
rithms, several performance metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision
F-Measure, and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) are commonly used
as performance metrics. In this section, we describe the metrics that
have been used in most studies included in this review such as the coef-
ﬁcient of determination R2, the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root
mean square error.
R2, or the coefﬁcient of determination, evaluates the proportion of
the variance of the target variable that is explained by the model, as
shown in Eq. (1):
R2 ¼ 1 � ∑
n
i¼1 yi � byi
�
�2
∑
n
i¼1 yi � yi
ð
Þ2
ð1Þ
Yi is the observed value of the target variable, byi is the predicted
value of the target variable, and yi represents the mean of the observed
target variables. The highest possible value for R2 is one, which means
that the model is 100% accurate. However, this value can also be nega-
tive if the model produces slightly worse predictions. In the case of
R2 ¼ 0, the model is constant and always predicts the expected value
of y, ignoring the input feature. Most often, values above 0.5 are consid-
ered good.
MAE or Mean Absolute Error is the average of the absolute difference
between the observation and the predicted value, as shown in Eq. (2):
MAE ¼ 1
n ∑
n
i¼1
��yi � byi
��
ð2Þ
The root-mean-square error (RMSE), as shown in Eq. (3), assigns a
high weight to large errors due to squaring. When the value is equal
to 0, the model is considered to have the best ﬁt. MAE is less sensitive
to large errors than R2 and RMSE because equal weight is given to
each error.

3. ML based algorithms for nutrient management and fertilizer
recommendation
This section describes various machine learning algorithms used in
the area of nutrient management and fertilizer recommendations. This
review focuses primarily on the current state-of-the-art ML techniques
for nutrient management and fertilizer recommendation. It addresses
the many factors that inﬂuence yield and how machine learning could
help predict fertilizer recommendations. Table 1 and Table 2 show a se-
lection of articles from the literature on this topic. An extensive search
was conducted to select relevant studies that use machine learning for
nutritional management of cropping systems. In the ﬁrst step, keywords
such as “nutrient management”, “machine learning in agriculture”, “fer-
tilizer forecasting” were used in various combinations including “ma-
chine learning in nutrient management”, “fertilizer recommendation
tools with machine learning” for a broad search through Science Direct,
Pubmed, and Scopus. At a ﬁrst level, publications were classiﬁed into
two general categories: Nitrogen Management and Nitrogen Phospho-
rous Potassium (NPK) Management. Only articles published in peer-
reviewed journals were selected. Although climate prediction is critical
to agricultural productivity, it is not covered in this review because ma-
chine learning applications to climate prediction are part of a separate
area of study. Finally, all articles covered here were selected for the pe-
riod from 2010 to July 2022 and found to be all within the scope of
this work.
3.1. Most common features
The best nutrient management strategies are predicted based on a
set of characteristics Khanal et al. (2018); Jian et al. (2020). For example,
17 nutrients are necessary for optimal crop development, including ni-
trogen, phosphorus, and potassium. They are all equally important to
crops, although their proportions are constantly changing. Because of
these variations, the availability of nutrients in the soil affects plant
growth, as the soil is the most important source of these nutrients for
plants. If any of these nutrients are lacking, crop yield is reduced. In ad-
dition to the nutrients already mentioned, the following section dis-
cusses some other common features that can be divided into three
categories:
Climate is one of the most misunderstood factors in crop develop-
ment Crane-Droesch (2018); Cai et al. (2019); Newlands et al. (2014).
Although it may not appear so at ﬁrst glance, water availability has a sig-
niﬁcant impact on agricultural productivity. Even low levels of rainfall
can have a detrimental effect on crops, and production can ﬂuctuate sig-
niﬁcantly due to extreme variations in rainfall amounts and periods. On
the other hand, weather conditions are more complicated than just a
rainy or dry climate. There are a number of climate features to consider.
Total daily and annual precipitation, high-yield and well-distributed
precipitation, and the Shannon diversity index (SDI) for precipitation
are some of the most common. Other characteristics include daily max-
imum and minimum temperatures and total solar radiation, pest infes-
tation under various atmospheric conditions and weather patterns.
Algorithms for nutrient management include soil type and texture,
organic matter, pH, accessible and exchangeable nutrients, total inor-
ganic and organic carbon, and the total capacity of a soil to hold ex-
changeable cations (CEC). Qin et al. (2018) created two additional
characteristics: a water table-adjusted available water capacity
(AWCwt) and a ratio of cumulative seasonal precipitation to AWCwt
(RAWCwt). Both features are used to reﬂect ﬁeld-level hydrologic con-
ditions and are dependent on conditions that are meant to showcase
how soil hydrology impacts nitrogen dynamics. Taking into consider-
ation that the amount of nitrogen lost under wet conditions is consid-
ered signiﬁcantly negative for a soil's ability to store water beyond the
saturated zone, which is generally equal to the depth of the water table.
Several soil management variables are considered and used as har-
vest management features: Planting date and density, date of nitrogen
application (both at planting and side-dress application), grain yield,
harvest key, fresh and dry biomass, fertilizer rate, and nutrient uptake
Ahmed et al. (2021). The information contained in the red and near-
infrared (NIR) canopy radiances is used mainly in common vegetation
indices: Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI)[4] and Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI)[5].
RVI ¼ ρRED
ρNIR
ð4Þ
NDVI ¼ ρNIR � ρRED
ρNIR þ ρRED
ð5Þ
Where ρRED and ρNIR represent the spectral radiances in the red
and NIR regions, respectively. These indices increase the contrast be-
tween the ground and vegetation while reducing illumination effects.
3.2. Nitrogen management based systems
In recent years, many applications of nutrient management models
have surfaced, especially regarding nitrogen recommendations, as it is
considered very important for yield estimation Puntel et al. (2016);
Dai et al. (2013); Castaldi et al. (2016); Shi et al. (2021). In the present
time, the implementation of ML techniques for N management can be
divided into different approaches such as EONR and NNI determination,
remote sensing and spectroscopy.

Determining the economically optimal amount of nitrogen can be
inﬂuenced by various factors such as rainfall and management practices.
Advances in ML paved the way for better Economic Optimum Nitrogen
Rate (EONR) predictions that take these various parameters into ac-
count. Qin et al. (2018) looked at the prediction of EONR from ﬁeld
trial data at two different time points: i) seeding, ii) split application
time points. Model-derived features such as AWCwt and RAWCwt and
weather data were used to build the prediction algorithm. RR provided
better results compared to LR, LASSO and Gradient Boosted Regression
Trees (GBRT). However, the results of this study cannot be generalized
due to the limited data sets. Ransom et al. (2019) evaluated the ability
of a set of machine learning and statistical algorithms to improve

nitrogen recommendations for corn using measured soil properties
along with weather variables from 49 sites in the Midwestern United
States. The authors examined different modeling scenarios for improv-
ing three different nitrogen recommendation tools and tested whether
adjustments for multicollinearity and accounting for the interaction be-
tween soil and weather parameters would result in improvements. Per-
formance was evaluated using the out-of-sample RMSE and included
soil and weather data prior to each nitrogen recommendation tool. RF
provided better nitrogen recommendations, but compared to the per-
formance of the models in terms of number of variables, the decision
tree provided the best ﬁt with the smallest number of variables. The
results showed that reducing multicollinearity slightly improved the
performance of the different ML algorithms.
The objective of a study by Correndo et al. (2021) was deﬁning the
importance of soil, weather conditions, and cropping management in
estimating and magnifying uncertainty in key components affecting
the nitrogen response of corn yield. When yield without fertilizer,
Yield at Economic Optimum N Rate (YEONR), and nitrogen fertilizer ef-
ﬁciency (NFE) are considered in EONR. Bayesian statistics were used for
the N response curves ﬁtting along with Extreme Gradient Boosting that
evaluates the importance of the traits in the predictability process.
EONR was the most difﬁcult attribute to estimate, with an average un-
certainty of 50 kg N ha-1. Weather accounted for about two-thirds of
the variation in estimated values for YEONR, EONR, and NFE. Uncer-
tainty in all aspects of the N response mechanism was also inﬂuenced
by weather conditions (72% to 81%). With a constant but moderate con-
tribution, soil factors explained both the predicted N response and the
associated uncertainty (10% to 23%). Model uncertainty as a form of
risk, potential seasonal weather predictions, and the development of
probabilistic frameworks to optimize this data-driven decision process
for corn nitrogen application should be considered in improving nitro-
gen decision support systems.
Wang et al. (2021b) investigated the possibility of improving in-
season N-nutrient index (NNI) along with corn grain yield prediction
by combining management, soil, and weather data with’GreenSeeker’
data, an optical sensor that instantaneously measures crop health and
vigor using NDVI. RFR was compared to Lasso linear regression (LLR),
which contains similar combined data from multiple sources, and to
the simple regression model, which uses only plant data. Studies of
corn nitrogen fertilization and crop density were conducted at four
sites in northeastern China. Using the RFR model to predict grain yield
to simulate the response of corn grain yield response to a range of nitro-
gen fertilizer applications at different growth stages is an innovative
method for seasonal nitrogen fertilizer recommendations that have
been developed. The simulated results were as good as the measured
results. The RFR model-based recommendation technique, which

combines crop sensing data with soil data, is a promising avenue for
corn nitrogen management. To improve machine learning-based N rec-
ommendation for seasonal seeding, additional data from the year of the
site, varying conditions on the farm, and sensors with more spectral
ranges are needed. Similarly, data from the RapidSCAN active canopy
sensor was also combined with Genetic*Environmental*Management
(G*E*M) information to increase the accuracy of NNI estimation in the
Midwestern U.S. under a variety of weather, management and soil
variables Li et al. (2022);
Qiu et al. (2021) presented that conventional methods for monitor-
ing nitrogen nutrient index (NNI) require manual real ﬁeld measure-
ment data, which is time-consuming and costly, red-green-blue (RGB)
imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an alternative. In
this study, six machine learning algorithms were used to extract rele-
vant data for predicting the NNI and vegetation index (VI). The results
of predicting the NNI of rice using these algorithms showed that the
methods of RF performed the best in each growing season, with the
best NNI prediction occurring during the ﬁlling and early maturity
stages. At the early maturity stage, rice NNI was found to be signiﬁcantly
related to both available nitrogen in the soil (AN) and yield. Combining
RGB imagery from UAVs with ML algorithms provided a robust and sim-
ple solution for instant validation of rice NNI that improved nitrogen use
efﬁciency and provided suggestions for precise fertilization in rice crops
despite its limited accuracy.
Modern remote sensing methods for precise nutrient management
and fertilization could then be divided into two approaches: Deep learn-
ing methods for predictions based on multiple remote sensing data or
multivariate regressions Wang et al. (2021a). Barbosa et al. (2020a)
used ﬁve input variables (nitrogen rate, seed rate, elevation map, soil
electrical conductivity, and the NDVI index) to estimate corn yield pro-
duction using a deep-learning approach, and the results were compared
with other machine learning approaches (Fully connected neural net-
work (FNN), multiple linear regression (MLR), SVM, and RF regression
models). Although a reduction in RMSE of up to 29% was validated com-
pared to the random forest, it should be noted that the deep learning
model, satellite data, required a total of 1800 plots to be deﬁned.This
study also shows that the most beneﬁt comes from the higher variability
of the spatial structure of the data. In their study, Escalante et al. (2019)
investigated the recognition performance of a set of classiﬁers and deep
learning convolutional neural networks for evaluating optimal fertiliza-
tion using RGB images as input. The average LOO cross-validation per-
formance was presented for each of the studied classiﬁers and each of
the pre-trained models. The percentage of correctly identiﬁed images
is used to quantify the performance. ANN, SVM and Adaboost per-
formed the best with an accuracy of 81.9%, 80.5% and 83.3%, respec-
tively. Considering that only visual features (Barley variety, Fertilizer
rate, Vegetation indexes) extracted from RGB images were used, these
are promising results (random guessing leads to an accuracy of 33%).
This could be due to the fact that sophisticated models are more speciﬁc
to the target they were created for, while a simple model can be more
general and captures relevant information for the representation of
images.
Yu et al. (2018) used a deep learning-based regression model with a
fully connected neural network (FNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE)
to quantify nitrogen concentration in canola leaves. SAE was used to
infer deep spectral features in the visible and near-infrared regions
from a hyperspectral image of a canola leaf, which in turn were used
as input data for the FNN to predict N content. With R2 ¼ 0:903,
RMSEP = 0.307%, and a residual prediction error RPDp = 3.238 for N
concentration, the model SAE-FNN performed quite well. The results
show that with a combination of hyperspectral imaging and deep learn-
ing, it is possible to quickly and non-destructively detect N concentra-
tion in canola leaves to provide better fertilizer recommendations.
In another study, Deep Learning was used to detect nitrogen deﬁ-
ciency in corn. For this purpose, four CNN models were pre-trained by
applied transfer learning, considering (V4, V6 and R1) as growth stages.
The leaf samples were then digitized to generate 384 images represent-
ing the 16 nitrogen treatments considered in the study. The results
showed signiﬁcant differences with respect to each growth stage. How-
ever, CNNs built using RGB images provided great results (average
61.8%) compared to traditional text-based methods (average 50–60%)
Montes Condori et al. (2017).
Similarly, in the study by Kou et al. (2022), RGB images of the cotton
canopy were acquired using a UAV digital camera. The nitrogen content
of the cotton canopy was predicted using two cotton cultivars and six
nitrogen gradients. Forty-six features were extracted from the image
after image preprocessing, and CNN were used to extract deep features.
Pearson and partial least squares were used feature selection. For accu-
rate prediction of nitrogen content of cotton crowns, manual features
were used as input to build linear regression models, support vector
machines, and one-dimensional CNN regression models. Deep learning
based features were used as inputs to build a two-dimensional CNN re-
gression model. The results were R2 ¼ 0:80 and RMSE = 1.67 g kg-1 for
Xinluzao 45 and R2 ¼ 0:42 and RMSE = 3.13 g kg-1 for Xinluzao 53, in-
dicating that cotton nitrogen content can be predicted on a large scale
using UAV RGB images and machine learning. However, the accuracy
and stability of the prediction model still need to be improved due to
insufﬁcient data samples.
In addition, soil properties such as total nitrogen can be determined
by combining ML algorithms and spectroscopy. These algorithms are an
excellent alternative to simple regression models when the goal is to in-
crease the accuracy of the regression. Partial least square regression
(PLSR) is a widely used approach for processing multivariable inputs,
extracting successive linear combinations of the spectra to achieve the
coupled goals of effectively explaining response variation and optimally
explaining predictor variation. This is the most commonly used method
in soil spectroscopy and chemometrics and has proven successful in
assessing water and nitrogen status. The availability of large data sets
coupled with better training and the provision of highly accurate
models is one of the major challenges for this system when applied to
nutritional management. Predictive models have been developed
using several technologies, including PLSR, which reduces the number
of features required, and neural networks, which compensate for non-
linearity Wang et al. (2021a); Tavakoli and Gebbers (2019); Morellos
et al. (2016). Table 1 summarizes and includes brief descriptions of
the above studies.
3.3. NPK management based systems
The development of NPK management based systems follows two
general approaches based the type of input, namely ﬁeld data (soil
tests, fertilization trials, etc.) or RGB and hyperspectral images. Yu
et al. (2010) developed a fertilizer model with data points from 10
experimental ﬁelds with 4 fertilizer rates and 14 treatments. A neural
network ensemble was presented to calculate the fertilizer rate more
accurately. The authors used K-means clustering to select the best net-
works individually and then combined the models using a Lagrange
multiplier. A fertilizer model was created using the ensemble method
for neural networks described above. In this model, soil nutrient content
and fertilizer rate are used as inputs to the neural network, while yield is
considered as an output. With this approach, the calculation of fertilizer
rates becomes a programming problem and can be used to determine
the fertilizer rate with the highest yield and proﬁt and to predict the
yield. This fertilizer model was also validated using data on the effect
of fertilizers. The results show that using an ensemble of neural
networks to predict yield is more accurate than using individual neural
networks.
According to Cholissodin et al. (2016), the integrated artiﬁcial neural
network (ANN) can not only optimize fertilizer rates for corn, but also
when used in conjunction with Bidirectional Improved Particle Swarm

Optimization (BIPSO), the fusion provides better results. The ANN ap-
proach provided good results in predicting recommendations using
ﬁeld trial data as training data, while BIPSO optimized multiple features
simultaneously, which accelerated the operation of the system. The
smallest mean square error (MSE) value was obtained by 10-fold
cross-validation, repeating CV hundreds of times. The goal of the study
was to initially use ML in pasture and rotational cropping and then ex-
tend it to other crops based on the results, which could lead to new in-
sights when used as input by other researchers. Kouadio et al. (2018)
investigated the use of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to analyze
soil fertility parameters and produce an effective yield estimate. The ef-
fectiveness of different ELM-based models based on Soil organic matter
(SOM), accessible exchangeable nutrients, and pH was tested with sin-
gle and multiple combinations of predictor variables. The results of the
ELM model were compared with those of existing predictive techniques
such as MLR and RF. The authors believe that the ELM model makes a
unique contribution to the agricultural sector, particularly in terms of
selecting optimal soil parameters for predicting coffee yields. The re-
search demonstrates the potential value of combining machine learning
with biophysical crop models. Moreno et al. (2018) found that they
could determine the fertilizers and amendments needed for pasture
production based on the major nutrients in the soil. They used a multi-
layer perceptron network trained with the backpropagation algorithm.
For fertilizers and additives, a multilayer artiﬁcial neural network was
trained with an input layer consisting of soil test variables and an output
layer with many simultaneous outputs. The MSE of the test data and its
standard deviation, and the MSE of the training data and its standard
deviation were used to determine the quality of each neural network.
The objective of the study was to develop a recommendation system
suitable for pasture cropping despite the limited amount of data.
Suchithra and Pai (2020) developed a system based on soil test re-
sults to classify and predict soil fertility indices and pH values based
on various soil characteristics. The algorithm used in this study was an
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classiﬁcation and prediction.
This algorithm provides better-generalized results by feeding forward
NN with a single hidden layer (SLFNs). The potassium fertility index
had an accuracy of up to 78%, while the pH classiﬁcation was up to
89%. The activation function in this NN that had the best classiﬁcation,
accuracy, and kappa values was the GRB function. Similarly, Timsina
et al. (2021) also compared three different nutrient management strat-
egies for common cereals considering various factors such as nutrient
use efﬁciency (NUE). A developed site-speciﬁc decision support system
Nutrient Expert (NE) was used to evaluate the nutrient balance of the
ﬁeld by analyzing past yields or costs. RF algorithm showed that NUE
for rice and P and K uptake for wheat and maize were the most impor-
tant factors contributing to grain yield. Random Forest was used in the
study by Yan et al. (2021) to quantify the relative importance of differ-
ent traits (Phosphorous (P) fertilization practices, region, soil proper-
ties, variety, and cropping system) on yield response to P and
agronomic efﬁciency of P in maize. Although this algorithm produced
very good results, Maize variety was selected as the most important fac-
tor affecting yield. The study encountered several limitations that
should be considered in future studies, such as the differences in yield
and agronomic efﬁciency between regions, the different release of
fertilizer-P in soil dynamics, and the fact that only top soil samples
were used rather than the entire soil proﬁle.
Coulibali et al. (2020) investigated and compared machine learning
and probabilistic models with site-speciﬁc predictive models for fertili-
zation of potato crops in eastern Canada. Using statistical models, potato
(Solanum tuberosum L.) performance is often associated with fertilizer
requirements. Because of the many variables involved, such as soil,
land management, genotypes, weather, and pests and diseases, it is dif-
ﬁcult to predict appropriate nutrient levels. This study compared differ-
ent models for evaluating NPK requirements for high quality and yield
as a function of soil, land management, and weather. They used data
from 273 ﬁeld trials conducted in Quebec between 1979 and 2017.
Predictions from k-nearest neighbors, RF, NN, hierarchical Mitscherlich
model, and Gaussian processes were created, tested, and compared. For
the prediction of marketable tuber yield, the ML models gave R2 values of
0.49–0.59, which were higher than the R2 of the Mitscherlich model
(0.37). Some models did not agree in obtaining optimal rates from
dose-response surfaces under constant conditions. Gaussian processes
proved to be a promising method for site-speciﬁc fertilizer recommenda-
tions that can reduce economic or agronomic risks because of their ability
to make suggestions in the context of probabilistic risk assessment.
RGB or hyperspectral images can be used to detect nutrient deﬁcien-
cies at early growth stages non-destructively. In their study, Backhaus
et al. (2011) investigated whether supervised approaches for predicting
plant nutritional status using classiﬁcation models are robust enough to
handle large data sets with signiﬁcant variance, such as leaf age or pixel
position in the leaf. The learning algorithms tested were SVM, General-
ized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization (GRLVQ), Supervised Rel-
evance Neural Gas (SRNG), and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network.
Leaf growth stage had the greatest impact on classiﬁcation accuracy,
with SVM and RBF providing reliable results and SRNG and GRLVQ tech-
niques falling to nearly determinable values. The importance of spectral
bands in predicting nutrient content was estimated using three cameras
covering the visible and shortwave infrared spectrum (VIS /SWIR). The
simple separation of pixels of veins and epidermis proved to be a source
of confounding variance for nutrient categorization in this work, but had
little effect on actual classiﬁcation performance. Leaf age had a much
stronger effect on GRLVQ, SRNG, and SVM classiﬁcation performance
(simple spectra) for nutrient states, such that it was close to the rate.
Automatic detection of nutrient deﬁciencies in leaves of oil palm using
a visual system and pattern recognition was presented by Asraf et al.
(2012). In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is also used as a
classiﬁer using three different kernels: a linear kernel, hard edge poly-
nomial kernel and a soft edge polynomial kernel. According to the pre-
liminary data, the SVM classiﬁers were able to detect oil palm leaves.
The soft-edge polynomial kernel was able to accurately classify nutri-
tional disorders in oil palm leaves with 95% correctness. Support vector
feature selection (SVFS), as a variant of SVM, showed great potential in
selecting relevant features for nutritional deﬁciencies. Images of the top
three leaves of a rice plant (Oryza sativa L.) and associated leaf sheaths
were acquired using static scanning techniques. Thirty-two spectral
and shape features were identiﬁed from these images by fusion of an
RGB mean function and a Matlab region-prop function. NPK deﬁciencies
were effectively detected using hierarchical identiﬁcation. The overall
accuracy of NPK deﬁciencies for the four growth stages was 86.15,
87.69, 90.00, and 89.23%, respectively. Validation was performed with
data from different years, and the accuracies were 83.08, 83.08, 89.23,
and 90.77%, respectively Chen et al. (2014).
In the study by Ghosal et al. (2018) individual soybean leaves that
exhibited a range of deﬁciency symptoms such as potassium and iron
were manually selected and collected in the ﬁeld by destructive sam-
pling. The leaves and charts were manually recorded with a digital cam-
era. In this way, 25,000 images were collected and labeled to create a
dataset of leaf images. The authors used a CNN classiﬁer and were able
to achieve an accuracy of 94%. In this study, a deep machine vision
based approach was used to detect early symptoms of stress. The pre-
sented method is widely applicable in modern agriculture and provides
accurate and not time-consuming immediate stress detection. This
method has been shown to be relatively insensitive to illumination var-
iations, making it a simple technique for large-scale stress detection. An-
other deep-learning approach was developed by Culman et al. (2017),
who presented PalmHand, a unique smart-device application that al-
lows farmers to detect instant oil palm deﬁciencies using leaf images.
The developed app works as an IoT device that stores and analyzes his-
torical data collected from numerous users simultaneously in the cloud.
A single MLP was used to classify oil palms into one of four possible cat-
egories. The MLP classiﬁed the image into four categories corresponding

to a healthy palm or a specimen deﬁcient in potassium (K), magnesium
(Mg), or nitrogen (N). The average macroprecision and accuracy were
0.67 and 0.50, respectively. Considering the limited dataset available
for training the classiﬁer, these results were considered promising evi-
dence for the concept. However, no information was provided on the
circumstances under which the 52 RGB images were acquired. Similarly
no details concerning the data were shared in the work of Archana and
Saranya (2020) that proposed a method focusing on macronutrients
(NPK), soil pH and electrical conductivity, and temperature to provide
the best crop recommendations. Crop rotation, fertilizer recommenda-
tions, forecasting, and crop production prediction were part of the col-
laborative proposed system. The objective of this study was to develop
a system that combines an agricultural dataset and uses a voting-
based ensemble as a classiﬁcation algorithm to recommend suitable
crops. It was found that yield prediction could be of great help to
farmers in increasing their yields. Crop rotation has shown good results
in improving soil fertility when applied regularly. This technique helps
in making fertilizer decisions that are beneﬁcial to farmers. This system
had an accuracy of 92%.
Although machine learning is widely used in agriculture in general
and in nutrient management and fertilizer recommendations in partic-
ular, the literature shows that research needs to focus on the availability
of data, including all the important factors that need to be used to over-
come the limitations Ransom et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2021b); Yu et al.
(2010); Cholissodin et al. (2016). Table 2 summarizes the above work
for the case of nutrient management subcategory.
4. Summary and outlook
The development of a nutrient management tool using machine
learning generated a great deal of interest in the scientiﬁc community,
which recognized the importance of food security and the sustainability
of its processes Thompson et al. (2015). With the revolution that our
modern agriculture is experiencing today, the use of various sensors,
smart irrigation systems, and remote sensing, more and more datasets
are becoming available Chlingaryan et al. (2018). These large datasets
have emerged simultaneously with major advances in computer
science such as machine learning, which has led to incredible break-
throughs in this research area. In this paper, we collected and reviewed
various machine learning approaches in the ﬁeld of nutrient manage-
ment. Analysis of these articles revealed that in the nitrogen manage-
ment category, Random Forests was the most frequently used ML
algorithm. The popularity of RFs correlated with better results (R2 was
up to 0.97 Qiu et al. (2021)). In the NPK category, many models such
as SVMs were used, but an RF-based algorithm gave the best R2 score
Timsina et al. (2021).
In the Nitrogen category, we can see a high presence of image inputs,
reﬂecting the emerging trend and the wide use of multi-source images
(HS, RGB, NIR, etc.). This has been enabled by the development and af-
fordability of this technology along with high computational power.
By integrating machine learning with IoT data, farm management sys-
tems are evolving into true artiﬁcial intelligence systems that provide
better recommendations and insights for future decisions and actions,
with the goal of increasing productivity. To this end, it is envisioned
that the use of machine learning models will become even more popu-
lar over time, enabling the development of integrated and applicable
technologies. Despite the great strides that have been made recently
in the ﬁeld of nutrient management, actual practical/accurate applica-
tion is currently a challenge. Many limitations have come to light that
are related to the methods used and are both intrinsically and extr-
insically related to the target problem. The current state of nutrient
management using digital imagery and machine learning was also
discussed to provide an in-depth analysis of the various challenges
faced by many researchers working on this topic. Collecting datasets
with such precise factors and for a speciﬁc crop is usually not an easy
task, considering that not all available datasets are representative
enough of the variation found in the ﬁeld.
To determine suitability for practical application, basic data from
studies of crop response to nutrients in ﬁelds with cross-validation are
needed. Soil properties John et al. (2020), plant density, weather indi-
ces, plant variety, plant growth stage and N, P, and K fertilizer rates,
are all very important and should be considered in data collection be-
cause they can directly affect the model output Trontelj ml and
Chambers (2021). Yield response can vary by plant variety in addition
to the fertilizer rate proposed by recommendation systems. In addition,
ﬁeld trials would directly impact yield and improve not only biomass,
but also solution sustainability and soil health. This practice would
shed light on forgotten features such as SOM and tillage systems, lead-
ing to a better understanding of soil dynamics and better recommenda-
tions. For example, Ransom et al. (2019) and Qin et al. (2018) tested
several models and algorithms to improve nitrogen requirement for
corn. In the case of Ransom et al. (2019), the R2 was up to 0.94, with
data sets collected from 49 experimental sites in the Midwestern
United States. While R2 in Qin et al. (2018) was only 0.46, using data
from a limited number of sites. Both studies tested the effect of ML algo-
rithms on nutrient management but reached different conclusions due
to the quality and size of the data they used.
The most critical point to mention is that many people see machine
learning as a solution to future needs in agriculture. On the other hand,
machine learning only provides the best recommendations based on the
inputs. In practice, various soil parameters need to be considered to
achieve greater or higher yields and better environmental performance
than traditional fertilizer management systems. However, to fully
understand this system, a standardized research technique based on
site-speciﬁc parameters is required. We believe that a comprehensive
knowledge of what accuracy means is insufﬁcient. As a result, different
technologies, procedures, and criteria for accuracy and good results
have been used, leading to a scenario of conﬂicting results. We also
ﬁnd that all approaches look at single procedures and solutions and
are not sufﬁciently linked to the decision process as is the case in
other application areas. The real problem is understanding the right
path to the best nutrient management recommendations and making
them accessible and understandable to farmers. Researchers should
also focus on the transition between great modeling results and tangible
practices to achieve them. From most of the articles reviewed, we can
conclude that there were strong correlations between model accuracy
and dataset size and quality. Compiling comprehensive data sets that
account for all the different scenarios and variabilities is the most difﬁ-
cult task Barbedo (2019), but is considered key to accurate results. The
ﬁrst step would be to identify the data source, which could include
ﬁeld studies and research. Second, we need to collect data on soil type
and climate from research studies and APIs. We also need data on
crop type, crop yield, and management data that can be obtained from
farmers, extension services, and government agencies. Finally, the col-
lected data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This includes remov-
ing outliers and normalizing the data to combine them into a single data
set that can be used by the ML algorithm.
However, we believe that data availability is the bottleneck when it
comes to taking full advantage of what ML can offer to the ﬁeld of fertil-
izer recommendations. We encourage researchers to share their data
with the community to enhance the capabilities and impact of the
research. We also encourage researchers developing ML-based recom-
mendation systems to suggest the best suitable features and develop
other features that can be collected at a large scale. In addition, it is
crucial to standardize the methodological approach to nutrient manage-
ment systems based on a detailed description of the entire system so
that results from different experiments and parts of the world can be
logically compared.
The accessibility of powerful machine learning tools and techniques
on many open source platforms is certainly beneﬁcial to the research

community. However, this also leads to many misleading publications
by researchers who either do not know exactly what ML expertise is re-
quired or do not have the proper soil and plant nutrient knowledge. This
phenomenon has led to a great pipe dream Schut and Giller (2020);
Lischeid et al. (2022); Paudel et al. (2021) in which scientists conﬁrm
the accuracy of their models while considering the wrong parameters.
Given the rapid progress ML has made in recent decades, it is very
likely that the world will see an increase in the applications of ML
models. The integration and applications are becoming more and
more remarkable. ML algorithms show great potential when properly
used for support or decision-making. The fusion of spectral and spatial
features and unique hybrid processing systems that complement each
other's limitations would deﬁnitely improve the understanding of soil
dynamics. This success will likely be paired with better yields leading
to a more food-secure world.
