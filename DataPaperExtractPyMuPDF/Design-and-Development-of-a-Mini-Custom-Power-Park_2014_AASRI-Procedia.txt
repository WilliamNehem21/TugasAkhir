impossible for most situations and now days cannot provide different grades of power.  In such a context a 
custom power park (CPP) can be built and operated so as to provide different grades of power to same 
ordifferent customers at different tariffs.The different grades are achieved by incorporating different devices 
in the park which will be discussed in later sections. 
The CPP concept is very much applicable to industrial or commercial areas which can account up to few 
megawatts of loads[2]. Each customer can have different grades of power depending of their load 
requirements. For example an industry or a shopping mall has critical or noncritical loads. Industries may 
have very critical loads such as process control, robotic tools etc. which   even cannot suffer small variation in 
the power quality level. The CPP will address such issues. 
In this paper the coordinated control scheme is developed to have a control of the connected equipment and 
loads so as to deliver different grades of power with load and source issues. Another important concern is 
over the voltage detection scheme. As fast the system can respond to the voltage variations the more 
effectively the system work. Here abc to dq0 transformation algorithm is used for voltage detection.  The 
shunt active filter achieves the harmonic and reactive compensation through Icos  algorithm [5]. The series 
active filter provides the voltage support and voltage harmonic compensation by a newly proposed algorithm 
which is very fast and easy to implement. The entire operation of the CPP is verified in MATLAB/Simulink 
model. 
2. Operation of the CPP 
Custom Power Park has mainly the CPP substation/park to with two incoming feeders’ namely preferred 
and alternate feeder. The park/substation consists of a STS (static transfer switch), a DG (diesel generator), 
Shunt active filter(ShAF), and a series active filter(SeAF). The park delivers mainly three different categories 
of power named as A, AA, AAA. The three different grades of power are supplied as per the customer 
demand. A category power is delivered to the least critical loads and AA to the next level of priority and AAA 
to the highly critical loads which cannot tolerate the power failure of even a second. The STS with the help of 
coordinated control can detect the voltage of the preferred or alternate feeder and switches to the higher 
voltage feeder. The power is qualified by means of the shunt active filter and series active filter which 
eliminates harmonics, sags or swells. In case of failure of both the feeders the power to the critical loads such 
as AA and AAA are provided by the diesel generator. For the time interval where the DG has to start up and 
synchronised the power to the most critical category which is the AAA are provided by the series active filter. 
3. Equipment employed in CPP For Power Quality Improvement 
The major equipment in the CPP includes 
3.1 Static Transfer Switch 
Static Transfer Switch (STS) is used to transfer the loads of the park from the preferred feeder to the 
alternate feeder in case of voltage reduction in the preferred feeder. It consists of antiparallel connected 
thyristors/gate turn off thyristors per phase. The thyristor based STS usually takes few milliseconds to half a 
cycle [6]. The GTO based switches can achieve a fast transfer [7] because of the turn off capability by 
applying a reverse current in the gate. As the load transfer is very fast and absence of commutating circuits etc. 
is indeed advantageous for the park. The only problem is the requirement of a high negative current to turn off 
the GTO. Another important aspect is the protection of equipment in the park [1].

4. Control of CPP 
In order to achieve the different grades of power it is necessary to have proper control of the devices and 
loads. The control is done by a CPP control center which continuously monitor the preferred and alternate 
voltages and based on the higher required voltage level, it switches between preferred and alternate feeders. In 
case of low level of voltages at both the feeders, it isolates both the feeders by controlling the STS. At that 
time it isolates the A loads and AA loads and control the series active filter to provide required voltage levels 
to the entire AAA loads and send signals to the DG to start up. After the DG startup it picks up the AAA and 
AA loads.   The control scheme flow chart is shown in Fig.2, which is similar to that of mentioned in [2] and 
[3] except the DG turn on and DG ready checking capabilities.Depending on the voltage detection scheme the 
speed of operation (isolation and switching) will vary.The voltage detection scheme used is the abc to 
dq0transformation method.The detection scheme is similar to [3]. The measured voltage is converted to dq0 
axis with abc to dq0 transformation technique, then passed through a second order mid rejection filter to 
attenuate the voltage transients and send to the CPP main controller for conditional checking. 
5. Simulation of  CPP Model 
The first section of the simulation shows the effectiveness of the controller for the CPP to switch between 
preferred feeder and alternate feeder so as to maintain a steady voltage at the CPP loads. The second 
sectionexplains the effectiveness of series active filter to eliminate sag/swells/elimination of voltage, the shunt 
active filter to eliminate current harmonics and reactive power requirements, so that desired voltage quality 
and levels are maintained at the AA and AAA loads. The simulation circuit is shown in the Fig.3.The load and 
system conditions are: Voltage – 415 V, A loads – 10kW, 1 kvar, AA loads - 10kW, 1 kvar, Diode bridge 
rectifier with R load, AAA loads – 10kW. In order to achieve the variation in the voltage magnitude and 
voltage harmonic injection, two programmable power supplies are used.Another power supply is used instead 
of DG. The controller for the entire system is modeled using mat lab function block.

The input to this controller is provided through the preferred and alternate feeder detected voltages. It 
checks the preferred and alternate voltages and switches as per the conditions as shown in flow chart. Up to 
0.05 second the preferred and alternate voltages are set to nominal values. From 0.05– 0.1 the preferred 
voltage is dropped to 80% of nominal value at that instant the load is switched over to the alternate feeder 
which has nominal voltage. For the time 0.1-0.15 the preferred voltage is restored to nominal voltage and 
switch back to preferred feeder. At 0.15 second both the feeder voltage dropped to 50%. At this instant the A 
loads are isolated and AA and AAA loads are taken by the DG set (assuming no delay for startup). At 0.25 
second the preferred and alternate voltage is restored and entire loads are switched to the preferred feeder. The 
various conditions of A, AA, AAA load voltages are shown along with the preferred and alternate feeder 
voltages in Fig.4. The A loads gets uninterrupted power for all times except at failure of both feeders The AA 
and AAA loads are able to receive uninterruptable power at all the times as shown in Fig.4. 
Fig.5 shows the performance of the series active filter in the park. To evaluate the effectiveness different 
events have created. The events are assumed to occur at both the feeders simultaneously. So it will affect the 
A and AA loads. Initially the system or feeder voltage is assumed to be nominal and at 0.05 s system voltage

has reduced to 70%. The A and AA loads are receiving low voltage same as the feeder voltage whereas AAA 
voltage is maintained due to the series active filter support. At 0.125s the voltage has increased to120%.At 
this event also the AAA loads are receiving nominal voltage. At 0.2s harmonics is injected to the system 
voltage and this has no effect on the AAA load operation due to the voltage harmonic compensation 
capability of the series active filter. Thus the AAA loads are resistible to feeder voltage issues.  
The performance of the shunt active filter in the park is shown in Fig.6. Up to 0.15s the shunt active filter is 
off and the source current is harmonically distorted. At 0.15s the shunt active filter is switched on, which 
makes the current drawn from the source in phase and sinusoidal by providing harmonic compensation for the 
nonlinear loads and reactive compensation for the AA and AAA loads in the park. 
6. Conclusion 
Developed a control scheme for the custom power park and the operation of the CPP is verified through 
MATLAB Simulink model. The loads of the CPP at various conditions of sag/swell etc. are receiving the 
nominal available voltage by switching between preferred and alternate feeders. The shunt active filter 
provides the harmonic and reactive power support to the AA and AAA loads and making the point of 
common coupling (PCC) current in phase with the PCC voltage. The series active filter eliminates all the 
voltage side issues to the AAA loads. The current harmonic elimination along with voltage issues suppression 
ensures the delivery of high quality power to loads. Thus the park is able to deliver high quality power than 
from a normal utility feeder for A loads and also well-conditioned different qualities of power to AA and 
AAA loads by utilizing shunt and series filters. This helps the customer to choose any level or multiple levels 
of power according to the sensitivity and reliability requirements. The effectiveness of the park can be 
improved by using special voltage detection schemes, operation with dynamic loads etc. which canbe 
considered as thefuture enhancements to this work.
