Editorial: Opening up computer science
I am proud to introduce the inaugural issue of Array, a new interna-
tional open access multidisciplinary journal published by Elsevier. In
contrast with the many specialized journals published by Elsevier or
other publishers, Array has the particularity of covering the entire ﬁeld of
Computer Science. Our ambition with Array is to ensure fast dissemi-
nation of up-to-date research results from a broad spectrum of topics,
including: Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics; Com-
puter Systems and Architecture; Computer Vision, Speech and Pattern
Recognition; Control & Signal Processing; Cyber Security; Data, Knowl-
edge and Intelligent Systems; Industrial Engineering; Interdisciplinary
Applications; Medical Informatics and Biomedical Engineering; Micro-
electronics and Hardware; Multimedia and HCI; Networks and Commu-
nications;
Operational
Research
and
Decision
Systems;
Scientiﬁc
Computing; Software Engineering, and Theoretical Computer Science.
Interdisciplinary contributions crossing boundaries within Computer
Science, or between Computer Science and other ﬁelds, are especially
welcome.
Following a current trend in scholarly publishing, Array is a gold open
access journal. This means that authors pay article processing charges to
cover publication costs. In exchange, their paper is made publicly and
quickly accessible to everyone, without the need for subscription fees. As
a result, research results are disseminated all over the world to a broad
readership, including academia, industry, and practitioners, which may
signiﬁcantly increase their visibility and potential impact.
Manuscripts to be published in Array must be novel, technically
sound, and clearly presented. Array accepts regular papers and shorter
technical notes. In addition to research papers presenting new results,
review articles as well as discussion and opinion papers are also
welcome. Together with regular issues, the journal will publish special
issues of topical interest in all areas of computer science, and we will be
more than happy to discuss suggestions for such issues with you.
The review process of Array complies with the best standards of
academic publishing. We believe that feedback from peers allowing
iterative paper improvement is an integral part of scientiﬁc publishing,
and what distinguishes it from electronic preprint repositories. Papers
meeting journal criteria will undergo a single-blind review process, uti-
lizing a minimum of two external referees. We aim at a fast review
process without compromising on the rigor and quality of the evaluation.
To achieve this goal, we have started to assemble an impressive Editorial
Board of leading researchers from all areas of computer science, to be
further expanded as the journal will get up to speed. We realize that
accepting to become a member of the Editorial Board is a serious
commitment and we would like to thank all Associate Editors for their
support.
In addition to its commitment to a rigorous review process, Array also
supports the best scientiﬁc practice, including reproducible research. In
particular, authors of papers published in Array are strongly encouraged
to make their datasets and/or their code publicly accessible via a re-
pository of their choosing.
My main purpose as Editor-in-Chief is to promote Array as one of the
best journals in Computer Science, bringing researchers from different
subﬁelds to signiﬁcantly advance the science and technology of digital
information processing and meet the challenges of the 21st century In-
formation Age. I hope that many of you will share the enthusiasm of the
Editorial board and the publisher, and I am looking forward to receiving
your best contributions.
