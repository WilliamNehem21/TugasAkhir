Abstract 
The paper realizes dual encrytions of images by using Logistic and Lorenz chaotic systems to change the the locations and 
the sizes of Pixel values. The dual encrytions hide the encripted information in the carriers and prevent it from being 
noticed, improving the safety of the information transferred. The process of decryption is the reverse process of encription, 
which withdraws the information and undergoes anti-scrambling with secret keys to restore the images identical to 
original ones. The peak signaltonoise ratio between the restored pictures and the original ones is 21.78. The experiments 
prove that this method preserves the good ramdon of chaotic order. In addtion, it makes decipher really difficult and 
therefore improves the safety of the encrypted pictures.

encryption of pictures differs from encryptions of  words mainly because of the large number of data, high 
redundance and Pixel values relations. Chaos is a movement controlled by nonlinear dynamic system. Its 
regularity, ergodicity and intrinsic stochastic properties of chaotic motion and unpredictablity makes its 
popular in encrypting pictures. Encryption transfers and hides the information before transferring in order to 
improve safety during the process. The receivers can use encryption key to restore encrypted information. 
Information hiding technology uses the insensitivity of human beings and redundancy in multi-media digital 
signals to hide secret information so that it can be safely transferred. 
2. DualChaotic systems 
2.1 Logistic Chaotic system 
Logistic projection is a very simple yet widely researched chaotic model with the definition as follows

the influence of Logistic projection with initial condition 
0x ,the chaotic sequence it produces is non-periodic, 
non-constringency and sensitivity to the initial value of the model of Logistic. 
Among chaotic systems, Logistic projection chaotic system is widely noticed because of its ergodicity 
and sensitivity to initial values. In formula (1),  
 is the coefficient, n is the number of iteration. When 
probability function distribution is

which proves the ergodicity of formula (1) and the probability density function has nothing to do with the 
initial values. Thus it provides theory for projection function to scramble pictures. 
2.2   Lorenz system  
Lorenz system is a classic three-dimentional chaotic system. Its dynamic formular is : 
                                                  
 
  (3) 
 
             
In which a,b,c are system parameters,the typical value are a=10,b=28,c=8/3,while a,c remain 
unchanged,when b>24.74 ,Lorenz system enters chaotic state. Numerical Integration can be used to solve the 
differential equations. The four-step Runge-Kutta is used to get the solution and the step size is 0.01. As a 
result, a numerical sequence is achieved at good ramdon. Lorenz system is a three-dimentional chaotic system, 
so the numerical sequence achieved is a three-dimentional real value array. The different ways of three chaotic 
encryption process undergoing single variable and multivariable make the designs of encryption sequences 
multiple. 
3. Dual Encryption of pictures based on Logistic projection and Lorenz system 
While encrypting pictures twice with Logistic projection and Lorenz system, we assume that the length 
and width of the encrypted picture A is M and N respectively.

4. Encription picture hidden arithmetic based on DCT 
DCT is a picture orthogonal transformation in real number field.  DCT can move the information in 
image to frequency domain, which takes advantage of the characteristics of human visual system and 
compacts the image while maitaining its quality. The DCT formula is as follows: 
 
                                                                             (4)

First, divide the carrier picture into several segments with different pixels. Then transform each segment 
via DCT. Take frequence coefficient matrix sized 8*8 for  example. The value of the matirx reaches the 
maximum with coordinate (0,0). 
Which is called DC. The other 63 frequency coefficients mostly approaches the  positive or negative 
floating-point numbers
which are called AC.  DC represents the brightness of the segment. The larger the 
data are, the brighter the picture will be. The high frequency parts of AC shows the complex degree of the 
picture texture. The small high frequency value reflects the smooth zone in the picture while the big value 
shows the complex texture picture. In other words, most of the picture s energy is focused on DC and some 
high frequencyAC while other absolute values of AC are relatively small
the absolute values of most low 
and middle frequency coefficients approches 0[4,5]. So DC and some high frequency AC can be characteristic 
data of the segment. Divide the encripiton picture into pixel segment of the same size, 4*4 for example. 
Replace the 16 smallest coefficient in AC of in the carrier picture segments with the information in encription 
picture. Then use DCT to get the reverse change and get the new picture embedded with encripted 
information. Fig. 3 give the carrier pictures before and after embedding the information.

The greater the differences between the size of the encripted picture segments and the carrier picture 
segmens are, the less information is changed and the embedded effect is better.But the method usually 
enlarges the picture, causes mosaic effects to some degree and wastes much room to embed information. To 
solve the problems, another way of embedding information is offered. First, change the size of the carrier 
picture and make it the same size as the encripted picture. Second, segment boththe carrierpicture and the 
encription picture by 8*8 at the same time. Third, tranform each segment of the carrier picture via DCT and 
keep only two decimal fractions of  the coefficient. Then ensure that each part is a realdecimal no bigger than 
0.01, add it to the related part in DCT coefficient matrix and finish the embedment of the data in encription 
picture. Last, transform the embedded data via DCT and get the carrier picture with encripted information. 
Fig. 4 gives the carrier picture with embedded information. 
Though there are slight differences in color, no mosaic effects appear and the visual effect is much better. 
Because the size of the segments are the same in encription picture and carrier picture, the arithmetic is much 
simplier than the privious one in the realization process. In addition, the time is shorter in the simulation 
process with the former arithmetic 15.307s and the latter only 4.1099 s. 
5.The extract and decoding of the hidden information in encription picture 
The process of extacting hidden information in encription picture is the reverse operation of encripting 
information.Through the encription key, conversion code encripting data can be easily gotten and encription 
picture can be restored through anti-scrambling data. Fig. 5 shows the restored picture.

6. Arithmetic effect measurement based on pixel 
Arithmetic effect measurement based on pixel is a quantitativen measurement which allows fair 
comparism among different arithmetics. Many distortion measures or quality measures dealing with visual 
information belong to difference distortion measures. Now the measure index in picture visual coding 
compression are Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) or Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) with dB as their unit. The 
SNR of the picture reflects the changes before and after the picture data are processed. It shows the statistical 
average of the change of the picture data. The higher the SNR is , the better the effect will be.The definition of 
PSNR is as follows

For the carrier picture, the SNR is 56.36 before and after hidding the picture information and the effect is 
good. The SNR of the original and the restored picture is 21.78 and the differeces mainly appear in the places 
where there are obvious color changes and thick complex textures.
