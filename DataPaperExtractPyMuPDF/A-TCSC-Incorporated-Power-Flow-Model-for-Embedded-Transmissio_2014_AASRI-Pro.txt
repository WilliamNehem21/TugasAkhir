their maximum limits. Hence the question of transmission usage allocation and reactive power compensation 
is of great importance. In a modern power system  Transmission usage allocation must be intended in a 
reasonable and apparent manner that is economically equitable to each and every one  market players, not 
only with the intent of correct revenue reconciliation strategies that recover system-wide transmission asset 
and operational costs, but also with the goal of increasing market efficiency. In present era FACTS devices 
play a vital role to solve the problems like overloading and reactive power compensation in efficient way. 
Many FACTS devices are used around the world to regulate active and reactive power flow along with 
maintaining desired voltage profile. The first attempt to allocate power flows was done by Bialek et al. when 
Topological Generation Distribution factors based power flow tracing were proposed in March 1996 [1], 
which explained the method for tracing generator's output. They introduce a simple topological method of 
tracing the flow of real and reactive power in transmission networks. In Feb 1997, Kirschen et al. [2] 
explained a power flow tracing method based on the proportional sharing assumption which introduces the 
concept of domains, Commons, and links. In Nov 2000, Gubina et al. [3] described the method to determine 
the generators’ contribution to a particular load by using the nodal generation distribution factors. In Aug 
2000, Wu et al. [4] explained the use of graph theory to calculate the contributions of individual generators 
and loads to line flows and the real power transfer among distinctive generators and loads. In 2009, Xie et 
al.[5] proposed and explained the power flow tracing algorithms founded in the extended incidence matrix 
considering loop flows. Similarly, the existing loss allocation methods may be classified into prorata method, 
marginal method, power flow tracing-based methods, and circuit theory based methods [6]. Prorata method  
allocated losses to load and generators in equal manner [6]. In marginal procedure, incremental transmission 
coefficients are used for allocation of transmission losses to demands and generators [7]. The use of tracing 
methods for allocation of transmission losses is presented in [8].A method based on a combination of 
cooperative game theory and circuit theory is presented in [9]. In [10] a novel algorithm is proposed for 
transmission loss allocation, which is used path integral and based on transaction strategy. A usage based loss 
allocation method is proposed in [11]. In [12] method based on circuit theory and the concept of orthogonal 
projection for pool based electricity market is proposed. FACTS device has the capability of regulating the 
power flow and voltage support at the buses. It provides the properties of both shunt and series compensations 
in order to regulate the power flow and simultaneously support the voltage at the bus. Modeling of these 
devices such as SVC, STATCOM and UPFC has been done effectively in [16, 17]. In [14] Newton Raphson 
algorithm for large power system with FACTS devices was presented [15]. 
In this paper authors presented a usage and loss allocation method along with TCSC incorporation in 
power flow model. A tracing algorithm presented in [5] is used and modified for usage and loss allocation. 
Newton Raphson method of load flow is used for power flow which is modified for incorporation of TCSC. 
Results with and without TCSC is presented on Sample 5 bus system. 
2. Proposed Matrices Methodology 
Let consider a simple diagraph G showed in Fig1.[13] 
 
Fig.1. Simple Diagraph G

 Baseem Khan et al. /  AASRI Procedia  7 ( 2014 )  45 – 50 
 
Hence from the above example for a simple digraph G of n vertices, an n by n matrix called the Kirchhoff 
matrix K(G)  or K= [K ij]  is defined as [1], 
       � � � ������������������ � �
�������������������� � ���                                                                  (1) 
Where,  d-(Vi)= in-degree of the ith vertex 
-X ij= (i, j) th entry in the adjacency matrix 
This matrix is the basis of the proposed methodology. Authors construct a power flow matrix from the 
Newton Raphson load flow. This matrix gives a complete overview of power flows in the system. It is formed 
between nodes of the system. Diagonal elements give net flows at nodes and off diagonal elements give the 
actual flows and counter flows in the system. The proposed matrix is defined as follows: active power in 
branch i-j  from bus I to bus J as P ij (>0) and total inflow at bus i as PTi 
-p

j and p

Where ��� � ��������������������� 
From the above matrix and using Eq. 1 the Modified Kirchhoff matrix is constructed as follows. Denoting 
Modified Kirchhoff matrix of a Power Network as,�� � ����
��� � � authors define the following expression 
for elements of the Modified Kirchhoff matrix:

Now from the above Modified Kirchhoff matrix, Kirchhoff loss matrix can be formed as follows:

3. Procedure for Tracing Power Flow and Loss Allocation
Authors adopt the tracing procedure which is proposed in [5]. But authors modified this tracing algorithm 
for transmission loss allocation.
3.1Model for power flow tracing 
Steps for tracing are same as presented in [6]. Power flow allocated to generators from the lines flow as 
shown in Eq. (5). For this allocation 23% share is allocated to generators and 77% is allocated to loads. For 
example the generator share situated as bus s to the line s-t is given by 
������ � ��������                                                                          (5) 
48  
 Baseem Khan et al. /  AASRI Procedia  7 ( 2014 )  45 – 50 
 
Hence eq. (5) gives the generators share in lines flows. For calculating the loads shares in line flows and 
generated power same procedure is followed. 
�� � ������
�����                                                                     (6) 
Where the diagonal matrix PLL= diag�PL1. PL2….�PLd� and R=R= PLL ���
��� T is the extraction factor 
matrix of loads from generators [6]. By using an extraction factor matrix, loads share in generating power and 
line flows is calculated.�
3.2Model for Transmission Loss Allocation 
For transmission loss allocations to generator consider Eq. (5). In this equation line flows Pst is replaced by 
the transmission Loss in lines which is coming from the elements of the Kirchhoff loss matrix. Hence 
transmission losses of line s-t allocated to generator located at bus i is given by: 
  ������
�
� ����                                                                             (7) 
Similarly transmission losses of line s-t allocated to load situated at bus j is given by: 
 ������
�
� ����                                                                            (8) 
3. Mathematical Model of TCSC 
 
Figure 2 TCSC model 
The idea of changeable series reactance is used to make the power flow model with TCSC in which value 
of series reactance adjusted to control the power flow. The modelling of TCSC in Newton Raphson load flow 
is presented in [16]. 
Power flow equation of TCSC can be written as 
PK=VKVMBKM sin(�k-�M)                                                           (9)�
QK=–VK
2BKK–VKVMBKM cos(�k–�M)                                                (10)�
Where BKM= 1/ XT 
BKK= -1/ XT, Where b XT is equivalent reactance. 
4. Result And Discussion 
The proposed matrices methodology is apply to the 5 bus structure to demonstrate feasibility and 
effectiveness of the methodology. An Executable code is developed under MATLAB. Test is conducted on 
standard 5 bus system.  For analysis bus 1is slack bus, bus 2 is voltage controlled bus and 3, 4, 5 are load 
buses. TCSC is installed between bus 3 and 4 by introduced an additional bus 6. For TCSC starting value of 
the inductive reactance is taken 0.015 pu (50% of value of the inductive reactance of the transmission line).

5. Conclusion 
Author presents a tracing based usage and loss sharing methodology with incorporation of FACTS devices. 
TCSC is incorporated with voltage source modelling structure for compensating the reactive power and 
50  
 Baseem Khan et al. /  AASRI Procedia  7 ( 2014 )  45 – 50 
 
improving the voltage profile. With TCSC power flow of transmission is increased hence transmission usage 
allocation and transmission loss allocation also increased. Voltage source modelling is used for FACTS 
incorporation because by this effect of TCSC at each iteration is incorporated in system. Further usage and 
loss allocation is done in direct way because matrix inversion is required only single time. The methodology 
is applied on sample 5 bus.
