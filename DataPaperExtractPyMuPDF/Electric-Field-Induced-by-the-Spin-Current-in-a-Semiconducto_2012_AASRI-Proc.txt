Abstract 
Using a new spin current definition the spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a weak semiconductor 
Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling nanowire (quantum wire) have been investigated theoretically. It is found that two 
nonzero linear spin current density elements take on oscillation peaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be 
changed by the number of propagation modes and Dresselhaus constant, respectively. Moreover, the spin-current-induced 
electric field has been calculated and its strength is measurable with today’s technology which can be used to spin current 
detection. Our consequences also show that the strengths of spin current and spin-current-induced electric field for the 
Dresselhaus case are smaller than that for the Rashba case.

1. Introduction 
The intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect in semiconductors has attracted intensive attentions for its 
important role in semiconductor spintronics.[1, 2] There are two types of intrinsic SOC in semiconductor 
heterojunction two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), namely Rashba SOC (RSOC) and Dresselhaus SOC 
(DSOC).[3, 4] In the situation of SOC, a moving spin is under an equivalent magnetic field with its strength 
depending on momentum of the particle. Similar to a system with an external magnetic field, it is natural to 
ask whether a persistent current exists in a SOC system.

Spin current in the ballistic systems has been investigated in several years.[4-12] However, there still exists 
a lot of debates over the correct definition of spin current.[4, 6, 9, 10] Rashba first suggested that the 
conventional definition IS=Re
�� s�
vˆˆ
 should be modified to eliminate the nonzero spin current.[4] After 
Rashba’s work, Sun et al. bring forward a new definition by using the conventional (linear) spin current and a 
angular spin current describing the spin motion and rotation, and further they also discussed the 
reasonableness of this definition in details.[5, 7-11] In the following, we will use the definition studying spin 
current and spin-current-induced electric field in a weak Dresselhaus nanowire (quantum wire), and all 
nonzero spin current density elements are calculated and demonstrated analytically.

3. Results and discussion 
In the following, the numerical examples of nonzero linear spin current density elements and spin-current-
induced electric field will be presented. The electron effective mass is taken as that for InGaAs quantum well 
m*=0.037me and the Dresselhaus constant β D=1.0�10-12 eVm, moreover, the Bohr magneton μ B=9.274�
10-24 A.m2 and the factor g=2. In the situation of hard-wall potential confining, it is assumed that the QW is 
elongated with a fixed area s=Ld and then the number of propagation modes (that is, the width of QW) will be 
decreased accordingly.[17] The initial length and width of QW are taken as L0=300 nm and d0=240 nm while 
the incident electron energies E��=Ef=5.9 meV. For one mode to four modes case the width d is taken as 80 
nm, 120 nm, 160 nm and 200 nm accordingly.

Figure 2 shows jn

s,yy, jT
s,xx and jT
s,yy (summing jn
s,xx and jn
s,yy from the 1th to the nth mode, 
respectively) as a function of no dimension coordinate u=x/d. From the figures one can find jn
s,xx and jn
s,yy  
show equal strengths and more oscillations for the 1th to 4th mode case, as well as when the number of 
propagation modes increasing, jT
s,xx and jT
s,yy also present more oscillations at the center of QW and their 
altitudes increase accordingly. It should be noted that jT
s,xx and jT
s,yy (or jn
s,xx and jn
s,yy) do not have a inverse 
symmetry relation and the altitude of jT
s,xx (or jn
s,xx) is a little larger than that of jT
s,yy (or jn
s,yy) since two 
elements are different physical quantities. Furthermore, the nonzero element jT
s,xx (or jn
s,xx) is special because 
it is the spin current density flowing along the confined x direction with the spin pointing to the transverse x 
direction. The existence of this element is due to spin precession in accompany with the electron motion.[7] 
From Eq.(15) the direction of 
ET

 (
ω
E
�
=0) can be known in the y-z plane and its strength can be expressed 
as ET =

. In Fig.3 (a)-(d), the contour patterns of ET for one mode to four modes case are shown as 
functions of u and z. One can find that ET mainly distributes at the nearby area of QW along the z direction 
and the area expands accordingly with the increasing of propagation modes. Furthermore, our results find that 
the spin-current-induced electric field for the Dresselhaus case is smaller than it for the Rashba case, moreover 
224

one can find when the number of propagation modes increases the strength of ET decrease rapidly indicating 
that the DSOC has a less influence than the RSOC to the ET.

functions of u and z. 
Fig. 4: The plots of jT
s,xx,  jT
s,yy and ET for different Dresselhaus 
constant case with three modes in the QW. 
In Fig.4 the influences of Dresselhaus constant β
D on jT
s,xx, jT
s,yy and ET for three modes case are 
demonstrated. It should be pointed out that in some 2DEG systems, the DSOC can lead to linear k-splitting 
and its strength increases with the decrease of thickness,[18] therefore, it would become comparable with the 
RSOC.[19] From the figures whenβ D increases from 1.0�10-12 eVm to 2.0�10-12 eVm, the altitudes of jT
s,xx, 
jT
s,yy and ET increase for twice accordingly and a linear increasing relation withβ D exists. Furthermore, from 
Fig.4 (c) and (d) for the case of β D =2.0�10-12 eVm (dashed line), ET can reach ~10-5 V/m which is as much 
as that of mesoscopic semiconducting ring in Ref.10. Moreover, in Fig.4 (c) the electric potential difference 
between two points (60 nm, 200 nm, 2 nm) and (60 nm, 200 nm, 50 nm) forβ D =2.0�10-12 eVm can be 
calculated as about 0.289 nV which is also smaller than it for the RSOC case. However, this potential value is 
still measurable with today’s technology [20] indicating that the spin-current-induced electric field can be 
detected which provide a way of spin current detection for the DSOC instance. 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, we have studied the spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a Dresselhaus 
nanowire (quantum wire). Using the electron wave-functions and definition of spin current, the linear and 
angular spin current densities and its induced electric fields have been calculated. It is found that two nonzero 
linear spin current density elements have peaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be changed 
by the number of propagation modes and Dresselhaus constant. Moreover, for the Dresselhaus QW instance 
the spin-current-induced electric field can also be detected which makes a way of spin current detection.
