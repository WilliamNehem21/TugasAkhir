Abstract 
Most practical target tracking are usually maneuvering, while most target tracking algorithm are linear filter. More 
estimation error is introduced from linear filter.  Nowadays more and more researchers pay their attention in Maneuvering 
Target Tracking algorithm. Particle filter has been developed for estimation of nonlinear system states.  This paper 
presents an improved particle filter, which can apply the maneuvering target tracking problem. In practice, the particle 
filter would take abundant computation for estimate the maneuvering target tracking. The ChinaGrid system use the agile 
and distributed federations to reduce the computing time, which achieve to fast resolution for particle filter computation of 
target tracing application. Lastly the simulation proves it.

solve two basic tasks. One is the estimation refining procedure, which need to infer the accurate estimation 
target position from noise measurement data. The other is to predict the target position in next time that 
information used to form forecasting windows limiting the target in the future. [2] So the kernel problem of 
target tracing is to estimate the states of the moving target, such as position, velocity and acceleration. Most 
target tracing algorithms belong to Bayesian theoretic. Kalman filter and particle filter are popular Bayesian 
filters for target tracing based on their probabilistic nature. [3] 
The paper presented by Isard is first publication for the particle filter algorithm [4]. The typical particle 
filter framework is shown in figure 1.

Fig.1. The typical particle filter 
Particle filter uses a mass of particles with the target status to approximate posterior distribution for the 
target, which main idea is from the Monte Carlo Simulation Theory. Particle filter prefer much particle 
approximation method to directly estimation. However it can improve the tracing performance, its 
computation is very high.  Only using a large numbers of particles might the particle filter achieve better 
estimation results dealing with complex target tracking. Therefore huge and highly efficient architecture is 
needed for particle filter. 
The huge sharing of computing and storage resources can be proved by the Grid technology, which uses the 
virtual method to arrange the compute mission to distributing machines. [5] So the problem in particle filter 
for maneuvering target tracing which is restricted by the capability of computer can be solved by taking the 
Grid framework. This papers proposed a framework for particle filter in maneuvering target tracing, which 
take the ChinaGrid as the base. The simulation proves that this framework can work well for complex target 
tracking.

and iterate from step 2. 
From above discussed, we can easily draw a conclusion that the more particle number is the more accurate 
the filter result is. This conclusion is agreed by other researchers [13].So we will take compute grid to achieve 
this goal. 
3. Use ChinaGrid Support Particle filter (CGSP) 
Nowadays ChianGrid has been covered over about one hundred famous universities in China, which 
purpose to build a national-wide system for grid computing to provide the service for education. The 
ChinaGrid makes use of most advanced internet and distributing computing, sharing technology. [8] 
ChinaGrid framework provides a platform for the user to development their application in the ChinaGrid, 
which is called as ChinaGrid Support Platform (CGSP). This platform works as a tool suit with API function 
for each application. The figure 2 shows the framework of CGSP. 
From the figure 2, it can be found that the Job manager module, Information Center module and Data 
Manager module is key layer for the ChinaGrid, which provide the base function. And the Security Manager 
module and Service Container module supports the whole system. Domain Manager, Grid Monitor and Portal

Engine module are the portal of the ChinaGrid. The user can obtain better service in sharing and storage 
service without thinking the whole machine physical distributing.

4. Improved particle filter 
Particle filter bases the Bayesian rule. If target state is stabilization, the filter performance will satisfy the 
practice requirement. When tracing system wants to catch a maneuvering target, the particle filter does not suit 
to this condition. And this paper addresses an improved method based on particle filter which can deal with 
maneuvering target tracing. Fig.3 shows a normal corner maneuvering route. 
From above figure we can find that in the corner of the route the target motion state, such as acceleration 
and velocity, change vary much. Almost tracing filter predicts the future position by accumulation on the 
target motion state estimation.  So in the point where target begin maneuvering, the performance decline very 
much.  
About target maneuvering, we can take it as the aberrance for target motion states. According this idea, we 
can introduce the aberrance into particle. Like nature, the preservation species take the aberrance to deal with 
circumstance variety. The improved particle filter every time will take some particles to vary states. When 
target begin maneuvering, there are some aberrant particle that can catch the target. The improved particle 
filter flow is shown Fig.4. 
To satisfy the requirement of maneuvering target tracing, tracing system must create more and more 
particles. Here we use the ChinaGrid to support improved particle filter for maneuvering target tracing. Its 
framework is shows as figure 5. 
Here we use a particle package as a interface which takes every particle as a computer unit into ChinaGrid 
to run. Because every particle is independence, so the computer for particle can be paralleled in ChinaGrid 
framework.
