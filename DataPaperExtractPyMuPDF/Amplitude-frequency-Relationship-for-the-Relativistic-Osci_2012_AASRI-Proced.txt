Abstract 
The Hamiltonian approach and the variational approach are utilized to treat the relativistic harmonic oscillator for the 
amplitude-frequency relationship. The nice reliability is shown by the result comparison with that from open literature. 
The simplicity and efficiency of the methods are also disclosed for different range of the initial�amplitude during looking 
for the amplitude-frequency relationship for the nonlinear relativistic harmonic oscillator.

where A  is the initial amplitude. This is an example of a conservative nonlinear oscillatory system in which 
the restoring force has an irrational form. The relativistic oscillator is important in physics because it is 
usually used as the basis for analyzing more complicated motion. 
2. Application of the Hamiltonian approach 
      The Hamiltonian approach has been successfully used to study the nonlinear vibrating equations [5, 6] 
since it was discovered by Ji-huan He [4]. Here, the corresponding Hamiltonian can be easily obtained, which 
reads

      This is the same as that obtained by the max-min approach in Ref. [2] (see Eq. (7) and Eq. (10) in Ref.

3. Application of the Variational approach 
      Variation is one of the two basic ways to describe a physical problem [7, 9]. Next, we apply the variational 
method [7, 9] to the nonlinear relativistic harmonic oscillator. The functional formulation can be constructed, 
which reads

This agrees well with that obtained by the Hamiltonian approach, Eq. (8); equals that obtained by the max–
min approach in Ref. [2] (see Eq. (7) and Eq. (10) in Ref. [2]).

      Though �  in Eq. (13) and Eq. (15) is different in form, we know the approximation is good compared 
with the exact one after symbolic computation with distinct initial amplitude. Maybe because the methods are 
based on energy, the resulted approximation amplitude-frequency relationship is valid for different range of 
the initial�amplitude, no matter the amplitude is large or small.
