1. Introduction 
In order to meet the requirements of speed and precision for pharmaceutical packaging machinery, the 
counting system of electronic counting-machine is designed based on DSP and linear CCD sensors [1]. 
Compare with the old system, the system resolution is higher; counting speed is faster, filling accuracy is 
much higher. Meanwhile, the system can detect tablets size and adhesion, then picks out the medicine bottle 
filled with crushing-pills. The counting system makes electronic counting-machine is much more efficient.

2. Design of system 
Fig.1 shows the functional blocks in the Counting System. As is shown in Figure 1, through the lens, the 
light shoots at the CCD sensor, and immediately the sensor converts the light into electric charge and 
processes it into electronic signals. When pills fills down through the detection channel, the light intensity in 
the detection channel will be weakened, and then the electronic signals from the CCD sensor will be changed. 
The Light source provides the system with stable light intensity. Through the detecting space, the pills image 
on photo surface of CCD sensor. TLC2543 takes the analog signal , processed by the CCD sensor, conversion 
for digital signal and the digital signal will be sent to the First In First Out
FIFO
memory for the frequency 
matching factor between the ADC(TLC5510) and DSP(TMS320VC5509).The ADC and the FIFO data-in 
operation are also driven by the timing generator.

The TMS320VC5509 gets the commands from the HMI(Human Machine Interface), and it not only 
provides the timing signal to the ADC and FIFO, but also sets the counting mode of the system. In the 
meantime, the timing generator provide timing signal for CCD sensor. The DSP continually reads out the 
image data from the FIFO by the half-full flag of FIFO until all of the data from detection channel sent to the 
synchronous dynamic random access memory(SDRAM) by itself. After a series of data processing, the DSP 
send the processing results to the HMI. The touch screen (Human Machine Interface) show the results and 
save the results to SD card automatically. 
3. Optical system 
However, on order to improve the system reliability, a reliable optical system is the key factors. In this step, 
the system coverts light into electronic. 
3.1. Design of Optical circuit 
The Toshiba TCD1209D is used as a sensor of the counting system. The device contains a row of 2048 
elements photodiodes, and the Image Sensing Element Size is 14
m [2]. The Imaging length is:

As is shown in Fig. 2, the detection distance is 400mm.So the counting system will be divided into two 
parts of CCD, and a single CCD optical circuit schematic diagram is shown in Fig.2.

The Altera EMP3064A is used as the timing generator of the counting system. EMP3064A is a CPLD chip 
with 64 micro-cells, 1250 usable gates and 66 user I/O pins.Line timing(SH),driving timing(
1and
2), reset 
pulse timing(RS), buffering timing(CP) are all generated by the EMP3064A chip, furthermore, EMP3064A 
receive the synchronous signal from DSP[5][6]. The output sequence of timing Generator is shown in Fig.3(a). 
4. Data acquisition 
The CCD sensor converts the light into electric charge and processes it into analog signal. However the 
analog signal must be transformed into the digital signal so that it can be recognized and used by DSP. The 
Texas Instruments (TI) TLC5510 is used as the ADC. The TLC5510 is CMOS.8-bit, 20 MSPS analog-to-
digital converters that utilize a semi-flash architecture [4].ALL422B is used as the FIFO, that consists of 3M-
bits of DRAM, and is configured as 393,216 words. The signals were stored and then transmitted to RAM of 
DSP. The ADC and FIFO receive synchronous sequential signal which come from DSP. The block diagram 
of Data acquisition is shown in Fig.3(b) 
5. Data Processing 
The Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320VC5509A is used as MCU. The TMS320VC5509A of fixed-point 
digital signal processor (DSP) is based on the TMS320C55x DSP generation CPU processor core. With 
performance of 8000 million instructions per second (MIPS) at a clock rate of 200MHz, the C55x devices 
offer cost-effective solutions to high-performance DSP programming challenges. The block diagram of DSP 
module is shown in Fig.4(a)
