There is growing tendency to elicit subject-dependent features from physiological data like electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals, which is the most relative one to the subject’s brain, though the behavior of this signal does not
obey any grammatical pattern. In this regard, several attempts have been made toward eliciting subject-
dependent features from EEGs to promisingly verify/identify subjects. In this paper, we have comprehensively
assessed state-of-the-art EEG features to empirically show their pros and cons. Herein the resting-EEG and ERP-
EEG of 20 healthy subjects are utilized and the conventional features are extracted from them. These features
are then fed to three types of classiﬁers. Among the deployed features, spectral coherence and correlation features
provide the best veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation results in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and equal error rate.
Empirical results demonstrate that the ERP-EEG features are more discriminative than the resting-EEG features
because they reveal the response of a speciﬁc circuit of the neural brain system.
1. Introduction
Biometric systems have been widely used in secure and ﬁnancial
organizations such as military, banks, airports, security agencies and
famous companies. Biometric systems verify their queries according to
their unique physiological data such as ﬁngerprint [1, 2]], palm print [3],
face, ear shape, iris textures, vocal tract system (speech signal) [1],
ﬁducial points of electrocardiogram (ECG) [4], distribution of electro-
encephalogram (EEG) energy in different bands [5, 6]] and DNA struc-
ture
[7].
The mentioned biometric systems suffer
from various
limitations and can be deceived by impostors. For instance, speech
recognition system can be deceived by a recorded tape; iris biometric
systems can be deceived by wearing a lens; an image or video tape is the
bottleneck of face and ear-shape biometric systems. DNA veriﬁcation
system is the most secure biometric system but its veriﬁcation process is a
bit time consuming and expensive.
ECG and EEG biometric systems cannot be deceived since these sto-
chastic signals should be directly acquired from the surface of the body.
Among the mentioned biometric indicators, it is expected that decoding
the EEG variations [8-13] provides exclusive features characterizing the
brain activity of subjects. There are some evidences about differences
among people’s brain in terms of anatomical and functional traits [14,
15]]. Moreover, it has been proven that there are some genes, which have
considerable effects over different brain areas and EEG frequencies
[16-18]. Since EEG signals represent the reﬂection of ionic currents
through exclusive neural connections of each subject, it carries speciﬁc
information and imitating of this signal is impossible. It seems that EEG is
the most appropriate technique [19, 20]] to monitor the brain activity
because of high temporal resolution, portability and low price, though
EEG suffers from some limitations such as volume conduction, common
sources, potential leakage over the scalp and additive noise (e.g., muscle
artifacts). As the research trend shows, EEG will be used as the most
effective and popular brain monitor tool in the future [21, 22]]. Never-
theless, EEG as a veriﬁcation biomarker has some bottlenecks such as
noisy recording and also its content is inﬂuenced by stress and mood.
A few attempts have been made to extract exclusive brain signature
for each subject by applying a suitable transform to his/her EEG signals
and considering the elicited coefﬁcients as his unique mental features.
Fraschini et al. [23] investigated the possibility of person identiﬁcation
by measuring the brain functional connectivity. Nonetheless, this feature
is sensitive to the phase difference between each pair of EEG channels.
They estimate functional connectivity between electrodes using the

phase lag index and then, generate the connectivity matrix. Afterward,
the weighted network is estimated from the connectivity matrix and the
nodal eigenvector centrality is computed. The highest recognition rate is
obtained in the Gamma and Beta bands, while other frequency bands
yield poor results. Their results show that using functional connectivity
improves the performance compared to that of power spectrum features.
Rocca et al. [24] propose the spectral coherence-based connectivity
between different brain regions which measures the extension of corre-
lation function in the frequency domain. They execute this method over
108 subjects and obtain 97.5% and 96.3% veriﬁcation accuracy during
eye-closed and eye-open conditions, respectively. These convincing re-
sults are achieved in the Alpha and Delta bands. Gui et al. [25] evaluate
two similarity features for EEG-based identiﬁcation: Euclidean distance
and dynamic time wrapping (DTW) methods. Their results on the chan-
nel Oz provide the best identiﬁcation accuracy for both mentioned fea-
tures. Using Euclidean distance yields 80% accuracy over 30 subjects,
while the best accuracy of DTW yields 68% veriﬁcation rate. Zhao et al.
[26] implement a security system verifying the users (4 females and 6
males) directly from their EEG signals. After preprocessing stage to
remove frequency interference and artifacts, they extracted features
including coefﬁcients of autoregressive (AR) model, power spectrum and
center frequency (frequency which makes the power spectrum maxi-
mize) from EEG signals. Then, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁer is
applied to classify the obtained features with the average accuracy of
97.63%. Huang et al. [27] extract equivalent root mean square values
from scalp EEGs and apply them to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural
network. Their results over 45 subjects yield 100% veriﬁcation rate while
it provided 95.1% over 122 subjects.
It is noteworthy to say that the veriﬁcation results over the occipital,
temporal and parietal lobes are much higher than the other scalp parts in
the eye-close condition [16], while the veriﬁcation results are proper
over the anterior part under the eye-open state [16]. Therefore, a few
studies are conducted to verify the subjects by employing less number of
EEG channels (e.g., only one on the occipital lobe). Riera et al. [28]
propose an EEG-based authentication system by using just two dry
electrodes (Fp1 and Fp2). They recorded EEG signals from the subjects
within the interval of 34 � 74 days. AR coefﬁcients, power spectral
density (PSD) and three statistical measures are extracted from their EEG
signals. They have achieved the veriﬁcation rate of 98.10% over 51
registered subjects and 36 intruders.
Another EEG based subject-dependent biomarker is the pattern of
evoked related potential (ERP) which has been used for subject veriﬁ-
cation [29]. ERP shape reﬂects valuable information about high-level
neural processing like attention and memory. Armstrong et al. [30]
extract
ERP
template
by
synchronous
averaging,
and
then
subject-dependent features are elicited from the ERP of each subject.
They ﬁnally apply their subjects’ ERP features to different classiﬁers and
achieve 82–97% veriﬁcation rate. They have achieved the identiﬁcation
rate of 92% for cross-correlation, 89% for divergent auto-encoder
(DIVA), 82% for Naive discriminant learning (NDL) and 83% by sup-
port vector machines (SVM), respectively. In addition, their ﬁndings
imply the stability of the ERP features through six months recording.
Das et al. [31] extract spatio-temporal patterns from visual evoke
potential (VEP). They show that the subject-dependent information of
ERP component, over the occipital region, occurs from 120 to 200 ms
after the visual stimulus. Palaniappan [32] have recorded EEG signals
through a speciﬁc mental task from several subjects in order to verify
them. In this regard, they have extracted AR coefﬁcients, PSD differences
over the inter-hemispheric channels, linear complexity and approximate
entropy from the EEG signals. They propose a modiﬁed four fold cross
validation procedure to demonstrate the robustness of this authentica-
tion system against impostors.
This study aims to investigate the performance of state-of-the-art
signal processing techniques to characterize the EEG signals of 20 sub-
jects, in both resting and cognitive state, for an EEG-based authentication
system in both identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation modes. The candidate
features in this study are local binary pattern (LBP) [33, 34]], AR co-
efﬁcients, wavelet coefﬁcients, eigen-vectors of principal component
analysis (PCA), correlation value, spectral coherence and phase differ-
ence. The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. The description
of the collected dataset is brought in Section 2 and the explanation of the
extracting features are brought is Section 3. Classiﬁers are discussed in
Section 4. Experimental results and discussions are illustrated in Section
5. The paper is ﬁnally concluded in Section 6 and a horizon for the future
work is suggested.
2. Data collection
Twenty subjects (all male and healthy) have voluntarily enrolled in
this study. The average of their age is 33.4 years old with standard de-
viation (Std) of 9.29. They have had no history of pain, neurologic and
psychiatric disorder. During the EEG recording, each participant is seated
on a comfortable chair with open eyes. To mitigate the effect of muscle
artifact, the neck is ﬁrmly supported by the chair, and the feet are rested
on a footstep. In this study, the signal recording process can be divided
into two phases, where the resting-EEG and ERP-EEG signals are caught
from the same subjects. In the ﬁrst recording state, the participants do not
perform any mental task and no stimulus is imposed. Each trial recording
takes 2 min. In the second recording state, ERP-EEG signals are recorded
through oddball stimulus paradigm (cognitive task), where audio stimuli
are randomly applied to the subjects. The participants are asked to
discriminate the infrequent target stimuli (high pitch beep) from the
frequent standard stimuli (low pitch beep) by pressing a button. The
cognitive ability of distinguishing between the low and high tones is
conﬁrmed before beginning the experiment. This cognitive experiment
takes 20 min for each subject.
Electrophysiological data are recorded using a Neuro-Scan 24 chan-
nels Synamps system, with a signal gain equal to 75 K (150- at the
headbox). Through the recording paradigm, EEG signals are caught from
20 electrodes (Fpz, Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, T3, C4, T4, Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, P3,
P4, T5, T6, O1, and O2) via an Electrocap molded according to the 10–20
standard system with reference to linked earlobes plus vertical electro-
oculogram (VEOG) and horizontal electrooculogram (HEOG). The sam-
pling rate of the EEG setup is 200 Sa/s. The blink artifacts are corrected
using an efﬁcient technique, which is described in [35, 36]]. In the ﬁrst
preprocessing phase, the artifacts are eliminated by an experienced
physician using visual inspection. In addition, the EEG signals are ﬁltered
by a band pass ﬁlter with cutoff frequencies of 0.5 and 45 Hz.
3. Methodology
In this Section, state-of-the-art features for the EEG-based authenti-
cation systems are brieﬂy explained.
3.1. Local binary pattern (morphological feature)
Local binary pattern (LBP) [33, 34]] is an efﬁcient descriptive method
for texture analysis. For each sample in the signal, this feature is
computed by comparing the current sample value to its left and right side
neighbors and therefore, it measures the local variation for each sample.
LBP feature is computed as:
LBPLHSðx½n�Þ ¼

where x½n� represents the nth sample of signal x, Lis the number of

samples considered on either side of the current sample. Here L is set to 8
and the function Sis deﬁned as follows:
SðpÞ ¼
�
1ifp � 0
0otherwise
(4)
3.2. Spectral coherence
Spectral coherence [24] quantiﬁes the level of synchrony between
two stationary signals at a speciﬁc frequency f. This feature for two EEG
channels (i and j) is estimated by:
cohi;jðf Þ ¼
��Si;jðf Þ
��2
Sj;jðfÞ:Si;iðf Þ
(5)
where Si;jðfÞ is the cross spectrum between the ith and jth channels, Si;iðfÞ
and Sj;jðfÞ are the respective auto-spectra. cohi;jðfÞ ¼ 0 is occurred when
no synchrony exists at the frequency f, and cohi;jðfÞ ¼ 1 shows the
maximum synchrony is happened at frequency f.
3.3. Phase difference
The phase lag index (PLI) [23] is estimated using pair-wise statistical
interdependence between EEG time series in two different channels. In
contrast to spectral coherence, PLI reveals the features related to volume
conduction, common sources and active reference; therefore, it presents a
more suitable estimation of functional interactions among the brain re-
gions. The PLI varies between 0 (interaction with zero-phase lag) and 1
(maximum interaction), and it evaluates the asymmetry of the distribu-
tion of instantaneous phase differences between pairs of channels. The
PLI is determined as:
PLI ¼ j〈signðsinðΔϕðtkÞÞÞ〉j
(6)
where Δϕ is the difference between instantaneous phases for two time
series in the interval ½ � π; π�, tk are discrete steps and 〈:〉denotes the
average over the time. Finally, a functional connectivity matrix con-
taining the PLI values between each pair of electrodes is obtained.
3.4. Wavelet coefﬁcients
Wavelet transform [37] has been repeatedly used for analyzing EEG
signals and representing its content in both time and frequency domains.
In fact, wavelet transform is a bank of ﬁlters, which their bandwidths are
set in a dyadic manner [38]. Wavelet coefﬁcients c(j,k) of the mother
wavelet Ψ j;kðnÞ (jth scale and shift k), is determined by the following
relation:
cðj; kÞ ¼
X
n2z
f ðnÞΨ
�
2jðn � kÞ
�
(7)
where f(n) is the input discrete signal. After decomposing each EEG
channel into m scales, ﬁve features are extracted from each decomposed
signal within a time frame. These features are the energy, maximum,
minimum, mean, and standard deviation of the decomposed signals. In
this research, the number of extracted features from 20 EEG channels for
the 5 scale became 5 � 5 � 20 ¼ 500.
3.5. Principal component analysis (PCA) features
PCA [39, 40]] is an orthogonal linear transform which projects a high
dimensional input to a lower dimensional subset of features, where the
new features are orthogonal and independent to each other. This feature
reduction is carried out by multiplying the input vectors to the
eigen-vectors,
corresponding to
the
larger eigen-values.
Given a
threshold determines the informative eigen-vectors in which data is
scattered along those directions (just features with a high variance are
selected). First, the employed EEG signals are segmented into successive
1s windows. Next, the covariance matrix of EEG signals is estimated for
all channels and 20 eigen-vectors are extracted. For each time-frame over
20 channels, 20 � 20 ¼ 400 features are generated.
3.6. Correlation-based features
The correlation [41] between different EEG channels is determined
by the following function:
RxðτtÞ ¼ E
�
xðt þ τtÞxTðtÞ
�
(8)
where τt is the time delay between a signal and its shifted version. The
cross-correlation value is determined between two by two EEG channels
and therefore, 20 � 20 ¼ 400 features are produced for each time frame.
In fact, these features contain spatio-temporal information of the 20 EEG
channels. Fig. 1 depicts stages of the implemented correlation-based
feature.
1. Estimate time delayed covariance matrix between two consecutive
EEG frames as

where the covariance matrix Ri
xðτtÞ includes spatio-temporal information
of EEG signals in each time frame.

T � 1
where T shows the number of trials.
3. Arrange the elements of ﬁnal matrix ~RxðτtÞ into a vector.
3.7. AR coefﬁcients
One of the most powerful tools for signal modeling is the autore-
gressive (AR) model [42], in which a sample is predicted according to the
weighted average of its p former samples, where p determines the model
order. A stationary signal x[n] is modeled by the following relation:
x½n� ¼
X
p
i¼1
baix½n � i�
(9)
where bai denotes the AR model coefﬁcients. In this paper, the Burg
method is employed to estimate the AR coefﬁcients based on the sum-
mation of both forward and backward prediction errors. In addition, the
ﬁnite sample criterion [42] is used to select the best order of the AR
model, considering the residual variance and the prediction error. In this
study, the best order of AR model is set to 8; therefore, the number of
elicited features for 20 channels becomes 160.
4. Classiﬁers
In this part, we introduce the k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support
vector machine (SVM) and random forest. Although kNN [43] is not a
new method, it is still used in wide range of applications, especially for
those multi-class problem that the distribution of their classes is multi-
modal. kNN is famous due to its simplicity, interpretability and good
performance. kNN is a lazy classiﬁer in the recall phase while it is the
only classiﬁer that does not need any training phase. kNN is a local
classiﬁer and for each test sample x0, its k nearest neighbors should be

Array 6 (2020) 100026
3
found and the label of samples, with majority vote, is assigned to x0.
Through the cross validation phase, the value of k is set to 5.
Support vector machine (SVM) [44] is designed based on the statis-
tical learning theory. SVM tries to maximize the margin width simulta-
neous with minimizing the empirical error in order to provide a good
generalization property. Using kernel function maps the input samples to
a new high dimensional space that probability of separating the projected
samples by a hyper-plane is increased.
Random forest [45] classiﬁer is operated by constructing an ensemble
of decision trees in the training phase and predicts the label, which is the
mode of the classes of the individual trees. Decision trees work by
choosing the ﬁnest feature to divide the data and expanding the leaf
nodes of the tree until the termination criterion is met. In these tree
structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent con-
junctions of features that lead to those class labels. After the construction
of the decision tree, a tree-pruning phase is applied to diminish the size of
the decision tree. Pruning is supported by trimming the branches of the
initial tree to simplify the interpretation capability of the decision tree.
5. Experimental results and discussion
In this section, the veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation results are sepa-
rately illustrated in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and equal error rate
(EER). The results are demonstrated for three authentication scenarios in
terms of the resting-EEG, ERP-EEG and averaged ERP. In the identiﬁca-
tion system, we are confronted with a multi-class problem, where the
outputs of each classiﬁer could be 1 to N (where N is the number of
participants). On the other hand, in veriﬁcation system, we are faced
with a two-class problem, where each EEG signal could be classiﬁed
either as authorized user or impostor.
In the ﬁrst stage, both resting-EEG and ERP-EEG signals are divided
into successive 1 s windows (except for wavelet transform that the
window length is set to 4 s). The successive windows have 50% overlap.
The mentioned features are extracted from each windowed signal, then
these features are applied to kNN, SVM and random forest classiﬁers.
Results in Tables 1–3 demonstrate the identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation
accuracy (in terms of mean and Std) over twenty healthy subjects. In this
study, SVM uses linear kernel function, and sequential minimal optimi-
zation (SMO) for objective-function minimization. In addition, for opti-
mizing the hyper-parameters of each SVM, an interval is considered for
the parameter C and SVM is run for different values of C (in the train set)
and the best value of C is selected. Since the SVM is binary classiﬁer (only
two classes), in identiﬁcation task, K(K – 1)/2 binary SVM models using
the one-versus-one is applied where K is the number of class labels.
As we see, the results of ERP-EEG using different features are
signiﬁcantly superior to that of the resting-EEG features. This is therefore
ERP-EEG features reveals the high-level activity of neural systems (e.g.,
attention, memory and cognition) rather using the resting-EEG which
reveals the integration of the whole activities of the brain system.
Tables 1–3 show that both spectral coherence and correlation are the
most accurate methods for both EEG-based identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation

The signiﬁcance of the ERP-EEG results implies the uniqueness of the
cortical activities for each subject. On the other hand, the brain is an open
system (cybernetic) and it receives several inputs from the ﬁve types of
sensors along with cortical activities during the mental and emotional
excitation. Therefore, unlike several attempts for distinguishing subjects
according to their resting-EEG features, the identiﬁcation result is not
promising due to the wide range of factors inﬂuencing the EEG signals
[14]. Our results on the ERP-EEG signals over three classiﬁers show that
the spectral coherence and correlation have the best discriminative in-
formation for the person identiﬁcation task. The Student’s t-test is
applied to determine the difference between the efﬁciency of the
mentioned features is signiﬁcant or not. The signiﬁcance level of p < 0.05
is considered statistically signiﬁcant. Our statistical evaluation over the
three classiﬁers shows that these two features (spectral coherence and
correlation) are signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) superior to the other compared
features.
Both correlation and spectral coherence can measure the relationship
between two signals. Coherence value is a correlation coefﬁcient in the
frequency domain, while the correlation feature shows the similarity of
signals in the time domain. Spectral coherence measures the degree of
linear dependency of similar frequency components between two signals.
In other words, it can measure the degree of information ﬂow between
groups of neurons activities of the EEG signal. The excellent results given
by the correlation and spectral coherence show the way which functional
networks can cooperate with each other during neurocognitive pro-
cesses. These are a high-resolution way to quantify the degree of dynamic
connectivity between the diverse areas in the brain [46, 47]]. Addi-
tionally, our results show difference between the efﬁciency of wavelet
coefﬁcients in Tables 1–3. Since wavelet decomposition adaptively pro-
vides dyadic resolution over the frequency range, these frequency di-
visions are matched with the EEG standard bands. However, the accuracy
of wavelet may be changed with several factors such as mother wavelet
and number of decomposition levels. Efﬁciently setting of these factors
will lead to high veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation accuracy.
In addition to the classiﬁcation accuracy, false accept rate (FAR) and
false reject rate (FRR) and EER are measured [48]. A False acceptance
allows an impostor to get an access, and a false reject denies an access to
the enrolled user. These criteria are simply deﬁned below:
FAR ¼ Number of accepted impostors
Total number of impostors
(10)
FRR ¼ Number of rejected genuines
Total number of genuines
(11)
EER ¼ FAR þ FRR

Tables 4–6 show the EER (%) for the deployed resting-EEG and ERP-
EEG signals in both veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation systems. Our results
shows that the random forest and kNN obtain the better results in com-
parison with SVM.
It is noticeable to state that specialists visually analyze the ERP
waveforms for diagnosis purposes by measuring their amplitude and la-
tency. In this regard, the ERP signals are extracted from the EEGs and
then applied to the classiﬁers to see how discriminative these waveforms
are for authenticating the subjects. The ERP-EEG epochs following a
given stimulus are averaged (over 80 stimuli) to remove the background
EEG, for eliciting the ERP template. Fig. 2 shows the extracted ERP signal
on Fz, Cz and Pz channels for a randomly selected subject. Since the most
of classiﬁers require multiple examples from each participant in order to
learn input–output mappings robustly; consequently, it is not sufﬁcient to
simply create one ERP trial from each participant for training of the
classiﬁers. A bootstrapping procedure is applied to both train and test
data, where 100 ERP trials are generated for each participant [30].
Finally, the samples of ERP waveform are considered as features to be
applied to kNN, SVM and random forest classiﬁers. Table 7 shows the
accuracy and EER for the ERP-based veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation sys-
tems. Unlike our expectation, the classiﬁcation results show the ERP
waveforms are not suitable for the identiﬁcation task, while its veriﬁ-
cation results are plausible.
Despite the achieved excellent ERP-EEG based veriﬁcation and
identiﬁcation results, there are certain aspects that may need further
investigation. These important points are:

� The important limitation that must be addressed in future work is the
sample size. The sample size is small in our study. To prove the use-
fulness of these tools for subject identiﬁcation task, these measures
should be applied to larger population. Since, a normal EEG varies
with the age, these features must be applied to study of EEG signals
during different intervals of age (it is shown that EEG in childhood
generally shows slower frequency oscillation than an adult).
� EEG recording in the resting state needs no active involvement of
subjects during the recording; therefore, the probable effect of mental
fatigue is highly reduced. Moreover, our results show the existence of
exclusive information in the resting-EEG of each subject, which is
emerged from the exclusive connections in the brain system of each
subject [24]. EEG signals in the time domain obey not grammatical
behavior and they behave like a white/color noise, nonetheless it
seems that the subject-dependent information is captured through
this signal. It is shown the power spectrum of EEG signal, especially in
the range of Alpha band contains subject information that can be used
in person veriﬁcation [49].
6. Conclusion and future work
In this paper, we investigate the role of state-of-the-art features in
veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation of subjects via classifying their resting-
EEG, ERP-EEG and the averaged ERP features. The universality,
measurability, uniqueness and robustness against fraudulent attacks are
favorite characteristic of use of resting-EEG and ERP-EEG signals for
human recognition. As we have expected, the veriﬁcation results provide
more accuracy rather the identiﬁcation results in terms of classiﬁcation
accuracy and equal error rate. This difference is emerged from this fact
that the identiﬁcation process is a multi-class problem (in this research
20 classes), while the veriﬁcation process is a two-class problem. More-
over, the results of ERP-EEG features provide higher accuracy rather than
the two other approaches, because ERP-EEG contains the information of
both background EEG and ERP, which are richer than each of them.
Although ERP has a grammatical pattern and reveals the response of a
speciﬁc sub-system of the brain, the background EEG contains unique
information for each subject and combination of them provide robust
features. We suggest the ERP-EEG based authentication system as an
efﬁcient biometric tool due to its convincing results.

� Our results demonstrate that the ERP-EEG signals have high inter-subject variability and low inner-subject reliability; therefore, ERP-EEG-based individual iden-
tiﬁcation is a good candidate to design a reliable authentication system (in conﬁrmation with previous studies [30, 50]]). Nonetheless, to address the robustness,
participants should return to the EEG lab after their ﬁrst session to analyze the stability of our results over the time.
� EEG signals may be inﬂuenced by motion artifacts and body movement. In order to reduce the effect of these undesired components, it is essential to select better
ﬁltering algorithm to obtain signals with better quality. ERP is less sensitive to the background noise (the ongoing EEG) because the background EEG and additive
noises behave like the white/pink Gaussian noise and therefore they are attenuated and faded through the averaging. Synchronous averaging assumes the ERP
template is fairly constant in response to each stimulus and through the long time, brain fatigue leads to skew the ERP latency and amplitude.
� The quality of EEG depends on the quality EEG setup. An apparatus with more number of electrodes (e.g., 128 or 256) is usually more accurate and if the process is
performed by a high quality apparatus with dense array, the results might be increased due to covering more spatial resolution and better quality of signals. Although
the results are acceptable with 24 electrodes, the acquisition of EEG signals with more number of electrodes will deﬁnitely add more discriminative information.
