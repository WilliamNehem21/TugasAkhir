1. Introduction 
Recently developments with short-term and lower cost are strongly required for shorten products life cycle. 
Therefore Taguchi-methods [1],[2]� are used for deciding optimum process conditions. However these 
methods are not enough to develop a new product with short time, lower cost, high quality and high accuracy. 
In this research, the software for innovative tool using Taguchi-methods is developed and evaluated. There 
are two trials in the innovative tool using Taguchi-methods. First trial investigates rough fuctions regarding all

levers of all control factors, then important control factors and meaningless control factors were sorted with 
the several comments for the second trial. At that time, maximum, intermediate and minimum values for each 
lever of the each control factor should used for pursuit of all possibilities. Second trial decides the optimum 
combination of the control factors by more detail trial using only important control factors. The second trial is 
tried for getting the best combination using the optimum level of each control factor. The optimum condition 
regarding cooling system for cutting was investigated for evaluating this innovation tool in the experiment. 
2. Explanation of Taguchi-methods 
The Taguchi-methods is used to decide optimum processing conditions with narrow dispersion for robust 
design. Therefore the Taguchi-methods is explained in this section. 
Control factors are equal to the design factors (See the control factors in Table 1). Noise factors are 
occurred for the error of function on the product (See the noise factors in Table1). Most designer can 
understand that the final functions of the developed product are strongly influenced for the each lever of each 
control factor under several noise factors. All combinations using all control factors are compressed by an 
orthogonal table (See the orthogonal array in Table 2).Then the experiment or the CAE analysis with 
influence of noise factors is performed by the orthogonal array. At last, the average and the standard deviation 
regarding all combinations using all control factors are calculated for the SN ratio and Sensitivity. Then most 
of users write the effective figure (Fig. 1) of the control factors and zealously search the combination of the 
control factors for large SN ratio. A product using the combination isn’t nearly influenced by noise factors.

3. Algorithm for innovative tool 
Now, innovative development with short-term, low cost, labor saving and energy-saving is also required in 
the world. Therefore, in this research, the software for innovative tool using Taguchi-methods is developed 
and evaluated. At first, first trial investigates rough fuctions regarding all levers of all control factors, then 
important control factors and meaningless control factors were sorted with the several comments for the 
second trial. At that time, maximum, intermediate and minimum values for each lever of the each control 
factor should used for pursuit of all possibilities. Then second trial decides the optimum combination using 
the levels of the control factors by more detail trial using only important control factors. The second trial is 
tried for getting the best combination using the optimum level of each control factor.  
The control factors consist of digital data and non digital data.  When these data are inputted in the 
software of Taguchi-methods, the results of the effective figures for both SN ratio and Sensitivity can 
calculate such as Fig. 2. In case of Taguchi-methods, after several evaluations were performed by using the 
effective figures, the trial was completed. Therefore our original system starts from here; then Fig. 2 is 
rewritten to Fig. 3. At that time, horizontal axis is the levels of the each control, and vertical axis is used the 
average of function (desired property) or it standard deviation. In case of the digital data, a line graph is used 
such as Fig. 3(a), and in case of the non digital data, a line graph is used such as Fig. 3(b). Everyone can 
intuitively and visually feel the influences of the control factors by using the Fig. 3, can grasp for the physical 
image regarding the influences of the control factors. In case of the line graph, then the working of curb fit is 
performed by using exponential, linear, logarithmic, polynomial and radical approximations. In here, an 
operator can intutively understand the influences of the control factors. In case of a bar graph, Fig. 3(b) could�
not change to Fig. 4.

Fig.4. Recommendation of the levels for 2nd trial using the results of the 1st trial 
The optimum levels of the control factors  for  the second trial were decided by using the results of the first 
trial. The method for selection of the optimum levels of the control factors is shown in Fig. 4. In the 
explanation, it suppose that the larger function is desired by everyone. The curve of Fig. 4(a) has a mountain 
shape,  there is the optimun lever of the control factor in the region of first trial. Therefore new level 2’ is 
decided to the top of the mountain, new level 1’  is middle between the old level 1 and the new level 2’ , and 
new level 3’ is middle between the new level 2’and the old level 2. Level 1’, lavel 2’ and level 3’ are the 
optimum levels for the second tiral. The curve of Fig. 4(b) has a shape of graph rising to the right,  there is the 
optimun lever of the control factor in the right region of first trial. Therefore new level 3’ is decided to the 
practicable large value, new level 1’ and new level 2’ devide into three regions between the new level 3’and

operator can estimate stability for the noise factors. 
4. Experimental results for evaluation 
At last, wet cutting using strong alkaline water with air of optimum quantity was used for evaluation of the 
innovative tool. Experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 5. Micro bubble is always supplied for high heat transfer 
coefficient in strong alkaline water. The strong alkaline water with micro bubble is dew from the vessel and is 
supplied to the blender for air. Air is also supplied to the blender for air by the compressor. Strong alkaline 
water and air are mixed in the blender for air and are supplied to the nozzle for outlet. 
In the manufacturing field, everyone is desired high heat transfer coefficient. Therefore heat transfer 
coefficient is used for the function in the proposed innovative tool. The control and noise factors for first trial 
are shown in Table 3. Then, the optimum quantities of strong alkaline water and air were investigated for high 
cooling efficiency in the experiment with Table 3. At that time, the proposed innovative tool was used for

system. The results (Brown square) trial and The optimum conditions (Green arrow) decided after 2nd trial 
Results of the first trial are shown in Fig. 6. There are the results of the first trial (Blue line) and the results 
of the recommendation area (Light green area) of the levels for 2nd trial in Fig.6. Shapes of graphs in (b) and 
(d) are mountain shape. Therefore middle region were selected for the second trial regarding (b) and (d). As 
(a) and  (c) were graphs  rising to the left and right, therefore the more left region and the more right region 
were selected for the second trial regarding (a) and (c), respectively. 
The control factors and the noise factors for the second trial are also shown in Table 3. After the 
experiment with Table 3, the experimental results of the second trial were calculated by the proposed 
innovative tool (Brown square). The�results of the second trial are also shown in Fig. 6. Averages of heat 
transfer coefficient for the second trial were larger than those for the first trial. The proposed innovative tool 
could estimate the good region for the second trial. The optimum levels of the each control factor are decided 
by using Fig. 6 (Green arrow). The optimum condition are also shown in Table 3 (       ); Optimum length L
mm of hose between the blender for air and the nozzle for outlet is 70 mm, optimum air pressure P is 0.2 MPa, 
optimum quantity of flow for strong alkaline water Q is 6.0 l/min and optimum distance D mm between the 
nozzle for outlet and the sensor is 200 mm. And heat transfer coefficient of the proposed cooling system with
