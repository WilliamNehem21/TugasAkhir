Currently, there are mainly the range based localization methods and the range free localization methods in 
wireless networks. The rangebased localization methods as proposed in [10][8][4], localize nodeswith 
property measurement.On the other hand, the rangefree localizationmethods proposed in [5][2][3][9]localize 
anchors without property measurement. We can tolerate that the website with bad content such as sex and 
violence are banned for the common good of society[5], but it may be a big pity that some websites with 
academic disputations are banned so not reachable only for political reason. [6]Moreover, one path may be 
broken down resulting in some websites not available to certain people, but actually they can still visit the 
webs after many attempts of trying other way only if the websites have other paths. In addition, sometimes 
though the websites are still available to us, we can always find a best way, i.e. with the highest speed to 
use.In one word, we need a put up way which can make the accessibility of the wireless sensor network more 
robust with better performance.  
In fact, there are many papersthat study the localizationproblems in sensor networks using optimization 
method. For example,[3] described localization information distributing propagation methods.[10]gave a time 
a localization discovery method in wireless sensornetworks.The Co-SRL system is answer we find. In Co-
SRL, there is not any center server, and only a register server generate identifications for the nodes who want 
to join the system, but not one is responsible for monitoring the behaviors single nodes. When strange nodes 
come to certain nodes and request for service, the requested nodes make their own opinions on response 
positively or negatively, according to their knowledge of the coming nodes. 
This paper is arranged as follows: In section 2, we first introduce some basic principles of localization in 
wireless sensor networks and the optimization method, and then talk about the Co-SRL. In section 3, we 
present the simulation results of Co-SRL.And finally, we give the conclusion of this paper. 
2. The Algorithm of Co-SRL 
For each of the specific sub-problems, the problem specific assumptions will be presented when the 
problem itself is presented. The sensor network is � � ���� � � �� � � ��randomlydeployed. ��is an anchor, and 
����� � ����� ����� is the position set of  ��. Both the mobile target and all communications between different 
anchors are bidirectional.  
This paper gave a convex optimizationbased method to help node to localize anchors, given that at most M 
of them are malicious in a network. Our enhanced protocol, named Advanced Distance Bounding (AAD) 
protocol uses the high-speedDBtechnique.By Using of AAD, it can preventfrom many network attacks aiming 
at wireless sensor networks such as wormhole attacks [1],Sybil attack [1] and Distance reduction attacks etc., 
because in this case, malicious anchorswith faked position information will be detectedimmediately by a 
Malicious Node. Why? The reason can be seen as follows. 
Basically, we use the convex optimizationtechnique for the Malicious Node position estimation. As 
shownabove, if there existmeasurementnegative errorsthe intersection region ���� of the disks ����� may be 
empty. The disk  ����� corresponds to the circle drawn with the position of anchor ��being served the center 
and the distance between��and the target t as the radius. In this case, it will result in the increased distance 
estimation����
� �
����
��������, if we increase a factor of
�
�������� to  the distance estimates����for the malicious 
node ���. Let�����
�  denotes the increased bound disks, andlet ����
� denotes the corresponding increased bound 
circles. There must exist some malicious nodes in the non-empty region ����
� which is the intersection of 
�����
� . 
All points in����
�may likely be the position of Malicious Node. ��of����
�is used as the Malicious Node 
Localization,it would minimize the worst case error in estimation.Where ��  is the point satisfyingthat 
���������
��� � ��� � ���������
��� � ��, for any � � ��. Butit is very difficult to calculate the geometric 
center.As a result, to obtain ��,we will find the solution of the following equation (4.1).

� � ��� � � �
 
Where, � � � � �. 
In fact, it means that we use a common factor �tosimultaneously shrink�����
�  (all disks), as much as 
possible, it only need to ensure that there exist at least one member in the intersection among the disks. The 
first N constraints in equation (4.1) can ensure the condition of non-empty intersectionamong the disks. The 
objective function as shown in equation (4.1) is to maximize�, and finally to minimize� which is the 
shrinking factor. Clearly, there existsa unique optimal solution ���� ��� for this convex optimization problem. 
Here ��is named as the algebraic centre AC of the non-empty region����
�. To simplify the solution of the in 
(4.1), wetransform it into the following equation (4.2).

Where �� is the Largrangian multiplier [7]. By using the algorithm which is presented in Algorithm 1, the 
aboveproblem can be efficiently solved.  
As shown in Algorithm 1,in Line 3,it uses the newton method [7] with tolerance��� � � � ���� for the 
minimization. 
The �valuekeeps increasingin algorithm 1,which willresult in the reduction of �����
� . Finally, the itstopped 
and get the solution��(the center of ����

� has been reduced greatly. 
��will be served as the approximation of the localization of the Malicious Node. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Algorithm 1: The optimization algorithm 
In this research, it is assumed that the malicious node ���  has adequate ability to perform the 
localizationoperations in Algorithm 1. Otherwise, if it cannot perform the localization operations, then the 
anchors can perform the localization operations. 
3. Simulation Results 
The proposed methodhas been implementedusingthe Matlab software. We apply the algorithm into the 
design the Co-SRLsystem which is an application overlay of the physical networks. It is constructed by the 
nodes and their accessible parts of the Internet. every peer in the system is a proxy which voluntarily relay the 
traffic of pass through it . Each node of Co-SRLis composed of 4 subsystems: The Functional-Module, the 
Calculation-Engine, the Friends-List and the Evaluation-Engine. Where, the Functional-Module is used for 
transferring traffic, registering and other functions. Our policy model for admission control is implemented in 
the calculation engine. When a new node comes, the calculate engine is responsible to calculate its trust value

and reflect to the friend list to record, and when the node interact with some new node, as the functional 
module offers or demands the service, the evaluate engine estimate the Recommendation and record in order
