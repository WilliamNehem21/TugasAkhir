a user datagram protocol (UDP). UDPs exhibit packet loss and congestion problems, but the RTP does not 
include standards of retransmission and flow control. Moreover, most RTP applications do not implement a 
retransmission mechanism; therefore the effect on voice streaming is slight, but that on video streaming is 
severe. 
Because bandwidth is insufficient, only voice data have been transferred; however, the effect of packet loss 
on voice is small and communication is possible when packet loss is not excessive. Furthermore, because 
voice data are small, a flow control mechanism is unnecessary. 
Increasing bandwidth has allowed video streaming to become mainstream. Video data are large and, 
therefore, require division into multiple packets; however, frames cannot be decoded appropriately when one 
packet has been lost. This prevents users from seeing an image appropriately and also wastes bandwidth. Flow 
control mechanisms are therefore critical. 
2. Flow control 
Once a sender starts sending video streaming data, a receiver sends a PKL (Packet Loss) packet to the 
sender to confirm the current network state every 100 millisecond. This allows the sender to control the rate of 
data transmission. 
Before the sender sends a frame, the sender calculates how long a frame takes to send at the available 
bandwidth.

2.1. Bit Rate Reduction 
The bit rate changes in accordance with the current network state. The sender reduces the bit rate by half 
when packet loss exceeds 5% per second.

The size of one packet is 1 kb (1 PKL = 1 kb). 
When transmitting at a new bit rate, the bit rate is reduced by half if the PKL exceeds 240. 
2.2. Bit Rate Increase 
The sender increases the bit rate when packet loss is 0% per second.

3. Retransmission 
Once a sender initiates the sending of video streaming data, the receiver determines the packet loss based 
on the sequence number in the RTP header. When packet loss occurs, the receiver sends the RTP packet to the 
sender. The RTP packet contains the same sequence number as the lost packet, but does not contain payload 
data. The sender can determine which RTP packet is lost and retransmit the RTP packet in the next time slice, 
when receiving the empty RTP packet. The detailed retransmission mechanism is presented in Fig. 1. 
Fig.1. Schematic diagram of retransmission. 
Using the above method still incurs a problem; after packet loss occurs, successful retransmission must be 
confirmed before subsequent frames are sent. However, waiting for a packet halts the function of the system. 
Thus, the receiver sets a timer for each retransmission request and discards the frame when the timer runs out. 
The system can continue normally without decoding the unnecessary frame, preventing a broken image from 
appearing and a performance overhead from being incurred. 
3.1. Comparisons with RFC4588 (RTP Retransmission Payload Format) 
RFC4588 provides an RTP payload format for performing retransmission. Compared with the proposed 
method, RFC4588 exhibits several weaknesses. First, it requires an RTCP (Real Time Control Protocol), 
which increases the complexity of the system and consumes performance. Furthermore, it requires another 
channel to perform RTP retransmission, such that a RTP streaming requires three channels. Finally, it uses 
SDP to perform retransmission requests, the format of which is complex and exhibits a large packet size, 
increasing the parsing time and bandwidth requirements. The differences between RFC4588 and the proposed 
method are listed in Table 1.

4. Experimental results 
This section presents the effect of the retransmission and flow control mechanism. IP camera was used to 
transmit video data over the Internet and we count frame numbers that can be decoded appropriately. 
� Codec type: MPEG4 
� Video Size = 640*480 (VGA) 
� Frame Rate = 30 fps 
� Bandwidth = 2 Mbps 
First, the effect of retransmission was tested. The retransmission mechanism increased the received 
complete FPS by 2.66 times (from 10.8 to 28.8) compared with no retransmission. The detailed experimental 
results are listed in Table 2.

Next, the flow control mechanism was implemented and NAT (Network Address Translation) was used to 
limit the bandwidth and test the effect of flow control at various bandwidths. The received complete FPS 
exerted a positive effect at each bandwidth, as shown in Tables 3 and 4.

5. Conclusion 
This paper presents a retransmission and flow control method. Retransmission can reduce the effect of 
packet loss on video streaming by using a small number of retransmission packets. Flow control controls the 
sending rate based on the number of packets lost, so that the sending rate adheres to the available  bandwidth. 
Retransmission and flow-control improves the performance of video streaming, and users can clearly 
appreciate the difference when viewing images.
