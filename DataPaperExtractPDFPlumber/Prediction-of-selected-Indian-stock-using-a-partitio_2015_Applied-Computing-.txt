1. Introduction
Financial TSD mining provides useful information for the investors, banks and
insurance companies to channel their funds properly for better returns. This deci-
sion making is the primary motivation for prediction of financial TSD. Accurate
multi-step ahead prediction of financial TSD becomes more difficult, as the finan-
cial TSD is highly volatile. If prediction is one-step ahead preserving data trend is
irrelevant. However, as the forecast horizon increases, preserving data trend
becomes significant. In either case, prediction accuracy should remain high.
Hence, the two basic requirements for multi-step ahead prediction model are
maintaininghighpredictionaccuracyandpreservingthedatatrendacrossthepre-
diction horizon.
Traditional models like ARIMA, GARCH or ANN cannot meet both the
requirements simultaneously. However, a hybrid model may provide scope for
preserving data trend across the forecast horizon while maintaining good predic-
tion accuracy, which motivates the research work of this paper. Most of the tra-
ditional models such as ARIMA, GARCH and ANN are applied for one-step
ahead forecasting in many works of the literature, where prediction accuracy is
of major concern. However, in the present paper, we target multi-step ahead pre-
diction, which requires preserving data trend in addition to high prediction accu-
racy. Such a model should account for the nature of TSD at every stage in the
model.
Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature survey
of different prediction models existing in the literature. The proposed PI based
hybrid ARIMA–GARCH model is detailed in Section 3. A quantitative analysis
of the proposed model is discussed in 4. The proposed and the traditional models
are applied on selected NSE India data and the performance is compared in Sec-
tion 6. The paper ends with conclusion in 7.

ARIMA models are popularized after Box and Jenkins, who developed a coher-
ent, versatile three-stage iterative cycle for time series identification, estimation,
and verification. This method is also known as the BoxJenkins approach [1]. In

Englein1982introducedARCHmodel[7]whichisknownforforecastinghigh-
ly volatile TSD. An improved version of ARCH model called generalized ARCH
also known as GARCH model [8] was introduced by Bollerslev, Engle, and Nel-
son in 1994. Several extensions of GARCH model are found in the literature.
Some of the extensions are extensively surveyed in [9]. In [10] a simple (linear)
GARCH(1,1) model is applied on Swiss market index and the results show that
the model provides a good parametrization for the daily returns. GARCH model
isfurtherexploredandstudiedin[11]andshowedthatthepresenceofoutliershas
an impact on the forecast results. In [12] GARCH models are used to forecast
hourly prices in the deregulated electricity markets of Spain and California and
theresultsoutperformARIMAmodelwhenvolatilityandpricespikesarepresent.
SometimesGARCHmodelsareinappropriatetomodelastheyassumeGaussian
distribution. In such cases student-T distribution can be assumed. This fact is fur-
ther investigated in [13].
Many Hybrid models are derived in the literature for time series forecasting.
The hybrid models combine strengths of few individual models to render better
prediction accuracy. A composite ARIMA–GARCH model for forecasting rain-
fall data is presented in [14]. ARIMA is used with GARCH model for forecasting
daily load and maximum electricity demand estimation as seen in [15], which pro-
vides a better long term forecasting. In [16], traffic modeling and prediction using
ARIMA and GARCH models are proposed. A MA filter based hybrid ARIMA–
ANNmodelisproposedin[17].Othertechniqueslikespectralanalysistoforecast

3. PI based hybrid ARIMA–GARCH prediction model
Details of modeling TSD using ARIMA, GARCH, ANN, and wavelet-ARIMA
are all present in the literature mentioned in Section 2. Here, the proposed hybrid
ARIMA–GARCH prediction model is discussed.
Financialdataarehighlyvolatileinnature.Ifthisvolatilitynatureischaracter-
ized and accounted at every stage in a prediction model, both the data trend and
accuracyrequirementscanbemetsimultaneously.Generalcharacteristicsofhigh-
ly volatile TSD are changing variance as a function of time, volatility clustering
(VC) and fat tail distribution (FTD) [20]. These are mathematically characterized
using conditional standard deviation, autocorrelation plot of absolute or squared
returns, Quartile–Quartile plot respectively [20]. Using these characteristics a MAPrediction of selected Indianstockusinga ARIMA–GARCH model 133
filter decomposition technique is developed. Along with this, a unique PI
technique is used to build the PI-based hybrid ARIMA–GARCH model. The
two techniques are detailed as follows.
3.1. MA filter based decomposition technique
Given TSD is decomposed into two components, one of which is smooth, called
the trend component and the other named as noise component. This decomposi-
tion is shown in Fig. 1. The MA filter is given in (1), where m indicates length of
the filter, sm is the smoothened trend component and er is the noise component.
t t
It is adjusted such that one of the decomposed components is highly volatile with
predominant VC and FTD, but the other is low volatile with relatively very less
VC and no FTD.

To decide on m, the TSD should be mathematically characterized for volatility,
VC and FTD.
3.1.1. Volatility
Volatility is termed as the continuous changing of variance as a function of time
[21]orvariabilityofpricesorreturnsofagivenTSD[22].Thepopularmeasureof
volatility is the conditional standard deviation, r, given in (2), which is the vari-
t
ance of TSD available till the time lag t. In (2), r represents the returns data. If r
t t
changes slowly with time, the TSD is identified as low volatile, else it is highly
volatile.

3.1.2. Volatility clustering
According to [23], some TSD can be characterized by VC, which means large
changes are more likely to be followed by large changes and small changes more
likelyfollowsmallchanges,inthegivenTSD.VCimplies,thoughthetimesamples
appear uncorrelated across time, they are actually dependent across time. VC can
be quantifiedusing the autocorrelation plot of absolute returns data [23], or using
autocorrelation plot of squared returns [20]. If these plots slowly decay as a func-
tionoftimelag,thenthedataaresaidtoexhibitVC.Ifthedecayisrelativelyslow,
the effect of VC is high, else it is low. The autocorrelation sequence can be calcu-
lated using (3), where, s represents the time lag.

3.1.3. Fat tail distribution
IfthedistributionofgivenTSDdeviatesfromthatofGaussian(Normal),thenthe
dataare fat tail distributed. This meansthe data exhibit peaked nature at the cen-
ter and the tails are fatter than that of Gaussian distribution. To quantify FTD,
Jarque–Bera normality test can be used. According to this test, if the kurtosis of
TSD is 3, it is Gaussian distributed and if kurtosis is not equal to 3, it exhibits
FTD. Note that if the data are highly outlier prone, kurtosis is greater than 3
and if it is less prone to outliers, the kurtosis is less than 3 [24]. Kurtosis is com-
puted using (4). Another way of identifying FTD is the Q–Q plot on returns data
[20]. If this Q–Q plot deviates substantially from the standard normal Q–Q plot,
the data have FTD.

3.2. Partitioning and interpolation
Let the original TSD be represented as fx ;x ;x ;x ;x ...x g, where Tr repre-
1 2 3 4 5 Tr
sents the last sample data point in the series. These data are then split into P par-
titions as shown in (6).

Consideranyoneofthepartitionsin(6).EachpartitionisaTSDwithlessthanTr
sample data points. On this data, a linear interpolation is done to obtain Tr data
points. This process is repeated on each of the partitions and P different TSD are
obtained, each consisting of Tr sample data points. Thus interpolated TSD parti-
tions are notated as TP1;TP2;TP3;...;TPP.
3.3. Steps in proposed model
The steps involved in the proposed model are described below.
1. ThegivenTSDaredecomposedintotwoseriesusingaMAfiltergivenin(1).m
is chosen such that one of these decompositions is highly volatile with pre-
dominant VC, FTD (notated as S1), while the other which is low volatile with
relatively less VC, FTD (notated as S2).
2. The S2 series with En data values is given as training data, and an ARIMA
model is fit.Correspondinglypredictionsare madeoverthe predictionhorizon.
3. The S1 series is split into M partitions. If original S1 is considered as
fx ;x ;x ;x ;x ...x g, the M partitions are indicated in (6).

Then each partition is linearly interpolated to obtain same number of data
points En, as in S1 series. Let these M interpolated partitions be
P1;P2;P3;...;PM.
4. Consider one partition P1 with first Er data values, where Er < En. Using Er
values as training data a GARCH model is fit, validated and En(cid:2)Er forecasts
are obtained. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) with En(cid:2)Er pre-
dicted and actual data values is obtained. This process is repeated on all P2
to PM partitions. The best GARCH model is finalized as the one with mini-
mum error. The best partition which gives this best GARCH model is used
to forecast over the complete prediction horizon.
5. The predictions from step 2 and step 4 are added to form the final predictions.

can be observed that the series S1 is highly volatile with predominant VC and
FTD, and the other is series S2, is low volatile with less VC and no FTD. Thus
it is indeed possible to obtain the required two series by selecting a proper value
ofm.Notethatthevalueofmisnotunique.Forexampleinthiscase,weobserved
that for values of m ranging in 25 6 m 6 35, the required two series can be prop-
erly obtained (Results are not presented).
4.2. Analysis of PI technique
Let a TSD, referred as raw data here, have 500 data points. If 10 partitions are
done,eachpartitionwillhave50points.Inthiscase,thefirstpartitionhasthedata
points 1;11;21;...;491, second partition has data points 2;12;22;...;492, and
the last partition has data points 10;20;30;...;500. To have the same number
of data pointsas the originaldata in eachpartition, eachpartitionis interpolated,
to obtain 500 data points. On series 1 of Fig. (3), the PI technique is applied with
10partitions.Itisobservedthatalltheinterpolatedpartitionsretainvolatility;and
VC,FTDchangeonlyslightlythanthatoftheseries1.Ifthenumberofpartitions
made 30, this change is more. However, in both the cases, the partitions have
volatility, VC and FTD. From this observation we can conclude the following.
When the PI step is performed with 10 partitions, the partitioning did not violate
Nyquist sampling theorem [25]; and after interpolation, each partition still has
same frequency content as the initial series. In this case kurtosis of all the
partitionsisnearlysameasthekurtosisofinitialseries.WhenPIwith30partitions
is performed, it violates Nyquist sampling rate, which implies that some high
frequency components are being removed from the partitions. In this case,
kurtosis of different partitions is different.

5. Performance of the proposed model
Theproposedmodel rendersbetterpredictionaccuracyforalongtermprediction
onahighlyvolatileTSD.Inthissection,quantitativereasoningastowhythepro-
posed method is better, is illustrated.
5.1. Application of the right model
From Fig. 2, on the low volatile decomposition with less VC and no FTD,
ARIMAmodelisapplied.ThisisaptbecauseARIMAmodelassumesaGaussian
distribution(i.e.noFTD),noVCandconstantvariance[1].Similarlyonthehigh-
ly volatile decomposition, which has VC, and FTD, GARCH model is being
applied. This is apt because, GARCH model relaxes the constraint of constant
variance [26], and is suitable for data with VC [23]. The proposed hybrid model
is hence applying apt individual models based on the nature of decompositions.
Note that in general decomposition improves prediction accuracy [24], and in this
case, due to the application of right model to each of the decomposition accuracy
further improves.
InsteadofdirectlyapplyingGARCHmodelonS1,ifPItechniqueisapplied,P
different data series result. On each of the series, GARCH is suitable because, the
volatility, VC and FTD still prevail as discussed in Section 4.2, irrespective of the
number of partitions P. Now out of the P different GARCH models, the best
modelcanbechosen.LetthisbestmodelbeobtainedduetotheB partition.This
th
meansthatsomeofthedatapoints,whichdonotreallyplayanyroleinprediction
(for example, outliers) are not present in this B partition and so this partition
th
gave the best prediction accuracy.
5.2. Advantages and limitations of the proposed model
Theadvantagesof theproposedmodel arethat,itiswell suitedforlongtermpre-
diction. Also, being a linear model, the data dynamics i.e. data trend is preserved
and the prediction accuracy is high, better than the popular ANN. The ANN on
the other hand uses the training data and learns from the data before prediction.
It blindly tries to maximize the overall prediction accuracy. In this process, the
data dynamics are sacrificed. This reasoning supports the fact that the proposed
prediction model is better than the ANN model. The proposed model is clearly
better than ARIMA, GARCH and Wavelet ARIMA models also, because the
nature of the given time series data is clearly accounted at every stage in the
model.
The limitation of the proposed model is that, the number of partitions P is
decided based on trial and error. If the estimation of P for a given data set is
possible, it will improve the model, though complexity increases. Also, in this
paper, the covariates are not considered. The proposed model is shown to workPrediction of selected Indianstockusinga ARIMA–GARCH model 139
well for univariate data. If the covariates are considered, the prediction accuracy
stillfurtherimprovesbecausetakingtheeffectofcovariates,impliesthedependen-
cies of the data are completely being accounted. The drawback will be the model
complexity and tuning of the increased number of model parameters [22]. So this
study is not included in this paper.
6. Experimental results and discussion
In this section, on selected financial TSD originating from NSE India data, the
proposed model, ARIMA, GARCH, wavelet-ARIMA and ANN are applied.
The performance measures used for comparison, are the error measures, MAPE,

The highly volatile NSE India data [27] selected are close price stock data of SBI,
number of trades data of Tata Steel. A 20-step ahead prediction is performed in
both the cases. This implies using the data values available till yesterday, the data
values from today till another 20days are predicted. In both these TSD cases, the
proposed method outperformed other models in terms of prediction accuracyand
also in preserving data trend.

The number of trades of Tata Steel from January 2011 to December 2011 is con-
sidered as TSD2 for the study. On this highly volatile TSD, the ARIMA,
GARCH, wavelet ARIMA, ANN and the proposed model are applied. The
results of MAPE, Max APE, MAE, and RMSE for these models are given in
Table 2. The proposed model outperformed others as in the previous case. The

proposed method preserved the data trend more accurately. In this case the pro-
posed model used 11 partitions, where 6 of them had almost same VC, FTD and
Q–Q nature as the S1 series while the other 5 showed very different nature. The

7. Conclusion
Inthispaper,forhighlyvolatilefinancialTSD,ahybridARIMA–GARCHmodel
is proposed, which is suitable for multi-step ahead forecasting. The technique
involves a MA filter based decomposition as a pre-processing step on given
TSD. The proposed model is applied on selected NSE India data sets to get mul-
ti-step ahead prediction. The obtained results are evaluated using error perfor-
mance measures MAPE, MaxAPE, RMSE, whose values confirm the improved
prediction accuracy compared to traditional models ARIMA, GARCH and
ANN.Theproposedmodelalsopreservedthedatatrendoverthepredictionhori-
zon better than the others. The prediction performance can be studied by the
inclusion of covariates, which forms the future scope of this paper.
