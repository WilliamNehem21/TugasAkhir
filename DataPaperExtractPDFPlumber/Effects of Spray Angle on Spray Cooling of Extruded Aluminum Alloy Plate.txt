Abstract
Spray cooling technology relying on phase-change mechanism has a notable ability to remove high heat fluxes. Spray
cooling can be used to transfer large amounts of energy through the latent heat of evaporation. Heat transfer rates much
higher than can be attained in pool boiling are possible with spray cooling since the vapor can be removed from the
surface more easily. Therefore, spray cooling has a number of applications in the various fields such as continuous casting
process, electronics thermal control and metal quenching process which require a high flux cooling technique [1-3]. One
important area which would benefit from spray cooling to improve heat removal is press quenching of extruded aluminum
alloy plate.

1. Introduction
Heat transfer in spray cooling has been studied extensively throughout the world. Shaojun Zhang et al [4]
studied the effects of spray distance and high-temperature steel plate’s surface temperature on heat transfer
coefficient in spray cooling. Eric A. Silk et al [5] investigated the effects of surface roughness and spray
inclination angle on spray cooling.

In the past few years, studies [6-8] on the spray angle are focused on the spray angle itself and the
coefficients of discharge and the spray cone angle, fruitful results were obtained by both experimental and
numerical research. However, progress in the research of effects of spray angle on spray cooling has been very
slow, especially in the field of metal press quenching. The analysis of the effects of spray angle on heat
transfer is much more difficult and the direct numerical simulation is the best choice for theoretical study.
This paper attempts to make some numerical investigations on the effects of spray angle on spray cooling
of extruded aluminum alloy plate to look for an optimal range of spray angle value that can improve the
cooling performance. A commercial FVM code, Fluent, will be employed to calculate the temperature
distribution within the cooled aluminum plate. The corresponding stress distribution is obtained with the help
of MSC.Marc software.
2. Model Building
The cooling target is 300 mm × 10 mm section aluminum alloy plate, Fig 1 shows the simplified spray
cooling model for analysis with nozzle arrangement. The pressure boundary condition at inlet and outlet is P =
101325 Pa. For the surface, no slip boundary condition is considered. SIMPLE algorithm is adopted as the
pressure-velocity coupling solver. It is clear from the 2-D mesh model shown in Fig 2 that the mesh around
the outlet of nozzle along the spray axis is locally fined to improve the computation resolution.
The spray operating pressure is 0.3 MPa, the orifice diameter of spray nozzle is 2 mm, the spray angles
varied between 10º and 110º, the spray distance from the plate surface is 150 mm, the cooling time is 10 s, the
gravity is neglected in the model.
The aluminum plate is assumed of uniform temperature distribution when it is extruded from the extruding
machine. Therefore, the initial temperature distribution of the plate is set uniform, the temperature value is set
793 K. The material property is 6061 aluminum alloy.

3. Simulation Results And Analysis
The distribution of heat transfer coefficient on top surface at different spray angle is described in Fig 3,
which indicates that the highest heat transfer coefficient is at the spray stagnation point (located at the central
point of top surface) in all cases. With the distance from the stagnation point increasing, the heat transfer
coefficient is on a decrease on the whole. From the Fig 4, it can be observed that the increase of cooling
efficiency and cooling uniformity can be improved under an optimal range of spray angle, in this paper, the
optimal range of spray angle is from 70º to 90º.
Heat transfer coefficient is a very important factor affecting the temperature change, therefore, it is can be
seen from the Fig 5 and Fig 6 that the bigger the spray angle is, the more uniform the surface temperature
distribution becomes, and when the spray angle is about 90º, the mean surface temperature reaches the
maximum value. So increasing the spray angle can make contribution to cooling uniformity to certain extent,
and cooling efficiency attained the highest at spray angle ranging from 70º to 90º.

From Fig 7 and Fig 8, which show the equivalent stress distribution and maximum surface equivalent stress
on the top surface at different spray angles, it can be found that increasing spray angle can remarkably better
the uniformity of the surface equivalent stress distribution and help lower the maximum surface equivalent
stress, it is meaningful in keeping high quality and satisfactory shape of the product.
4. Conclusion
A numerical study of spray cooling of extruded aluminum alloy plate with an emphasis on spray angle
effects on cooling performance has been presented. The analysis for the cooling process is a combination of
FEM and FVM. The results show that increasing spray angle contributes to improving uniformity of surface
temperature distribution, surface equivalent stress distribution and reduction of maximum surface equivalent
stress obviously, and the spray cooling will be performed with higher thermal efficiency in a certain range of
spray angle, the optimal range of spray angle is from 70ºto 90º in this paper.
