Desiggning a softwaare to count thee body compossition and sommatotype and itss role in pursinng the morphollogical state off
sporttsmen
TThe objective ffrrom this studyy is to design a software whhich relies on tthe Heat-Carter method for oonthropometriee
somaatotype and maatiegka équationn in counting thhe body mass (tthe fat, the musscle, the bones))and among thee characteristicss
of the software :
1. Facilitatinng the countabble operationss for matiegkaa équations annd Heat-carterr method for antropometricc
somaatotype .
2. Counting the results of tthe body mass and somatotypee for big numbber of sportsmenn in short periood of time ,lesss
efforrt and more accuuracy.
3. Designingg basic data richh of the body mmass ‘and the soomatotype ‘s reesults of manysportsmen ,So that ,it helps inn
pursiing their morphhological state aand the way to sselect and guidthem to the besst sport activity.
4. Designingg the somatochaart and diagramm for body compposition .
AAs a future studdy we are loakking for luikingg the software with the electtronie side in oorder to designn an outomaticc
machhine which worrks on taking the anthropometrric measurments in human boddy with high acccurary and to trransmit the dataa
to thee countable maachine in which they will be treeated and storedd in basic data ootomatically.

1.Inntroduction
TThe world of computer sciences has witnessed a lot of success aas one of the technologicall advances inn
sparing a lot of timme and effort ,it also increaased the credibbility and connfidence of thee results to almmost a perfectt
level .
CComputer and software scientists succeeeded in makinng many commputers for thhe use in all ffields, amongg
whicch sports activvities are coveered.
Inn fact all scieentific fields use computerrs to store, too retrieve andd to analyse ddata that is wwhy computerr
sciennces were intrroduced in spoort activities too match the sccientific progrress known toother scientiffic fields .

Sports morphology is a science that is specialised in studying the changes of human body structure which
occur under physical exercises ,The high performance of tained by athlets makes it necessary to evaluate the
body capacity and the individual characteristics of each athlet .
This evaluation considers a number of parametrs such as weight ,height, body surface ,fat mass, muscle
mass and bones mass .
From this logic stems the idea to design a software capable to treat in put data (Anthropometric
measurements ) where the the out put data will be in form of Somatotype and body mass .
By using Matiegka equation and carter-heat method of anthropometric somatotype, as a consequence the
objectives of this research are :
1) To simplify the computing operations of Matiegka equation and the carter-heat method.
2) To increase the precision of computing the results of body mass and somatotypes of several athlets in
faster time and less efforts.
3) To design baseline data of body mass and somatotype for a big number of athlets to follow up their
morpholic state,thier selection and thier guidance to the most appropriate sport ‘s activity.
4) To design a somatochart and body composition chart .
2.Research terms
Software: he’s a direction give to the computer to excute precise task in the time from .(Ghistaine and
Patrick 2000).
Body composition (body mass) : is a term refers to the human body from three ingredients are ( muscles,
fats, bones) . (Battinelli,2007)
Somatotype : is an expression refers to the morphology , and is expressed in three points , the first refers to
the endomorphy(right), segond (midale)to mesomorphy , third (left) ectomorphy (carter,2002)
3.Equations adopted in software
We used the formulas of Mateigka (1921) :
3.1.Fat mass
MA = d. s.k.
MG : absolute fat mass in kg
d:½(cid:153)skinfold(subscapular, (biceps+triceps)/2chest,forearm,abdominal,thigh)/6
s : body surface calculated by the formula Izakson(1958) :
s = ( 100 + wieht + ( stature – 160 )) / 100
k : constant = 1, 3
- calculating the percentage of fat mass (relative) :
MG% = (MA/ body mass).100
3.2.Bones mass :
MO = l.o².k
MO: absolute bones mass in kg
l : stature in cm
o = (diameters distal arm, forearm, thigh and leg)/4 in cm
k: constant = 1,2
- calculating the percentage of bones mass (relative) :
MO% = (MO/masse corporelle).100
3.3.muscle mass :
MM = l.r².k
MO : absolute muscle mass in kg40 Asli Houcine et al. / AASRI Procedia 8 ( 2014 ) 38 – 43
l : stature in cm
r =((cid:153) circumference arm, forearm, thigh and leg) / 25.12 - ( (cid:153)skinfold arm, forearm, thigh and leg) / 80
k : constant = 6,5
- calculating the percentage of muscle mass (relative) :
MM% = (MM/body mass).100 (Matiegka, 1921).
4.Somatotype
We used the Heath-carter Antropometric Somatotype (Duqaet and carter ,2001),(Heat and
carter,1977),(Philipaerts,2002)
4.1.How the software works:
programming language :
visual C sharp(C#)(cid:314)Microsoft visual studio 2008
Data base (cid:314)MySQL (Wamp Server) (Mickey,2002),(Donis,2005),(Loca and John,2010)
Software platform :
32 bit ,64 bit Windows (XP , Windows 7)
Size of program : 2 ,45 MB
First step :
After fixing the program (setup software) you’ll see the next interface and it’s « somatotype interface » if
you want to change the language from english to arab click on « administrator box ».
fill the information about somatotype then click on the « somatotype box » to show the results , if you want
to represent data in the somatochart clik on « chart » , if you want to delete data click on « reset » , After
making sure to fill the correct to data click « save » and you’ll see the message if you want to Continue
calculate body mass click « OK » , and if want to save the results somatotype just click « NO » if you want to
close program click on « cancel »
Observation : to fill the high side of the program (code ,Name , Age ….) are necessary to save the results in
database.

The second step:
Fill the data for body mass then click on « OK » to show results ,same previous steps if you want change the
language or graphical representation or delete afer confirming data click « save » then click on « data base»
box , to confirming data save in data base you will see the next interface .
After clicking on « data base » you’ll see black page , click on execution for appearence of stored
information , if you want to research about ( Name or code or …..) entre Name …, in research box you will see
the spacial information in blue color .
If you want to delete the stored information for this code click on « delete » , and if you want to delete
all the information from data base click on « delet all » ; if you want to change in some data click on
then click on Name or code …., that you wanted to change then click on « somatotype » or « body mass » box ,42 Asli Houcine et al. / AASRI Procedia 8 ( 2014 ) 38 – 43
You'll find that the data was automatically filled then make a change process then click on « Save » , if you
want data representation Somatotype or body mass choose the serie name then click on the box and will
apear to you the interface .
When the next interface apear choose graphical represetation chart type then click on « OK » then click on «
somatochart ».
To apear somatochart as you see in the picture .
5.Search Results
1 ) Facilitating the countable operations for matiegka equations and Heat-carter method for antropometric
somatotype .
2) Counting the results of the body mass and somatotype for big number of sportsmen in short period of
time ,less effort and more accuracy.
3) Designing basic data rich of the body mass ‘and the somatotype ‘s results of many sportsmen ,So that ,it
helps in pursing their morphological state and the way to select and guid them to the best sport activity.
4) Designing the somatochart and diagram for body composition .

6.Recommendations
1) Link this software to the hardware to the process to make measurs anthropometry .
2) Take care to the morphology side to estimate training program
3) It’s necesory to take care of somatotype in selection process and to direct athlets to the right physical
activity .
4) Make more of meetings and conferences about the importance link to the sport domain with ather
sciences especially electronic engineering science .
