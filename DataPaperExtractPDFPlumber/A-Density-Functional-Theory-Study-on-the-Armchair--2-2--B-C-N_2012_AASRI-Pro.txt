Abstract
The ultra long tube models of single walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different ratios of B, C and N atoms
were studied with density functional theory of B3LYP/3-21G* and the periodic boundary conditions. The (2,2) B-C-N
nanotubes have specially serrated tube structures. The energies were calculated and the band gaps of tubes were within
0.062 eV to 3.874 eV showing metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity.

1. Introduction
The ternary system boron carbide nitride (B-C-N) nanotubes have attracted extraordinary attention in past
ten years in virtue of potentially interesting properties. The tubes synthesized by CVD experiment were found
to be of semiconductor conductivity[1]. Photoluminescence studies revealed that aligned B-C-N nanotubes
were also semiconductors exhibiting a band gap of 1.0eV[2]. Additionally, BC N nanotubes might act as blue
2
and violet light emitting materials such as an efficient field emitter[3–4].

The thinnest armchair carbon nanotube of (2,2) tubes was supposed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs) preparation[5] and the cluster models of (2,2) tubes was studied by theory method[6]. In present
work, the (2,2) B-C-N tubes with different atom ratio or the isomers with different atom arrangement were
studied in the ultra long tube models, it was extended the research to their structure and band structure.
2. Calculation method
The density functional theory functional (B3LYP 3-21G*) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for
one-dimensional models were employed by the Gaussian series packages[7] in this paper. All the tube
structures, model energies and the band gaps were obtained by the theoretical calculation for optimized
models.
3. Result
3.1. Structure parameter
For the (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different atom ratios (the C atom ratios of 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4) and
different atom arrangements, eight stable models were found and examined as shown in Figure 1(a) to (h).
The tube structure parameters optimized with B3LYP/3-21G* were listed in Table 1.

As shown in figure 1, the (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes have serrated tubular structures as the pristine (2,2)
carbon nanotube(CNT)[8]. It was found that there were two different kinds of chemical bond, which were the
perpendicular (circumferential) bond lengths L (the subscript 1 denotes the bond being perpendicular to the
1
tube axis) and the oblique(axial) bond L (the subscript 2 denotes the bond being oblique with respect to the
2
tube axis), respectively. For most of (2,2) B-C-N models, L were larger than that of the pristine (2,2) CNT
1
where L =0.1373 nm but L were smaller than that of the (2,2) CNT where L =0.1512 nm[8].

The cross sections of (2,2) B-C-N tubes were distorted. Tube larger diameter (D ) or smaller diameter (D )
L S
of tube models denoted the largest or shortest distance of two atoms in a same cross section. The slightly
distorted models were with the values of D /D being 1.070 for the models BC N(II) but larger values of
L S 6
D /D being 1.212 for the models B C N (II).

The Mülliken atomic charges were obtained. The doped atom B were found to be positive values (about
0.66~0.85e) and those of the N atom were negative value (about -0.82~-0.59e), respectively. The Mülliken
charge was negative value for C atom adjacent to B atom but positive value for them adjacent to N atom. The
results were in accordance with the electrone-gativities of B, C and N atoms (respectively being 2.04, 2.55
and 3.04 on the Pauling scale) [9].Yanli Wang et al. / AASRI Procedia 3 ( 2012 ) 357 – 361 359
