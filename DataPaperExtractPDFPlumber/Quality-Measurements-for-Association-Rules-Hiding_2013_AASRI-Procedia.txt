1. Introduction
Data mining technologies are widely used and help people to make good decision and good money since
appeared. While at the same time, some knowledge extracted from the data mining can be considered sensitive
which may potentially reveal sensitive secrets and cause serious privacy problems [1-3]. This problem is dealt
with privacy preserving data mining.

Privacy preserving data mining is a novel research direction in data mining. It analyzes the side effects
incurring in data privacy. Privacy preserving data mining hides sensitive knowledge by modifying the original
database in a way that sensitive knowledge disappeared with less affecting on non-sensitive knowledge.
A lot of approaches of hiding have been proposed. Usually, based on the discovered association rules and
hiding requirements, the hiding of sensitive association rules is executed manually or automatically after data
mining process. There is still a lot of room to improve the efficiency and quality. The work focuses on the
quality measurements of hiding approaches to guide the sensitive association rule hiding process. Several key
quality measurements will be proposed in this paper. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the problem of association rule hiding. Section 3 presents the quality measurements.
Association rule Hiding strategies are illustrated in section 4. Conclusions and future works are described in
the last section.
2. Problem description
Association rule hiding is a classic knowledge hiding approach which deals with modifying the original
database in a way that sensitive association rules disappear while at the same time, without seriously affecting
the original data and the non-sensitive rules.
Given a set of association rules which are mined from a specific dataset and are considered to be sensitive,
the task of association rule hiding is to properly sanitize the original data so that any association rule mining
algorithms that may be applied to the sanitized version of the data will be incapable of discovering the
sensitive rules under certain parameter settings, and while at the same time, will be able to mine all the non-
sensitive rules that appeared in the original dataset under the same or higher parameter settings and no other
rules[4-5]. It is quite challenging.
2.1. Hiding sensitive frequent itemsets
Assume that the original database is denoted as D-original, the pre-defined minimum support threshold as
, the set of all the frequent itemsets as F-original.
Let F-sensitive={s | s F-original and s is sensitive}.
The goal of sensitive frequent itemsets hiding is to construct a new, sanitized database D-sanitized from
D-original, which makes F-sensitive F-sanitized= , where F-sanitized is the set of all the frequent itemsets
on D-sanitized at the same pre-defined minimum support threshold as (or higher) , while less affecting the
non-sensitive itemsets , i.e., F-sanitized=F-original-F-sensitive.
To hide a sensitive itemset, the privacy preserving algorithm has to modify the original database D-original
in such a way that when the sanitized database D-sanitized is mined at the same (or a higher) level of support,
the frequent itemsets that are discovered are all non-sensitive.
2.2. Hiding sensitive association rules
Assume that the original database is denoted as D-original, the pre-defined minimum support and
confidence threshold as and , the set of all the association rule that satisfy and as R-original .
Let R-sensitive={r | r R-original and r is sensitive}.
The goal of association rule hiding is to construct a new, sanitized database D-sanitized from D-original,
which makes R-sensitive R-sanitized= , where R-sanitized is the set of all the association rules on D-
sanitized at the same pre-defined minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold as and
(or higher) , while less affecting the non-sensitive association rules , i.e., F-sanitized=R-original-R-sensitive.230 Hui Wang / AASRI Procedia 5 ( 2013 ) 228 – 234
2.3. Hiding requirement description
Given P: P P I
The hiding requirement is described withR sensitive.
Rsensitive {r| i left P i leftisconsidered sensitiveand contained inr'slefthand}
The goal is to hide rules in R-sensitive by low the confidence down to below the pre-defined minimum
confidence threshold . According to the definition of confidence, it can be done by increasing the support of
the left hand or decreasing the support of the right hand to decrease the confidence of the rule.
3. Quality measurements for hiding
The quality of hiding is important. Quality measurements measure the hidden effects, side effects and
database effects. Let C(r) and C’(r) the confidence of association rules r in R-original and R-sanitized,
respectively. Define hidden-rate, lost-rate, false-rate and altered-rate as following.
3.1. Hidden rate
Hidden rate is to measure the quality of sensitive association rule hiding. It measures the percentage of
hidden association rules among all of the sensitive rules.
|{r|r Rsensitive C(r) C'(r) }|
hidden rate *100%
|{r|r Rsensitive C(r) }|
The lower hidden-rate is the better. The best situation is hidden rate is 100%, that means that all the
sensitive rules can be hidden at the same (or higher) thresholds and .
3.2. Lost rate
Lost rate is to measure the side effect of hiding. It measures the percentage of lost association rules among
all non-sensitive rules.
|{r|r Rsensitive C(r) C'(r) }|
lost rate *100%
|{r|r Rsensitive C(r) }|
The lower lost rate is the better. There should be no lost rules in the sanitized database which are arrived
support and confidence in the original database at the same (or higher) thresholds and .
3.3. False rate
False rate is to measure the side effect, either. It measures the percentage of false association rules among
all of rules whose confidence is below the pre-defined minimum confidence threshold.
|{r|C(r) C'(r) }|
false rate *100%
|{r|C(r) }|Hui Wang / AASRI Procedia 5 ( 2013 ) 228 – 234 231
The lower false rate is the better. No false rules should be produced when mining the sanitized database at
the same (or higher) thresholds and .
3.4. Altered rate
Altered rate is to measure the workload of the database transformation. It measures the percentage of
altered transactions among the entire database.
|{r|r D original risaltered inD sanitized}|
altered rate *100%
|D original|
The lower altered rate is the better. When more transactions are modified, the more processing time would
be required.
4. Transformation strategies
Assuming some predicting items contained in the left hand of an association rule and it is so crucial to infer
a conclusion which is the right hand of the association rule. There are might multiple items contained in the
right hand of association rule. It is only need to hide rules with one item in the right hand instead of multi-
items’ ones. We have theorem 1 as follow.
4.1. Theorem 1
Given
A {i left} {i right} R; A {i left} B {i right} R;
A and B and A B ;i left I and i right I ;i left i right
Following conclusion holds:
confidence(A {i-left} B {i-right})<=confidence(A {i-left} {i-right})
Proof:
According to the definition of rule’s confidence:
support(A B)
confidence(A B)
support(A)
support(A {i left} {i right})
confidence(A {i left} {i right})
support(A)
support(A {i left} B {i right})
confidence(A {i left} B {i right})
support(A)
According to the definition of rule’s support:
support(A) |{(tid,T)|(tid,T) D T A A I}|
support(A {i-left} {i-right})>= support(A {i-left} {i-right})
So, the conclusion above holds.232 Hui Wang / AASRI Procedia 5 ( 2013 ) 228 – 234
4.2. Strategies
The strategies are based on theorem 1. According to theorem 1, if association rule such as A {i-left} {i-
right} is hidden, then all the association rules such as A {i-left} B {i-right} (B ) are hidden. To hide
rules such as A {i-left} {i-right} , it is needed to check the transactions contained {i-left, i-right} and
increase the appearances of item i-left in the transactions to increase the support of the left hand or decrease
the appearances of item i-right in the transactions to decrease the support of the right hand. The
transformation of database is repeated until good quality measurements are arrived.
4.3. Examples
Assuming F={a,b,c}; P={c}; =2; =0.75 .
The goal is to hide rules containing item c in the left hand. We consider the hidden effect and side effects
at a transformation of one transaction of the database.
Let database is represented as a binary vector where 1 means an item contained in a transaction and 0
means the item not contained in the transaction.
(1) Decrease the support of the right hand
Let D-original={011,111,111,110,100,001}
We decrease the appearance of item b to hide rules with the right hand contained item b while the left hand
contained item c.
For example, we make item b disappear in transaction 1 in D-sanitized.
D-sanitized={001,111,111,110,100,001}
The results in this step are illustrated in Table 1, where hidden-rate=50%, lost-rate=25%, false-rate=1/7.
Table 1. Hiding by decreasing the support of item b
Rule set Rule C(D-original) C’(D-sanitized) Status
c a 2/4 2/4 hold
c b 3/4 2/4 hidden
To hide c ab 2/4 2/4 hold
ac b 2/2 2/2 fail
bc a 2/3 2/2 false
a b 3/4 3/4 hold
Maybe false a c 2/4 2/4 hold
a bc 2/4 2/4 hold
ab c 2/3 2/3 hold
b a 3/4 3/3 hold
Maybe lost
b c 3/4 2/3 lost
b ac 2/4 2/3 hold
(2) Increase the support of the left hand
Let D-original={111,111,111,110,100,101}Hui Wang / AASRI Procedia 5 ( 2013 ) 228 – 234 233
We increase the appearance of item c to hide rules with the right hand contained item a while the left hand
contained item c.
For example, we make item c appear in transaction 5 in D-sanitized.
D-sanitized={111,111,111,110,101,101}
The results in this step are illustrated in Table 2, where hidden-rate=60%, lost-rate=0, false-rate=1/3.
Table 2. Hiding by increasing the support of item c
Rule set Rule C(D-original) C’(D-sanitized) Status
c a 4/4 5/5 fail
c b 3/4 3/5 hidden
To hide c ab 3/4 3/5 hidden
ac b 3/4 3/5 hidden
bc a 3/3 3/3 fail
a b 4/6 4/6 hold
Maybe false a c 4/6 5/6 false
a bc 3/6 3/6 hold
ab c 3/4 3/4 hold
b a 4/4 4/4 hold
Maybe lost
b c 3/4 3/4 hold
b ac 3/4 3/4 hold
5. Conclusions
Currently, approaches for privacy preserving of association rules are basically based on the same
fundamental theory of adjusting supports and confidences. The work focuses on the quality measurements of
hiding approaches to guide the sensitive association rule hiding process. Several crucial quality measurements
are defined. The requirements of sensitive association rule hiding are described. The transformation strategies
of database are proposed. Examples are illustrated and quality measurements are compared. Lots of algorithms
are proposed by researchers and a lot of room for improvement of the current hiding methodologies. It is quite
challenging to arrive at each of the best quality measurement.
