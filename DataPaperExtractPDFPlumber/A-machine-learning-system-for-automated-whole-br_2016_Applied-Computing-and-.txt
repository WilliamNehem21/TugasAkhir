1. Introduction
Epilepsy is a chronic condition of the brain, and causes repeated seizures, com-
monly referred to as fits. Epilepsy is said to affect 70 million people worldwide
[19]. The risk of developing epilepsy is greatest at the extremes of life with inci-
dencesmorecommonintheelderlythantheyoung[18]andisthecauseofprema-
ture mortality for those suffering with the condition [19].
Seizurescanbefocal(partial)andexistinonepartofthebrainonly,ortheycan
be general and affect both halves of the brain. During a focal seizure, the person
may be conscious and unaware that a seizure is taking place, or they may have
uncontrollable movements or unusual feelings and sensations. A diagnosis of
epilepsyismadewiththehelpofanelectroencephalogram(EEG).EEGrecordings
are commonly visualised as charts of electrical energy produced by the brain and
plotted against time [16].
The majority of previous works on seizure detection and prediction have
focused on patient-specific predictors, where a classifier is trained on one person
and tested on the same person [13,10,25,26,63,9]. In this paper, the emphasis is
on using EEG classification to generalise detection across all regions of the brain
using multiple subject records.
A whole-brain seizure detection approach supports para-clinical evidence
obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and EEG to make a diagnosis of
epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. It helps to mitigate the difficulties associ-
atedwith the capture and interpretation of electroencephalogram byneurologists.
In this paper, a robust data processing methodology is adopted and several clas-
sifiersaretrainedandevaluated,using342EEGsegmentsextractedfromtheEEG
records of 24 patients suffering with epilepsy.
The structure, of the remainder, of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes
theunderlyingprinciplesofEEGandthetypeoffeaturesextractedfromEEGsig-
nals. Section 3 discusses machine learning and its use in seizure and non-seizure
classification, while Section 4 describes the evaluation. The results are discussed
in Section 5 before the paper is concluded in Section 6.72 P.Ferguset al.
2. Seizure detection and classification
Gotmanisoneofthepioneersofseizuredetectionwhoseresearchintheareadates
back to 1979. In Gotman et al. [22], he proposed a system for automatic recogni-
tionofinter-ictalepilepticactivityinprolongedEEGrecordingsusingaspikeand
sharp wave recognition method. Extensions to this work are presented in Koffler
and Gotman [29], Gotman [21], Gotman [23], Qu and Gotman [51], while recent
works havefocussedon theuse of functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI)
and the correlation between cerebral hemodynamic changes and epileptic seizure
events visible in EEG [36]. More recently, he has looked at automatic seizure
detection in sEEG using high frequency activities in the wavelet domain [10].
Inotherstudies,themostcommonclassifierusedtodistinguishbetweenseizure
and non-seizure events has been the support vector machine (SVM). Using the
CHB-MIT database and a patient-specific prediction methodology, the study in
Shoeb[55] used a SVM classifier on EEG recordingsfrom 24 subjects. The results
show that a classification accuracy of 96% for sensitivity was produced, with a
false-positive rate of 0.08 per hour. In a similar study five records from the
CHB-MIT dataset (containing 65 seizures) were evaluated using a linear dis-
criminant analysis classifier [28]. The overall accuracy reported was 91.8%,
83.6% for sensitivity, and 100% for specificity. For similar SVM studies using
other datasets the reader is referred to [55,28,44,62].
Acharya et al. focused on using entropies for EEG seizure detection and seven
different classifiers [6]. The best-performing classifier was the Fuzzy Sugeno clas-
sifier, which achieved 99.4% for sensitivity, 100% for specificity, and 98.1% for
overall accuracy. The worst performing classifier was the Naı¨ve Bayes Classifier,
which achieved 94.4% for sensitivity, 97.8% for specificity, and 88.1% for accura-
cy.Nasehi and Pourghassem[43] used thesame CHB-MITdataset with a Particle
Swarm Optimisation Neural Network (PSONN) which produced 98% for sensi-
tivity and a false-positive rate of 0.125 per hour. Using the FRE1 dataset Yuan
et al. presented a patient-specific seizure detection system and an extreme
machine-learning algorithm to train a neural network [65]. Twenty-one seizure
records were used to train the classifier and 65 for testing. The results show that
the system achieved an average of 91.92% for sensitivity, 94.89% for specificity
and 94.9% for overall accuracy.
Patel et al. [49] proposed a low power, real-time classification algorithm, for
detecting seizures in ambulatory EEG. The study compared linear discriminant
analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Mahalanobis dis-
criminantanalysis(MDA),andSVMclassifierson13subjectsfromtheFREdata-
set. The results show that the LDA gave the best results when trained and tested
onasinglepatient,with94.2%forsensitivity,77.9%forspecificity,and87.7%for
overall accuracy. When generalised across all subjects, the results show 90.9% for
sensitivity, 59.5% for specificity, and 76.5% for overall accuracy.

3. Electroencephalography and feature extraction
Electroencephalography is the term given to the recording of electrical activity
resulting fromionic current flows generated by neuronsin the brain and is mainly
usedtoevaluateseizuresandepilepsy.InordertoretrieveEEGsignals,electrodes
are placed on the scalp where odd numbered electrodes are placed on the left side
of the scalp and even numbered electrodes on the right. Electrode locations and
names are specified by the International 10–20 system [55].
The collection of raw EEG signals is always temporal. However, for analysis
and feature extraction purposes, translation, into other domains, is possible and
often required. These include frequency representations, via Fourier Transform
[42,37,24,12]andwavelettransform[12,32,40,17,14,39].Theadvantageoffrequen-
cy-related parameters is that they are less susceptible to signal quality variations,
due to electrode placement or the physical characteristics of subjects [38].
Inorder toobtainfrequencyparameters,severalstudieshaveusedPowerSpec-
tralDensity(PSD).WithinPSD,PeakFrequencyisoneofthefeaturesconsidered
inmanystudies.ItdescribesthefrequencyofthehighestpeakinthePSD.During
a seizure, EEG signals tend to contain a major cyclic component, which shows
itself as a dominant peak in the frequency domain. In one example, Aarabi et al.
used Peak Frequency, along with sample entropy and other amplitude features,
todetectepilepticseizuresandachievedasensitivityof98.7%andafalsedetection
rate of 0.27 per hour [3].
Meanwhile, Ning and Lyu [45] found that Median Frequency displayed sig-
nificant differences between seizure and non-seizure patients. By segmenting the
EEG signal into five separate frequency bands for delta (d: 0.56f64Hz), theta
(h: 46f68Hz), alpha (a: 86f612Hz): beta (b: 126f625Hz), and gamma
(c: 256f), it was possible to predict 79 of 83 seizures, with a sensitivity value of
95.2%.
Root mean square (RMS) has also been considered a useful feature for distin-
guishing between seizure and non-seizure events. RMS measures the magnitude
of the varying quantity and is a good signal strength estimator in EEG frequency
bands[5].Inastudyonneonatalseizuredetection[50],21featuresforseizureclas-
sification were compared, which saw RMS achieves an overall accuracy of
77.71%. The study showed that RMS outperformed all the other features used.
Entropy has been used as a measure of the complexity, or uncertainty, of an
EEG signal, where the more chaotic the signal is, the higher the entropy. There
are two kinds of entropy estimators: spectral entropies, which use the amplitude
of the power spectrum; and signal entropies, which use the time series directly
[27]. Many authors agree that during a seizure, the brain activity is more pre-
dictable than during a normal, non-seizure, phase and this is reflected by a sudden
drop in the entropy value [46,47,61,66].
Energy is a measure of the EEG signal strength. Rather than looking at the
energy of the whole EEG signal, the energy distribution across frequency bands74 P.Ferguset al.
has been used in seizure detection [46]. The study found that delta and theta fre-
quencybandssaw amuchlargerdistributionofenergyduringa seizurecompared
to normal EEG, whereas the alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands saw a lower
energy distribution during a seizure. Using the energy distribution, per frequency
band, as a feature achieved an overall accuracy of 94%.
Correlation dimension has been investigated as a correlation measure in several
studies, which is a nonlinear univariate, widely used to measure fractal dimension.
Fractal dimension measures the complexity of the EEG signal, in other words, the
regularityanddivergenceof thesignal [33,7].In[1] correlationdimensionand five
otherfeaturesforseizurepredictionoffocalneocorticalepilepsyproducedreason-
ably good results with 90.2% for sensitivity and 97% for specificity. However,
when looking specifically at the correlation dimension they found the results
dropped in 44.9% of seizures and increased in the pre-ictal phase in 44.9% of sei-
zures. They also found that there were stronger dimension changes in the remote
channels compared with those near the seizure onset.
In [8] correlation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent were studied to
determine their ability to detect seizures. The study showed that neither measure
on its own was useful for the task, but did work better, when they were used
together. They also noted that correlation dimension was only useful when applied
to the frequency sub-bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma), and not on the
entire 0–60Hz frequency spectrum that was used in the study. The authors con-
cluded that changes in dynamics are not spread out across the entire spectrum,
but are limited to certain frequency bands.
Skewness is a third-order statistical moment, and kurtosis is the fourth. Along
withthefirstandsecondordermoments,meanandvariance,respectively,thefour
statistical moments provide information on the amplitude distribution of a time
series.Specifically,skewnessandkurtosisgiveanindicationoftheshapeofthedis-
tribution [4]. Khan et al. use skewness and kurtosis, along with normalised coeffi-
cient of variation, for seizure detection in paediatric patients. They managed to
detectall55seizuresfromasubsetof 10patients,achieving100%sensitivity,with
a false detection rate of 1.1 per hour.
4. Automated whole-brain seizure detection
Theaimofmoststudies,inEEGdetection,hasbeentodetectpatient-specificfocal
seizures, rather than predicting general seizures across a much bigger population.
As Shoeb [55] explains, a seizure EEG pattern is specific to a particular patient.
The main reason for this is that focal seizures can occur in any part of the brain,
and therefore, can only be detected in the EEG on specific channels. A classifier
trainedonapatientwhoexperiencesfocalseizuresintheoccipitallobes,forexam-
ple,wouldnodoubtbetrainedonfeaturesfromchannels,includingelectrodesO1,
and O2 (electrodes to monitor electrical activity in the occipital lobe), as theseA machinelearning systemfor automatedwhole-brain seizure detection 75
wouldbe the channelsfrom the areaof the seizureand therefore, best at detecting
the seizure.
For this reason, and due to the configuration of the dataset, this study focuses
ondiscriminatingbetweenseizureandnon-seizureEEGsacrossagroupof24sub-
jects. The classifiers are trained on all patient records and therefore, classification
is generalised across all subjects using features from channels that capture the
EEG in all parts of the brain.
The approachutilises machinelearning algorithmsembeddedin-line with exist-
ing clinical systems to enhance clinical practices in epilepsy diagnostics. The pro-
posed algorithms support para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic
resonance imaging and electroencephalography to alleviate the capture and inter-
pretation of electroencephalogram and help reduce costs, by minimising the need
for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. The approach provides auto-
mateddetectionofcorrelatesofseizureactivitygeneralisedacrossdifferentregions
of the brain and across multiple subjects.
4.1. Methodology
The CHB-MIT dataset is a publicly available database from physionet.org that
contains 686 scalp EEG recordings from 23 patients treated at the Children’s
Hospital in Boston. The subjects had anti-seizure medication withdrawn, and
EEG recordings were taken for up to several days after.
The EEG recordings are divided among 24 cases (one patient has two sets of
EEG recordings 1.5years apart). The patients range between 1.5 and 22years
of age, and there are 5 males and 17 females. Case 24 was added afterthe original
dataset was collected and has no patient data.
Most of the recordings are one hour long, although those belonging to case 10
are two hours and those belonging to cases 4, 6, 7, 9, and 23 are four hours long.
Records that contain at least one seizure are classed as seizure records and those
that contain no seizures as non-seizure records. Of the 686 records, 198 contain
seizures.
Although the description supplied with the dataset states that recordings were
captured using the international 10–20 system of EEG electrode positions and
nomenclature,itwasfoundthat17ofthefilesthatcontainedseizureshaddifferent
channel montages to the rest of the seizure files. Therefore, these 17 records have
been excluded from this study, leaving 181 seizure files. A further 10 records were
removed from the dataset due to a large number of missing data.
The final dataset used in this study was constructed from 60-s data blocks
(mean ictal length across the 171 seizure records), comprising the ictal data (sei-
zure), which were extracted from 171 seizure files. Table 1 provides a summary
of the ictal data with the 171 ictal blocks.
Theresultsshowthat25%ofthedatablocks(42.75blocks)containlessthanor
equal to 23s of ictal data, which means that 75% of our data blocks (128.2576 P.Ferguset al.
blocks)contain23sormoreofictaldata,withtheaverageblockcontaining45sif
we consider the median. However, the data contain outliers, i.e. the Max value is
752.To get a more representative summary the first 60s of ictal data is used from
each seizure record that lasts longer than 60s. Table 2 provides a summary of the
data.
The average block now contains 45s if we consider the median, 40.52% if we
consider the mean. More importantly, the majority of the data blocks (64%) of
the 171 ictal blocks contain 30s or more of icta data. In a real-world scenario,
it is unlikely that, whatever window size we select, data blocks will contain only
ictal data. The more realistic case is that it will contain both ictal and non-ictal
data. By having 60-s blocks with different ictal and non-ictal data splits, this
allows us to determine the performance of the classifiers under conditions more
aligned with a real-world situation. However, future work will explore optimal
window sizes. To balance the dataset, 171 data blocks randomly extracted from
non-seizure files were also added to the dataset.
Fig. 1 shows the processes used in the methodology to process the data, that
include filtering, feature extraction, feature selection, classification and finally
validation.
Each of these processes is discussed in more detail below. Fig. 1 shows a data
science methodology that produces a robust data analytics based solution.
4.1.1. Data pre-processing
IntheCHB-MITdatabase,eachrecordwassampledat256Hz,with16-bitresolu-
tion. Signals were recorded simultaneously through twenty-three different chan-
nels, via 19 electrodes and a ground attached to the surface of the scalp.
A bandpass filter was applied to each of the 342 EEG segments (171 seizures,
171 non-seizures) to extract the EEG data in eachof the frequency blocks. Second
order butterworth filters were used as they offer good transition band character-
istics at low coefficient orders; thus, they can be implemented efficiently. This
results in five columns of additional data; the complete bandwidth (0.5–30Hz),
delta(d:0.56f64Hz),theta(h:46f68Hz),alpha(a:86f612Hz):andbeta

(b: 126f625Hz). In other words, each block contains 115 columns of data for
each of the 23 EEG channels in the original data (N=23*(complete
bandwidth+delta+theta+alpha+beta)=23*5=115).
4.1.2. Feature selection
The feature vectors in this paper are generated from the 171 seizure files and 171
non-seizure blocks, obtained from 23 patients, using Peak Frequency, Median Fre-
quency, variance, root mean squares, sample entropy, skewness and kurtosis. These
featureswereextractedfromeachofthe115columnsinanEEGblock(N=7fea-
tures*115 columns=805). The literature reports that Median Frequency, sample
entropy and root mean squarehave the most potential to discriminate between sei-
zure and non-seizure records. To validate these findings, the discriminant capa-
bilities of each feature are determined using several measures: statistical
significance (p and q-values), principal component analysis (PCA) – Principle Com-
ponent one (PC1) and Principle Component two (PC2), linear discriminant analysis
independent search(LDAi), linear discriminant analysis forward search(LDAf), lin-
eardiscriminantanalysisbackwardsearch(LDAb)andgram-schmidt(GS)analysis.
Using these measures, the top 20 uncorrelated features were extracted from all
regions of the EEG scalp readings (region-by-region feature extraction is consid-
ered later in the paper). For example, in the case of p-values we select the top 20
uncorrelatedfeatures(fromthe805featuresthatwehave)thathavethehighestp-
valuesandusethesefeatureswithallourclassifiers.Thetttest2functioninMatlab
can be used to extract p-values and they can be ranked using the sort function.78 P.Ferguset al.
These features are then used to determine which classifier performs the best. The
sameapproachis used forthe q-values. The mafdr functionin Matlabcan be used
todeterminetheq-valuesandagain,theycanberankedusingthesortfunction.In
the case of Principle Component one (PC1), the top 20 uncorrelated features that
comprise the most variance in PC1 were selected and evaluated against all classi-
fiers.ThesameapproachwasusedforPC2.Inthecaseoflineardiscriminantana-
lysis feature selection, the featseli, featself, and featselb provided by the Matlab
patternrecognitiontoolboxPRToolsisusedtoprovideanorderedrankingoffea-
tures. In a similar way, the Gram-Schmidt ranks and orders each feature by
importance.
Table 3 shows that the best results were obtained from the linear discriminant
analysis backward search technique with an area under the curve (AUC) of
91%. This was followed closely by statistical p and q-values with AUC values of
90% and 89% respectively.
Fig. 2 shows (using PCA) that several RMS and Median Frequency features,
from different channels and frequency bands, appear along the principal compo-
nent.ThisisconsistentwiththefindingsinNingandLyu[45],Abdul-latifetal.[5],
Paivinenetal.[47].TheverticalaxisshowsthatCH12_48_Var,CH9_48_Var,and
CH3_0530_MFreq features align closest with the second principal component.
Again, these results are consistent with the findings in Ning and Lyu [45],
Abdul-latif et al. [5], Paivinen et al. [47].
This study also extracts the top five uncorrelated features from each of the five
regionscoveredbytheEEGscalpelectrodesasshowninTable4.Thisensuresthat

4.1.3. Classification
Following an analysis of the literature, the study in this paper adopts simple, yet
powerful algorithms. These include the linear discriminant classifier (LDC),
quadraticdiscriminantclassifier(QDC),uncorrelatednormaldensitybasedclassifier
(UDC), polynomial classifier (POLYC), logistic classifier (LOGLC), k-nearest
neighbour (KNNC), decision tree (TREEC), parzen classifier (PARZENC) and
the support vector machine (SVC) [61].
4.1.4. Validation methods
In order to determine the overall accuracy of each of the classifiers several valida-
tion techniques have been considered. These include Holdout Cross-Validation,
Sensitivities, Specificities, Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) and area under the
curve (AUC). The Holdout Cross-Validation technique uses 80 per cent of ran-
domly selected observations (N=19.2) to train the algorithms and 20 per cent
of randomly selected test cases to test the algorithms (N=3.8).
5. Evaluation
5.1. Results using top twenty uncorrelated features ranked using LDA backward
search feature selection
In the first evaluation, the top twenty uncorrelated features, extracted from each
of the frequency bands within each of the EEG channels, and nine classifiers
are used. The performance for each classifier is evaluated using the sensitivity,
specificity, mean error, standard deviation and AUC values with 100 simulations
and randomly selected training and testing sets for each simulation. In this study,80 P.Ferguset al.

high sensitivities are important to ensure that seizures can be detected within an
alarm system. High specificities are considered equally important as high false
alarm rates (more than 1 per hour) will deter doctors from using it.
5.1.1. Classifier performance
The first evaluation uses all the seizure and non-seizure blocks from all subjects in
the CHB-MIT dataset (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). The simulations use
80%fortrainingand20%fortesting.Table5,showsthemeanaveragesobtained
over 100 simulations for the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC.
As shown in Table 5, the sensitivities (seizure), in this initial test, are low for all
classifiers.Thisisinterestinggiventhatthedatasetisbalancedbetweenseizureand
non-seizure blocks. One possible reason for this is that the ictal length across the
171 records was 60s. However, in the CHB-MIT records ictal periods ranged
between 2 and 752 (cut down to 60s) seconds.It is possible thatsome ictal blocks
resemble non-seizurerecordsresultingin misclassification (particularly blocksthat
contain 2s of ictal data). However, given that 64% of the ictal blocks contain
more than 30s of icta data, this is appropriate for training. Furthermore, it is a
decision that is supported by the relatively high sensitivity, specificity and AUCA machinelearning systemfor automatedwhole-brain seizure detection 81

values. Nonetheless, further investigationis required. Table 6 shows the error and
standard deviations obtained over 100 iterations.
The results show that all techniques are able to achieve a classification error,
lower than the base-rate error of 50% (i.e. 171/342).

feature selection from five head regions
In the second evaluation, the top five uncorrelated features, extracted from five
main regions across the head, are used to determine whether the detection of sei-
zures can be improved. Again, the performance for each classifier is evaluated
using the sensitivity, specificity, mean error, standard deviation and AUC values
with 100 simulations and randomly selected training and testing sets for each
simulation.

5.2.1. Classifier performance
The simulations use 80% for training and 20% for testing. As shown in Table 7,
the sensitivities (seizure), for most of the algorithms have improved, including the
specificities values. The AUC results also show improvements for several of the
classifiers, with 93% achieved by the KNNC classifier. From the previous results,
we find a 4% increase in sensitivities, a 3% increase in specificities and a 2%
increase in the performance of the KNNC classifier, with other classifiers improv-
ing by similar values.
Again, the results in Table 8 show that the mean error has decreased by 3%
usingtheholdouttechnique.Thisindicatesthatusingaregion-by-regionapproach
is better at discriminating between seizure and non-seizure events.
Overall, the mean errors produced, using all of the validation techniques, are
significantly lower than the expected error, which is 171/342, i.e. 50%.

6. Discussion
The study has focused on discriminating between seizure and non-seizure EEG
records across a group of 23 subjects, rather than a single individual. The classi-
fiersaretrainedusingall24cases,andtherefore,classificationisgeneralisedacross
the whole population contained in the CHB-MIT database. To achieve this, fea-
tures from all the channels that capture the EEG in all parts of the brain were
used. In the initial classification results, the top 20 uncorrelated features from
thewholeofthehead(notregion-by-region)wereextractedfrom805possiblefea-
tures. This was determined using the linear discriminant analysis backward search
techniquetorankfeatures.Thisapproachachievedreasonablygoodresults,using
the KNNC classifier, with 84% for sensitivity, 85% for specificity, 91% for the
AUC, with a global error of 15%.
Interestingly,thefeaturesusedinthisinitialevaluation,involvedchannelsfrom
the four lobes of the brain, occipital, parietal, frontal, and temporal, but not the
channelsspreadacrossthecentreofthehead.Thisimpliedthatratherthanhaving
generalised seizures across the whole of the brain, a majority of focal seizures
occurred in each of the lobes. Unlike studies that used the BONN dataset, which
only contains one channel, or the FRE dataset, that contains six channels and84 P.Ferguset al.
identifiesfocalandextrafocalchannels,theCHB-MITdatabaseusedinthisstudy
contains 23 channels with no information on the seizure type or location.
Using the top five uncorrelated features from EEG channels specific to the five
main regions of the head improved the sensitivities and specificities, while produc-
inghighAUCvalues.ThebestclassificationalgorithmwasagaintheKNNCclas-
sifier, which achieved 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity, and an AUC value
of 93% with a 12% global error. This was followed closely by the SVC classifier,
whichachieved85%forsensitivity,86%forspecificity,andanAUCvalueof90%
with a 14% global error.
Comparing our results with other studies, we find that Shoeb [55] produced a
better sensitivity value (96%) than those reported in this study. However, their
approach utilised a SVM classifier trained and tested on an individual patient
and was not concerned with the generalisation of seizures across a bigger popula-
tion group. Consequently, the 88% sensitivity value produced in this paper
appears to be extremely good given that our classifiers were trained and tested
on data from 23 different patients, not just one. In a similar study, Nasehi and
Pourghassem [43] used a neural network and reported a sensitivity value of
98%, which again is higher than the results reported in this study. However, as
withtheworkofShoeb,theclassifiersweretrainedandtestedonspecificpatients.
Incomparisonwithotherstudiesthatadoptedasimilarapproachtoourstudy,
ourapproachproducedbetteroverallresults.Forinstance,Khanetal.[28]report
a 83.6% specificity value, while Patel et al. [49] report 94% for sensitivity, 77.9%
for specificity, and 87.7% for overall accuracy. Yuan et al. [66] report 91.72% for
sensitivity, 94.89% for specificity, and 94.9% for accuracy, while Aarabi et al. [2],
Kannathal et al. [27], report similar results. The results found in this paper can be
compared in more detail with the papers listed in Table 9.
This work has potential future clinical applications in the investigation of
patients with suspected seizure disorders and may be useful in the assessment of
patients with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD). Introducing automated sei-
zure detectiontechnologies could help increase capacitywithin healthcaresystems
such as the UKs National Health Service (NHS), which currently suffers from a
chronic shortage of trained clinical neurophysiologists to interpret EEGs. Tele-
EEG reporting has previously been suggested as a solution and more recently
online systems [20,41], which are interesting approaches, but carry increased costs
and concerns over data security. Nonetheless, these, including automated seizure
detection may be viable solutions, following further work aimed at improving
accuracy further.
7. Conclusions and future work
Within a supervised-learning paradigm, this study has addressed this challenge by
utilising EEG signals to classify seizure and non-seizure records. Our approach
posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjectsTable9 Seizuredetectionstudiesandclassificationresults.

without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an
improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity
and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-
NN classifier.
The results suggest thatthe algorithmsin-situ with existing clinical systems and
practicesmayenableclinicianstomakeadiagnosisofepilepsyandinstigatetreat-
ment earlier. It can help to reduce costs by limiting the number of trained special-
ists required to perform the interpretation by automating the detection of
correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain and
across multiple subjects.
There are a large number of features reported in the literature, which have not
beenconsideredinthispaper.Inparticularourfutureworkwillconsiderthesetof
features described in Logesparan et al. [34], Logesparan et al. [35]. Furthermore,
our future work will investigate the use of more advanced machine learning algo-
rithms,despitethe goodperformanceof the classifiers consideredin this paper.In
particular, we will investigate the use of convolutional neural networks [53] and
SVM with different kernels [54].
Window sizes will also be considered to determine whether further improve-
ments on accuracies can be made. Future development will also utilise regression
analysis and a larger number of observations. This may help to define the charac-
teristics of the pre-ictal phase. In addition, more advanced classification algo-
rithms, and techniques, will be considered, including advanced artificial neural
network architectures (higher order and spiking neural networks). The investiga-
tionandcomparison,offeatures,suchasfractaldimensionandcepstrumanalysis,
autocorrelation zero crossing and correlation dimension, have also not been per-
formed. These techniques should be investigated in a head-to-head comparison,
with linear methods.
The paper has investigated the use of classic yet powerful machine learning
algorithmsandevaluatedtheirabilitytodetectcorrelatesofseizureactivity.While
the results are convincing the paper does not address how the system can be gen-
eralisedfornormaluse.Furthermore,itdoesnotaddressreal-timeconcernswhere
performance will degraded significantly. The approach evaluates the algorithms
using offline data; however, this is not a good indicator of the system’s ability
as the signals that are used to train and test the algorithms are processed and
cleanedandappropriatefeaturesextracted.Thisisamajorconcernandourfuture
work will look to implement the methodology pipeline using real-time signals,
using advances in the Internet of Things and Big Data community that currently
utilise data processing technologies, such as Apache Spark.
Finally, there are concerns regarding the verification of the results produced
using the CHB-MIT dataset against other datasets. Our future work will investi-
gate the use of a bigger dataset, using patients provided by our co-author from
TheWaltonCentreNHSFoundationTrust,andotherdatasetsthatpermitaccess

Overall, the study demonstrates that classification algorithms provide an inter-
esting line of enquiry, when separating seizure and non-seizure records.
