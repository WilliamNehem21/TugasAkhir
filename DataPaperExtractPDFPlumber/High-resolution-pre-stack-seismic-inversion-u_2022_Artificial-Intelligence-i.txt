Keywords: We propose to use a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method for the pre-stack seismic inversion problem in obtaining a
Few-shot learning high resolution reservoir model from recorded seismic data. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) demon-

ability. Hence, ANN method could provide a high resolution inversion result that are critical for reservoir
characterization. However, the ANN approach requires plenty of labeled samples for training in order to obtain a
satisfactory result. For the common problem of scarce samples in the ANN seismic inversion, we create a novel
pre-stack seismic inversion method that takes advantage of the FSL. The results of conventional inversion are
used as the auxiliary dataset for ANN based on FSL, while the well log is regarded the scarce training dataset.
According to the characteristics of seismic inversion (large amount and high dimensional), we construct an arch
network (A-Net) architecture to implement this method. An example shows that this method can improve the
accuracy and resolution of inversion results.

2. Method
The objective of training an ANN is to find an input-to-output map-
ping and minimize the error between the network output and the labels.
The complicacy of the structure and the number of valid data largely
determine the predictive ability of supervised ANN (Das et al., 2019).
ANN applies successfully in the field of image classification because it is
easy to obtain valid labeled data (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), whereas in
the geophysical inversion it is often difficult to obtain numerous valid
labeled data. To meet this challenge, we combine the conventional

network not only has the ability to map from pre-stack seismic data to
reservoir parameters, but also has high resolution output due to the
influence of well log data on the network. Finally, the reservoir pa-

learning capability of the A-net, we can get the desired reservoir pa-
rameters from pre-stack seismic data.
We used a PyTorch implement of 1D convolutional layer to build
each convolutional unit (Fig. 3). At the end of each layers, we introduce
the nonlinearity using normalized function (BatchNorm1d) and activa-
tion function (ReLU) defined as χ(ξ)=max(0,ξ)(Nair and Hinton, 2010;
Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). There is also a linear mapping layer at the end
of the network. It is found that scaling labeled data and the output of the
network into a small range may accelerate the convergence process,
especially with the Adam optimizer that provides “normalized” (i.e., the
ratio of the first and the second momentum) parameter updates because
all trainable parameters are randomly initialized in a range of [0,1].
Therefore, in experiments of this paper, the ground-truth reservoir pa-
rameters models are scaled using the global minimum and maximum of
parameters values Mmin and Mmax, i.e., (M(cid:0) Mmin)/(Mmax(cid:0) Mmin).
To obtain the estimated reservoir parameters models, a reverse scaling
procedure is required to assign each pixel of output into a parameters
values, i.e., Moutput =Moutput×(Mmax(cid:0) Mmin)+Mmin.
