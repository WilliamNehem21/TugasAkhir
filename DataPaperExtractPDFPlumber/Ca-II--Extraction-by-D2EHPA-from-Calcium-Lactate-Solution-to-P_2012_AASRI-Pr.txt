Abstract
A new solvent extraction method that removing the Ca(II) from calcium lactate by Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid
(D2EHPA) to produce lactic acid was proposed. The influences of composition of organic phase, phase ratio, temperature
and calcium concentration, on extraction yield, were investigated. The optimal technological conditions of extraction were
obtained: reaction temperature 323 K, phase ratio (O/W) 4:1, the initial calcium concentration 1.03 mol L 1, the D2EHPA
volume fraction 40%, and 5% 1-octanol as modifiers. The reaction occurs at the interfacial zone possibly, and the rate is
mostly controlled by chemical reaction. Reaction order with respect to H A, pH and Ca2+ was determined and the rate of
2 2
calcium extraction could be expressed as: F = 10-6.81[Ca2+][H A]0.5[H+]-1.

1. Introduction
Lactic acid is a chemical commodity utilized in chemical and pharmaceutical fields [1]. Approximately 90%
of the total lactic acid produced worldwide is made by bacterial fermentation at present [2]. Solvent extraction
was a kind of method to recovery lactic acid from fermentation broth, and the lactic acid was extracted to
organic phase. However, this process has drawbacks of consuming extra chemicals and forming a waste salt.

To resolve these shortcomings, the way of keeping lactic acid in aqueous phase was proposed in this paper.
In this process, calcium lactate solution produced by the addition of calcium hydroxide to the aqueous
fermentation broth was contacted with D2EHPA (H A ) to remove cations to organic phase, while lactic acid
2 2
retained in aqueous phase. For this new approach of separating lactic acid by solvent extraction of cations, it is
necessary to perform detail experiments to optimize the extraction conditions and make some insight of
kinetic mechanism for finding out the determining step of the solvent extraction process.
The aim of this study is to select an appropriate solvent composition for extraction of Ca(II) and optimize
the extraction conditions, meanwhile, kinetic mechanism of solvent extraction was investigated. The effects of
composition of organic phase, phase ratio, temperature, and concentration of calcium lactate were examined in
effects of parameters on the extraction rate.
2. Experimental techniques
2.1. Materials
The materials used in this study were calcium lactate (kindly provided by Henan Jindan Lactic acid Tech
CO., Ltd.) which has an analytical purity of 98 %. The content of D2EHPA (Tianjin Chemical Co.ltd,) was of
99 %. 1-octanol, 2-octanol and iso-octanol, aromatic free kerosene were of reagent grade and were used
without pretreatment. Deionized water was produced by Millipore Milli-Q Water System.
The aqueous medium was prepared by dissolving calcium lactate in deionized water at desired temperature,
and its concentrations were measured by EDTA complexometry using EBT (Eriochrome black T) as an
indicator. All other reagents were of analytical grade.
2.2. Procedure
The experiments were carried out in 250 ml conical flask. Proportional volumes of aqueous and organic
phases were shaken for 5 min at constant temperature on the magnetic stirring apparatus, unless for the tests
about reaction time effect on the result. The phase separations were carried out in 250 ml separatory funnels.
After phase separation, the calcium ions concentrations in the aqueous phase were measured by EDTA
complexometry using EBT (Eriochrome black T) as an indicator. The pH of aqueous phase was measured by
a Mettler Toledo pH meter, and lactic acids concentrations could be calculated.
The construction of the Lewis cell and the working procedure with the Lewis cell used in this investigation
was discussed before [3]. The stirring rate was controlled at 180 rpm except the effect of it on kinetic
experiment. The aqueous concentration of calcium was estimated by sampling and complexometry. A Mettler
Toledo pH meter was used for pH measurements. All experiment were carried out at 293 K, the interfacial
area was kept at 1.776 cm2 unless for the tests about temperature or interfacial area.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The research of extraction process
The influences of H A volume fraction, modifiers, phase ratio, temperature, and calcium concentration
2 2
were researched, and the initial conditions were: reaction temperature 298 K, phase ratio (O/W) 4:1, the initial
calcium concentration 0.68 mol L-1, the H A volume fraction 40 %, and 5% 1-octanol as modifiers. The
2 2
major criterions to choose technological conditions were extraction yield and concentration of H+.Xiulian Ren et al. / AASRI Procedia 3 ( 2012 ) 341 – 350 343

3.1.1. Influence of D2EHPAvolume fraction on extraction yield and concentration of H+
The D2EHPAvolume fraction ranged from 10 vol. % to 50 vol. % to research its influence on extraction
yield and concentration of H+, and the result was plotted in Fig. 1 (a).
Fig. 1 (a). shows that the calcium extraction yield and concentration of H+ increased linearly with the
increase of D2EHPA volume fraction, and inflection points appeared at 35 vol. % and 40 vol. %, respectively.
These were because that more resultant was obtained. Considering the extraction yield and concentration of
H+, the H A volume fraction was chosen as 40 vol. %.
2 2
3.1.2. Influence of calcium concentration on extraction yield and concentration of H+
The calcium concentration was varied from 0.28 to 1.44 mol L-1, to research its influence on extraction
yield and concentration of H+, and the result was shown in Fig. 1 (b).
Fig. 1 (b). shows that with the growth of calcium concentration, extraction yield fell from 98% to 89%,
concentration of H+ grew from 0.5 to 1.39 mol L-1. These were because that more resultant was obtained.
Considering the extraction yield, concentration of H+, the calcium concentration was chosen as 1.03 mol L-1.
3.1.3. Influence of modifiers on extraction yield and concentration of H+
The volume fraction of three modifiers ranged from 5 vol. % to 25 vol. % respectively, to research their
influence on extraction yield and concentration of H+, and the result was shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 shows that the extraction yield and concentration of H+ increased with the increase of three
modifiers, but not observably. The reason was that the addition of modifiers changed the polarity of organic
phase, and made more D2EHPA exist as monomers. Meanwhile, the solubility of extraction complex was
higher with the existence of modifiers. Considering that the absence of modifier caused the solidification of
organic phase when it cooled to room temperature, the modifier volume fraction was chosen as 5 vol. %.
However, the influences of three modifiers on extraction process were similar, so all of them could be chosen.
In this research, 1-octanol was chosen as modifier.

3.1.4. Influence of phase ratio on extraction yield and concentration of H+
The phase ratio was varied from 2:1 to 6:1, to research its influence on extraction yield and concentration
of H+, and the result was plotted in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3. shows that the calcium extraction yield and concentration of H+ increased with the increase of phase
ratio, and both inflection points appeared at phase ratio of 4:1. The increase of phase ratio was actually to
increase the amount of extractant, which conduced to increasing the extraction yield and concentration of H+.
Considering the extraction yield and concentration of H+, the phase ratio was chosen as 4:1.
3.1.5. Influence of temperature on extraction yield and concentration of H+
The temperature was varied from 293 to 353 K, to research its influence on extraction yield and
concentration of H+, and the result was shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. shows that the temperature had a slight influence on extraction yield but a remarkable influence on
concentration of H+. The reason was that the distribution ratio of lactic acid changed with the change of
temperature, so more lactic acid could stay in aqueous phase. Considering the extraction yield and
concentration of H+, the temperature was chosen as 323 K.
The optimal technological conditions of extraction by D2EHPA were obtained: reaction temperature 323 K,
phase ratio (O/W) 4:1, the initial calcium concentration 1.03 mol L-1, the H A volume fraction 40%, and 5%
2 2
1-octanol as modifiers. Under these conditions, the extraction rate could reach 91%, and the concentration of
H+ could reach 1.4 mol L-1.

3.2.4. Identification of the nature of the kinetic regime
The most important criterion that enabled to distinguish between a diffusion-controlled and a kinetics
regime was the influence of extraction rate on the stirring speed, and to research it, the stirring speed was
varied between 60 and 210 rpm (Fig.7. (a)).
When the stirring speed was lower than150 rpm, the extraction rate was influenced by stirring speed. When
it was higher than 150 rpm, a plateau appeared, and the extraction rate is constant, demonstrating that the
interfacial area and the global transfer coefficient were constant.
A further criterion was the experimental determination of the activation energy of the extraction process.
Generally, when the rate is controlled by chemical reaction, Ea is above 40 kJ/mol; when the rate is controlled
by a diffusion process, Ea is below 20 kJ/mol; and the rate might be a mixture controlled regime when the Ea
value is between 20 kJ/mol and 40 kJ/mol [6].
The influence of temperature on the kinetics of calcium extraction was shown in Fig. 7 (b).The extraction
rate increased with increasing temperature and the experimental data obeyed Arrhenius equation:

The apparent activation energy of the reaction was 54.57 kJ/mol calculated from the Arrhenius plot, and it
was above 40 kJ/mol. That suggested the extraction process was controlled by chemical reaction.
The effect of interfacial area on the rate of extraction was another important criterion to identify reaction
mechanism. The relationship between interfacial area and extraction rate was showed in Fig. 7. (c),
demonstrating the reaction occurring at the interfacial zone possibly[7].
4. Conclusion
The following conclusions have been obtained:
1. The optimal technological conditions of extraction by D2EHPA were obtained: reaction temperature 323
K, reaction time 5 min, phase ratio (O/W) 4:1, the initial calcium concentration 1.03 mol L-1, the H A volume
2 2
fraction 40%, and 5% 1-octanol as modifiers. Under these conditions, the extraction rate could reach 91%,
and the concentration of H+ could reach 1.4mol L-1.

2 2
