vaccination process on different social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, etc. This study has analyzed the views
and opinions that they have expressed on different social media platforms about the vaccines and the ongoing
vaccination program. For performing this study, the reactions of the Bangladeshi netizens on social media have
been collected. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model has been used to extract the most common topics
expressed by the netizens regarding the vaccines and vaccination process in Bangladesh. Finally, this study has
applied different deep learning as well as traditional machine learning algorithms to identify the sentiments and
polarity of the opinions of the netizens. The performance of these models has been assessed using a variety of
metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score to identify the best one. Sentiment
analysis lessons from these opinions can help the government to prepare itself for the future pandemic.
