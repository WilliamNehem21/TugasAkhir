1. Introduction
At present GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) consists of two fully
operational global systems, the United States’ global positioning system (GPS)
and Russia’s GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS), as well as
the developing global and regional systems, namely Europe’s European Satellite
Navigation System (GALILEO), China’s COMPASS/Bei-Dou, India’s Regional
Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) and Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System
(QZSS). GPS is used in a large number of safety critical applications and has
become essential for precise timing reference and synchronization purpose in
telecommunications networks (Zhu et al., 2010). GPS signal power levels are
extremely low, due to the long satellite-receiver distance. The commercial GPS
receiver is easily affected by vulnerable effects of interference and noise. The
GPS receiver mounted on or inside manned or autonomous vehicles is easily
affected by impulse noise caused by motor emissions. This leads to a drop in
the carrier power to noise density ratio. Hence, it is important to have an
effective method to detect and filter the noise. Spectral signal processing consists
of time and frequency excision, pulse blanking and pulse spiking techniques
which are used to prevent loss of lock caused by the effect of noise (Borio
et al., 2008).
Thenominalpowerlevelofthereceivedsignalisonly(cid:2)158.5dBW.Thehighest
power density of the spread spectrum signal is (cid:2)220dBW/Hz where the nominal
backgroundnoiselevelisapproximately(cid:2)205dBW/Hz,i.e.thesignalstrengthlies
15dB under the background noise level (Braasch and Van Dierendonck, 1999). A
GPS signal below (cid:2)158.5dBW power level is categorized as a weak signal, so
there is a strong possibility of the cross-correlation peaks exceeding the autocor-
relation peaks. This will ruin acquisition and reduce satellite availability. The
pre-detection integration time plays a vital role in signal detection and in deter-
mining the feasible gain. This should be optimally selected to achieve the desired
acquisitionsensitivitywiththeavailableprocessingpowerandtoavoidfalselocks.
Hence the detection threshold should be optimally chosen to avoid false locks
whichcanbeachievedbyselectingapropervalueofthefalsedetectionprobability

acquisition in order to improve the SNR. Dividing the set of input data into
smaller blocks then stripping the C/A code from the data and performing FFT
based parallel code phase search technique (performing an algebraic sum of the
signal) are known as coherent detection (Bao-Yen and Tusi, 2005). In the non
coherentintegrationmethod,summingthedatablocksofsquaredcorrelationval-
ues of the acquisition process (performing an absolute sum of the signal) yields
good correlation. This increases the signal strength by a factor of 2 and noise
p p
by 2therebyincreasingtheSNRby 2or1.5dB(Deshpandeet al.,2004).This
improvement is less compared to the coherent integration method but requires
fewer operations. Also non-coherent integration is not affected by the navigation
databittransitionsincethecorrelationresultsofthecoherentintegrationtimeare
squared before summation. When the correlator output is multiplied with the
complexconjugateofthesuccessivecorrelatoroutputthismethodistermedasdif-
ferential coherent detection and thus by doing this a high degree of correlation is
beingmaintained.Hence,theSNRlossindifferentiallycombiningdetectionisde-
creased in comparison to non-coherent combining detection. Fallahi et al. (2012)
calculated probability of detection and the ROC (Receiver Operating Character-
istic)usingcoherent,non-coherentanddifferentialdetectionatvariouspowerlev-
els of GPS signal.
The typical C/N value of a commercial GPS receiver is in between 37 and
0
45dB-Hz. In the noisy environment of analyzing the GPS signal, the traditional
methods of coherent, non coherent and differential coherent ways of increasing
the integration time result in poor correlation. If the impulse noise distorts the
GPS signal, the parallel code phase search acquisition performed for single msec
data works only for C/N up to 35dB-Hz of the GPS receiver. Hence, it is quite

(Deshpande et al., 2004). A longer coherent integration time means a smaller
Doppler bin size which increases the number of the Doppler bins to be searched.
The coherent integration time is limited by two factors, navigation data bit tran-
sition and the Doppler effect on the C/A-code. A navigation data bit transition
will spread the spectrum causing the output to be no longer a CW signal. This
spectrum spreading will reduce the acquisition gain and distort the acquisition
peak. An increase of 100ms non coherent integration correlation can acquire
the signal having C/N up to 25dB-Hz. But all the above mentioned techniques

2. Inverse spiking filter based noise excision in GPS receiver
Inthissection, the spikinginversefilterbased noise excisionis proposed forexcis-
ing the impulse noise. The received noisy GPS L1 signal which has a C/N below
0
20dB-Hz is subjected to the spiking filter and the output of the spiking filter is
given to the A/D converter with a sampling frequency of 11.999MHz .If 1ms

The spiking de-convolution(Mathew and NarayanaDutt, 1993) is proposed to
compress the effect of impulse noise embedded in the GPS signal and to improve
the SNR value. The problem may be formulated as follows: To design a spiking
inverse filter h corresponding to the impulse noise function g , that is, h \g =

The actual filter output x^ is expressed as
x^¼ Yh ¼ YðYTYÞ(cid:2)1 YTx ¼ Px whereP ¼ YR(cid:2)1YT
The error vector can be written as

The error square becomes

The ‘‘performance’’ matrix P is a projection matrix with size
(N+M+1)·(N+M+1)andhastraceequaltoM+1,whileitseigenvalues
are either 0 or 1.For the sum of all the eigenvalues to be equal to M+1, there
should be M+1 eigenvalues that are equal to 1, and N eigenvalues equal to 0.
Therefore, the matrix P has rank M+1 (Mathew and Narayana Dutt, 1993),
and if the desired vector x is selected to be any of the M+1 eigenvectors belong-

impulse occurring at the i-th instant, x=d(n(cid:2)i).
The actual filter output from the spiking filter is given by
x^¼ Px ¼ Pdðn(cid:2)iÞ ð8Þ
Thus the i-th column of P matrix is the output of the i-th spiking filter which
reshapes y into a spike with i delays. The corresponding i-th filter is

Hence the columns of the matrix R(cid:2)1YT are all the optimal spiking filters. The
estimation error of the i-th filter is

The filter which has the optimal delay i corresponds to the smallest of the error J

block of peak search algorithm. As per the simulation parameters for the GPS
L1 signal mentioned in Table 1, the acquisition performances are tested for three
differentscenariosandtheoutputsaretabulatedinTable2.Forallthe3casesthe
peak algorithm proposed by Mao et al. (2008) has been used. The threshold con-
dition is set based on the maximum peak and the secondary peak values of the
decision statistic (S) in the acquisition process. The Threshold Condition used
for simulation is given as the Correlation max Peak – Mean Peak>0.96 and
the Max Peak – Secondary Peak>0. 5. Based on this condition, the simulation
is carried out for single msec data, and it is observed that the signal is absent
due to poor SNR and the typical parallel code phase search algorithm fails to de-
tectthedistinctpeak.Hencelongermsecdataofcoherentintegrationareusedfor
improving the SNR of the signal, but there is no significant improvement in strip-
ping the noise. On the other hand, even if non-coherent integration is performed,
the acquisition success percentage does not improve due to the large false alarm
peaks. The minimum requirement of 4 visible satellites was not attained in both
coherent and non coherent integration methods. Finally the spiking filter com-

TheacquisitionresultofSVN-16obtainedbytheconventionalmethodsforsin-

data is shown in Fig. 4.This depicts that the start of C/A code is not perfectly

Processing of single msec data results in worst correlation. Similarly analyzing of
coherent and non-coherent detection also provides many cross correlation peaks.
By comparing the outputs in Fig. 4, the conventional differential coherent
approach gives a better performance of detecting SVN-16. Only 2 SVNs surpass
the threshold condition but minimum 4 SVNs are required to find the user
position.
Nextthesamenoisydataaretestedwiththespikingfiltercombinedwithdiffer-
ential coherent detection (modified differential coherent). Increased visibility of
the satellites [SVN 3, 9, 10, 13, 16, 23 and 30] in terms of distinct peak (perfect
alignmentwith C/A code) is shown in Fig. 5. This approach performsbetter com-
pared to other traditional methods and ensures that the corrected code phase and
Doppler frequency enhance the acquisition performance. The results of Table 3
show the visible satellites, their respective Doppler frequency and code phase.

this method can detect only 35dB-Hz C/N level with 100% of probability of

the input signal. The two equally spaced (±0.5 chip apart) early and late versions
C/A code of visible satellites [SVN 3, 9, 10, 13, 16, 23 and 30] acquired in the
previous section is generated and correlated with the incoming signal to produce
two outputs.Theseoutputs arefiltered, squared and comparedusing anearly-late
normalized envelope discriminator. The phase lock loop (PLL) comprises of a
numerically controlled oscillator (NCO), carrier loop filter and a discriminator
(Kaplan, 1996). The output of the DLL is a signal only modulated with the
navigation data, which is also used as the input to the PLL. The Costas loop is
used for GPS signal tracking in the PLL stage. An arc tangent discriminator that
isinsensitivetothephasetransitionofthenavigationdatabittransitionsisusedto
determine the phase shift in the carrier frequency (Kaplan, 1996).The tracking
loop parameters used for simulation are listed in Table 4. Once the lock has been
accomplished, the navigation data bits are extracted from the In-phase arm since
the local carrier signal is in-phase with the incoming signal and all the energy will
be in ‘Ip’.

The impulse noise affected signal processed through traditional differential

Fig.7.SVN-3istestedduringtheacquisitionphaseasthissatellitedoesnotsatisfy
thethresholdconditionand is aninvisible satellite.Herethe PLLand DLLerrors
are not considerably reduced to the minimum extent. The input and reference
signals are not in-phase and the Ip and Qp values contain only noise. The demod-
ulation of navigation data is not possible in this case due to loss of lock with the
incoming signal and the tracking fails to demodulate the navigation data. From
the results we conclude that the noise is not effectively excised; so reacquisition
of GPS data is required.
The tracking operation is next tested for spiking filter combined with differen-
tial detection. For this method, the carrier frequency settles after 100ms period
and is shown in Fig. 8a. It is inferred that lock has been achieved for the GPS
signal power level of 20dB-Hz. The code-phase error and PLL error of SVN-3

are plotted in Fig. 8b and c. The outputs show that the code and carrier loops are
tracking the incoming signal with good accuracy. When the input and reference
signals are in-phase, the I arm only contains the navigation data as indicated in
Fig. 8d and the Q arm contains only noise. The binary navigation data demodu-
lated from the I arm are shown in Fig. 8e.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, a method based on the least square spiking filter is proposed to
excise the impulse noise in GPS receivers. From the results, it is evident that by
replacing the traditional differential coherent approach by least square spiking
filter, the detection of the number of visible satellites is increased and the reacqui-
sition of GPS data is avoided. It is shown that coherent, non-coherent detections
handletheGPSsignalwithC/N onlyupto35and30dB-Hz,respectivelywhereas

efficiently excises the noise and provides 90% of probability of detection for

of the navigation data. Further tracking results can be passed onto the bit and
