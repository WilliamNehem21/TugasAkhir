The academic paper describes a method to determine the position of an autonomous vehicle using 2D LiDAR scans and cadastral maps, primarily for outdoor scenarios. The process involves correlating a scan obtained from the vehicle's physical sensor with virtual scans from pre-made maps. A spectral technique is used to identify geometric relationships between the two types of scans, creating 2D geometric histograms that reflect their similarity. The virtual scan locations are then ranked based on this similarity metric, and a subset of potential vehicle poses is selected using a threshold defined by the correlation coefficient of scan combinations.

The paper presents a holistic approach that integrates odometry, scan matching, and scan-to-map matching to solve a graph optimization problem. The optimal vehicle pose is calculated based on the 2D LiDAR sensor's data. To refine this information, non-building objects are filtered out from actual laser observations through a split and merge technique combined with weighted line fitting. Generalized Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is then used to align the real range scan with the map-derived scan, and the resulting pose transformation is added to the graph if the ICP successfully converges.

The paper also introduces a method to address the uncertainty in longitudinal vehicle positioning found in environments that resemble corridors. It leverages scan-to-map matching in conjunction with a particle filter. This filter utilizes the pose estimate to generate a map scan, which is then matched against the actual sensor's range scan employing PLICP. The results are then integrated into the particle filter's population, producing more accurate and robust pose estimates than if a single particle or a fresh initialization was used.

Additionally, the paper contrasts this method with the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), which relies on mapping point distances to voxel distributions. The proposed Voxelized Generalized ICP (VGICP) approach considers the distribution of points within a voxel and matches these with target distributions. VGICP is designed to be more efficient and robust to variations in voxel resolution as it does not perform costly nearest neighbor searches.

Lastly, the researchers mention values of tested standard deviations, which they derived from the specifications of commercially available panoramic LiDAR scanners. They assessed the maximum range errors reported and divided them by three to encapsulate 99.73% of the errored readings within a calculated standard deviation value, following a statistical rationale.
