In this research paper, the authors introduce new findings that contribute to understanding a particular scientific phenomenon. They demonstrate through their results that a significant group of constructions based on realizability invariably leads to one of three outcomes: C, RC, or HEO, depending on the context. The proofs rely critically on a method originally developed by Dag Normann. Due to the nature of this extended abstract, the authors limit their discussion to detailed formulations of their theorems and a concise overview of how they approached the proof process.

Additionally, the concept of a realization for a type structure within a partial combinatory algebra (PCA) is discussed. This concept is essentially a modification of a previously defined concept (Definition 4.1). The paper also suggests that when dealing with the more expansive concept of applicative morphisms, it is possible to consolidate and utilize a singular notion of realization across different contexts.
