This study focuses on the impact of various dimensionless parameters on the undrained bearing capacity of footings on anisotropic clay, specifically considering the anisotropic strength ratio, dimensionless eccentricity, load inclination angle, and adhesion factor. A novel model based on a data-driven approach, MOGA-EPR (Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm - Evolutionary Polynomial Regression), is introduced to predict the bearing capacity factor, factoring in anisotropy, load eccentricity, and inclination. The model shows promise for routine application in designing shallow foundations under undrained conditions while accounting for the directional variability in clay strength.

However, an in-depth analysis is needed regarding the bearing capacity factor under eccentric load in anisotropic clay conditions. This study aims to analyze the effects of undrained strength anisotropy on the bearing capacity of footings under eccentric and inclined loading using the upper and lower bound approach within the Finite Element Limit Analysis (FELA) framework. The study disregards horizontal footing forces and notes that the adhesion factor becomes less significant in the absence of horizontal forces.

The findings indicate that an increase in the anisotropic strength ratio enhances the bearing capacity factor due to the naturally isotropic nature of clay properties. Conversely, a higher dimensionless eccentric length decreases the bearing capacity factor as it often diminishes the force transmission efficiency to the footing. The study presents a comprehensive approach to understanding and predicting the behavior of footings on anisotropic clay and introduces a tool for practitioners to estimate the bearing capacity with higher accuracy.
