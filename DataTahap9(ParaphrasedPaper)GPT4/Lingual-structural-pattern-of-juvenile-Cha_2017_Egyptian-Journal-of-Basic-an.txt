The academic paper describes the diversity in tongue structures among reptilian species belonging to the Squamata order and how these anatomical features reflect their feeding behaviors and environmental adaptations. The tongue is not only used for capturing food but also contributes to olfaction through collaboration with the vomeronasal organs. Reilly and McBrayer have proposed that the tongue is well-suited to manage the transportation of both liquids and solid food.

Chameleons, a family within the Squamata, are distinguished by their highly specialized tongues, which can uncoil rapidly to catch prey, sometimes extending beyond the length of their bodies. This incredible projection mechanism is facilitated by a combination of the hyoid bone, lingual muscles, and collagenous structures, with the accelerator muscle providing significant force for tongue propulsion.

Research by Anderson et al. indicates that younger chameleons, specifically juvenile Chamaeleo calyptratus, exhibit slower tongue retraction relative to their body size compared to adults, possibly because their mouth-closing mechanism is not yet fully developed.

To analyze the chameleon's tongue, the fore tongues of specimens at various developmental stages were preserved and prepared using a meticulous process involving fixation in glutaraldehyde, dehydration through alcohols, critical point drying, and gold coating for scanning electron microscopy. This analysis showed that the chameleon tongue is a complex organ engaged in prey capture, with the front of the tongue grasping prey and the mid and hind sections powering elongation and grasping. Notably, the presence of cartilaginous elements in the mid-tongue region aids in stiffening the tongue during projection, which is a novel finding.

The tissue surrounding the cartilage is pliable, enabling the external muscular layer to contract and glide, enhancing tongue extension. The hyoid bone plays a vital role in this tongue projection as a movable element of the skull connected by muscle to the jaw and thoracic region.

Glandular structures on the tongue's surface show variations in their reactions to specific staining techniques, reflecting the diversity in acid mucins and glycogen derivatives they contain. The secretions from these glands likely aid in prey capture and swallowing by lubricating the tongue and facilitating muscle contraction.

Various shapes of filiform papillae were observed, and these structures, resembling rigid tooth filaments, assist in handling prey and swallowing. Although no significant keratinization is evident in the lingual epithelium, cytokeratin expression, linked to structural proteins, was present. This protein expression is especially noteworthy in the juvenile stages of chameleons and seems to be tied to the prevalence of sulfur-containing amino acids in the papillae, as found in keratinization-related studies by Shimada et al. and Iwasaki et al.

Furthermore, the correlation has been drawn between cytokeratin expression and the presence of stem cells within the lingual epithelium. Tanaka et al. discovered that lingual epithelial stem cells show increased expression of specific cytokeratins, with heightened activity of these stem cells associated with the proliferation and differentiation of the lingual mucosa in young chameleons.
