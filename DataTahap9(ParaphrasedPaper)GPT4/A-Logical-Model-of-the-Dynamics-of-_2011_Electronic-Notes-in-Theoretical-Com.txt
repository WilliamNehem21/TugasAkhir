The process of amending preferences to make them strictly ordered, while keeping them transitive, is more complex when eliminating relationships between elements where one is less preferred than the other (x < y). To maintain consistency, additional relationships may need to be removed, and there is no single, definitive best method for doing so. Thus, the procedure to refine preferences into a strictly ordered set is inherently unpredictable. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on a non-transitivity-preserving but predictable method to streamline the discussion of the dynamics.

In the scenario where the initial state is z, a change is inevitable since staying at z is not an option. The only alternative states available are y or n. Furthermore, according to Lemma 5.2, transitioning to state i is impossible. Therefore, the only potential cycle involves alternating between states y and n. Because of symmetry, we may presume that state n followed by action a leads to state y, and then state n again at the next step (n, a |= y and n+1, a |= n). This cycle can result from a strong suggestion, resulting in state n with action a leading to a strong suggestion (n, a |= sn), which in turn implies a forceful nudge (n, a |= fn).
