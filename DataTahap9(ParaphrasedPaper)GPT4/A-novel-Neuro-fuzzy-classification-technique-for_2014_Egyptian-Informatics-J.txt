In our study, we introduced a new neuro-fuzzy classification approach to enhance data mining processes. This approach utilizes a generalized bell-shaped membership function to fuzzify inputs for the classification system, where input patterns receive a membership degree to different classes. A pattern is then categorized into a specific class based on its membership degree. We tested our model on ten benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and compared its performance against two established algorithms: Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS).

Our comparison focused on several performance metrics, including accuracy, root-mean-square error (RMSE), kappa statistic, true positive rate, false positive rate, precision, recall, and f-measure. Our proposed method outperformed both RBFNN and ANFIS in all performance measurements.

The paper is structured with related works reviewed in Section 2, the description of our neuro-fuzzy method in Section 3, the detailed procedure in Section 4, performance analysis and results discussion in Section 5, and conclusions in Section 6.

Previous research by Kuncheva has shown that fuzzy pattern recognition can be useful in real-world problems, advocating the combination of fuzzy systems with neural networks. Moreover, other studies have highlighted the benefits of integrating fuzzy systems with artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to enhance learning and adaptive capabilities.

Abonyi et al. developed computational intelligence techniques that meld fuzzy rule-based systems with data mining algorithms based on soft computing principles, with successful applications in selecting features, optimizing rules, and simplifying rule bases, as demonstrated with the wine data classification problem.

Our methods were tested on ten datasets using MATLAB, leading to superior results for our neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) compared to RBFNN and ANFIS. The NFS yielded the lowest RMSE and highest kappa statistics, indicating its effective classification and predictive capabilities in data mining.

Overall, our findings suggest that the NFS classifier could significantly improve traditional classification methods for data mining applications. Despite these promising results, future research aims at broader experimental assessments and integrating additional interestingness measures from the literature.
