This presentation examines the creation of real-time software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and addresses issues of precision and efficiency when converting between various semantic frameworks. The necessity for these conversions emerges in an effort to reconcile the clarity of conceptual models with the practicality of computational models, highlighting that challenges in software development are present not just in coding but also in the initial design stages.
