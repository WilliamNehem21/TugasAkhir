The paper discusses the challenges and novel approaches to ensuring secure and efficient data routing in opportunistic networks, which are characterized by sporadic and indirect connections caused by node movement. The proposed Trust-Based Model for Opportunistic Networks (TBMOR) integrates direct and indirect trust measures to evaluate node reliability, utilizing Forwarding Positive Degree (FP) and Node Activity Degree (NA). This model enhances routing decisions by generating a list of trustworthy next nodes, which is further refined through pruning strategies to optimize the network's performance. Additionally, TBMOR aims to extend the lifetime of the network by dynamically adjusting energy thresholds, thereby controlling the number of message replicas based on trust assessments.

The paper outlines the progression from the traditional "epidemic" method of routing, which relies on replicating packets to increase delivery success at the cost of network resource consumption, to more sophisticated strategies like "spray and wait" and motion-based algorithms, which aim to balance efficiency and resource use.

The study highlights the importance of trust models over cryptographic approaches for security due to the high resource demands of encryption methods in opportunistic networks. Notable work in trust-based models is reviewed, including mechanisms for integrating node behavior and historical data to predict reliability and mitigate malicious activities.

The TBMOR approach is compared with existing algorithms like Epidemic, Prophet, and Spray and Wait using the ONE (Opportunistic Network Environment) simulator, demonstrating improvements in message delivery rates and latency while resisting malicious attacks effectively.

The paper concludes with simulation experiments that show TBMOR's superior performance under various scenarios such as varying packet lifetimes, node cache sizes, and under the presence of malicious nodes, showcasing its ability to maintain high packet delivery with lower redundancy and latency across different network conditions.
