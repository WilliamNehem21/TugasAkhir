HIV/AIDS first came to prominence in the 1980s and has since become a global epidemic, infecting and affecting millions. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is a type of lentivirus that progressively deteriorates the body's immune system, ultimately leading to death. AIDS signifies the most severe stage of HIV infection. To evaluate the epidemic, researchers look at incidence and prevalence rates. Prevalence reflects the proportion of people living with HIV, while incidence indicates the number of new cases each year or quarter within a population.

To gather national HIV statistics, various methods are employed, including national surveys, sentinel surveillance at health facilities, particular surveys of high-risk populations like sex workers, and back-calculation from surveillance registries. One significant hurdle in collecting this data is the societal stigma attached to HIV/AIDS.

This study focused on analyzing additional characteristics of high-risk populations, like people who inject drugs (PWIDs), along with existing data on demographics, sexual and injecting behaviors, and biological aspects to improve the prediction of HIV risk scores. This novel approach enhances the current understanding in HIV/AIDS predictive research.

The use of machine learning classifiers for predicting diseases including HIV/AIDS is widespread in the medical field. This paper illustrates the practicality of machine learning for forecasting HIV/AIDS outcomes and survival rates in diverse regions worldwide. It also identifies key risk factors contributing to HIV spread in specific areas. Key objectives within the study include classifying HIV status and predicting patient survival.

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model for HIV prediction is introduced, which uses genetic algorithms for classification and has achieved an accuracy rate of 84.24%. The research acknowledges that incorporating social factors like financial status could potentially improve these results.

The experiment involves PWIDs from 2012 to 2019, encompassing 57 attributes pertaining to demographics, behavior, and biology. Demographic attributes capture age, education, and marital status, whereas behavioral attributes include injection habits and sexual practices, affecting HIV status, which is categorized as negative (not exposed to HIV) or positive (HIV reactive).

During data analysis, the study faced the issue of missing values, which was addressed using data imputation techniques. Based on the attribute type, missing values were substituted with mode for categorical data or mean for numerical data.

Feature selection was carried out using automated machine learning tools like SelectKBest and Extra Tree classifiers, prioritizing features with expert opinion. Various classification methods, including Random Forest (RF), PART rule induction, and SVM, were used to predict HIV/AIDS status based on the selected attributes.

The dataset for this research was provided by NZ Trust, which was collected via a Management Information System (MIS) utilized by over 30 Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) across Pakistan. Outreach workers interact with PWIDs to provide prevention and treatment services, with data manually recorded and later entered into the MIS by data entry operators.
