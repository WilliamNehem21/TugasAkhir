The paper is organized as follows: initially, a short introduction is given to the concept of the restart method within the context of applications. The following section discusses how restart strategies are evaluated within service-oriented systems. The 'SFERA' framework is introduced in Sections 4 and 5, with its application illustrated in Section 6. The paper is concluded in Section 7.

Restarts are used to address failures noticeable in the time it takes to complete tasks. This is particularly relevant in service-oriented systems where issues like system crashes, network disruptions, or overloads can lead to increased or even unbounded task completion times. Thus, evaluating restart methods in these systems concentrates on analyzing task completion times using test-beds, simulations, or analytical methods.

For measurement-based assessment, a testbed with clients, servers, and restart algorithms is created, and task completion times with and without restarts are recorded. Tools such as Puppet and Genesis can facilitate testbed deployment. This approach generates realistic data on system completion times and delays but is limited by the availability of hardware and the duration of experiments.

A simulation framework tailored for service-oriented architectures is presented, extending traditional process chains and incorporating quantitative aspects to simulate both system architecture and inter-service networks. It prioritizes detailed system modelling, which restricts how many client scenarios can be scaled due to its intricate nature.

Data on completion times, either raw or processed using OMNeT++ objects, is recorded on a per-client basis. This allows further analysis through external scripts. SFERA, for efficiency, does not employ OMNeT++'s inherent data management and analysis features.

A testbed was set up with four distinct web services that together provide a composite service. Each service was deployed on a separate machine, forming a networked system. Tests were conducted to measure completion times both with and without induced packet loss. As these times capture realistic system performance, they serve as a solid foundation for evaluating restart strategies.

The observed completion times were modelled using acyclic phase-type distributions with the help of the PHFit tool. This resulting distribution provided an accurate narrative of the time data, which was in turn used as a basis for evaluating service times within the working servers.

The simulations were concentrated on one parallel client and three work servers that combined their workflows. Two faultless servers run in parallel until their results are collated by an administrative module, which then hands over to a fault-simulating server with packet loss data. Several restart algorithms—fixed intervals, Jacobson/Karn, and QEST—were tested, and their parameters were tailored to the testbed's measured completion times. The impact of these restart algorithms on statistical properties, primarily the empirical mean of completion times, was then thoroughly examined.
