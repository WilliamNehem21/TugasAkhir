The paper discusses the challenges of reusing semantic descriptions when designing new programming languages, emphasizing that even though basic constructs like conditional statements are common across languages, their semantics often cannot be directly transferred from one language to another.

Doh and Mosses addressed this issue by proposing a modular structure for Action Semantic Descriptions (ASDs), where each programming construct's description is a separate module, allowing for straightforward language descriptions and supporting the explicit reuse of semantic descriptions. They used the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment for validation but found direct use of ASF+SDF problematic due to notational overhead.

The authors of the paper propose a new formalism, ASDF, designed to offer reusable descriptions of individual language constructs with less notational overhead, alongside a supporting environment called the Action Environment. This environment builds on the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment by exploiting its open architecture to integrate new components, such as translators from ASDF to ASF+SDF, and potentially in the future, a typechecker, interpreter, and compiler specific to ASDF.

The ASF+SDF Meta-Environment itself provides a rich set of tools, including syntax-directed editing, well-formedness checks, visualization of code structure, and a library of common data structures and programming language grammars. It also supports refactoring operations and addition of new components through a button language and graphical user interface mechanisms.

Action Semantics (AS) is a hybrid of denotational and operational semantics, which uses action notation (AN) to define the semantics of programming constructs. The modular nature of ASDs stems from AN's design, not from explicit named modules, providing a flexible approach to the enrichment of behaviors in actions and data processing.

The paper also discusses the technicalities of implementing new features in the meta-environment, the similarities of the Action Environment with the previously developed ASD tools and the Abaco system, and proposes an object-oriented presentation of action semantics for individual constructs.

Ultimately, the paper presents the ASDF formalism and the Action Environment as solutions for developing reusable, modular semantic descriptions, furthering the documentation and design process for new programming languages. An initial case study has been performed using ASDF and the Action Environment to describe the basic constructs underlying Core ML.
