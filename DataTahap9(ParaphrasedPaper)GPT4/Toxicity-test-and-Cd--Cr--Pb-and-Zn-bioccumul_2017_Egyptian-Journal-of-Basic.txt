Fish are vulnerable to the accumulation of heavy metals, which can be taken up and stored at each level of the food web, particularly in water environments where filter feeders like phytoplankton and shellfish collect suspended particles. Not only do fish ingest metals through their diets, but they also absorb them directly from the water via their gills.

During an adjustment phase, fish were fed a standard commercial diet suitable for omnivorous species daily. During acute toxicity testing, however, the fish did not receive any food. Both the acclimation and experimental protocols conformed to ABNT NBR 15088 guidelines.

The study used a range of zinc sulfate concentrations (30 to 90 mg/L), informed by the literature and preliminary investigations, to expose the fish within 4-liter water tanks with quality parameters maintained as per Georgetti (2010)â€”specifically, a water hardness of 40 mg/L CaCO3 and dissolved oxygen from 7.0. After contaminating the containers, the fish were observed for 96 hours, with dead specimens collected and analyzed for relevant parameters.

To ensure analytical accuracy, solutions were diluted to specific concentrations and the 1.0 mg/L standard was evaluated 11 times. To confirm the efficacy of the recovery method, additional testing was conducted.

The sensitivity of small-bodied Poecilia fish species to heavy metals such as cadmium, zinc, and lead can be associated with factors like size, ecological requirements, and metabolic activity, all of which impact metal concentration and retention in various fish species.

Comparing different toxicities and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for metals like zinc sulfate in zebrafish and other species revealed that zinc accumulates more significantly yet is less toxic than lead and cadmium. However, chromium, which is less bioaccumulated, is better tolerated by the species.

The study also examined the chronic effects of metal exposure on P. caudimaculatus, noting that lead and cadmium were the most toxic, with higher BCFs observed in the order Zn > Pb > Cd > Cr after three months. This suggests a strong potency for bioaccumulation, especially for cadmium and lead, despite their relative concentrations.

Given that cadmium and lead are considered nonessential and potentially very harmful, the observed BCFs, including those under different conditions reported by other studies, indicate that there may be mechanisms for detoxifying and regulating these heavy metals in fish.

Lead toxicity was further discussed, particularly how it relates to water conditions, being less toxic in contexts where water hardness and pH levels cause lead compounds to precipitate.

The successful use of P. caudimaculatus as a bioindicator in these experiments highlights its significance as a species that can signal various levels of chronic, accumulative, and persistent environmental effects beyond direct individual impacts.

P. caudimaculatus's ability to thrive in both pristine and contaminated environments, coupled with its abundance, reproductive ease, and adaptability to laboratory settings, establishes it as an ideal candidate for a bioindicator species.

The study emphasizes the importance of utilizing native species in toxicity tests and as bioindicators to avoid the ecological risks associated with introducing exotic species and to better protect local biotas from contaminants.

The study concludes that contamination by metals such as cadmium, lead, chromium, and zinc poses risks to the aquatic food web and that validating P. caudimaculatus as a bioindicator offers a tool for addressing heavy metal pollution in aquatic environments.

The experimental findings revealed that lead nitrate was the most harmful substance to P. caudimaculatus, followed by cadmium nitrate, zinc sulfate, and potassium dichromate, yet the species still proved to be an effective bioindicator for these metals.
