In the academic paper, the authors introduce a proof planning system with a graphical user interface (GUI) that serves as a back-end for facilitating interactive proof exercises. This system suggests proof steps to learners based on the proof planning context, and these suggestions can be tailored to individual users and educational criteria using pedagogical knowledge.

The paper is organized as follows: It begins with a background on proof planning and the ActiveMath system, followed by the introduction of four learning scenarios that utilize a proof planner. The focus then shifts to one specific scenario—interactive proof planning—and the usage examples are explained. Here, the authors detail how exercises can be customized for learners and how suggestions are offered through an interaction console, which displays the partial proof plan. The article concludes with a summary and outlines future research directions.

Strategies have been implemented to make proof planning more systematic and hierarchical. These strategies consist of various methods and search heuristics, each corresponding to different approaches to proof planning. The proof planner operates in two modes: automatic, where it autonomously searches for a proof plan, and interactive, where the user guides the decision-making process.

The authors elaborate on how their system not only suggests tactic applications but also offers guidance for method applications and meta-variable instantiations. If certain arguments are missing for a command applying a tactic, the system generates partial suggestions, and the user is then responsible for providing the missing information.

The different learning scenarios are reflected in the design of the proof GUI, emphasizing user adaptability to accommodate the learning context. Command suggestions can sometimes be over-specified, including like the result of a method's application. This practice can aid in teaching learners how to manually perform certain techniques.

The authors discuss strategies for automatically applying methods to simplify proof steps for learners who are already familiar with them, for example, in decomposing logical operators or normalizing assumptions. However, selecting methods from a list can sometimes be less distracting for learners who are still trying to understand proof concepts.

The current GUI does not yet offer tailored presentation of proofs, suggestions, or feedback to cater to the varying needs of learners. Enhancing this adaptivity and exploring automated generation of both faulty and over-specified suggestions are identified as objectives for future development.
