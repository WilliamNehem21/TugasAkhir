This paper discusses different methods for determining the location of a person, item, or target, emphasizing that the choice of localization technique is application-dependent. A system's accuracy and precision requirements will dictate the appropriate approach. Localization technologies are critical in various contexts, such as tracking assets, healthcare management, providing location-based network access, enhancing gaming experiences, aiding manufacturing processes, supporting law enforcement and military operations, streamlining logistics, optimizing retail experiences, bolstering security measures, navigation assistance, and enriching conference experiences.

The research categorizes localization technologies into two groups: indoor and outdoor systems. For outdoor localization, Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely accepted and integrated into many portable electronic devices. However, GPS is ineffective for indoor positioning due to its need for a direct line-of-sight with satellites. As a result, alternate technologies using radio wave properties have been developed for indoor use, which is the focus of this survey paper.

RFID-based localization is discussed, involving electromagnetic interactions between RFID readers and tags. RFID tags can be passive or active, with passive tags having a limited range of approximately 1-2 meters and higher reader cost, while active tags offer a significantly extended range suitable for larger environments.

The paper also reviews passive localization systems and notes that their prevalence is lower compared to active systems. A new concept known as Device-Free Passive (DFP) localization has been introduced, allowing for the detection and tracking of targets without any attached hardware or tags. DFP systems leverage variations in the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of wireless communication to detect objects or humans. Techniques like DFP are particularly useful for security, military, and police operations, especially when entering a building might be hazardous.
