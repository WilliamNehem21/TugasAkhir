The paper discusses two approaches to the semantics of non-classical logics. Many-valued semantics extend the concept of homomorphisms from language structures to truth-functional algebras, incorporating a range of truth values beyond the binary. On the other hand, Kripke-type semantics adhere to the traditional binary truth values but introduce relationships between different valuations. Despite potential philosophical debates, both approaches offer significant technical advantages, providing mathematical frameworks to support fundamental philosophical concepts.

This paper centers specifically on two semantic frameworks: multivalued semantics and Kripke-type semantics, providing a broad introduction to these conceptual structures in the realm of logical theory.
