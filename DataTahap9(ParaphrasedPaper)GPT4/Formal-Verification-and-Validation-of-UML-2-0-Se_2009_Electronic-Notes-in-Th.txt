This academic paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 details the process of generating PROMELA code in line with UML 2.0 interaction semantics. In Section 3, a verification and validation (V&V) method involving source/destination and send/receive events is introduced. Section 4 describes a practical application of the proposed technique and shares the experimental findings. Section 5 gives an overview of the tool developed for the V&V process. Section 6 reviews work related to the subject. The paper is concluded in Section 7 with closing thoughts and suggestions for future research.

The study utilized the SPIN model checker to test specified properties and found that only the initial property holds true. For all other properties, SPIN provided counterexamples. The paper proceeds to explain the failing traces for each evaluated property.

For future research, two principal issues are suggested for consideration. Firstly, there is a significant disparity between natural language descriptions and formally written logic properties. Enhancing model checkers with graphical notations, macro languages, and property specification patterns could bridge this gap and help adapt these tools for industrial use. Secondly, security aspects are often distributed across various types of diagrams rather than confined to a single one. Conducting analysis across multiple diagrams could yield more accurate assessments of UML models.
