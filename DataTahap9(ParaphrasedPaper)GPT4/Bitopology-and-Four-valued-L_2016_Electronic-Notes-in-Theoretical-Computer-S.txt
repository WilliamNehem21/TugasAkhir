This paper explores the relationship between two structural theories, bilattices and D-frames, which provide a four-valued logical interpretation. Bilattices are connected to logic while D-frames were developed with topological semantics in mind. The authors introduce a unified structure, merging bilattices and D-frames into a single framework that offers clear bitopological semantics and retains many bilattice logical properties. This new structure is named ND-frames.

Jung and Moshier's work on bitopological spaces, or bispaces, revealed that these can represent four-valued logic wellâ€”associating one topology with true predicates and another with false ones. This semantic interpretation is more apparent in D-frames' algebraic duals (ND-frames).

The research argues that ND-frames are a natural extension of D-frames, combining advantages from both bilattices and D-frames while presenting a bitopological interpretation for logical negation through interior operators.

The paper's contributions include a generalization of bilattices allowing for non-isomorphic components within four-valued structures. For D-frames, it provides an account of proof-theoretic negation and extends this negation across the entire D-frame, linking geometry with proof theory. ND-frames also refine the classification of bispaces due to their broader spectrum class.

The authors extended Stone duality from D-frames to ND-frames, which suggests the robustness of the theory. Additional assumptions align topologically, with 'P' and 'M' linked to interior operators. The only variation from D-frame duality includes the conditions (DPP) and (DPM). For spatial ND-frames, conditions (SP) and (SM) are also required.

Overall, this generalization allows comparisons between the partial implication in D-frames and the implication in bilattices, showing that the former is significantly stronger than the latter. This paper indicates that melding the two structures not only allows for deeper understanding but also enhances their theoretical and practical applications.
