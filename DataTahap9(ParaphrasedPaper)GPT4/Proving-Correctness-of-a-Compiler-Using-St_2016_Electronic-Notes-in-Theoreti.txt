In this research, we present a proof that confirms the accuracy of a compiler for a call-by-name programming language, employing step-indexed logical relations and the principle of biorthogonality. Our source language builds on the simply typed lambda-calculus by incorporating recursion, while our target language is fashioned after the Krivine abstract machine. The proof has been meticulously developed with the help of the Coq proof assistant.

Compiler correctness verification has advanced significantly since the pioneering works decades ago, with notable examples like CompCert for the C language and other certified compilers for functional languages. For our source language grammar, we use de Bruijn indices-based lambda calculus and enhance it with constructs like a fixed-point operator, integer literals, strict arithmetic functions, pairs, and selective projections.

Through Lemma 5.7, we facilitated a nested induction relevant to the 'rec t' case. If the source language excluded the fixed-point operator, thus being strongly normalizing, the semantic chain wouldn't be required, and compiler accuracy would directly tie to the semantics of the source term.

All results in this study are rigorously formalized within Coq (using version 8.4pl6 and ssreflect 1.5), ensuring a constructive approach without relying on classical axioms. We encourage readers to delve into our Coq formalization, which enriches the insights provided in this paper.

Looking ahead, we aim to evolve the source language by enhancing its type system and introducing new elements. Similar to past proofs of compiler accuracy for higher-order imperative languages, we're interested in applying relational proof strategies for compiler correctness. We're also keen to adapt our methods to other execution models that better reflect actual assembly language, in addition to applying it to lazy functional languages and targeting abstract machines like the Sestoft or STG machines.
