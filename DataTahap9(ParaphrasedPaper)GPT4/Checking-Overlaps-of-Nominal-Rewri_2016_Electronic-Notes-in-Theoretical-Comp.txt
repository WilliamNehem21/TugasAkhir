This paper extends the concept of first-order rewriting by introducing support for binding operators through nominal rewriting. The authors present sufficient conditions to ensure the local confluence of closed nominal rewriting systems by examining rule overlaps. Specifically, they demonstrate that if all nontrivial, critical overlaps (called "proper critical pairs") can be resolved, then the closed nominal rewrite rules are locally confluent. The paper also refines the concept of rule overlap specifically for closed rewriting systems, providing conditions that are straightforward to check using existing nominal unification techniques.

The authors argue that, in the absence of termination, local confluence can still be guaranteed by the critical pair lemma, a cornerstone of the Knuth-Bendix completion procedure. Notably, they mention orthogonality as a significant condition for achieving confluence without relying on termination; it employs two syntactic constraints on the rewriting rules: left-linearity, ensuring a variable appears only once on the left side of a rule, and a non-overlap condition that prevents rules from having overlapping left sides except in specific trivial cases.

The paper defines "closed rules" as those without free atoms, where bindings of atoms remain unaffected during rewriting. The term "closed terms" is then given both a structural definition and an operational characterization. The authors point out that for closed rules, one only needs to consider a single "freshened" version of each rule when evaluating rule overlaps. This implies that for a finite set of rules, the number of critical pairs is finite, offering an effective criterion for local confluence.

They demonstrate that the closed rewriting relation for a particular theory of explicit substitution (from an example in the paper) is locally confluent because all critical pairs can be joined. However, including the beta rule in the theory disrupts this local confluence, highlighting an exception to their stated theorem.

Finally, the paper outlines criteria that simplify the verification of confluence for nominal rewriting theories, improving upon previous work. It leads to a completion algorithm for closed rewrite rules, with the authors planning to incorporate their results into the PVS library for term rewriting systems.
