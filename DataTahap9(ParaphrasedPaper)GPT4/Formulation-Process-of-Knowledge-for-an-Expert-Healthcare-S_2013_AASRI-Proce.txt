The central processing component of a system receives information related to the human body and environmental conditions, provided by physiological sensors that are connected to it. These sensors are diverse, among which electrodiagnostic tools are utilized to discern and locate issues within the peripheral nervous system.

In this study, a foundational expert healthcare system architecture is presented. This system is designed for adaptability, allowing for the simple integration of new functionalities, like the management or treatment of additional diseases. This is achieved by introducing new functional entities and their objectives into the system, along with corresponding rules and facts, without disrupting the pre-existing goals or features.
