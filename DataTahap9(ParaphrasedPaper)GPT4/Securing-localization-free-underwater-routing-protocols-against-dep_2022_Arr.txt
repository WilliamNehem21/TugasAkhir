This academic paper introduces an energy-efficient and secure routing protocol specifically designed for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), which are often susceptible to sinkhole attacks through depth spoofing. To combat this, the authors present a Depth-Based Probabilistic Routing (DPR) protocol that counters the effects of such attacks by leveraging a random forwarding strategy by suboptimal relay nodes, thus improving resilience. By fine-tuning the forwarding probabilities, the protocol maintains high packet delivery rates even under attack conditions, while also keeping energy usage low. Results show that the DPR protocol achieves significant energy savings and high performance compared to existing protocols, despite the challenges posed by underwater communication environments.
