Microalgae, which are either single-celled or simple multicellular organisms, demonstrate several benefits over traditional crop plants, including more efficient photosynthesis. They show high rates of CO2 fixation and can grow much faster than conventional crops under the right conditions. These organisms are capable of utilizing CO2 from various sources such as the atmosphere, industrial emissions, or carbonates like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). One significant agricultural challenge is soil salinization, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, which reduces crop yields. This salinization, often due to chloride and carbonate salts, can affect not only soil but also surface and groundwater due to high evaporation rates.

This study focused on understanding the effects that different carbon sources, namely Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, have on the green algae Pachycladella chodatii. Researchers looked at variables such as growth, CO2 consumption, enzyme activities like lipoxygenase (LOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and uptake hydrogenase (HUP), as well as intracellular lipid content and fatty acid profiles during batch culture cultivation.

The antioxidant capacity of algae was assessed via the phosphomolybdenum method, using methanol extracts, while the activity of SOD was measured based on modified protocols from Misra and Fridovich. HUP activity was evaluated in a reaction mixture that was free of oxygen and exposed to hydrogen. The study drew on past research indicating that inorganic carbon sources like carbonates could enhance the photosynthetic efficiency and rate of growth in algae, therefore increasing carotenoid and lipid contents.

Moreover, the detailed analysis of fatty acid methyl esters from the algae is crucial for selecting species for biodiesel production, as different species can vary significantly in their fatty acid composition. Most microalgae contain common fatty acids such as palmitic, stearic, and linolenic acids, while some can also accumulate significant amounts of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids.

Specifically, oleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid were found in substantial amounts in Scenedesmus obliquus. The fatty acid composition of algal strains, an important factor for their environmental adaptability, is strongly influenced by growth conditions like nutrient levels, light, and temperature. Consequently, pinning down a standard profile for algae-based biodiesel is challenging, and variations in carbon chain length and saturation degree can affect both the properties and performance of the biodiesel produced.
