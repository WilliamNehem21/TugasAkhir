Between 3.3 and 3.5 billion years ago, the diverse and adaptable cyanobacteria emerged, populating a wide range of habitats including freshwater and marine environments, as well as polluted waters, while also thriving in soils, on rocks, and tree bark. They come in various shapes and sizes, including single-celled, filamentous, and colony-forming variants. Certain species are even thermophilic, prospering in hot springs.

The environmentally beneficial cyanobacteria possess the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and make phosphates more accessible in the environment. They are a prolific source of essential primary metabolites, which include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, pigments, and hydrocarbons. Additionally, they produce a wealth of secondary metabolites with potent biological activities, such as anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive properties.

Marine microalgae have been researched for decades for their production of extracellular antibiotic metabolites and other pharmacologically active compounds. Cyanobacteria also contain antioxidant compounds including ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids.

The process of increasing the production of these compounds can be unpredictable and labor-intensive. In contrast, statistically designed two-level factorial experiments have been demonstrated as efficient for optimizing the culture conditions of microbes. In this study, the goal was to use response surface methodology (RSM) to investigate the impact of various medium compositions on maximizing the production of bioactive compounds by the cyanobacterium Anabaena oryzae.

Flavonoid levels in Anabaena oryzae extract samples were measured using the aluminum chloride colorimetric method. For the assay, a mixture that contained alga extract, sodium nitrite solution, and aluminum chloride was incubated, followed by the addition of sodium hydroxide. The reaction mixture's volume was adjusted with distilled water.

The study found that increasing the magnesium concentration from 8.8 mM to 26.4 mM enhanced the production of antibiotics by Nostoc muscorum. Conversely, raising the iron concentration from the base level of 5 mM to 15 mM significantly reduced antibiotic production, a finding that aligns with earlier research conducted by Ohta and colleagues.
