The research paper examines how heavy metal ions are affected by two adsorbents, algal powder (AP) and activated algal carbon (AAC). Various factors such as contact time, the amount of algae used, pH levels, and the concentration of metal ions were analyzed to determine their impact on adsorption efficiency. The study found the most effective conditions for adsorption to occur were a pH of 5.0, a contact time of 60 minutes, an algal dose of 0.8 g/L, and an initial metal ion concentration of 60 mg/L.

Heavy metals, which originate from sources such as paint, batteries, mining, and agriculture, can cause significant health issues, including kidney and nervous system damage, cognitive disorders, and symptoms like insomnia and dizziness.

In the pH effect experiment, with constant conditions of 10 mg/L metal concentration, 0.1 g algal dosage, and a shaking time of 120 minutes, the influence of pH values ranging from 2 to 8 was evaluated.

To study the impact of biomass weight on sorption, samples with varying biomass weights (0.2 to 1.0 g/L) were agitated with a metal solution of 10 mg/L at pH 5 for 120 minutes.

A fixed amount of AP and AAC (0.4 g) was added to a 10 mg/L heavy metal solution, and then shaken for various durations (5 to 120 minutes). After each interval, solutions were filtered and analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.

Analysis through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption showed that KOH-activated carbon had greater porosity compared to its precursor powder. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) revealed less thermal stability in Ulva lactuca (a type of algae) compared to KOH-activated carbon. The presence of functional chemical groups on both adsorbents was confirmed by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).

The study concluded that KOH-activated carbon derived from U. lactuca was more effective than algal powder in removing heavy metals, and therefore can be considered a potent technology for cleansing environments contaminated with metal ions.
