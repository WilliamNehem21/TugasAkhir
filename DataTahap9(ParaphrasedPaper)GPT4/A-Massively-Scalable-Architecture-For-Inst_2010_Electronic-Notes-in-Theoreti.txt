This paper examines the scalability of Instant Messaging & Presence (IM&P) architectures through a queueing-based model to determine and address bottlenecks within the current IM&P system at Hyves, a Dutch social network. The study investigates three alternative architectures: evolutionary partitioning, aggregated and batched presence updates, and presence subscriptions to overcome the limitations. The Hierarchical Evaluation Tool (HIT) is utilized for analytical modeling and analysis of these architectures.

Given the expectation that the existing IM&P infrastructure at Hyves may not cope with a significant increase in user activity, the paper aims to identify a scalable solution. Scalability is defined as the ability of an architecture to maintain performance levels proportional to the addition of hardware resources when dealing with increasing workloads.

The paper comprehensively details the methodology, reviews the current IM&P architecture and its limitations, describes alternative architectural solutions, and presents the results of the modeling and analysis. Recommendations are provided based on the findings, with the subscription-based architecture highlighted as the most scalable and robust option for IM&P services, as it demonstrates a linear relationship between workload and resource utilization.

The study also notes room for improvement in modeling techniques for scalable architectures and suggests that enhancements in HIT might simplify the analysis process. It proposes more focus on component interrelations and mentions limitations posed by the inability to model cycles in the component hierarchy. The conclusion is that while the current IM&P system at Hyves is adequate, it requires evolution to sustain future demands.
