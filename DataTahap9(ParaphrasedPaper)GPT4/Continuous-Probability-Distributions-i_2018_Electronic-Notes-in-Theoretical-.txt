Here's a paraphrased version of the academic paper:

The paper introduces a model for concurrent games in which strategies can be probabilistic, encompassing both discrete and continuous probability distributions. This is an enhancement of the probabilistic concurrent strategies concept by Winskel, who utilized event structures in his work. The authors start by establishing the concept of measurable event structures by forging discrete fibrations of event structures into measurable spaces.

Subsequently, they create a bicategory composed of measurable games and strategies founded on measurable event structures. They then incorporate probabilistic elements into these measurable strategies using established measure theory methods. To exemplify the model's utility, the paper offers semantic interpretations for an affine, higher-order, probabilistic language that features real number types and continuous probability distributions.

The study also explores the application of game semantics to probabilistic computation. Building on a probabilistic adaptation by Danos and Harmer of the Hyland-Ong game model originally developed for deterministic programs, this approach is particularly effective for probabilistic programs with state attributes. The model achieves full abstraction for the language of Probabilistic Algol, which is an expansion of PCF that includes basic type references and stochastic components.

The paper sets aside discussions of probability until Section 4, dedicating the initial sections to establishing a measurable framework for game semantics. The authors define measurable strategies, explain the composition of these strategies, and detail the organization of the bicategory.

The authors note an operation on maps of event structure presheaves (ESPs), which is extendible to maps of fibred and measurable ESPs. This operation is shown to be functorial and turns the category (Mes, _, 1) into a symmetric monoidal category, where 1 represents the empty measurable event structure. They plan to employ this functorial action in later discussions within the paper.

Standard Borel and race-free ESPs, which remain invariant under the paper's constructions, form a sub-bicategory of the measurable games (MG). The authors choose to work exclusively within this subset, which offers certain beneficial properties, such as the measurability of singletons in Borel spaces. They start by defining valuations on discrete ESPs.

Lastly, the authors compare the likelihood of a closed term converging to the probability of its semantic interpretation. They define this probability within the context of their new framework for game semantics.
