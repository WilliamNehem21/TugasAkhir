The understanding of how individuals react to the attitudes of others remains somewhat elusive. Nonetheless, Timothy Leary's influential theory suggests there are eight fundamental interpersonal stances that humans adopt, which are important for improving social and workplace interactions.

This academic paper reviews efforts to measure these stances through nonverbal cues like body posture, gestures, and facial expressions, considering their application in a police interrogation training game. It was observed that professional actors can better embody these stances compared to non-actors, but generally portraying a stance convincingly is challenging and observers often have differing opinions on what is being depicted. The study of such stances also extends to linguistics, where researchers have analyzed them within the context of written and spoken communication.

Ranganath et al. developed a system to detect interpersonal stances in spoken language using four categories: flirtatious, friendly, awkward, and assertive, considering prosodic, lexical, and dialogue features. The research included an analysis of gender differences and a comparison of lexical versus prosodic cues.

Other work has aimed to create systems that assist individuals in enhancing their skills in conveying interpersonal stances. One such system is a simulator-training game that leverages text inputs to teach these stances; however, the system's low accuracy hampers its effectiveness as a training tool.

The simulator-training game mentioned comprises two segments: an interface for recording voice samples with guidance on sentence articulation, and a backend server process that uses an SVM algorithm to generate unique voice models from these samples, with further details found in references [4,5].

The study involved 20 English speakers with an average age of 28. The group was 75% male and 25% female, recruited from a university setting and the crowdsourcing platform Prolific. The experience with the software varied among subjects, with a small portion having used it before the experiment.

The game's objective is to guide a computer status indicator within a specific target area by correctly employing interpersonal stances within a given number of tries. The system records the user's voice, which is then analyzed on the server using the individual's voice model to classify the stance.

Reflecting on prior studies, it's recognized that building reliable models to classify the eight interpersonal stances using current datasets is difficult, just as it is to teach individuals these stances with such models.

Future research should further explore these stances, aiming to understand how people interpret them. An expansion of the experiment to include more participants could validate observed trends and examine the relationships between different stances. It's also essential to determine how well people can actually recognize and utilize these stances in real-life interactions and whether they perceive them as distinct categories or as part of larger clusters.
