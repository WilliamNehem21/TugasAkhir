The paper's structure is laid out as follows: Section 2 reviews existing literature, Section 3 introduces a tiered framework of security issues in cloud computing, Section 4 discusses the dynamic security contract model, and Section 5 provides the paper's conclusion.

The paper examines the security of Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), identifying critical vulnerabilities in publicly available Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and proposing a tool called Amazonia, which uses public interfaces to exploit these weaknesses. Successful attacks have led to the extraction of sensitive data such as passwords and credentials, enabling further intrusions, botnet initiation, and unauthorized access to AMI-hosted web services.

Security-as-a-Service for cloud-based applications is explored, presenting a user-centric approach that allows users to select and employ various security solutions from different cloud providers, promoting flexibility and tailored protection according to service criticality.

The paper underscores the importance of data privacy in cloud computing, referring to the challenges of integrity, authorized access, and availability. Solutions such as Cisco's Secure Data Center Framework offer multilayered protection to safeguard data.

Two attack methods against cloud interfaces are identified: signature wrapping and advanced XSS attacks, both of which can compromise customer accounts and lead to unauthorized access at a root level without directly assaulting the cloud infrastructure.

The intersection of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) is discussed, categorizing attacks into three types: those targeting cloud services, virtualization, and utility computing. These attacks can lead to the theft of information, deployment of malware-infested VMs, or unauthorized resource utilization, all of which are of significant concern.

At the second tier, PaaS and IaaS services encompass hardware and software virtualization, utility computing, and development services â€“ all susceptible to varied cyber-attacks, some of which may even threaten physical machines. These layers can be compromised by techniques like ARP spoofing or the deployment of malicious code, posing medium to high-risk levels.

Secure Shell (SSH) is identified as a specific target for extracting API keys and credentials. While attacks aimed at breaking encryption are considered medium risk, those targeting publisher credentials are noted as high risk. The paper highlights that hardware virtualization faces threats like ARP and MAC spoofing, with associated risks varying from medium to high, and utility computing being particularly vulnerable to various high-risk attacks.

An example highlights the security services required for web portal services and hardware virtualization, asserting that the level of risk increases from web services to hardware virtualization, necessitating a shift in security services to focus more on multi-tenancy and data privacy.
