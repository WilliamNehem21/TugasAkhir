Rule abstractions transcend pattern abstractions by binding any expression rather than just patterns. Utilized within the rewriting calculus, these abstractions are critical for representing rewrite rules and strategic rewriting comprehensively. For instance, they enable the expression of innermost rewriting strategies in term rewriting systems. Rule abstractions also relate to an advanced form of natural deduction in which proof trees are manipulated rather than just making assumptions. Despite their solid integration into both the logic and programming language realms, their foundational principles remain underdeveloped.

Let's consider an example with `p ara=(par(x) d s d s.x,a d s d 3,...)`. Here, the `par(x)` function searches for a method corresponding to the variable `x`, and then transfers (or installs) this method to the object, effectively treating the method as a first-class entity.

We propose an operational semantics defined by a natural proof deduction system following the style of Gordon Plotkin. This semantics aims to transform every closed expression into its normal form, characterized as an irreducible term that's also in weak head normal form. The strategy we detail follows a lazy call-by-name approach, meaning it does not evaluate under certain constructs.

To expand on the evaluation strategy: we first assess `t1` (the term under protection). If `t1` computes to a value unaffected by match failures (that is, it produces a valid output value), then this resulting value is the output of the entire `try catch with` expression. This process is akin to the execution of `t1` where no exceptions are thrown.
