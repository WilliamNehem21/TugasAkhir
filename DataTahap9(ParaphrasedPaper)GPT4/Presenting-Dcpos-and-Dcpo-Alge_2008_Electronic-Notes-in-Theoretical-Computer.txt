The academic paper discusses how the set of c-ideals has two useful applications owing to its isomorphic properties. Firstly, it considers frames that are constructed using a set of generators and relationships, much like the Lindenbaum algebra for propositional geometric theories. This setup allows for the transformation of the frame's presentation into a site form, subsequently guiding the definition of sup-lattice homomorphisms emanating from the frameâ€”a technique found particularly beneficial in studies involving quantales and their related modules, which, while being sup-lattices, do not typically constitute frames.

Secondly, the paper indicates a method for expanding the coverage theorem's application beyond frames to accommodate other structures such as quantales and their modules. This generalization broadens the theorem's usefulness in presenting these algebraic structures.

The discussions further mention the interaction between forgetful functors and free algebra functors, highlighting that each functor arrow in their diagram signifies a forgetful functor with a corresponding left adjoint. They also point out that while there are existing coverage theorems for certain finitary theories (between which some functor arrows are indicated), their primary contribution (Theorem 4.4) pertains to directed complete partial orders (dcpos) and extends coverage theorems to the category represented in the central square of their conceptual diagram.
