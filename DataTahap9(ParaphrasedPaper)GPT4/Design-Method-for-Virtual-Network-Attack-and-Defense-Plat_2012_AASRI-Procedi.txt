The paper presents a method for creating a simulation platform aimed at examining network attacks and defenses. It begins by dissecting the platform's structure and capabilities. To shape the platform's virtual topology, the researchers harnessed Visio's secondary development capabilities, which allowed for the modification and extension of Visio's functions. This method simplifies the graphical development aspects of constructing virtual networks and enables the programming of device behaviors.

Using Microsoft Office Visio 2003's ActiveX control, which offers the full suite of Visio's functionality, they embedded Visio into the host application, allowing it to be controlled by code or event-driven interactions. Within the user interface, Visio's drawing control enhances the experience by providing a charting environment.

The process of crafting the mold entails plotting the drawing cell symbols in the space provided, and then setting their properties via the shape sheet spreadsheet. Afterward, the new mold is created and saved under a distinct name.

Managing the drawing cell programmatically involves both retrieving data from and writing information to the cell, adjusting its state as needed. To extract details from the cell, the `Shape.GetCells()` method is utilized, selecting the required values from the shape sheet based on the relevant parameters.

The examination of the virtual network's topology generation reveals the benefits of the Visio secondary development method. Following the development discussion, the paper illustrates the platform's capabilities through scenarios simulating network attacks and defenses, confirming the platform's functionality and the attainment of design objectives. Simulation outcomes validate the efficacy of the proposed platform and design method.
