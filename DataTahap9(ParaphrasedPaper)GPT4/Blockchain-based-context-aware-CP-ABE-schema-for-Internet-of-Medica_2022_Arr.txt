The increasing prevalence of COVID-19 cases has highlighted challenges in managing patient data within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) due to the strain on internet-based systems needed for monitoring and rapid detection of cases. This has raised security and privacy concerns, given the risk of tampered control messages. The paper discusses addressing these issues using blockchain and smart contract technologies in conjunction with a context-aware Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) security framework. The new framework incorporates context-aware policies to enhance authentication and maintain confidentiality.

As the demand for healthcare data access grows, the storage and transmission of this data, facilitated by cloud technology, become critical. However, the associated security risks, such as potential confidentiality breaches and privacy violations, must be addressed. An example solution in the paper is the mutual authentication technique proposed by Jegadeesan et al., which reduces the storage and computational burdens on mobile devices by exchanging session keys after successful authentication without relying on environmental attributes.

The paper recognizes blockchain's revolutionary impacts across various sectors, including healthcare. Blockchain's inherent benefits include security, privacy, cost savings, and enhanced efficiency without the need for centralized third-party control. Yet, blockchain is not immune to security risks, especially when integrated into smart city infrastructures combined with artificial intelligence.

The application of neural networks, deep learning, and homomorphic encryption methods to blockchain technology is also explored to secure access control in digital healthcare systems. With a focus on ABE methods, the paper describes how they can provide flexible and scalable encryption suited for large-scale, attribute-based access control, mitigating the role explosion problem.

Additionally, the paper emphasizes the need for robust and cost-effective encryption-decryption mechanisms for IoMT, given that existing algorithms may be insufficient against modern attacks. A context-aware CP-ABE based approach is proposed for secure IoMT usage within healthcare systems.

The paper also discusses a specific use case involving patient data access delegation to a specialist from another hospital, demonstrating the dynamic policy update capabilities of the proposed schema. Context-aware CP-ABE ensures that only the authorized physicians within the relevant domain can decrypt and access the Patient Health Records (PHR).

Finally, the AVISPA simulator is used to verify the security of the proposed schema. The simulator confirms the robustness of the approach, concluding with tests on a real dataset to evaluate stability and execution time, demonstrating the schema's effectiveness and scalability potential.
