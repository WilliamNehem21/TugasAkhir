The swift uptake of cloud computing technologies has led to increased challenges in infrastructure maintenance for cloud service providers, primarily due to soaring operational expenses that include hefty energy costs. Data centers, for instance, can use about 100 times the energy of comparably-sized conventional offices. By optimizing server power management, data centers can realize significant energy savings as lower power usage translates to reduced heat output. This, in turn, decreases the energy required for cooling systems.

Recent studies have progressed towards detailed energy consumption measurements, such as assessing the energy use for individual virtual machines (VMs) within a physical server. Research introduced a power model for VMs that utilizes performance event counters to estimate energy use, achieving an impressive 97% accuracy on average.

The proposed system architecture includes a Resource Monitoring Unit (RMU) that dynamically tracks energy consumption of hardware components and the number of VMs allocated. An Energy Profiling Unit (EPU) is then responsible for computing the energy consumption of each VM and hardware component. This data is processed and translated into Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and stored in a database. The Reporting and Analysis Unit utilizes this data to furnish developers with energy-aware reports to inform more energy-efficient programming without sacrificing performance, allowing choices between relying on components that consume less energy like CPU or memory.

Hardware used in the study included commodity servers by Dellâ€”a cluster where each server was outfitted with an Intel Xeon X3430 CPU, 8GB of RAM, a Western Digital 250GB HDD, and a Broadcom gigabit Ethernet card for network connectivity. The servers accessed a 2TB storage shared through NFS for VM images, backed by a RAID 0 array.

The Energy Profiling Unit highlights different functionalities, reporting energy usage at both host and VM levels. Data is provided as a historical log, current usage, and future predictions. These predictions are made using linear regression based on CPU utilization versus power consumption data gathered during a training phase, with automatic calibration for precision.

Experiments indicated a clear linear relationship between the number of VMs on a host and the host's total power usage; as more VMs are added, and thus more physical resources like CPU, disk, and memory are leveraged, power consumption increases proportionately.

Results from a subsequent experiment (Experiment 3) mirrored those from an earlier one (Experiment 2), demonstrating the linear growth in power consumption with the addition of VMs to each of the three concurrently running physical hosts. This setup illustrated that an application can effectively distribute its tasks across multiple VMs that are hosted on different physical machines.
