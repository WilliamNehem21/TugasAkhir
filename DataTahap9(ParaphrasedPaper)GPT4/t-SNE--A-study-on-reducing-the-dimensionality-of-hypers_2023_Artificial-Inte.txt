Recent advancements in the wine industry have prioritized the integration of cutting-edge technologies to enhance production processes, aiming to harvest grapes for winemaking in a eco-friendly manner without sacrificing grape quality. Traditional methods, which involve laboratory tests to evaluate specific winemaking parameters, are not only destructive to the grapes but also time-consuming and expensive. To address these issues, hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a valuable non-destructive technique that provides detailed information about grape characteristics.

The paper offers a thorough examination of their hyperspectral imaging experiments, including the specifics of the experimental setup, the process for conducting reflectance measurements, and the construction of training datasets. It also touches on dimensionality reduction methods used in the research, introduces support vector regression (SVR) as the regression algorithm, and discusses strategies to prevent overfitting and optimize generalizability with cross-validation. Details about the grape sampling process and descriptions of the datasets are outlined to illustrate the data's inherent variability.

The study assesses the effectiveness of t-SNE and kernel t-SNE in reducing the dimensionality of hyperspectral images data from wine grape berries, combining these methods with a machine learning regressor (SVR) to predict sugar content and pH levels. The study addresses the challenge of high sample variability across different wine grape vintages and varieties. The findings reveal that t-SNE not only performs well in dimensionality reduction tasks, where it typically serves only for visualization, but also outperforms PCA in nearly all case studiesâ€”an unusual feat as many new reduction techniques show promise with artificial datasets but underperform with real-world data in comparison to PCA. Furthermore, kernel t-SNE demonstrates solid performance, suggesting potential use in dimensionality reduction for streaming or online data scenarios.
