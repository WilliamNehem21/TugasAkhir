This academic paper discusses the development of an expert system for reasoning in power grid management, particularly focusing on the challenges of knowledge sharing within the system's knowledge base. The authors propose using ontology technology to abstract and analyze the process of power grid security investigations, leading to the creation of an ontology-based knowledge base. By doing so, they aim to establish meaningful associations between the vocabulary relevant to these procedures.

The paper describes the use of semantic reasoning tools, particularly Apache Jena, a framework that provides an environment for RDF, OWL, and other rule-based inferences. The authors outline how Jena's reasoning mechanisms and inference grammar rules can be applied. They stress that while Jena is comprehensive for many OWL inferences, it does not fully support all OWL-DL reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, Jena can store and even persist knowledge bases, allowing for direct interaction with relational databases. With the release of Jena 2.2, there is added support for DIG interface reasoners, enhancing the flexibility of the system according to specific needs.

For class and individual reasoning within a knowledge base, the authors explain the capacity of the system to determine if an individual is an instance of a particular class, to identify all instances of a class within the knowledge base, to associate a specific individual with a class, and to judge relationships between two individuals or a particular instance.

The inference engine of Jena operates at the graph SPI level, allowing for the construction of models around an inference graph. The ontology component of Jena aids in integrating reasoners into the ontological models being built. They also mention the InfModel, which extends the typical model interface, providing more control over and access to the inference graph.

Jena, an open-source project developed by HP Labs, is highlighted as a powerful semantic reasoning and retrieval tool. Using Jena enhances the understanding of ontology knowledge and boosts retrieval efficiency.

In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the role of Jena as a critical support tool in the research process of semantic reasoning and ontology, especially in the context of power grid security investigations.
