Simulation techniques are widely utilized in academia and industry for various purposes, such as assessing system performance, analyzing workflow, enhancing processes, and managing assets and personnel. Simulation tools are available to assist organizations in identifying inefficiencies and understanding the impact of resource allocation on system performance. These tools enable decision-makers to quickly test various scenarios and compare outcomes at much lower costs than physically implementing the changes.

LoctrackJinqs, building upon Jinqs, shares its structure, with two main Java packages: 'network' and 'tools'. The 'network' package defines queueing network structures, while 'tools' offers utilities for setting up simulations, incorporating probability distribution families, and computing performance indicators. Both packages are designed for easy extension, allowing developers to add specialized features by subclassing and modifying existing classes.

LoctrackJinqs differentiates itself by offering location-aware simulation capabilities. Unlike Jinqs, which only facilitates abstract simulations with instant entity transfers, LoctrackJinqs assigns physical locations to entities within a 2D Cartesian coordinate system, enabling more accurate simulations by having entities move along defined paths at variable speeds.

The 'TransportCustomersEvent' class within LoctrackJinqs is responsible for simulating the movement of customers, who are represented as entities. This event calls the 'moveCustomers()' method for each 'TransportLink' entity and by scheduling the event to occur frequently, it simulates customer movement at a high level of detail.

In the visual component of the simulation, different colors are used to represent various types of entities and their states: pilots and flight attendants, as well as EU and non-EU passengers, are signified by distinct colors, with red, orange, and pink indicating queuing entities, and three shades of green representing the servicing of customers from each class.
