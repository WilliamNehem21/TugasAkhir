This article introduces a modification to a key component of a previously established decision-making process. The text is comprehensive and can be understood without prior knowledge of former works, given that it provides necessary definitions, foundational theorems, the new decision procedure, and experiment results, alongside comparisons with other methods.

Chordal graphs are discussed due to their relevance in only requiring transitivity enforcement on chord-free cyclesâ€”typically triangles in such graphs. As with earlier research, this paper uses this principle differently, though for a similar aim: it confines the algorithm's focus to triangles. Even though a graph may have exponentially many contradictory cycles, it only has polynomially many triangles, and enforcing transitivity on these triangles suffices to address all contradictory cycles.

Building on Theorem 3.4, the article outlines an algorithm capable of constraining all simple contradictory cycles, elaborating on a modified version of an earlier RTC algorithm to produce RTCS. This streamlined version only targets simple contradictory cycles and is more straightforward in both conception and implementation.

The paper's focus narrows to biconnected components (BCC), as these encapsulate all contradictory cycles that require constraint. During the process, RTCS makes the BCC chordal by adding edges, thereby simplifying the required constraints.

A lemma within the paper (4.5) suggests that within a specific kind of triangle in a graph, if there's a simple contradictory cycle involving two vertices and an intermediary, it implies there's also a simpler contradictory cycle that bypasses the intermediary vertex.

Finally, empirical results show a significant reduction in both the number of transitivity constraints (17%) and the algorithm's runtime (32%), not accounting for SAT solver time. In contrast to the sparse method, which indiscriminately imposes three constraints for each triangle in the graph, the RTCS generated far fewer constraints on average, leading to more efficient performance on test graphs.
