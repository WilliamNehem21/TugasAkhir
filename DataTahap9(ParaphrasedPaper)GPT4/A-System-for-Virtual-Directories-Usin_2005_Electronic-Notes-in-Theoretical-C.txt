This paper discusses the utilization of Euler diagrams for visualizing virtual directories, which are collections of files generated on-the-fly based upon certain constraints. The authors present their ongoing work on the VennFS project and its enhancement to incorporate this visualization capability. A pivotal aspect of this work is the introduction of a novel data structure, the EulerTree, that extends the principles of an R-Tree, a spatial data structure that efficiently processes range queries in two-dimensional space.

The authors highlight several systems that leverage user-defined attributes or complex structures to organize information. For example, Presto allows the creation of virtual directories on demand through user queries, and WinFS employs a direct acyclic graph and a relational database to enable advanced search functionalities for file systems. Ximian Evolution is also referenced for its use of virtual folders (Vfolders) that automatically update based on search criteria.

The application introduced in the paper provides a user-friendly tool to assist with daily tasks by tapping into the intuitive nature of Euler diagrams. These diagrams allow users to visually and easily create classifications without much instruction.

They elaborate on the R-Tree's function in answering range queries within a two-dimensional space. A specific type of data structure, the doubly-connected edge list, is described as capable of representing planar subdivisions, essential for handling rectangles and their subdivisions within these diagrams.

Additionally, the authors describe an insertion algorithm that ensures the disjointness of subrectangles. This algorithm operates in two phases: first, computing the overlay of two subdivisions and then refining the overlay to ensure all resulting spaces are rectangles using a sweepline algorithm.

Finally, the paper expresses aspirations to extend the application of Euler diagrams beyond virtual directories to other domains, such as email and bookmark management, citing the potential for automatic categorization based on existing methods for comparing such items.

The cited reference at the end provides context for further research on cognitive maps in virtual environments that explores how innate spatial abilities can enhance learningâ€”a concept possibly related to the intuitive nature of the Euler diagram-based tools described in the paper.
