The paper discusses the weaknesses of traditional particle filter algorithms when handling the problem of tracking multiple objects (multi-modality) and the issue of particle degeneration. Standard particle filters struggle with maintaining distinct peaks in probability distributions when multiple targets are present.

To address these issues, the paper suggests utilizing a Mixture Particle Filter (MPF) that models the target distribution as a non-parametric mixture model. In particular, it proposes a new algorithm called GM-MPF, which combines the advantages of the Gaussian Particle Filter (GPF) with the MPF for improved performance. The GPF is preferred due to its lower computational complexity, as it generates particles from a Gaussian distribution rather than performing resampling, thereby speeding up the computation.

The proposed algorithm aims to improve real-time capability and maintain the ability to handle multi-modal distributions without degrading particle quality. The GM-MPF is designed based on the principle of segmenting particles among multiple targets and using Gaussian approximations to represent each segment's posterior distribution, thus enabling more accurate multi-target tracking.

Experimental results detailed in the paper indicate that the GM-MPF algorithm performs better in multi-target tracking scenarios by effectively addressing the issues of multi-modality and particle degeneration while also providing faster computation times compared to traditional methods. The comparison of processing times and estimation accuracy for PF, GPF, MPF, and GM-MPF showcases the enhanced real-time performance and estimation accuracy of the proposed GM-MPF during multi-target tracking tasks.
