In electric railway systems, the pantograph-catenary setup enables electric locomotives to draw power through a carbon strip that rubs against a copper contact wire. The durability of the carbon strip and copper wire is greatly impacted by the wear resistance of these contacting materials. To examine this wear resistance, experiments have been conducted using a friction and wear testing apparatus with an electrical current. This research delves into the tribological (friction and wear) properties of the carbon strip in contact with the copper wire, with variables such as sliding speed and current altering the results. The paper presents an analysis of these materials' surfaces through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and suggests a mechanism for the wear that occurs during the electrical sliding contact process.

The experimental setup, previously detailed in other studies, involved applying normal forces of either 80 or 160 newtons (N) and varying electric currents of 0 to 70 amperes (A), all while maintaining a constant sliding speed equivalent to 50 km/h over a one-hour test duration.

Key findings include a lower coefficient of friction when electric current is present compared to when it's absent, with both friction and electric current showing parallel trends over time. The wear rate of the carbon strip escalates with an increase in electric current. The paper identifies thermal wear, arc erosion, and abrasive wear as the primary wear mechanisms present during the electrical sliding contact, which also results in a transfer of materials.
