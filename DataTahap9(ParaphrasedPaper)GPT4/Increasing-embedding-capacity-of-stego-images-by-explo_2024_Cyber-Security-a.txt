This academic paper focuses on the field of steganography, which is a technique for concealing secret information within a carrier medium, such as an image or audio file. The paper evaluates steganography performance based on its ability to increase data hiding capacity, minimize distortion in the carrier medium, and withstand various forms of attacks, which is analyzed using steganalysis techniques.

The authors describe an approach to enhance the embedding capacity of secret data by using morphological operators to increase the number of edge pixels within an image. They also discuss the application of hybrid edge detectors and, in 2018, Kusuuma et al.'s use of encryption to further secure the hidden data. Khan et al. mentioned that existing edge detection-based embedding methods typically suffer from limited embedding capacity.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes a steganography scheme that combines the outputs of multiple edge detectors to identify more potential locations for data embedding, thereby increasing the number of concealable bits within both edge and non-edge areas of an image. This not only boosts the amount of data that can be hidden but also preserves the visual quality of the stego images and enhances resistance to statistical attacks.

The structure of the manuscript consists of literature review in Section 2, details of the proposed method in Section 3, and experimental results presented in Section 4, with Section 4.6 specifically focusing on the robustness of the proposed method against attacks. Section 5 discusses the implications and limitations of the research, while Section 6 concludes the paper.

Two separate programs were developed for data embedding and retrieval, following different proposed methods from Bai et al., Setiadi D.R.I.M., Sultana et al., and Rasol et al. The model's drawbacks include its reliance on edge detectors and the time consumption when using a predictor. The authors note that if the steganography method raises suspicion about the carrier medium, the model is considered to have failed.
