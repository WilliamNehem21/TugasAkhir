This paper introduces a comprehensive methodology for simulating and visualizing distributed algorithms using graph relabeling systems. Graph relabeling systems serve as a means for encoding the local rules that guide the behavior of distributed algorithms. The authors have developed a Java-based prototype tool that aids in the implementation and visualization of such algorithms. Through this tool, the execution of distributed algorithms—encompassing algorithms for tasks like leader election and spanning tree construction—can be displayed in an automated fashion by applying local relabeling rules across the network.

Graphs, representing the network of processors with vertices as processors and edges as communication links between them, are the backbone of this framework. These graphs are finite, undirected, simple, and connected, and are labeled with a potentially infinite set of labels. Local relabeling applies to subgraphs to modify vertex and edge labels according to specified rules. This modification takes place within a limited scope or radius around each vertex.

Moreover, the paper discusses models for the implementation of distributed systems, including "rendezvous" and "star synchronization" mechanisms for managing process interactions and local computations. These mechanisms use randomization to achieve synchronization among processors before executing the next set of local computations.

Visualization includes showing the process of the algorithm's execution, such as message exchanges and status updates of the network components. Importantly, the authors provide a detailed explanation of two types of local computations, LC1 and LC2, both of which involve randomized procedures.

The developed Java tool simulates processors using threads, offering a library of high-level primitives to define local computations. Example implementations, such as a spanning tree algorithm, are discussed to show how the tool operates.

The paper's structure encompasses sections that dive into the specifics of graph relabeling systems, the methodology for simulating and visualizing distributed algorithms encoded by these systems, and the conclusion with future work considerations. The authors emphasize the significance of their work in advancing the understanding of distributed algorithms through a robust and automated visualization approach powered by graph relabeling systems.
