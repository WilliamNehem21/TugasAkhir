Community is a structured method for designing software architectures, characterized by its precise mathematical underpinnings rooted in category theory. This framework provides an insightful, intuitive way to model how architectural components interact and are refined in relation to each other, moving beyond simple schematic representations to more formalized, category theory-based diagrams.

The methodology embraces a distinct separation of concerns, partitioning computation, coordination, and distribution, the latter of which includes considerations for system mobility. As for describing component behavior, Community utilizes a simple state-based language, drawing inspiration from UNITY and interacting processes.

One of the standout features of Community is its emphasis on compositionalityâ€”treating system interconnections as a primary focal point that allows for an understanding of how the overarching properties of a system emerge.

The tool support accompanying Community is demonstrated through the modeling of practical systems like the GSM handover protocol, a complex real-world application that necessitates a deep understanding of distribution and mobility. The paper introduces this protocol and outlines the modified Community framework that can accommodate location-aware systems without presupposing any particular conception of space.

According to this revised framework, local channels are tagged to specific locations, indicating where their values are accessible. Modifications to the value of a location variable symbolize the movement of the associated channels and actions.

When actions are synchronized, they are represented by a compound action that carries out their transformations across the actions' respective locations. The notion of "loc types" and spatial relations like "touch" and "reach" are also introduced, offering further tools for specifying the topology of systems.

The paper also discusses the Community workbench and the associated architecture description language, illustrating how the GSM handover protocol can be encapsulated within this framework.

Looking forward, the authors of the paper are working on a distributed execution model, mapping the location types onto physical hosts to enable real-world mobility within the architecture. This model will be implemented based on the Klava library, a Java library for mobile agent systems that provides constructs for defining hosts and managing communication across them.

In conclusion, the paper showcases Community's capabilities, particularly its formalism and the explicit management of architectural concerns, by applying the framework to the GSM handover protocol and outlining the development of distributed execution infrastructure.
