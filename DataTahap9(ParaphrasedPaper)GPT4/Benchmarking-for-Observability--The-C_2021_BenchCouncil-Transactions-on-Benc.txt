In the paper, the authors carry out an empirical study of 277 user-reported storage failures to understand real-world issues and examine the capabilities of advanced debugging tools. They categorize the failures based on various factors, including the time needed to resolve them and the kernel components affected, offering a quantitative perspective on the challenges faced in practice.

Additionally, the authors conduct a thorough analysis of storage issues, focusing on the observability provided by debugging tools—the capacity to observe and comprehend the internal states and behaviors of systems—and propose metrics to assess observability both qualitatively and quantitatively. They highlight the importance of observability for system reliability, which includes properties like visibility, repeatability, and expressibility.

The study reveals that existing tools, such as ftrace and PANDA (Platform for Architecture-Neutral Dynamic Analysis), sometimes struggle to diagnose complex cases and usually lack the ability to provide detailed information about changes in persistent storage states. Observing low-level interactions, such as device commands, between the storage software and the hardware is identified as essential for understanding failures.

To overcome these limitations, the authors extend ftrace and PANDA to improve their ability to observe low-level details without requiring specialized hardware. These extensions enable the capture of detailed command-level information, similar to what hardware bus analyzers provide.

The paper acknowledges potential threats to its validity, including the possibility of an incomplete dataset due to the reliance on specific keywords and manual selection processes and the fact that not all Linux users report issues, meaning some failures may not be captured in the study.

One key observation from the study is that the majority of storage failures were caused by software rather than hardware, emphasizing the importance of monitoring the storage software stack for failure diagnosis.

The authors suggest that while their work aims to measure observability, it is only a first step in improving system reliability. They encourage further research into other important properties like those found in modern cloud-native environments, which include microservices and integrated monitoring, tracing, and logging. 

Finally, the authors express gratitude to their reviewers, researchers from Western Digital, and various individuals who contributed to the study.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the novelty of their effort in measuring debugging tool observability and expresses hope that their initial work will spark further research to enhance system robustness.
