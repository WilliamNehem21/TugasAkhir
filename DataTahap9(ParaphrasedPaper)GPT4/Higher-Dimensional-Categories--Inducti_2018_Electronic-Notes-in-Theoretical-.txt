Bicategories have long been utilized to represent computational concepts like parallelism and variable scope. The collection of bicategories, known as "bicat," forms a tricategory, a more complex structure that has appeared sporadically, both explicitly and implicitly, in works on programming semantics. However, the question remains: what is a weak n-category in a broader context? Strict n-categories, which can be used arbitrarily, have found application in modeling concurrency and are related to rewriting concepts. It is anticipated that weak n-categories will eventually become similarly significant in the domain of programming semantics. This paper seeks to delve into, expand upon, and slightly modify a significant definition initiated by Batanin and further developed by Leinster, along with its associated theory. Their work presumed advanced mathematical knowledge, overlooked the inherent recursive nature of the subject, and did not address programming semantics considerations.

This work discusses the forgetful functor that maps from the category of strict n-dimensional V-categories to that of n-dimensional V-graphs, and confirms that there exists a left adjoint to this functor. It assumes throughout that V is an extensive category with finite limits. As a result, the categories V-Gph and V-Cat (derived from V), as well as their nth dimensional equivalents V-Gph(n) and V-Cat(n), inherit extensiveness and the property of having finite limits.

In Example 5.4, the focus is on a specific case where C equals n-Gph, which is the same as Set-Gph(n), and T equals T(n), the monad that generates free strict n-categories. Here, T(n)-operads are referred to as n-globular operads, which have an n-graph of arities known as T(n)1. The elements of this graph form what are known as globular pasting schemes.

Example 5.5 elaborates on the situation where C equals U-Gph(n) for an extensively categorical U with finite limits and where T equals T(n), the monad for creating free strict n-dimensional U-categories. These T(n) operads are an enriched form of n-globular operads, quite similar in nature, with the primary distinction being the treatment of n-cells; instead of being considered individually, n-cells now constitute an object within U.

The paper also introduces the concept of contraction as coined by Leinster and extends it to an enriched setting. Following Garner's approach, contraction is defined as the selection of specific types of diagonal fillings. This definition aligns with a construction method detailed in a previous work by Garner.
