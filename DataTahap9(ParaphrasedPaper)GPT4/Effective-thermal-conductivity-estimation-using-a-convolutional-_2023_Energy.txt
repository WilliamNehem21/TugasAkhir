In this study, researchers developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for predicting the effective thermal conductivity of heterogeneous materials, which are crucial in energy research due to their mechanical and transport properties. The CNN model demonstrates a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) ranging from 0.67% to 11.8% across varying scenarios, successfully approximating the effective thermal conductivity and enabling structures to closely reach theoretical optimal performance.

Commonly, effective thermal conductivity is predicted using analytical or empirical models, but they are limited by assumptions of simplified geometries. Experiments and simulations provide alternatives but are costly and time-consuming. This research adopts advancements in CNNs, focusing on the architecture's accuracy and prediction speed, and the model is validated with analytical results and data outside the training dataset to ensure generalization.

The dataset consists of over 130,000 images with varying thermal conductivities simulated by a parallelized Central-Differencing-based Numerical Heat Transfer (NHT) model using the Bridges2 supercomputer resource. The CNN models are trained and tested using the GPU partition of the Expanse supercomputer.

The study also explores the CNN model's application to topology optimization, a process of iteratively modifying structures to optimize specific properties. The CNN model significantly reduces computational time, which is typically a limiting factor in topology optimization due to the repetitive need to reassess optimized properties after each structural update.

The researchers adopted an architecture from the VGG family of CNNs, finding that while more convolutional layers can help extract relevant features, there is a limit beyond which additional nodes or layers do not significantly improve accuracy. The CNN model provides predictions in milliseconds, as opposed to seconds or minutes required by other methods like random-walk-based models or 3D NHT models.

The study confirms the CNN model's reliability for real-world scenarios and potential as a fast and efficient alternative for non-gradient iterative topology optimization, focusing on accuracy in predicting changes in thermal conductivity.

A limitation of the CNN model is its inability to generate temperature or heat flux maps due to its lack of physical understanding, which prevents it from being partnered with methods like evolutionary structural optimization. Suggestions for future research include enhancing the training dataset, adapting the model to 3D, and extending its application to other materials.

Finally, the researchers make their trained network, training dataset, and a sample code available for public access, advocating for further development and validation by the research community.
