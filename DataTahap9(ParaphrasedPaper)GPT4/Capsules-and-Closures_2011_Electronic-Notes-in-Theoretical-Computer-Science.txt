The central concept presented in these propositions is that each computational element, known as a capsule, is associated with multiple states that are bisimilarâ€”that is, they are indistinguishable in terms of their computational behavior, despite containing extraneous information. Similarly, for each capsule that cannot be further simplified, there are multiple comparable outcomes that also maintain unnecessary details. Consequently, capsules provide a more streamlined and focused depiction of the computational state, free from irrelevant data.
