This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related research, summarizing Bluetooth routing protocols. Section 3 details the proposed Bluetooth scatternet routing optimization protocol, and Section 4 analyzes the simulation outcomes. The paper concludes with Section 5.

Although numerous mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocols have been developed, they are not directly applicable to Bluetooth networks due to their unique bandwidth and MAC layer characteristics. It's essential to integrate ad hoc routing protocols with scatternet formation functions. When adapting MANET protocols to scatternets, the ad hoc routing algorithms must be designed to support the creation of new scatternets and determine routing paths using scatternet-specific routing strategies.

It's possible to adapt conventional ad hoc routing protocols for use in Bluetooth networks. Bhagwat's early routing approach for Bluetooth using the routing vector method represents such an attempt. The paper emphasizes an enhanced AODV routing protocol for Bluetooth network communication, improving upon AODV's original route discovery mechanism. The protocol differentiates between two types of links.

The simulations involved fifty Bluetooth devices scattered across a 70m x 70m area, employing Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic to represent application data. The number of devices ranged from fifteen to fifty, with eighteen pairs of source-destination connections. A round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm was used, and data packets of types DH3 and DH5 were transmitted. Simulations ran for a total of 200 seconds.
