Our study examines the reachability problem within segments of mobile ambients, a complex framework for distributed and mobile computing. By employing a correlation with associative-commutative (AC) term rewriting, we establish that the reachability is a solvable issue in the non-open fragment of pure mobile ambients that encompasses name restriction and employs a weak reduction approach. The processes within this framework exhibit three types of infiniteness: the depth of ambients, the extent of parallel compositions, and the quantity of restricted names. Our findings build upon preexisting research concerning public versions of mobile ambients, enhancing those results.

In literature, the expressiveness and verification challenges concerning variations of the mobile ambient (MA) framework have been the subject of much research. This paper zeroes in on the reachability dilemma, questioning whether a transition exists between processes p and q. Previous studies have addressed the reachability problem for the public fragments (i.e., lacking name restrictions) of MA.

We previously explored the connection between public MA segments and a variant of AC term rewriting called TUC. This exploration revealed that the computational actions of public MA align smoothly with rewriting systems designed for terms with multiset variables. We demonstrated that for TUC's structure-preserving fragment, TUCSP, reachability between non-variable terms is a decisive matter. TUCSP rules are defined as structure-preserving as they cannot remove term tree internal nodes but can generate and eliminate terminals (leaves). Additionally, we showed that reachability's decisiveness in TUCSP expands the studies relating to mobile ambients in earlier literature. The constraints applied to MA in said literature can be uniformly reformulated with structure-preserving TUC rewrite rules. Of particular note, TUCSP differs from other AC rewriting fragments since it requires synchronization rules that work with tree terms and multiset variables, a feature limited to non-variable terms in PRS and AC ground term rewriting.

To confirm that solving the reachability problem within the defined segment of pure mobile ambients is possible, we revert to a reduction to reachability in a specialized segment of AC term rewriting known as structure preserving, where solving reachability is already established as possible. We will set out the structure of these preserving rewrite rules in the following section.
