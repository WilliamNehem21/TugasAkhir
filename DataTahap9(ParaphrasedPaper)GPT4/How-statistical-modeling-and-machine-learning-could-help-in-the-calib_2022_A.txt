This academic paper outlines the creation and development of two modeling types used for predicting the motion of a conductor over time and space, given a specific wind speed. The first model, referred to as the Strip Theory Model (ST), relies on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations. Though accurate, this model requires significant computational resources. The second model, named the Wake Oscillator Model (WO), is a simplified alternative that avoids the complexities of the first. The paper describes a research framework comprising three key phases: data collection using the WO model, data modeling, and data visualization. A specific focus is placed on optimizing the WO model parameters through various algorithms, with a preference for Hyperopt due to the complex nature of the problem.

The paper goes on to detail a new prediction model, coined the OPTI-ENS model, which forecasts specific values (y/d) using time-series WO data. The OPTI-ENS model is composed of an ensemble of XGBoost models and a Deep Neural Network (DNN), with the final prediction being a weighted average from these individual models. The training process skips traditional feature extraction, and consists of two stages: pre-training in an unsupervised manner to set initial network parameters, and fine-tuning in a supervised manner to update all layer parameters with backpropagation.

Results from various machine learning models are compared, with a focus on RMSE and R2 score metrics to evaluate prediction success. The benchmark includes visualization of the training data generated by the Hyperopt optimization process, the development and training of the OPTI-ENS model (using a combination of several XGBoost models and an optimized DNN model), and the subsequent prediction outcomes. The findings suggest that the ensemble model (OPTI-ENS) performs better than individual models when it comes to predictions. The combination of XGBoost’s efficiency with smaller data sets and DNN’s strength in handling almost raw time-series data accounts for the predictive capability of the ensemble model.
