The paper emphasizes the critical need for precise cattle identification and distinguishes between two primary methods: contact and non-contact. Contact methods, such as branding and ear tagging, have been the traditional means of identification but are prone to circumvention and cause animal stress due to their invasive nature. Non-contact methods are increasingly favored due to advancements in AI, including biometric identification and machine learning models which offer a more humane and efficient approach.

AI technologies, which have been broadly successful in recognizing humans through features like face, iris, and fingerprints, are now being applied to cattle. This technological shift aims to manage false livestock insurance claims, a significant problem where farm owners deceitfully obtain insurance money through unverifiable cattle recognition by untrained individuals. Automated intelligent systems have been proposed to utilize cattle's unique biometric features, akin to human fingerprints, for identification, resolving fraudulent insurance claims.

The proposed system offers a myriad of applications, such as tracking cattle for breeding or medical reasons, monitoring behavior and movements within farms, and identifying lost or stolen animals. It leverages computer vision to identify cattle based on their unique biometric characteristics with higher precision and efficiency than traditional methods.

The paper is structured into sections detailing a literature review, research methodology, experimental results, and recommendations for future research. Recent studies have shown the application of various AI technologies in cattle identification, with the emergence of precision livestock farming being particularly notable as it revolutionizes cattle management through advanced identification techniques.

AI's capability to recognize cattle characteristics, even with similar facial features, has led to the development of several techniques, such as the use of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to extract biometric features. The YOLOv7 model, part of the YOLO object detection family, demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency, achieving a 99.50% detection rate and a perfect 100% identification rate when coupled with feature matching algorithms.

This research proposes a YOLOv7-based object detection approach, which outperforms previous versions in terms of accuracy and speed, using a dataset of 9,400 images and 15,416 class labels. The dataset comprises four classes representing cow faces, noses, dirty noses, and non-cows, divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. In conclusion, the paper presents a significant advance in cattle identification methods, driven by cutting-edge AI techniques that have vast implications for the agricultural sector.
