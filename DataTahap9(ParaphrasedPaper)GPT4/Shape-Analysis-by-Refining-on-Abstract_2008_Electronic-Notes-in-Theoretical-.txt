Shape analysis algorithms analyze programs to deduce information about heap-based data structures they handle. This analysis is crucial for understanding and verifying programs, and it requires abstraction to be done effectively. Various abstraction methods exist, including k-limited heap abstraction, shape graphs, reference counts, and 3-valued logic abstraction.

Furthermore, shape analysis helps in detecting memory leaks, which are prevalent issues in pointer-based programming languages. These leaks can cause large, resource-heavy, and long-running programs to fail by depleting memory. Various models and techniques, such as ownership models and region-based methods, are employed to identify memory errors.

The paper introduces an Abstract Evaluation Path (AEP) to manage complex expressions, as their values aren't readily defined in an Abstract Shape Graph (ASG). AEP represents an abstract path by which an expression's value is determined in an ASG. It simplifies the process of defining values within the ASG.

A more dynamic strategy in shape analysis is taken, including the ability to handle pointers within data structures, not just at their start. This approach is conservative and might yield more shape graphs than those actually produced by the program.

The paper comprises sections detailing the definition of Concrete Shape Graph (CSG), the concept of AEP, the algorithms for refining ASGs using AEP, the abstract semantics of statements on ASGs, experimental results, related work, and conclusions.

A shape graph, distinct from a typical directed graph, is a complex representation of memory structures and their connections with various node types to represent different data structures.

Abstract interpretation addresses the issue of potentially infinite systems by generating a finite set of ASGs from infinite CSGs. This is done by abstracting memory location values and using predicates to categorize infinite memory locations into a finite number of classes based on their truth values.

A set of unary predicates and their constraints, known as the core predicates, are defined to provide a foundation for the algorithm.

The algorithm involves operations like splitting new nodes from non-unique ones and cutting off inconsistent edges and graphs. It also involves replacing a graph with a set of graphs to ensure unique paths from cells.

Conflict conditions are identified in reachable and share predicates indicating logical inconsistencies.

The paper demonstrates that shape analysis with this method can handle complex expressions and middle-of-structure pointers. AEP, derived from any C language expression, is used for refining the ASG and simplifying the semantics of a statement on the resulting shape graphs. The method also supports checking for memory errors on the ASGs. Future work aims to improve this method's efficiency and to further validate its applicability in verifying C language programs.
