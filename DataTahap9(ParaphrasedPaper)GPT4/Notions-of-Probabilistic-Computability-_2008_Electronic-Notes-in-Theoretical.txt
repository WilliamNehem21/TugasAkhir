Section 3 presents detailed definitions of three modified notions of computability linked to the previously mentioned items (i), (ii), and (iii). By considering combinations of these notions, a total of five distinct computability concepts are introduced. Each concept of computability is associated with a corresponding relaxed version of continuity. The section emphasizes examining the connections between these relaxed continuity notions and standard attributes of representations, spaces, measures, and functions. The study then investigates the interrelationships among the five computability concepts by using one of three approaches: providing a robust counterexample to demonstrate that one concept does not inherently lead to another, proving that one concept invariably entails another, or demonstrating that one concept implies another given some additional, but reasonable, conditions.
