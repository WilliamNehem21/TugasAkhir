This study introduces a methodology centered on the B method for disciplined development of Java Card smart card applications. The key aspect of this methodology is to separate the specific details of Java Card and smart card applications from the specifier's concerns as much as possible. The approach allows the application logic to be specified without focusing on Java Card's intricacies, especially the communication between the card acceptance device and the smart card. Platform-specific code is generated during the refinement process and code generation stage. An additional benefit of this method is the potential for reusing the specifications across different implementation platforms.

The paper suggests a tailored B methodology, enhancing the efficiency of Java Card software development. Current methods can auto-generate Java Card code from B modules but neglect certain Java Card elements, particularly the communication between the host application and the applet on the smart card. Our goal is to define B method guidelines tailored for the Java Card environment, enabling automation of the communication protocol's specification and implementation between the card applet and the host application.

The paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 provides the basics of smart cards and Java Card, Section 3 gives an introduction to the B method, Section 4 is the crux, detailing how to apply the B method to Java Card design, and Section 5 wraps up with related work and remarks.

Smart cards, embedded with a microprocessor and memory, offer several benefits such as enhanced security for data processing and storage, greater storage capacity, and independence from remote database queries. They're especially useful in industries like telecommunications, finance, transportation, and healthcare.

Developing smart card applications has become more accessible due to the Java programming language, which abstracts the complex details of smart card systems. Additionally, Java development tools enhance rapid building, testing, and deployment, thereby reducing software production time and cost. Other advantages include multiple application support within a single card and adherence to international smart card standards like ISO 7816.

The paper discusses the details of a card acceptance device (CAD), the half-duplex APDU protocol for communication, and the Java Card applet's structure with its essential methods. The work delves into the B method's application to smart cards, noting the importance of aligning B integer variables to Java Card types and the need to handle exceptions properly. Designers are provided with templates for managing exceptions and encoding information.

The paper concludes by explaining the translation step required to mold operation interfaces into the Java Card style, generating a new B abstract machine that can be refined and implemented. Moreover, the paper describes the purpose and relationships between crucial machines like api_process.mch and api_conversions.mch in transferring the abstract operations into executable low-level data for the Java Card platform.
