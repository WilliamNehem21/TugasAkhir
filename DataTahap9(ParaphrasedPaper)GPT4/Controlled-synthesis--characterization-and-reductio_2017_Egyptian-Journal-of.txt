In a standard process for producing graphite oxide, a blended solution consisting of 96 ml of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and 10.7 ml of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in a 9:1 volume ratio was generated. This acid mixture was gradually combined with a mixture containing 0.6 g of graphite powder and 4.8 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in an 8:1 mass ratio while stirring in a vessel.

Graphite oxide's epoxy groups are susceptible to reaction with nucleophiles, which can lead to the opening of these epoxy rings. It is believed that ascorbic acid can provide protons and electrons to graphene oxide which facilitates the opening of the epoxide structures and produces easily removable hydroxyl groups that subsequently dehydrate to form graphene sheets.

The degree of oxidation in graphite oxide (GO) was observed to vary with the amount of potassium permanganate used. In particular, there was a discernible decrease in absorption intensity at around 300 nm for a sample of GO with increased levels of potassium permanganate (GO4) when compared to another sample (GOC3), suggesting that an excess of potassium permanganate could lead to over-oxidation of graphite. To further explore the impact of reaction temperature on the oxidation level, two samples, GO4 and GO5, were synthesized with the same graphite powder to KMnO4 ratio of 1:8, but at different controlled temperatures.
