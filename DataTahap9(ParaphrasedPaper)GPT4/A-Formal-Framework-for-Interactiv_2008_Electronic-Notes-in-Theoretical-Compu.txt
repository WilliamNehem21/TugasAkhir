The paper discusses the complexities and new considerations in the design of interactive agents, which operate beyond the scope of traditional Turing computability. Interactive agents, unlike basic algorithms, must address challenges like survivability and environmental awareness, as well as the ability to influence, negotiate or compete within their environment. 

The paper proposes examining interaction points as boundaries between the agent and its environment. These interaction points could include sensors, effectors, or message exchanges with other agents. It then outlines a framework based on rewriting logic and a reflective coordination model, which includes new forms of interactions, and extends existing interaction semantics, to design, specify, and analyze interactive agents.

The paper is structured into six sections, beginning with the motivations and theoretical underpinnings, followed by a formal description of its architecture, interaction semantics, and applications to real-world agent systems. Finally, it summarizes the content and proposes future research directions.

A 'Pagoda system' is introduced as a case study, involving a distributed network of nodes managed by coordinators that handle message flow and knowledge dissemination. The authors illustrate interactive agent behavior through the example of an "alternating display" agent that reads from sensors and outputs to a display, governed by a set of coordination rules.

Four types of interaction points are considered: message input, message output, value reading, and value writing, each described by an identifier and associated with either a queue or a value. The paper then details the behavioral rules and coordination policies guiding how agents interact with these points.

The paper touches on various semantics for modeling the coordination of interactions, comparing them to existing work in interface design for reactive and concurrent systems. It culminates with a discussion on knowledge management and autonomous agents, and their potential activities, utilizing the proposed framework for structure analysis.

The conclusion emphasizes the necessity for future work, such as evolving actor interaction semantics, comparing different semantic models, and developing logical rules for deducing the emergent behaviors of interactive agents. It also stresses the significance of policy-based coordination for compositional reasoning within the design of interactive agents.
