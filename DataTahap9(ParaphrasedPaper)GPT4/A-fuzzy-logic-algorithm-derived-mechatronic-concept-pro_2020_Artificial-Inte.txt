The study aimed to develop and evaluate a prototype system for precise intra-row weeding in agricultural fields. A sensor mounted at a height above the average height difference between crops and weeds detected the time of flight of obstructions, with the data processed by a microprocessor (Atmega 2560). The microprocessor employed a fuzzy logic algorithm, taking into account sensor responses, soil conditions, vehicle speed, and plantation characteristics, to generate actuation commands. These commands were then sent to a motor controller (HB-25, Parallax Inc., Rocklin, CA, USA), which used pulse width modulation (PWM) to control a DC motor (WormDrv-G200-12, Parramatta, NSW, Australia) that laterally shifted the rotary weeding arm for a duration determined by the algorithm.

Position sensors were integrated into the system, including a proximity sensor (P1) on a ground wheel to calculate the system's forward speed, which was input to the control algorithm. The prototype's performance was tested in a specially equipped soil bin under various operating conditions to assess electronic control parameters, the system's behavior - including torque during weeding and draft force during lateral arm shifting - and the impact of system and operating conditions on potential plant damage.

Mounted on an externally controlled mechanical trolley allowing different speeds and depths, the prototype featured a 200 NM capacity torque transducer (T20WN, HBM, Darmstadt, Germany) linked between the DC motor and final drive to determine the torque during weeding. To measure the draft force during operation, two 12 kN capacity load cells (L1 and L2) (F214, Novatech Measurements Limited, East Sussex, England) were installed between the trolley and the prototype. An additional load cell (L3) measured the force during lateral shifting. All transducers connected to a data logger (1-MX840-PAKEasy, HBM, Darmstadt, Germany) interfaced with a computer for real-time data acquisition. A liquid crystal display (LCD) was fitted to show various operation parameters such as lateral shift speed.

Analysis of the fuzzy logic algorithm and plant damage was conducted using stepwise multiple regression to study the relationship between independent parameters and their interactions, where the fitness of models was assessed using ANOVA, and a two-sample t-test compared weeding efficiency and plant damage from field tests.

Excessive damage to tomato crops suggested the need for crop-specific adjustments in the fuzzy logic algorithm for intra-row shaft movement. Uniform soil bed preparation and planting were deemed essential for effective operation of intra-row weeding systems. Future work could include real-time soil compaction measurement for on-the-fly adjustment of shift speeds, integration of the weeding shaft system into different sensor networks, and examining the impact of soil properties and tractor wheel slippage. Preliminary field evaluations showed the system to be effective for controlling intra-row weeds (above 65%) and plant damage (below 25%) under optimum operating conditions.
