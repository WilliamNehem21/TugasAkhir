This research explores the utilization of IoT sensors for monitoring various seawater parameters, focusing on both educational applications and fostering environmentally sustainable practices. The study emphasizes the potential for IoT technology in oceanography, which has not been extensively investigated due to deployment challenges. By conducting hands-on trials in the Aegean Sea, the researchers aim to gather authentic datasets to create realistic educational scenarios that deepen the understanding of marine environments.

The paper recognizes the increasing threats to ocean ecosystems and the projected growth of the maritime economy. Emphasizing the importance of a scientifically educated workforce, it suggests the use of technology-enhanced experiences to foster student interest in oceanography.

The document is structured into eight sections, discussing prior research in water quality monitoring, essential water quality parameters, the design and capabilities of a custom IoT device, the execution of experimental trials, data analysis, educational applications, and reflections on the lessons learned.

Data collection at the University of Minnesota employs underwater sensors that deliver real-time water quality information, contrasting with traditional methods like manual sampling. This modern approach yields quicker, more accurate insights into pollution levels and the effectiveness of remediation efforts.

The paper also describes a DIY remote sensing device, reported on Huckster.io, which uses an Arduino-based system to measure diverse water quality indicators, with results accessible via smartphone or computer.

IoT sensing in education must account for the cost and durability of sensors, as inaccuracies may arise from using inexpensive, non-scientific equipment—a challenge highlighted by the differences observed in sensor readings during the Rome and GAIA project deployments. The importance of questioning and calibrating measurement tools is underscored to ensure robustness and data accuracy.

Additionally, the paper addresses the significance of measuring water temperature, salinity, and turbidity—critical factors affecting marine ecosystems. It also details the impact of environmental variables like solar radiation, precipitation, and evaporation on these parameters.

Ultimately, the study advocates for the adoption of the Arduino platform for educational IoT devices. Its open-source nature aligns with the mission to provide accessible, low-cost tools for learning about electronics and interactive design, fostering a hands-on approach to understanding and conserving marine resources.
