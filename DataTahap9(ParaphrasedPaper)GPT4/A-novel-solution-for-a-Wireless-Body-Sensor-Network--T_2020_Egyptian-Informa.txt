Tele-monitoring through event-based data transfer in wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) offers a promising framework for real-time health monitoring, particularly for elderly patients. However, ensuring reliable and real-time data transfer remains a challenge due to sensor interference, data loss, and redundancy. Active research aims to address these technical obstacles.

This paper explores the data transmission challenges encountered while telemonitoring the elderly using WBSNs. It evaluates various data transmission techniques and models that strive to balance low latency, energy efficiency, and high reliability. The research begins with identifying WBSN problems during telemonitoring, followed by a review of algorithms, techniques, and frameworks applicable to this subject. The best existing solutions for WBSNs are then improved upon, with mathematical and theoretical evidence to support the enhancements. These proposed solutions undergo simulations to examine the efficiency of health data transmission within WBSNs as part of an event-based system, focusing on reliability, latency, and energy consumption.

Results of the simulation show a reduced end-to-end delay of 0.056 seconds, improving upon the previous 0.059 seconds. This is while taking into account potential hindrances like hidden terminals (e.g., Wi-Fi and ZigBee); however, the system lacks a secondary path for packets that encounter interference or collision. Although the paper successfully reduces delay, it also studies other research like Alfa et al.'s incentive-compatible scheduling technique, which achieves 0.03 seconds delays for sensitive medical packets. While this technique enhances service priority during emergencies, it adds complexity during network recoveries, making it unsuitable for our proposed solution.

The paper also assesses a method that improves link quality and congestion management in WBSNs, showing a 20% improvement in the data delivery ratio compared to the RTCS technique. However, this method does not account for the movement of sensor nodes, which can affect network stability and link quality.

Event-based data transfer has emerged as a superior option to conventional periodic or priority-based transfer methods, minimizing redundant data transmission and associated delays. Although more reliable, there is still the issue of data loss due to multiple sensor interferences, highlighting the need for further improvements in WBSN reliability, interference, and latency.

In summary, event-based data transfer in WBSNs has notable advantages for monitoring the health of the elderly. It improves on traditional methods by lowering end-to-end delay, latency, and increasing reliability, especially for substantial networks. Energy consumption is also a major concern, as data not surpassing a certain threshold can be disregarded, enabling energy-saving modes. The proposed system reduces bit transmission, mitigates sensor interference, and conservatively utilizes energy.

The research concludes by achieving a latency reduction to 0.635-0.875 milliseconds and reliability between 98-96%, while also reducing sensor power consumption significantly. Future research should aim to refine localization and tracking for tele-monitoring, aiding in monitoring behaviors and activities, crucial in emergencies. Additionally, current strategies focus on wearable body sensors and do not encompass sensors implanted internally, such as in the brain, which could potentially provide more precise health insights.
