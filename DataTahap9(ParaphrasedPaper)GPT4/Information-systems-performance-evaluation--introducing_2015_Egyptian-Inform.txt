This paper presents a novel method for evaluating and analyzing call center performance, which applies models traditionally used for assessing information systems. Adapted from the Delone and McLean model (1992) and the Design Reality Gap model by Heeks (2002), this approach introduces two key metrics: a success index and a gap index. Utilizing these metrics, the paper describes the development of an evaluation tool designed for call center managers to systematically assess their operations. The tool has been tested on four diverse call centers ranging in function from simple food ordering to emergency control systems, highlighting the value of information system models in evaluating such complex environments and pinpointing areas that require improvement.

The relevance of call centers is underscored by their proliferation due to the advancement of communications technology and cost reductions for voice and data calls. Call centers have significantly transformed customer support, marketing, and after-sales services. They are increasingly utilized for real-time critical services, like emergency response and first-line health consultations. In Egypt, for instance, call centers have enhanced the ambulance system following the January 25th revolution, while in India, they provide initial health consultations to ease the burden on primary care.

Traditional queuing theory often fails to capture the complex reality of call centers due to oversimplified assumptions. The paper offers a literature survey on operations management challenges in call centers, taking into account technological newcomers, behavioral aspects of agents and customers, and the intersection with sales and marketing.

The research harnesses the Delone and McLean model to analyze call center performance, including 43 indicators across six model dimensions. This multi-dimensional approach allows for detailed analysis and understanding of the individual and collective impacts of different aspects of performance. The paper describes sections on applying the Design Reality Gap model to call centers, discussing the gap index, presenting findings from the methodology, and concluding remarks with suggestions for future research.

The paper notes the challenges in collecting and analyzing data from call center systems, which include both hard (e.g., blockage rate) and soft (e.g., customer satisfaction) indicators. Automated feedback and customer surveys via interactive voice response (IVR) systems have become more common for assessing soft indicators.

Specific call center case studies in Egypt underline the need for a reevaluation of their design to better meet performance demands. Future research may focus on tailoring indicators to industry-specific call centers (like finance or health) and establishing appropriate weightings for each model dimension. The ultimate goal is to create an automated, integrated tool for evaluating and benchmarking call centers in real-time.

This summary streamlines and rephrases the original comprehensive academic paper for clarity and brevity, focusing on the main objectives, methodology, and implications for the call center industry.
