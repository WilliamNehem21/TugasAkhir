The paper discusses the relevance of finite state automata (FSA) in the field of information technology, particularly because of their flexibility and alignment with objectives of regular enterprise applications. The emergence of workflow-based programming highlights the potential for FSAs to regulate workflows. This is becoming a focal point, evidenced by the inclusion of the Workflow Foundation engine within the .NET 3.0 platform to facilitate workflow management. Despite sophisticated frameworks, simpler use cases may also benefit from building applications around FSA.

In this context, the paper introduces a framework that generates automata and is noteworthy for its ability to utilize both static and dynamic information for generation, which can happen at runtime. A technical highlight is that this generation uses lambda expressions from the enhancements made in the C# 3.0 language.

FSAs are defined as mathematical constructs that are in one state at a time from a predefined set of states. They start in an initial state, transition through states based upon inputs and conditions, and if they end in a final state when the inputs are exhausted, the inputs are considered accepted.

FSAs are popular for solving practical problems and are increasingly vital in workflow-based programming. Workflows can be designed as automata that embody business rules. Despite advanced workflow programming frameworks like .NET's Workflow Foundation, there is sometimes a need to simplify implementation details for programmers without overcomplicating the set-up or using external tools.

The paper touches on improvements in C# 2.0, highlighting generics and the addition of anonymous methods. These methods, akin to Java's anonymous classes, allow the creation of unnamed functions.

The framework includes a container for each state that contains a lambda expression of the type Func<string, StateValue>, dictating the next state for a given input (a string in current implementations with plans for future extension). After validating an XML-based declarative description, it generates constants, state value enumerations, and lambda expressions.

The pilot implementation has limitations and potential issues such as managing tail recursion, which C# natively doesn't handle, leading to possible stack overflows, but which may be mitigated using the 'tail.' IL instruction at the code level.

The paper concludes that the implementation can be expanded to support multiple start and end states, and transitions with guard conditions. Though these seem like minor adaptations, creating a non-deterministic automaton with lambdas is identified as a significant challenge for future work.
