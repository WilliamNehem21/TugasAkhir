The study focuses on the spindle system of a high-speed, high-precision machining center, employing finite element analysis (FEA) to conduct thermal analysis and thermal-structural coupling analysis. The research simulates the cooling system's effectiveness in dissipating heat and anticipates the resulting thermal deformation. The simulation results serve as a guide for the robust design of spindle systems.

Heat sources affecting the machine tool during operation are broadly classified into internal and external sources. Internal sources, such as cutting heat and friction-induced heat, are the primary contributors to thermal deformation. The study predominantly considers the forced convection heat transfer approach to examine different fluid flow patterns' impact on heat transfer, utilizing various empirical formulas to calculate heat transfer coefficients. The determination of whether the fluid flow is laminar or turbulent is made using the Reynolds number, a dimensionless criterion.

To validate the analysis, the study includes an experimental phase where temperature and thermal deformation data are collected under typical operating conditions. Test runs were performed with the spindle at 8,000 rpm, and data was sampled every five minutes at room temperature. 

The paper presents FEA as an effective tool for predicting temperature distribution and thermal deformation. The experimental results support the FEA's reliability, providing insights for spindle system design considerations and thermal error compensation strategies.
