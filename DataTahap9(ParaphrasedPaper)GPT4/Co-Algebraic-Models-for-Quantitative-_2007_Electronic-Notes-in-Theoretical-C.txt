Recent studies have ventured into the realm of non-syntactical interpretations of spatial logics. Instead of applying these logics to the term language of a specific process calculus, they have been applied to graph rewriting systems. An innovative approach offers a non-syntactic take on parallel decomposition by integrating spatial information into language semantics. This approach has resulted in a coalgebraic model known as spatial transition systems (STS), which has proved to be a fitting semantic model for CCS-like process calculi. The STS framework highlights that it supports full concurrencyâ€”it distinguishes between processes like "a.b + b.a" and "a | b," as their meanings differ in this context.

In the STS model, the semantics of process calculi relies on reaction rules, which restricts the ability to observe behavioral aspects of individual subsystems in isolation. Differently from previous models, this approach only recognizes the parallel decomposition of processes if the subprocesses involved are able to potentially synchronize with other processes. This is somewhat reminiscent of the location semantics found in CCS.

The SLTS (spatial labeled transition systems) bisimulation that derives from this definition encompasses the standard CCS bisimulation and is broader than structural congruence. To illustrate the application of the framework, consider a formula that measures the minimum quantity of a specific resource (represented by a process capable of performing action "a") after event "b" has occurred. The use of this kind of formula finds parallels in the field of multi-valued logics, especially in the context of managing history-dependent access control policies, where the assessment of resource usage policies is influenced by the historical sequence of events, just as the validity of access control policies is dependent on past execution history.
