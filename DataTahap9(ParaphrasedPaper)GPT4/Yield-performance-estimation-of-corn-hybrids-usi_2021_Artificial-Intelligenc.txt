The global population surge and environmental challenges, such as climate change-induced extreme weather, are prompting worldwide concern about securing food sources, especially crops. Accurate yield prediction has become increasingly vital for financial stability and food management globally, and can aid farmers and food industries in evaluating and improving their productivity and efficiency. Accurate forecasting models also support agronomic decisions to mitigate losses under unfavorable conditions.

To enhance yield prediction, researchers have explored various predictive models, including traditional machine learning, data mining, and advanced neural networks. Deep-learning models have become prominent due to their ability to handle complex interactions. Deep Gaussian process frameworks and recurrent neural network algorithms are examples with notably high accuracy rates in predicting crop yields leveraging different types of data.

Corn hybrids are of particular interest due to corn's importance in both food and industrial sectors. Hybrids, created by crossing two parent seeds, generally offer superior productivity and drought tolerance. Though breeding programs aim to determine high-performing hybrids, traditional methods are costly and inefficient. Data analysis techniques are now employed to foresee hybrid performance before extensive field evaluation. The 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge was an opportunity to apply machine learning to predict the performance of new corn hybrids, based on a historical dataset of nearly 200,000 inbred-tester combinations across various environments.

In the study, multiple machine learning models were trained and tested using different data splits to prevent overfitting. The data preprocessing phase included feature selection and encoding categorical variables into numeric forms through various methods. Ultimately, the best model was selected based on the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) during testing. The study determined certain clusters of inbreds and testers that could influence yield outcomes.

XGBoost, a model known for handling overfitting, emerged as the superior algorithm and has been validated in other studies predicting agricultural yields. The model proves useful for decision-makers in breeding programs by cutting down on the number of trials needed and providing results rapidly.

For future work, the study suggests improving clustering methods for inbreds and testers and incorporating more environmental factors into the dataset to enhance model accuracy. The study concludes by demonstrating the potential benefits of machine learning, particularly the XGBoost model, in predicting corn hybrid performance and thereby contributing to more productive and cost-efficient agriculture.
