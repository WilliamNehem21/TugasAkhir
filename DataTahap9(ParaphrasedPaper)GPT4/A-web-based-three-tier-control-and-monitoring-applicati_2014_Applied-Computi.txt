The paper outlines an automated control and monitoring application designed for photovoltaic (PV) plant installations that comply with the IEC 61724 standard. This application could easily be adapted for other renewable energy sources and various remote automation scenarios.

The paper is structured as follows: The system's architecture is introduced in Section 2, followed by a description of the control and automation services in Section 3. Section 4 gives details of a solar park installation, the signals being monitored, and alerts put in place. Screenshots of the implemented services are shown in Section 5, while Section 6 describes the technology stack and database schema used in the application.

The system operates on a three-tiered structure. The middle (automation) level features a data center that centralizes the monitoring and management of all installations. Its service back end is responsible for collecting, storing, and managing data and can be expanded for additional measurement points. This backend also provides third-party integration through the Communication Adapter Module (CAM) and supports extended calculations via the Application Logic Module (ALM). Additionally, it includes a Notification Server Module (NSM) for alerting users and a Reporting Server Module (RSM) for generating and delivering reports.

At the top management level, the solution offers a web-based interface compatible with standard browsers, providing a unified view to operators and end-users.

Derived parameters are calculated on the back end using specific formulas, reducing the need for bandwidth and storage at remote sites.

The system also tracks and communicates the operational status, ranging from normal to critical conditions, and this is displayed to users in a hierarchal fashion. Automatic report generation, delivering information via email or SMS, is another key feature, and the timing and content of these reports can be customized.

Solar parks operate based on the photovoltaic effect with the interconnection of solar panels being crucial during installation. The application includes various alarms for conditions like power loss and battery performance.

Users can define their preferred communication channels for notifications and alarms in their profile pages, with options for SMS and email alerts.

Technologically, the PV management system is built using Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4 framework, with C# as the programming language. It consists of three projects: a website with .aspx pages, a WCF service library project for web services like email notifications, and charting controls for graphical data representation. A Microsoft SQL server database stores the necessary data at the service back-end.

Finally, the system's efficacy was tested on real data collected over a year from a 2 MWp PV plant, including various environmental and performance metrics.
