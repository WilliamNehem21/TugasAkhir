Recommender systems, which are key components of online retail platforms such as Amazon and eBay, aid consumers in discovering products they might enjoy. Despite considerable progress, most of these systems operate on static, centralized infrastructures like the internet, and there's a need to explore their effectiveness in more dynamic settings with erratic network connectivity and variable transmission times. This research investigates a recommender system designed for delay-tolerant networks (DTNs), where sporadic interactions between users drive communication.

The developed system merges collaborative and content-based filtering to forecast item ratings. Each user’s device has a local recommender, updated through exchanges with others, that allows it to make predictions even in the face of disruptions. Simulations demonstrate that this method increases recommendation availability and mitigates issues faced by new users or items—known as the cold-start problem.

Collaborative filtering streamlines user profile creation by tracking user ratings, though it struggles with new users or items due to a lack of historical data. The combination of collaborative and content-based filtering in this study aims to balance accuracy with breadth of recommendations.

In a DTN-based digital marketplace, participants' mobile devices, gifted with ample computational and networking capacities, collectively create an adaptive communication structure. Each device maintains a buffer for such exchanges.

The system in this research uses node clusters to promote message passing and supports local recommenders on each node to make predictions. The role each node plays in managing their respective cluster is crucial, particularly clustering heads that lead the spread of user profiles.

A controlled experiment uses a fixed network to evaluate how a traditional collaborative system compares to the proposed DTN-compatible hybrid system using the Amazon dataset. It also looks at how the number of considered user profiles affects predictions. Subsequently, the researchers explore how the DTN system adapts over time as it accrues more user profiles, by monitoring the mean absolute error (MAE) and recommendation coverage.

Results indicate that in early stages, when nodes have few similar profiles saved, the reference system shows high MAE, but it gradually improves with the accumulation of more relevant profiles. Conversely, the hybrid system exhibits a consistent MAE regardless of the size of the profile buffer, since it doesn't rely solely on other users' ratings. Furthermore, both systems' coverage augments as they incorporate ratings from a growing number of similar users, though the hybrid system's capability to make predictions is immediate and later improves as other users’ ratings are combined.

In conclusion, this work showcases a hybrid recommender system tailored for DTNs, demonstrating its potential to deliver robust and reliable suggestions even in the absence of a centralized network, overcoming challenges specific to dynamic and intermittent connectivity.
