Cellular automata (CAs) are a type of discrete, systematic framework where each round involves simultaneous updates to units within a uniformly arranged grid using a local rule. Generally, these units, or cells, are uniform finite machines tied together in a consistent connection pattern with their adjacent cells, frequently with conditions that loop at the boundaries. The local rule dictates the subsequent condition of any individual cell, based on its present condition and the conditions of its neighboring cells.
