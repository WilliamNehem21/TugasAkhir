In this paper, the authors introduce the DEMONAT project, a French initiative directed at developing a software system capable of analyzing and validating mathematical proofs written in natural language, primarily for educational purposes. The system is intended to help students better comprehend and construct mathematical proofs.

The process begins with a student writing a proof in natural language. The DEMONAT program then translates this proof into an intermediate language known as PhoX.NC, which incorporates both standard commands from the PhoX proof assistant (intro, left, elim, apply, prove, and so on) as well as what the authors call new commands. These new commands require an automatic tactic to validate them, as they must prove a formula before being accepted into the proof.

The paper's Section 2 introduces these new commands and explains the rationale behind PhoX.NC. Section 3 presents a straightforward example of a proof written by a student, detailing how the program would analyze it. Section 4 focuses on the validation process, which is the mathematical core of the project, and discusses the need for a dedicated theorem prover tailored to DEMONAT.

The authors also discuss the preliminary and flexible grammar for PhoX.NC commands, emphasizing their designed closeness to natural language while adhering to formal grammatical rules. They examine the challenges and nuances of translating natural language proofs into PhoX.NC, acknowledging that multiple translations are possible and highlighting potential complications.

Furthermore, the paper elaborates on how meta-rules derived from new commands could be validated by an automatic prover, noting the current limitations of PhoX's automatic tactic for handling these commands. The authors propose implementing an inverse resolution method in a "lazy" manner but do not fully define it, providing examples instead and directing readers to references for a comprehensive understanding of the resolution method.

The overview of DEMONAT reveals that, besides the outlined linguistic hurdles, the system can function in two modes: one that validates an entire proof based on a complete text and another that builds a proof iteratively, with the user interacting with the system and seeking feedback on the current proof state.

Lastly, the authors suggest that the automatic prover could become more sophisticated in tandem with the user's expertise level. For example, the system might challenge advanced students with more complex proof steps while maintaining simplicity for beginners by rejecting overly difficult reasoning.

Overall, the paper provides insight into the objectives and development of the DEMONAT project and discusses the range of complexities involved in translating and validating mathematical proofs written in natural language for educational purposes.
