To address a specific issue, this paper introduces a niche-based two-stage evolutionary algorithm named NACMOEA. This approach employs two collaborative archives and features a unique strategy for harnessing infeasible solutions. The algorithm is rooted in various groundwork made by CHT-based algorithms, utilizing dual-archive sets and other frameworks like CCMO and MOEA/D-DPF, which all contribute to balancing population diversity with convergence and feasibility.

NACMOEA distinguishes itself by incorporating collaborative archivesâ€”a convergence archive and a feasibility archive. The convergence archive focuses on discovered UPFs to organize the objective space, while the feasibility archive stores elite near-CPF solutions, maintaining a balance in the population's convergence, feasibility, and diversity. An innovative aspect of NACMOEA is the use of direction-informing angle-based niches for pairing feasible and infeasible solutions, which promotes offspring production that could explore the CPF directionally.

The algorithm's dual archives serve different purposes throughout the search, shifting their roles based on a non-dominant coverage rate metric. Initially, the focus is on rapidly converging towards the UPF, later transitioning to emphasize overall population feasibility. NACMOEA was tested on 28 different problems and was found to outperform several advanced CMOEAs in overall performance. Additionally, component-specific tests underscored the benefits of the dual archive cooperation mechanism and the infeasible solution strategy.

The study concludes by noting the efficacy of NACMOEA while recognizing opportunities for further improvements. These could include enhancing selection strategies and incorporating multimodal optimization techniques to broaden the algorithm's applicability to more complex many-objective constrained optimization problems.
