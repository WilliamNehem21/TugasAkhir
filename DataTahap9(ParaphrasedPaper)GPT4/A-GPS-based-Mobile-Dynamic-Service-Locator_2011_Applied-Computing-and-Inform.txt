The abstract proposes a GPS-based system for mobile devices that helps users find and locate services they need. The system, which is flexible and can easily integrate new service additions, stands out from previous systems by utilizing GPS technology for more precise location tracking rather than relying on mobile service provider data. The paper acknowledges the long-standing research in location-based services and discusses earlier systems, such as paging and infra-red technology-based location services, that predate the use of GPS and GSM for outdoor tracking. Notable existing products in the market offering geo-referenced applications for mobile phones include Webraska, Intelliwhere, Openwave, and ESRI. The proposed system informs users of the distance to services they seek, though these distances are not reflective of actual physical distances or traffic conditions; however, they still provide valuable information to the user.
