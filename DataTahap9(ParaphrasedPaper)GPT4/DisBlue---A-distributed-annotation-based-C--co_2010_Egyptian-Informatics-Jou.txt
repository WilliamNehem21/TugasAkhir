This academic paper proposes two compilers, Blue+ and DisBlue+, which aim to improve compilation efficiency and readability through novel annotations and distributed compilation techniques.

The compilers seek to address problems inherent in existing compilers: annotations in current programs increase token count and slow down compilation, while distributed compilers rely on synchronous cooperation between disjoint pieces, incurring overhead from extensive network communication.

Blue+ employs axiomatic semantics-based annotations to replace if/loop constructs, simplifying conditionals, enhancing readability, and reducing compilation scanning time. These annotations are precompiled by developers, saving compilation time and providing a clearer alternative to complex conditional statements.

Building on Blue+, DisBlue+ introduces a distributed architecture that breaks a program into prototypes (compiled interfaces) and definitions, which are separately compiled. This minimizes code transfer over the network, reduces dependencies between pieces, and eliminates synchronization overhead. Each class definition is compiled alongside its related prototypes, meaning less redundant file transfer and better performance.

The proposed compilers were evaluated using large-size codes and compared with Java-based compilers (javac, djavac, and cdjava). The results show that Blue+ and DisBlue+ are more efficient. The paper provides examples and implementations of these compilers, as well as experimental results demonstrating their advantages.

The underlying innovation of this research is utilizing axiomatic semantics, annotations, and compiled interfaces to enhance code readability and reusability while overcoming overheads due to annotation tagging and distributed compilation.

Overall, Blue+ uses pre-parsing to handle axiomatic annotations efficiently, and DisBlue+ employs a novel distributed compiler strategy that allows for asynchronous, conflict-free coding through well-defined interfaces and automated assembly of tasks. This results in smaller file transfers and fewer dependencies, which can greatly benefit compilation phases, especially parsing and semantic analysis. The prospect of extending these ideas into new C#/C++ compilers is also discussed, with suggestions for exploring more annotation types to enhance their capabilities.
