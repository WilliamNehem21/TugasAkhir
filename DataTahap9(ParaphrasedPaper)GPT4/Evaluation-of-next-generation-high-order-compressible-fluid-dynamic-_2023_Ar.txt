The paper's structure is outlined as follows: Section 2 details the core concepts and components of the spatial and temporal algorithms implemented in the SSDC method. Section 3 provides a concise overview of the software's implementation and infrastructure. In Section 4, the computational environments are introduced, which include the on-premises IBEX cluster and the Amazon EC2 cloud computing platform. Section 5 illustrates the performance outcomes of SSDC for various test cases on both the IBEX and Amazon EC2 setups. The paper concludes with Section 6, summarizing the findings and discussing directions for future research.

This study aims to evaluate the SSDC solver's effectiveness when solving intricate flow dynamics on two different computing platforms: the IBEX cluster and the Amazon EC2 cluster. It also seeks to determine the cost of computation per core hour. With EC2 instances, the number of CPU cores is assigned based on the instance type chosen, and the study ensures only the physical CPU cores are used by not enabling hyperthreading. Results will report the average wall-clock time (WCT), measured in seconds over three separate trials, and the associated costs in U.S. dollars (USD).

In previous applications, a shift from EC2's c5a.4xlarge to c5a.8xlarge instances demonstrated a substantial reduction in WCT, with a 35%-40% decrease observed. The fastest WCT is achieved on EC2's ARM-based c6g instances, with consistent results across various accuracy orders. Additionally, these instances display nearly perfect scalability when the number of cores is doubled.
