The academic paper discusses a tool designed for checking coding rules in C++ programs, which is integrated with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The tool aims to ensure code compliance with standards such as HICPP and MISRA-C, by checking for rule violations during compilation. Unlike other tools that may use informally described rules and possibly produce inconsistencies, this tool benefits from GCC's parser and semantic analysis engine, ensuring uniform interpretation of code.

The rule definition language of the tool is based on a subset of Prolog, with plans to develop a more accessible, completely declarative logic language for defining rules. The paper details how the tool identifies code that violates a given rule and presents it to the user with warning messages.

The tool has been added to the GCC middle-end and C++ front-end, with the extension of adding about 2.8 thousand lines of new code. It represents coding entities as Prolog terms and uses a naming scheme to identify them. The paper also notes the performance impact of the rule checker on compilation times and the variability of checking times based on rule complexity.

Overall, the tool presents a novel, formal approach to coding rule validation that integrates smoothly with developers' existing workflows and provides a reliable, consistent means for ensuring code quality.
