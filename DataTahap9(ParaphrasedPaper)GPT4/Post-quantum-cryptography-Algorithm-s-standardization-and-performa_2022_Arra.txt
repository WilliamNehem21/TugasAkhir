The paper addresses the international race to dominate in quantum technologyâ€”a major advance set to reduce computational times from years to mere hours or minutes, hence significantly aiding scientific progress. However, this technology poses a considerable threat to cybersecurity, as most current cryptographic methods are theoretically susceptible to quantum attacks. The advent of practical quantum computers, equipped with millions of qubits, could compromise nearly all contemporary public-key cryptography.

To confront this, the paper explores global efforts toward inventing, developing, and standardizing quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. These quantum-safe alternatives often require more processing power, increased memory during execution, and larger key sizes. The study delves into the practicality of various quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques.

Cryptography, being an essential facet of cybersecurity, uses complex mathematical challenges to secure information. The paper discusses how current cryptographic algorithms may fare against classical computing but are vulnerable to quantum computations. It offers a structured examination across eight sections, detailing general cryptographic information, introducing quantum computers, addressing post-quantum encryption challenges, reviewing efforts at standardization, analyzing potential quantum-safe algorithms proposed by NIST, their implementation via the Open Quantum Safe project, and assessing feasibility and adoption challenges.

The paper delineates the roles of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography and highlights their usage in everyday life, such as secure browsing, digital signatures, and electronic transactions. In the context of quantum computing's advantages, it also warns of its capacity to crack existing cryptographic systems, hence threatening information security on personal, governmental, and corporate levels.

National and international entities, including ETSI and the German BSI, are actively developing and endorsing quantum-safe cryptography. Despite the rush to innovate, most of these efforts remain outside the public domain, except for NIST's detailed process of standardizing quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

The paper ends by examining seven finalists and eight alternate quantum-resistant algorithms announced by NIST. It specifically evaluates algorithms like BIKE, a code-based key encapsulation method, Rainbow, a signature scheme based on multivariate quadratic systems' complexity, and Merkle signature schemes, which use a one-time signature with a Merkle tree.

Lastly, the paper acknowledges the challenge of resource constraints on ICT devices like smartphones, IoT devices, and smart systems, especially given the higher requirements of quantum-safe algorithms. These prospective cryptographic methods will need to strike a balance between security and scalability, acknowledging that perfecting both might be unattainable.
