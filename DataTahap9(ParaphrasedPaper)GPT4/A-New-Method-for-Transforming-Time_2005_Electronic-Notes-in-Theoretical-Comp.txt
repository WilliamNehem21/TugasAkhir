Title: State Space Reduction in Timed Automata and the SetExp Transformation Method

Abstract: Timed Automata (TA) are limited due to the potential for state explosion in their corresponding Region Automaton (RA) state spaces. A variety of reduction techniques have been introduced to transform a TA into a more compact automaton, thereby significantly reducing the number of states.

Theory: It is assumed that every TA behaves deterministically. This means that for two transitions triggered by the same event and occurring at the same location simultaneously, the outcome should result in an identical location change and clock resets.

Implementation: The example provided discusses the synchronicity between programming an alarm (set event) and the occurrence of the alarm (exp event), demonstrating identical timing constraints.

Transformation Method: The SetExp technique modifies a TA in two phases. The first phase involves the replacement of transition resets with set events, and reformulating transition guards as relative order constraints considering exp events. The second phase entails generating an explicit event order in the SetExp transformation including set, exp, and additional alphabet events. These transformation steps are thoroughly detailed in later sections.

Case Study: The discussion includes a scenario involving the expiration of a clock and the expectation of a subsequent expiration. When an expiration happens, it is modeled by an assignment, updating the expected expiration.

Main Results: Theorem 6.1 affirms the validity of the SetExp method, enabling the conversion of system modeling from TA to a non-real-time representation, which can then employ non-real-time analysis techniques. This concept has already been applied in areas such as conformance testing and supervisory control.

Further Insights: Property 6.2 is particularly significant as it allows for non-proportional alteration of guard constants, offering a more flexible approach compared to Property 6.1. The paper notes the need for future research to identify specific TA classes where Property 6.2 is applicable.

Advantages of SEA over RA: Unlike RAs, Symbolic Event Automata (SEA) are less likely to experience state space growth due to changes in the magnitudes of timing constants. Properties 6.1 and 6.2, along with an additional remark, highlight the benefits of choosing SEA over RA for practical state space management.
