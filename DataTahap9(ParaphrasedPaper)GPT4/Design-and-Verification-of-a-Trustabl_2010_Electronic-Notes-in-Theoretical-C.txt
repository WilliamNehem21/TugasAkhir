The paper discusses addressing specific issues by first developing models within the Refinement Calculus of Object Systems (RCOS) framework and then using the UPPAAL tool to verify the safety properties in real-time. Telemedicine systems, which incorporate both the Telemedicine System (TMS) and Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, provide decision support services to healthcare professionals across various hospitals and countries.

The authors choose RCOS for developing TMS because it allows for the refinement of both the structural and behavioral aspects of object-oriented systems. This approach effectively reduces system complexity by allowing concerns to be addressed separately. RCOS is built upon a coherent semantic model that includes a formal refinement calculus, which supports precise notations for object-oriented and component-based design. Accordingly, formal techniques and tools like UPPAAL can be integrated into the development process to enhance the system's reliability and safety.

The structure of the paper is as follows:
- The upcoming section introduces the class and interaction models within RCOS.
- Section 3 explains how the TMS is constructed using RCOS.
- Section 4 details the verification of the system using UPPAAL.
- The paper concludes in section 5.

RCOS supports a model-driven development approach, offering a multi-view modeling environment that merges object-oriented and component-based design and analysis methods, significantly streamlining system complexity and ensuring system consistency and correctness. In RCOS, an integral concept is that of a "component," which is an implementation of a contract.

The system facilitates the transmission of patient data to the EHR data center, where it contributes to the generation of EHR entries. While in EHR mode, doctors can simply select an existing EHR entry. The system analyzes either the newly generated or selected EHR entry and consequently provides doctors with reminders, evidence, and guideline links.
