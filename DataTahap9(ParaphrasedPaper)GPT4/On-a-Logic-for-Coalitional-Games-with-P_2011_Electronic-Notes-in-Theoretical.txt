This academic paper addresses the problem of coalition formation among resource-bounded agents with the aim of achieving goals represented by an ATL formula. The authors specifically focus on identifying the most cost-effective coalitions that can fulfill the given goals while following the rules specified by a priced game arena. Notably, the paper demonstrates that this problem is not more computationally intensive than the verification of goal satisfaction by fixed coalitions.

The study also highlights a less-explored issueâ€”how actions within the system can generate resources rather than just consume them. Previous research has shown that when actions can create resources, the problem of verifying the model becomes undecidable. However, this paper introduces a constraint where actions can only produce resources in amounts equal to or less than what has been consumed, thereby making the problem more tractable and representative of real-world scenarios.

The paper outlines a new formalism, PRB-ATL, which extends traditional ATL logic to incorporate resource bounds and pricing. It defines the optimal coalitions (OC) problem as the task of finding coalitions that are effective and economical. The research shows that both the model checking for PRB-ATL and the OC problem are in EXPTIME with a PSPACE lower bound, and it proposes an algorithm to search for optimal solutions, though the precise characterization of these problems' computational complexities remains open for investigation.

The document sets forth a structure that includes formalizing a logic to accommodate priced resources, analyzing the complexity of model checking, and addressing the challenge of identifying optimal coalitions. The conclusion suggests future research to explore different variants of the logic that could more naturally express a variety of scenarios. An example involves considering financial endowments as part of the game's structure or as a parameter to be minimized to establish how much money agents require to achieve a given task.
