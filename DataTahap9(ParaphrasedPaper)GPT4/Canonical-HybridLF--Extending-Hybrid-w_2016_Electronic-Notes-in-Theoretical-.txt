This paper presents the Canonical Hybrid Logical Framework (CHLF), an advancement in metalogics used for proving properties of other deductive systems, which is implemented in the proof assistant Isabelle HOL. CHLF builds on the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF) by Harper, Honsell, and Plotkin, as well as the Hybrid system by Ambler, Crole, and Momigliano, which utilizes higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) based on untyped lambda calculus.

The innovation introduced by CHLF is the use of a dependently-typed lambda calculus instead of an untyped one. CHLF enables users to define signatures that represent judgments and syntax of a deductive system, object logic, along with the capability to prove metatheorems related to those judgments using a HOAS interface. CHLF incorporates the use of the M2 metalogic by Schurmann and Pfenning to establish that metatheorems defined in the signature are valid.

The paper focuses on reasoning about object logics, which can include logics and programming languages, among others. This reasoning is done by first translating an object logic into a metalogic and ensuring that the object logic's properties are well-represented within this metalogic.

A core aspect of the Hybrid system is the use of conversion functions that map untyped higher-order syntax to first-order syntax. The authors assert that not only can this technique be applied to simply-typed settings, but it can also extend to the dependently-typed CHLF system, which circumvents the need for well-formedness predicates and enables `judgments-as-types' reasoning similar to Twelf.

The paper is structured, starting with an overview of the Hybrid system in section 2, followed by a recap of the Canonical LF logical framework and a detailed explanation of the contributions presented in the paper's introduction in section 3. Section 4 provides examples, including a comparison of the Hybrid and CHLF encodings of quantified propositional logic, and discusses an implementation of a logic for proofs within the system.

CHLF, like Hybrid, employs the concept of abstraction and introduces function predicates that validate if terms are legitimate abstractions. CHLF differs in its use of type abstractions in addition to term abstractions and expands the abstraction concept from unary to k-ary abstractions, where Isabelle functions bind precisely k variables. A discussion on these abstraction functions and their practical implementations is provided, highlighting how the higher-order pattern matching techniques from Hybrid are applicable to CHLF as well.

The paper also explains the implementation details of various functions like canon_typeof and atom_typeof, as well as substitution functions, illustrating their parameters and usage through sample code snippets.

Finally, the paper addresses the use of type constants to represent the judgments to be proved. Examples include 'form' for the type of formulae and 'nnf' for converting a formula in quantified propositional logic (QPL) to negation normal form.

The paper concludes by referencing previous work that compares formalizations of meta-theory for languages with variable bindings in Isabelle, highlighting the importance of CHLF in the broader context of formal verification and proof systems.
