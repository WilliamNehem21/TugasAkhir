The paper discusses the application of a process algebra called HYPE to hybrid modeling, using the repressilator—a synthetic genetic regulatory network—as an illustrative example. The repressilator is composed of three genes: tetR, cI, and lacI, each encoding proteins that repress the expression of the next gene in a negative feedback loop, resulting in oscillatory behavior. By representing this network within HYPE, the authors demonstrate how various analyses can be conducted.

The paper further elucidates the formal structure of HYPE, its operational and hybrid semantics, by introducing a simple example involving a gene with negative feedback regulation on protein production. When a certain protein level is reached, production halts until the concentration decreases to a point where production can resume. Flows – the production and degradation of protein – are central in the HYPE modeling approach, with events modifying the flow's strength and form. The HYPE representation separates the logical structure of flows from their mathematical interpretation, allowing for variability in modeling.

By modeling an uncontrolled system with possible events but without constraints and a controlled system through the synchronization of a controller (that has event prefixes like initialization) with the uncontrolled system, the dynamics of HYPE models can be understood. Event conditions dictate when discrete events occur, and operational semantics define the behavior, leading to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe changes in variables over time.

The authors suggest that translating the ODEs and event conditions into a hybrid automaton is logical, as it combines the information with the well-established formalism of hybrid automata – systems with both continuous evolution and discrete events that can enact abrupt changes in the system's state.

The Specifics of the repressilator's HYPE modeling are also touched upon, assuming unified reaction rates (labeled kp for production and kd for degradation) for simplicity. The paper concludes by discussing the importance of initial conditions for system initialization, and how specific events are triggered by conditions such as protein concentration thresholds, completing the overview of the modeling process and its potential for future expansion in the field of hybrid biological systems modeling.
