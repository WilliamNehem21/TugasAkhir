The research field of innovation and diffusion has been thoroughly explored, with many studies highlighting that collaboration enhances the quality of scientific research, leading to more productive scientific work. These studies typically assess academic collaborations by examining co-authorship networks, co-citation networks, co-word networks, and both international and inter-institutional partnerships, often by applying social network analysis (SNA) to evaluate the relationships within these networks. Despite this, there seems to be a gap in the literature regarding bibliometric and collaboration network analysis specifically within the domain of patent data.

Patent databases provide crucial information that includes patent numbers, priority application data, Direct Member Coverage (DMCs), titles, designated states, application details, inventors, assignees, patent specifications, International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, and references to other patents and scholarly articles. For the purpose of analysis, duplicate records have been carefully removed, resulting in a dataset of 3610 individual patent records, which have been further refined and organized in an Excel spreadsheet—cleaning and categorizing data related to assignees and patent counts.

Among the entities involved in patent partnerships, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a French public health agency, stands out with the highest number of co-owned patent applications. These patents often claim advancements in biomarkers for hepatic fibrosis prognosis or Hepatitis C treatment. AP-HP has 31 co-owned patents with 10 different co-assignees, which likely reflects its global health-focused international strategy aimed at fostering large-scale cooperative projects with other institutions.

The study also identifies trends in technology applications within the medical field, notably the use of artificial intelligence (AI). These applications are predominantly seen in medical image recognition, computer-aided diagnosis, disease monitoring and prediction, bioinformatics, and drug development, with particular attention to AI's role in specific patent classes such as G06T-G06K (AI in medical image recognition) and G06N-G06K (AI in medical diagnostic systems), as well as G16B-C12Q (predicting enzyme activity).
