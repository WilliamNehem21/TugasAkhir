Soot 2 is a toolkit designed for analyzing and manipulating Java bytecode, supporting both internal and external static analysis and transformation. The toolkit has become a popular resource for researchers, both within the Sable Research Group and beyond, as a platform for testing novel analyses and for benchmarking empirical findings. It's also utilized in academic settings, such as McGill University, as a practical tool in optimizing compiler courses, where it serves as a foundation for students' assignments and projects.

The visualization capabilities of the Soot framework are particularly advantageous for both its primary applications: academic research and educational purposes. For researchers, visual representations of analyses facilitate the development of advanced algorithms. In educational settings, these visualizations aid instructors in teaching analysis concepts and assist students in comprehending and troubleshooting the analyses they conduct.

Soot incorporates a versatile annotation system that assigns analysis results as tags to various components of the intermediate representation (IR), such as expressions, statements, and classes. These tags are maintained across different IR forms within Soot and can be embedded as class file attributes to interface with other tools. The Soot-Eclipse plugin uses these tags to visualize analysis outcomes in the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). Users can easily visualize new analysis results by simply annotating them with standard framework tags, which are then automatically displayed in Eclipse.

Three new types of tags have been created to represent different results within Soot. String tags display textual information as tooltips, color tags visually distinguish code elements through color-coding, and link tags create navigable connections between code statements. These tags present the analysis results in Eclipse, aligned with either the IR forms or the original source code.

Enhancements to the Soot-Eclipse plugin now enable step-by-step tracing of analyses, a feature that particularly benefits students. One of the greatest challenges students face when crafting their dataflow analyses is comprehending the analysis process in real-time. With the ability to methodically step through—or even reverse—analyses, it is anticipated that students will develop a deeper understanding of dataflow analysis, making the implementation and debugging process more intuitive and engaging.
