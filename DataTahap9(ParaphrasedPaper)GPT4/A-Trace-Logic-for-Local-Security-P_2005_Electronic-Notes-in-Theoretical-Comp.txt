We introduce a novel, simplified logic tailored for defining local security properties pertinent to individual protocol participants. This approach enables formal specification and integration of security properties into the cryptographic protocol design workflow and supports formal verification. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by revealing previously unidentified vulnerabilities in the extensively analyzed TMN protocol.

Our paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 details our model for security protocols. Section 3 presents our new trace logic language. Section 4 examines the TMN protocol, identifying new attacks against it. Section 5 reviews related work. Conclusions and future directions are discussed in Section 6.

Regarding intruders, we explain how they can generate a term 't' from known information 'k,' possibly involving unification processes where 't' might match a term in 'k,' signifying that the intruder has prior knowledge of 't.'

We use Vernam encryption, denoted as V(t1, t2), where keys r1 and r2 are exchanged between parties A and B through a server S. After the fourth message, A can deduce r2, establishing it as the shared key.

Deciding on the placement of freshness checks fveshr1 and fveshr2 within the server's role depends on when the values are received. We place fveshr1 after receiving r1 and fveshr2 after receiving its corresponding value to ensure their freshness.

Upon receiving specific messages, the server can authenticate parties A and B because of the unique secrets sa and sb shared with each. To confirm authentication goals, we translate the process into formulas asserting that messages apparently from A or B are indeed from them.

Looking ahead, we aim to apply our methodology to more complex protocols, such as multicast protocols like the LKH group communications protocol. Additionally, we're interested in exploring how to combine local security specifications, which we believe could be a significant advantage of our approach compared to other global concepts.
