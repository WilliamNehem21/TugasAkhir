This paper discusses how the complexity of software systems is increased by the need to incorporate mobility, and presents an approach that integrates mobility into the architecture of distributed systems without disrupting pre-existing computation and coordination elements. The approach maintains a separation of concerns by using architectural description techniques that are augmented to support the incremental and compositional development of systems that are sensitive to location.

The authors demonstrate the use of architectural connectors to manage the interactions between components, allowing for location-awareness to be layered onto location-translucent models. This superposition is achieved through the addition of distribution connectors, which control how components and connectors interact with location properties and the underlying network infrastructure, all while preserving the location-independent aspects of computation and coordination.

The paper refers to the work of Hoare regarding conditional multiple assignment and expressions that indicate no operation (denoted by the keyword 'skip') in relation to primed channels in the context of architectural models.

Roles within system interactions are discussed, emphasizing the need for components to fulfill certain obligations in order to instantiate a role. A notion of behavioral refinement is introduced, which allows for component and connector exchange without altering the system's overall structure. Further details on how this refinement works between designs and connectors are cited from other sources.

Channels within the model are linked to locations, represented as x@l, where 'l' indicates the position in space associated with 'x'. Changes to 'l' reflect the movement of 'x' and other related channels and actions.

Lastly, the paper mentions that the methods they've used to adapt components for mobility can be generalized through the use of location connectors. These connectors should become part of libraries to assist designers in making architectural models aware of location considerations. The authors note ongoing work to extend an algebra of connectors with the aim of systematizing the process of publishing, finding, and using such connectors for system modeling.
