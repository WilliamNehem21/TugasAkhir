In the submitted extract of an academic paper, the authors identify a pressing issue in Ethiopia where the inability to effectively utilize current technologies has resulted in low maize yields. This challenge is directly linked to food shortages in the country. Historically, maize was introduced to Ethiopia sometime around the late 17th century and is cultivated across diverse ecological zones including highlands, midlands, and lowlands.

Previous research on physical land suitability in Ethiopia has taken into account factors such as climate (rainfall and temperature), soil composition, land use, and elevation. However, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) was not considered a criterion, which the present study aims to address by incorporating LST in the land suitability assessment.

The study area in question has a variety of soils, with Haplic Alisols being the most prevalent, covering 61.0% of the area, and Rhodic Nitisols being the least, covering 7.5%. The researchers obtained climate data for the area by interpolating readings from four local meteorological stations using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method. The focus was on obtaining spatially detailed (30 m resolution) annual rainfall data for the study area.

For the purpose of this research, LST was obtained from the thermal bands of Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) data from 2020. The Mono Window algorithm was used to process the imagery and extract the LST, specifically utilizing band 10 of the TIRS. The Landsat data Digital Number (DN) was converted to spectral radiance before LST extraction, following methodologies from associated literature.

Soil data for the research area were sourced from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation Engineering, which was then spatially clipped to the study area boundaries. This data was converted to a raster format with a 30 m spatial resolution and reclassified according to criteria from an earlier study (Debesa et al., 2020) in preparation for an overlay analysis in the assessment of land suitability.
