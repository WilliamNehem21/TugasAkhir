This scholarly article reports on a study aimed at estimating the ripeness levels of strawberries both in the field and under laboratory conditions using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology in combination with deep learning techniques. The study focused on differentiating early ripe from fully ripe strawberries. Using HSI, the researchers were able to analyze the ripeness at two distinct stages, both on-site in the field and in a controlled laboratory environment.

A classifier was developed based on support vector machine (SVM) theory, which is essentially designed to identify the best possible hyperplane that differentiates the classes of data. SVM is known for its effectiveness in classification tasks using HSI data and features a structural minimum principle that helps prevent overfitting. For this study, the strawberry samples were divided into training and testing datasets with a 70:30 split for both field and laboratory data. The dataset comprised 43 early ripe and 41 ripe strawberries for field training while the test set included 17 early ripe and 19 ripe for field conditions, and the laboratory dataset had 39 early ripe and 45 ripe for training with 21 early ripe and 15 ripe for testing.

Upon evaluation, the researchers confirmed significant variations in average spectral wavelengths between different ripeness stages, which led to the selection of specific wavelengths. These wavelengths were used for spatial feature analysis, achieving a high accuracy of 98.6% on the validation dataset. This indicates that HSI can effectively distinguish between early ripe and ripe strawberries in the field according to conventional standards. However, one limitation is that the HSI cannot detect strawberries concealed by leaves.

The study suggests that portable HSI systems could be used to estimate strawberry ripeness in real-time, providing valuable support for precise strawberry harvesting on a field level. Although analyzing hyperspectral images in-field presents challenges, better sample preparation and a larger dataset for analysis can help refine the ripeness estimation process. The researchers plan to collect more sample images in future studies, covering a broad range of both external and internal qualities of strawberries at different ripeness stages.
