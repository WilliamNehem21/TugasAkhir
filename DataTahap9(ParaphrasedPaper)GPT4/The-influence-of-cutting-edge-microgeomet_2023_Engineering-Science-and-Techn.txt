Machining remains a crucial step in fabricating vital parts for the automotive and aerospace sectors. Despite novel production methods, broaching stands out for its unmatched efficiency and precision in numerous applications. However, it comes with high costs, prompting the need to reduce the forces involved, heat generated, tool wear, and potential damage to the workpiece surface.

Tool wear directly impacts temperature increases, and this has been studied through simulation, allowing insights into typically challenging-to-measure parameters like cutting temperature. Prior research, including 2D simulation studies, has examined how alterations in factors like rake angle and cutting speed influence cutting forces and temperatures during broaching. Still, research exploring the effects of the cutting-edge radius (or microgeometry) on these factors is less common. Nevertheless, studies in milling and turning have shown the significant impact of cutting-edge radius through sensitivity analysis, simulations, and high-speed testing. Rodriguez and colleagues, for example, looked into how cutting-edge radius affects the performance before and after applying a coating following drag-finishing polishing.

Previous experimental work has confirmed the validity of the Zorev shear stress model, which splits the too-chip contact area into zones of adhesion and sliding friction, each with their friction coefficients. Researchers like Grzesik have analytically demonstrated that the apparent coefficient of friction is made up of adhesion and deformation components. Moreover, in the real-world setting of broaching component manufacturing, friction isn't limited to the tool-chip interaction; it exists in the tool-workpiece contact and dynamically affects the cutting-edge radius, directly impacting chip formation, tool lifespan, surface finish, and energy use in the process.

The tool-workpiece interaction's coefficient of friction correlates directly to this interaction, increasing as the rate of flank wear rises. Certain studies have focused on measuring friction in the context of flank wear when machining particular materials such as titanium Ti-6Al-4V and nickel-based IN-100 alloys, noting that the friction coefficient is affected by the workpiece material and to a lesser extent, the edge geometry. These studies have been carried out on machines with high rigidity and minimal vibration, under dry conditions, using an uncoated sub-micro grain tungsten carbide tool.

Regarding friction, researchers have proposed both a quasi-stationary model and an average friction coefficient value, though others, like Arrazola et al., argue that the friction coefficient isn't constant and suggest a variable coefficient based on empirical data from cutting tests. They've noted that friction is influenced by parameters such as rake angle, clearance angle, and uncut chip thickness.

Finally, additional results in broaching, particularly on machining materials like Inconel 718, show that as the planning time increases, the cutting-edge radius also grows, while the edge's average roughness diminishes. However, due to the nature of the contact between the brush bristles and cutting edge, the method used for edge preparation has its limitations in managing microform variations and ensuring symmetry.
