This academic paper discusses methods for ensuring the reliability of analyses performed using the Real-Time Maude framework on real-time systems. Real-Time Maude is a tool that allows the modeling, simulation, and analysis of real-time systems, and can be as expressive as other modeling tools, but with analytical capabilities akin to automaton-based tools with some limitations. The paper addresses the problem that formal analyses of infinite-state real-time systems often lack decision procedures, and thus can produce incomplete results.

To overcome this, the authors introduce criteria that ensure both the completeness and soundness of Real-Time Maude search and model checking by using the maximal time sampling strategy. They particularly focus on real-time object-oriented systems that communicate asynchronously via message passing. A system is referred to as sound if the analysis does not produce false positives (spurious counterexamples), and an analysis is complete if the absence of found counterexamples indeed indicates that none exist.

The authors propose a two-step process for ensuring a complete analysis: First, carry out a traditional formal analysis in Real-Time Maude under the maximal time sampling strategy; and second, verify certain proof obligations related to the time robustness of specifications and the tick-stabilization of state properties.

The paper also highlights the efficiency gains from the maximal time sampling strategy through a practical example where a bug is found significantly faster compared to increasing time in one-unit increments. Moreover, they address how to deal with discrete time systems and examine how the strategy applies to probabilistic systems.

The approach's utility is demonstrated with the example of the OGDC algorithm for wireless sensor networks, showing how simple it is to prove time robustness with the outlined methodology. The maximal time sampling strategy is shown to be not only almost trivial to prove complete but also substantially more efficient, particularly for systems with large time scales.

In summary, this research provides a valuable contribution to the field by showing that with the right conditions and methodologies, it's possible to have complete and decidable time-bounded search and model checking for complex, dense-time, non-Zeno real-time systems using Real-Time Maude.
