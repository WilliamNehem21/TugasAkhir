The goal of our research is to apply the correspondence between algebras and coalgebras in demonstrating a counterpart theorem for coalgebras. We discovered that the analogue to implication in this context is the notion of a modal rule. Our findings, encapsulated in Theorem 4.1, reveal that a group of coalgebras can be defined through rules if, and only if, it is invariant under the application of morphism images and the formation of disjoint unions. Building upon this, Theorem 5.2 extends the discussion to the realm of Kripke frames, asserting that any category of Kripke frames that can be characterized by infinitary modal logic rules is necessarily stable under the influence of p-morphism images and the combination of disjoint unions.
