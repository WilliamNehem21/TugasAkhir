The system's reliability can be assessed using minimal path sets, which are collections of critical components whose operation is vital for the system's functionality. A minimal path set implies that the failure of any component in the path would render the system nonfunctional.

The GO methodology has introduced seventeen unique operator types, labeled 1 through 17, representing various system components and their interconnections through signal flows. Each operator is an abstraction for a particular system function and must adhere to specific input and output rules.

Within the set of logic operators, three types exclusively illustrate the logical connections between signals. Logic operators typically have two or more input signals. When deriving minimal path sets, these logic operators must be processed accordingly. For example, if a GO chart includes a type 2 operator (an OR gate), all operators connected to the OR gate and subsequent ones must be added to the input signals of the OR gate. If a type 10 operator (an AND gate) is present, the input signals are condensed into a single output signal, and any repetitive operators among these inputs are removed. When dealing with a type 11 operator, the respective operators are processed in a specific manner.

The GO methodology can be effectively implemented for modeling a water supply system. Components of the system are mapped to corresponding operators: Water sources and essential inputs like power and drive signals are illustrated using type 5 operators. The electric pump requires a control signal for normal operation, which is expressed with a type 6 operator. The primary input signal originates from the water source, and the secondary control signal comes from the output of the power system. Control valves, which must actuate with control signals, are also depicted using type 6 operators. Check valves, being bi-state components, are embodied by operator type 1.
