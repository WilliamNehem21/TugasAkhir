Until recently, there had been no proof of strong normalization for the cut-elimination process in full logic. P. De Groote provided such proof for classical propositional natural deduction utilizing the CPS-transformation. R. David, along with another author, offered a direct and syntactical proof. R. Matthes later discovered a separate semantical proof.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the typed system and its associated cut-elimination procedure. Section 3 outlines the realisability semantics and establishes the correctness theorem. Section 4 presents some applications of the theorem.
