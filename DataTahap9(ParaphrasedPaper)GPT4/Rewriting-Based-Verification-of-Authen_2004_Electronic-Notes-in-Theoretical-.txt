In this paper, we introduce a rewriting-based formal analysis method for security protocols. To assess the security of such protocols, we first model them as observational transition systems and define them within the CafeOBJ language. We subsequently develop proof scores in CafeOBJ to demonstrate the security and safety attributes of the protocols. These proof scores are processed by the CafeOBJ system through execution, which entails a form of rewriting.

The structure of our paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces CafeOBJ, and Section 3 describes observational transition systems within this context. The paper then briefly overviews the corrected NSPK protocol, known after Lowe's correction as the NSLPK protocol, in Section 4. Following this, Section 5 goes into detail about how this protocol is modeled as an observational transition system and specified within CafeOBJ. Section 6 presents a portion of the proof that establishes the protocol's safety properties. Section 7 compares this work to related research, and Section 8 concludes the document.

Originally proposed by Needham and Schroeder in 1978, the NSPK protocol aimed to authenticate communication using public-key cryptosystems. In 1995, Lowe exposed a significant vulnerability in the protocol that allowed an intruder to masquerade as a legitimate agent and initiate communication with others. Lowe also suggested a revision to remedy this flaw, resulting in what we refer to as the NSLPK protocol in this study.

The paper models a system accommodating an arbitrary number of principals using the NSLPK protocol, treating one of them as a potential intruder. This intruder adheres to the assumptions of the Dolev-Yao threat model, carrying out limited, predefined illegal actions. We label states for principals operating as initiators or responders in the protocol using specific notations reflecting their readiness to send or receive messages or establish a session. We define nonce values to track unique identifiers created or received by a principal during the initiation or response process. Initially, we assign neutral values to these state labels and nonce variables to signify a starting state where no nonce values have been used.

In summary, the paper focuses on using formal methods to analyze and verify the security properties of protocols, employing the NSLPK protocol as a case study. We use CafeOBJ to model the protocol's interactions and verify its safety properties formally, demonstrating how such formal analysis can provide robust security guarantees.
