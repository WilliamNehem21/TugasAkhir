This study explores the impact of localization errors on the power efficiency of location-based routing protocols which depend on position information to direct packets without the need for maintaining complex routing tables. The focus is on two protocols: GREAF, which selects the relay node nearest to the destination, and MECF, which also makes forwarding decisions based on proximity.

The authors propose a novel mathematical model to quantify localization errors within wireless sensor networks (WSNs), assuming a Gaussian distribution for these inaccuracies. Using this model, they analyze how these localization errors affect the energy consumption during routing.

Simulation in MATLAB compares the power usage of GREAF and MECF both without and with the presence of localization errors. The study narrows its scope to evaluate only the routing aspect of GREAF, intentionally excluding the protocol's MAC layer intricacies, and concentrates on assessing power consumption in relation to erroneous location data. Further metrics like packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput are suggested for future research.
