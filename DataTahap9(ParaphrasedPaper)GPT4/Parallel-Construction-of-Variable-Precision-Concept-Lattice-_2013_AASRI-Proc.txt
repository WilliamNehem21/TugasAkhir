This paper delves into the development and examination of a fuzzy concept lattice using the fuzzy cut method, and introduces a novel form of concept lattice known as the variable precision concept lattice. This new lattice can be tailored to accommodate varying confidence levels by choosing different thresholds for precision. The study discusses two distinct methods for constructing this lattice—the context cut method and the concept cut method—each from a different perspective, and shares several findings derived from these methods. Moreover, the paper presents a case study to illustrate the practical application of these ideas.

In practice, the connections between the extent (set of elements) and intent (set of attributes) in concepts are frequently ambiguous, characterized by fuzzy relations that cannot be properly expressed through traditional concept lattices. Researchers such as Burusco, Belohlavek, Georgescu, and Fan have expanded on the seminal work of L. A. Zadeh, who introduced the fuzzy set theory in 1965, by incorporating fuzzy logic into concept lattice theories. These modified lattices, given by scholars, are designed to reflect the inherent fuzziness in real-world relationships between extent and intent and are more aligned with human conceptualization.

The fuzzy concept lattice and the weighted concept lattice are extensions of classical set theory, allowing objects to partially fulfill the attributes encompassed by the intent. However, identifying concepts with only partial attributes can be computationally intensive, particularly in large lattices. In contrast, rough concept lattices enable searching for concepts with partial attributes, but they may include many objects with only a single attribute from the intent, thereby diminishing the support and confidence levels for the association rules drawn.

This work examines the relationship between classic concept lattices and fuzzy concept lattices, integrating the notion of fuzzy cut sets into the construction of concept lattices. The paper introduces a new type of concept lattice that captures varying degrees of confidence in rules, and a case study demonstrates its usefulness. Further research aims to apply this new tool to engineering practice, including rule extraction, fuzzy decision-making, and intelligent control.
