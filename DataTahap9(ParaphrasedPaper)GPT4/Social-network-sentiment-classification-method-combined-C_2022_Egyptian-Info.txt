Machine learning and text analysis algorithms can be used to categorize text as expressing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. In a world where expressing opinions online is commonplace, understanding public sentiment can benefit various fields like market research and customer experience analysis.

To enhance sentiment classification for Chinese text, a novel method involving graph convolutional networks (GCN) is proposed. GCN was initially developed for non-Euclidean data in social networks and has progressed to applications in image detection and user recommendations. It treats words and documents as nodes, linked by co-occurrence, and considers classification as a node classification task.

The paper introduces a model combining bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) for extracting word features and GCNs based on syntactic dependency trees to determine emotional polarity. By combining the extracted features with a syntactic dependency tree and pooling the information, this model aims to improve the accuracy of sentiment classification.

Using the DTGRU model resulted in a 4.45% increase in accuracy and a 3.71% increase in macro_F1 score over baseline models. This confirms the model's effectiveness in leveraging grammatical information and long-term word dependencies. Models such as CNN and RNN, including learning mechanisms like LSTM and GRU, have previously been used for sentiment analysis; this paper builds on these by introducing a syntactic dependency approach to better capture the emotional characteristics of Chinese texts.

For Chinese text, which typically lacks spaces, tools like Jieba are used for word segmentation. To tackle issues like long-distance word dependencies and vanishing gradients, the DTGRU model uses Bi-GRU to establish a connection between the previous and next states of words.

The paper establishes a large-scale Chinese sentiment analysis dataset through microblog data, dividing it into an 80-20 split for training and testing. The DTGRU model outperformed traditional single-neural network models, showing that integrating LSTM with CNN improves sentiment analysis but requires further enhancement.

The DTGRU model created in this research not only provides a framework for Chinese sentiment analysis but could also, with appropriated corpus and tagging, extend to other languages, offering deeper emotional understanding across different contexts.

Finally, the paper suggests the DTGRU model could be extended to include more nuanced sentiment categories and applied to other tasks like user intent mining and fake opinion detection, with future work aimed at further refining the model and broadening its applicability.
