The Coq proof assistant is a tool that realizes the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, enriched with both inductive and coinductive types, enabling the effective manipulation of different kinds of final coalgebras such as streams and infinite trees. It facilitates the definition of algebraic structures on real numbers.

Coq's specification language mirrors the structure of typed programming languages, which offer basic types and means to define new inductive types via constructors like 0 and S for natural numbers. Coinductive types in Coq also use constructors, and there's an emphasis on their relationship with destructors, especially in the context of pattern matching, underscoring a duality with inductive types.

Recursive functions are natural when operating on inductive types. In Coq, they must be structurally recursive to ensure termination, which is a cornerstone of its type theory.

However, with coinductive types, the concepts of productivity and guardedness come into play, analogous to termination and structural recursion. Despite their utility, these conditions can restrict the formalization of certain productive functions.

The paper presents a method for separating inductive from coinductive components in the definition of productive coinductive values in Coq, discussing the inductive character via ad-hoc predicates and the coinductive character through repeatability of certain predicates.

The paper overviews the modeling of inductive and coinductive types and utilizes examples, particularly focusing on how infinite data types like expression trees have been employed in formal proofs, such as in real number arithmetic.

Productivity is discussed, with a computational rather than domain-theoretic perspective, presenting a slight variation from past definitions. The paper discusses the relevance of productivity and termination.

Guardedness is explored as a sufficient condition for productivity, employing accessibility predicates to characterize inputs where algorithms terminate. The issue of guardedness breaching, potentially causing functions to be excluded in Coq, is acknowledged. The paper provides solutions like modifying conventional predicates to ensure guarded recursion.

Finally, the paper revisits techniques for modeling filter functions on streams and other types in Coq. It elucidates on automating parts of this technique and plans for future work to clearly describe the class of functions it applies to and develop steps for producing models and proofs in Coq.

The authors aim to provide a clearer understanding of the steps required to implement these techniques and advance the implementation as a program that models a given function and its key properties within Coq, anticipating future developments in this area.
