The study of nurse rostering has been extensive since the 1970s, with early research utilizing classic and exact approaches from mathematical programming. Metaheuristic methods became prominent in the 1990s, incorporating techniques like tabu search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and other strategies. Despite these advancements, constraint programming has been a key method in solving complete search problems within nurse rostering, nonetheless, practical applications in real healthcare scenarios remain scarce.

This paper investigates a real-world nurse rostering situation in mid-sized Chilean healthcare facilities, examining three clinics and four hospitals to capture the primary characteristics of such centers in terms of size, organization, and nursing staff. The nurse rostering problem is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with a combination of hard and soft constraints and is addressed using constraint programming (CP) algorithms and the JaCoP solver. This study aims to enhance practical understanding and research into nurse rostering issues.

The Chilean healthcare centers employ a distinct "fourth shift" system, which is different from the conventional 8-hour shifts found in most hospitals and research. This system consists of two 12-hour shifts: a day shift (08:00 to 20:00) and a night shift (20:00 to 08:00 the next day).

To accommodate staff preferences, soft constraints are used. Senior nurses, for example, may express scheduling preferences. Given that standard CP solvers do not inherently support soft constraints, they are modeled using reified constraints, which essentially allow for the maximization of preference satisfaction, illustrated through an example with three preferences related to specific nurse schedules.

The paper elaborates on the technical implementation, specifying the array and variables used to calculate and maximize the sum of preferences within the JaCoP solver. This approach effectively turns the CSP into an optimization problem that seeks to maximize preference satisfaction by inversely minimizing a 'cost' variable, conforming to JaCoP's minimization requirement.

In conclusion, this study offers a model that adapts to an unusual shift pattern and accounts for nurse preferences in mid-sized Chilean healthcare centers, turning the rostering challenge into an optimization problem. Rosters were created in approximately 20 minutes for a nursing staff of 40. The paper suggests that the approach could be scaled for larger healthcare settings with more complex soft constraints, with future research potentially exploring metaheuristics and autonomous search methods.
