This paper introduces an optimization algorithm for radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) termed as Hybrid Adaptive Mutation Particle Swarm Optimization (HAMPSO). The method is intended to enhance the training of RBF neural network structures, specifically targeting application in object localization. HAMPSO employs a dynamic adaptation strategy that incorporates both uniform and Gaussian distribution mutations to avoid becoming trapped in local minima and to accelerate convergence to the global optimum during the iterative training process.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the new HAMPSO-RBF approach, the authors compare it with traditional RBF networks, as well as RBF networks optimized with genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results show that the HAMPSO-RBF not only converges faster but also offers superior predictive performance.

The research underscores that while radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) can be successfully used for target localization, optimizing their structure remains a challenge. The novel HAMPSO approach proposed in this paper not only demonstrates its viability for RBFNNs but also shows its superiority over PSO-RBFNNs and GA-RBFNNs through various computational experiments.

In conclusion, the paper suggests that the HAMPSO method, when applied to the RBF neural network for target localization, outperforms existing approaches in terms of efficiency. The promising results imply that the HAMPSO-RBF method has the potential to be adapted for other scientific applications beyond the scope of just target localization.
