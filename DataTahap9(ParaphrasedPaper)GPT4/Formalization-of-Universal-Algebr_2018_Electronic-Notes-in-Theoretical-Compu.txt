This academic paper discusses how the algebraic constructs of subalgebras, quotients, and epimorphisms (which are surjective homomorphisms) are interconnected through the three fundamental isomorphism theorems. While there is a slight complexity in encoding subalgebras, the derivations closely mirror traditional proofs on paper. Additionally, for establishing these theorems, the authors have defined essential concepts like the kernel of a homomorphism and the homomorphic image.

The paper also explores the notion of morphisms amongst signatures, which is pertinent to how one can interpret the concept of similarity types within universal algebra. This has been a subject of significant scholarly discussion. The idea was originally introduced by Fujiwara, who described this relationship as mappings between algebraic systems. Janssen referred to it as polynomial derivors, leaning on the terminology of the adjoint group, while Mossakowski and colleagues used the term "derived signature morphism." This term signifies a broadened perspective on the more narrowly defined signature morphisms found within the theoretical framework known as institutions.
