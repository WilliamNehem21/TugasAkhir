Overall, thermophilic bacteria, which are adapted to high temperatures, remain underexplored due to the challenges of isolating and maintaining pure cultures. They possess considerable biotechnological potential due to their stable enzymes such as amylases, proteases, lipases, xylanases, and DNA polymerases, which are resistant to harsh conditions like high temperatures, extreme pH, and salinity.

This study was undertaken to investigate the bacterial community in Hammam Pharaon, a geothermal vent located in South Sinai, Egypt, known for being a tourist spot. Researchers aimed to characterize the bacterial isolates from Hammam Pharaon morphologically, molecularly, and based on their fatty acid profiles. They also aimed to assess their biotechnological potential by examining their abilities to break down starch, cellulose, fats, and proteins.

The bacteria were isolated from water samples collected in sterile containers and soil samples. Water mineral content was analyzed using standard methods. The bacterial community was cultured in Zobell marine broth and identified through a combination of morphological assessment, growth conditions, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Researchers used a central composite design (CCD) to identify the optimal growth conditions for each bacterial strain, focusing on pH and temperature. Strains were cultured under these conditions, and the resulting biomass was collected for characterization. Three identified strains were described: HM101 (cream-white, gram-positive), HM102 (greasy orange, gram-negative bacilli), and HM103 (greasy yellow, gram-negative rods).

The study found that the bacterial strains had high concentrations of saturated fatty acids, with each strain showing a different fatty acid profile. The content and composition of these fatty acids differed slightly from those of mesophiles (which prefer shorter-chain fatty acids) or thermophiles (which prefer longer-chain fatty acids), pointing to unique adaptations of the local isolates.

A comprehensive literature review suggested that each species has its niche, affecting its cellular structure and, in particular, its cell membrane lipids which are key to survival under specific conditions. Temperature influences lipid types, unsaturation levels, and membrane fluidity, with cells unable to grow at temperatures below their lipid solidification point. The study concluded that fatty acid characteristics—such as unsaturation, chain length, branching, and cyclization—are critical to the adaptability of thermophiles to their environments. While the types of fatty acids change between moderately and extremely thermophilic bacteria, none displayed hydroxy, cyclopropane, or unsaturated fatty acids, indicating a distinction in the lipid profiles of these hot-environment dwellers.
