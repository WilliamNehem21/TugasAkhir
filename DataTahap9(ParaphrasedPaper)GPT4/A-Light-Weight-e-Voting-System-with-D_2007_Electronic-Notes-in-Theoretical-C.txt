Recent advancements in digital life, such as e-commerce, e-democracy, and e-government, have highlighted e-voting as an area of continuous research. There is a growing sentiment that traditional paper-based voting with ID verification is becoming outdated. Problems have emerged from mechanical voting machines, centralized result collection, and human errors in vote counting, as seen in the United States during the presidential election of 2000. These issues have spurred the development and testing of electronic voting systems in various countries.

An analysis of commercial e-voting systems in the US shows that many of them rely on "security through obscurity," an approach regarded as inadequate since it often misapplies cryptography and leaves potential backdoors for attackers.

The paper outlines key electronic voting solutions, cryptographic elements such as zero-knowledge proofs and secure secret sharing schemes, and a novel authentication protocol that offers revocable anonymity. The proposed protocol is described in detail, followed by a comprehensive analysis of its computational and communication complexity and its security features. The paper concludes with suggestions for potential improvements to the protocol.

Mix networks (mixnets) and Dining Cryptographer networks (DC-nets) are discussed as means of anonymizing the distribution of voting credentials. A mixnet disrupts the traceability of messages by random redistribution by a trusted party. Both methods were introduced by David Chaum.

The paper touches on the use of anonymous bulletin boards in voting systems, where voters can securely post their votes, and on the role of proofs to confirm the validity of votes. These proofs can either be interactive or non-interactive.

Practical systems are being experimented with in Switzerland and Portugal. Swiss cantons like Geneva and Neuchatel have developed internet voting systems, while Zurich is working on mobile voting. Portugal's REVoting System (REVS) uses blind signatures and is an evolution of the eVox system. The paper outlines approaches for dealing with communication failures, server issues, and secure voter authentication.

The proposed protocol aims to ensure anonymous yet efficient authentication for users and service providers, with the ability to revoke anonymity under certain conditions by cooperating entities. It involves multiple independent parties: a trusted third party (TTP), an organization (O), a trusted authority within the organization (TAO), a service provider (SP), and a user (U), who is a member of the organization.

Assumptions include trust in the TA to validate credentials, the mix to not correlate voters with credentials, and the counter to accurately tally votes and publish verification proofs. Each party is considered independent and trusted not to collude.

The paper describes the process and assures that the size of data per voter is relatively small, ensuring efficient operation even with a large number of participants. It argues that the protocol is sound, as it is difficult for adversaries to forge credentials or manipulate results without collaboration among the authorities. It is robust because non-participating voters do not affect the election outcome, and it is scalable, allowing hierarchical structures with agent triples and the possibility of using a single secret for multiple users and employing multiple mix and counter agents.

In summary, the paper presents practical and secure electronic ballot solutions that incorporate cryptographic techniques like blind signatures or public keys for encryption in voting scenarios.
