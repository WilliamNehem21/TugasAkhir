The paper discusses the significance of counting blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, as a means of detecting various health symptoms and disorders such as weakness, fatigue, bruising, and diseases like anemia, infection, leukemia, and malaria. Blood cell counts are typically performed either automatically, using machines like hematology analyzers or flow cytometry, or manually under a microscopeâ€”which is common in developing countries and can be laborious and prone to error, potentially leading to incorrect diagnoses and treatments.

In developing countries, automatic blood cell counting devices are often prohibitively expensive and lack the capability to reveal cellular structures critical for diagnosing certain blood disorders. However, recent advances allow for counting blood cells by analyzing microscopic images with image processing software on computers or smartphones. This technological development offers both structural information and cell counts and can be particularly beneficial in low-resource settings.

Image acquisition is an essential first step in this diagnostic process. High-quality images obtained from a smartphone camera attached to a microscope can facilitate effective blood cell detection. An application that guides this process was developed and demands a minimum resolution, achievable with a 4-megapixel camera.

The paper describes a user interface created with MATLAB R2013a, allowing users to capture images and videos using the mobile camera. This interface also enables the handling of previously stored visual data and the ability to automatically send emails.

Initially developed to work on computers, the system was adapted to run on smartphones, expanding its utility for point-of-care applications. By converting MATLAB GUIs to Android apps, the technology has been successfully tested on a mobile phone with similar results to those obtained on a computer.

Beyond diagnostics, the system serves as an educational tool for laboratory technicians and supports research by facilitating the remote transmission of microscopic images and videos, which is particularly useful when infrastructure for Internet access is limited.

The paper highlights a smartphone telepathology system designed for counting blood cells and diagnosing malaria that is rapid, cost-effective, and accurate for use in low-resource settings. The system is praised for being user-friendly, capable of implementing even with minimal infrastructure, and able to recognize and count overlapping cells, thus enhancing healthcare delivery and educational opportunities in places like Ethiopia where Internet access is scant but mobile coverage is more common.
