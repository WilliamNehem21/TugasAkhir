Our definition's initial case aligns perfectly with the corresponding case found in the referenced paper and proves beneficial in our arguments, especially while addressing issues with bf. The second case extends the related definition in that same paper but now factors in the nuances that arise within the novel fuzzy context due to analogous terminologies. This particular case will be utilized in the examination of bv and bc scenarios, which will be demonstrated in the upcoming proof of our first theorem.
