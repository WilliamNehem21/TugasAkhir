The academic paper asserts a unique relationship between game plays in the free-running game (denoted FR) and the state sequences of the raw game (R), where each play in FR corresponds directly to a run in R. However, in the case of the threadlike game (denoted TR), this correspondence occurs between plays and a subset of constrained runs. It is evident that the FR game possesses a greater variety of strategies compared to the number of states available in R.

To demonstrate this concept, a calculation is performed that projects the outcomes into all three hypothetical components, resulting in three possible plays in the FR game: R, R', and R''. The play R comprises an interwoven sequence of moves from R' and R'', with a potential additional move at the conclusion. If R contains this extra move, it is replicated as the response to the threadlike game (T); conversely, if the extra move exists in one of the sequences R' or R'', that move is duplicated instead. It's important to note that the ability to replicate this move is predicated on the certainty that the necessary move is available in the free-running game, which underscores the importance of understanding the unique characteristics of these game types.
