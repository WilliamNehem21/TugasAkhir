A summary of the provided text might read as follows:

Plants are extensively used globally as natural remedies, treating up to 87% of human diseases, including infections, cancer, and various disorders. Historically, a significant number of commercially available drugs for both curable and incurable diseases have been derived from approximately 3,000 plant species identified with medicinal properties. People from both developed and developing nations rely heavily on plant-based treatments for primary healthcare, with over 80% depending on such herbal remedies. The Arabian Gulf region, particularly, has a rich tradition of using herbal medicines, which has prevailed until recently as the primary form of healthcare in both urban and rural settings, with Oman hosting around 1,204 terrestrial plant species reputed for their traditional medicinal use. Contemporary pharmacopoeia continues to incorporate botanical ingredients, signifying ongoing importance in the development of new medicinal compounds.

The study used various solvents, reagents, and standards from different suppliers to investigate the medicinal properties of plants. It applied the disk diffusion assay to evaluate antibacterial activity, highlighting that organic solvent extracts tend to be more effective due to the hydrophobic nature of many antimicrobial compounds, rendering them insoluble in water.

In particular, the study observed that the chloroform extract of the plant Antirrhinum majus showed strong antioxidant activity, likely from polyphenolic content, when tested with the DPPH method. The seed extracts demonstrated the ability to inhibit bacterial growth, particularly against E. coli and S. aureus, and the chloroform and hexane extracts exhibited cytotoxic effects against Artemia cysts, which increased with concentration. These findings suggest that the plant examined could serve as a source for new antibacterial drugs, offering a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics.
