This academic paper summarizes the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) model combined with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to model and optimize the performance of an inclined plate seed metering device in achieving 100% seed-cell fill. The study developed an ANN model to predict seed-cell fill based on experimental data and integrated the model with a PSO algorithm to find the optimal device operating parameters.

Experimental trials were conducted by varying one independent parameter at a time (such as forward speed) while keeping others constant. The number of seeds delivered by the device was counted across ten revolutions, with the cell fill percentage calculated. This data was used to train the ANN, adjusting the network's weights to minimize the mean squared error between predicted and actual cell fill values.

In the paper, the ANN model's predictive performance is verified through a confirmation test, showing excellent agreement with the experimental data, indicating the model's reliable generalization capability. The addition of the PSO algorithm helped move towards the goal of minimizing an objective function that, in practice, maximized the cell fill to 100% within the constraints of the device's parameters.

The results of the study indicated that the proposed integrated ANN-PSO intelligent optimization approach is not only applicable to the inclined plate seed metering device but could also be utilized to determine the optimal operating parameters for other agricultural machinery. This suggests a broader potential for the use of this technique in optimizing process parameters for precision seeding technologies and other agricultural processes, setting grounds for further research in this area.
