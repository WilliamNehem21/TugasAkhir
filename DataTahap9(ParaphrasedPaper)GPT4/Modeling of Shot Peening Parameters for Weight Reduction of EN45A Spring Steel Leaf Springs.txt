This academic paper addresses the enhancement of fatigue strength in materials, particularly focusing on improving the fatigue life of EN 45A spring steel leaf springs used in automotive vehicles through shot peening. Shot peening induces a compressive residual stress field on the surface layer of the material, which has been found to differ based on the intensity of peening. This variance in the relaxed residual stress field has a direct impact on the weight of the leaf springs.

The study presents an experimentally developed stress approach model that aims to reduce the weight of leaf springs while simulating industrial conditions. It introduces a time-efficient and reliable method for predicting the thickness and weight of leaf springs subjected to different shot peening intensities, thus catering to industrial needs. A model derived from experimental data is put forth, which can forecast the potential weight reduction in leaf springs for specified stress levels under varying shot peening scenarios.

Building upon the discourse in manufacturing engineering, Vinkel Arora et al., 2011, suggest the use of computer-aided design (CAD) modeling of leaf springs in CATIA, with analyses conducted in ANSYS for various design parameters and loading conditions. They emphasize the role of computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools as a cost-effective and time-saving alternative to physical experiments. However, the paper also acknowledges a range of errors that can accompany CAE predictions.

Cyclic stress testing following ASTM specifications was conducted using axial fatigue-testing machinery, establishing S/N (stress-number) curves by the standards outlined by Aggarwal et al., 2005. The leaf springs were further tested on a lab rig to calculate bending stress, employing formulas from Aggarwal et al., 2006. A static stress of 432 MPa was administered to the springs using a hydraulic ram, with the limits of hydraulic actuators adjusted for an alternating load and a stress ratio of 0.5. The specimens, both unpeened and shot-peened with various intensities, displayed increments in fatigue life after each treatment.

To explore the resilience of the induced residual stresses, additional tests were carried out. It was revealed through these tests and X-ray diffraction measurements that the compressive residual stress field (CRSF) undergoes relaxation after a defined number of fatigue cycles, attributed to micro-crack initiation and propagation. The extent of relaxation in CRSF correlates with the reduction in the fatigue life of the material.

Overall, the paper suggests that shot peening can be a beneficial method to improve the fatigue life of materials by creating favorable residual stresses on their surface, and it highlights the development of predictive models and the use of CAE tools to enhance the design and assessment of leaf springs in the automotive industry.
