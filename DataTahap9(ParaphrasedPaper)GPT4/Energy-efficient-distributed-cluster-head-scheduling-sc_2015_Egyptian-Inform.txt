The paper describes a system consisting of a large number of small wireless sensor nodes and a base station (BS), with each sensor node featuring a sensor, processor, memory, radio frequency (RF) transceiver, peripherals, and a battery. These nodes are dispersed across an area to detect events and collect data on various environmental conditions in real-time.

A well-known hierarchical routing protocol called Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is used to efficiently transmit this data to the base station. LEACH conserves energy by forming the nodes into clusters and operates in rounds, each with a setup phase and a steady-state phase. During the setup phase, nodes randomly decide whether to become a cluster head (CH) if a randomly chosen number is less than a threshold value T(n). This ensures that the role of the CH is rotated among nodes in the cluster to distribute energy consumption.

A CH must perform three duties: collect data from its cluster nodes and aggregate it, generate a TDMA schedule to allocate transmission times to each node, and send the aggregated data to the BS or a nearby CH. To prevent a single CH from depleting its battery quickly, leadership is periodically transferred in a systematic manner. The paper proposes a new CH selection method for a two-tiered wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture, factoring in the nodes' residual energy and communication distance.

Different from existing methods that used mathematical coordinates to estimate distance, this paper sets up an experiment to measure the real-time distance between sensor nodes using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values. RSSI values, which can be measured by most IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.4 radios, provide an estimate of the power of received radio signals.

The paper also discusses LEACH-Centralized (LEACH-C), a variant of LEACH with a centralized cluster head selection algorithm managed by the base station, and HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed Clustering), a protocol that selects CHs based on residual energy without requiring infrastructure or special node capabilities.

The paper is structured as follows: related work is discussed in Section 2, the network model and proposed Distributed Cluster Head Selection (DCHS) mechanism are detailed in Section 3, the experimental setup and results are presented in Section 4, and conclusions and future work are provided in Section 5.

The paper also mentions research by Jung et al. on a cluster-based energy-efficient forwarding scheme and work by Akhtar et al. on an RSSI-based energy-aware intracluster routing technique, with the latter achieving up to 17% increased energy efficiency in simulations.

Lastly, the paper describes the implementation of a real-time experimental setup to estimate the distance between sensor nodes using RSSI and integrating this into the simulation to validate the proposed DCHS scheme. The base station uses RSSI to elect cluster heads in both primary and secondary tiers, aiming to minimize transmission distances. The performance is evaluated through a real-time experiment and simulations, integrating RSSI measurements to assess the proposed system.
