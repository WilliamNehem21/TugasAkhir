Fungal keratitis is a major cause of severe eye damage and blindness globally, particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. In Egypt, there is evidence of rising incidences in line with regional climate changes, such as increased temperatures and humidity.

In less economically developed countries, microscopic examination of corneal scrapings remains the most practical and swift means for detecting fungal infections in the eye. Consequently, there's an urgency to determine a staining technique that is quick, simple, and highly sensitive for diagnosing fungal keratitis within a clinical environment.

Methylene blue (MB), a common clinical dye and staining agent, has been traditionally used to identify various disease conditions including gonorrhea, early and metastatic cancer, as well as precancerous and early-stage gastric cancers. Preliminary research suggests that MB is promising for rapid and effective diagnosis of fungal keratitis. The present study seeks to verify the success of MB staining for prompt identification of fungal keratitis and compare its detection rate, sensitivity, and specificity with those obtained using 10% KOH smears and calcofluor white (CW) staining.

Upon identifying fungal filaments in corneal scrapings through microscopy, all patients are promptly commenced on topical antifungal therapy with amphotericin B at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. This medication, initially an intravenous formulation, is diluted in distilled water and administered as hourly eye drops for one week, followed by application every two hours for three weeks, with a gradual decrease in frequency based on the disease's activity until the ulcers are resolved. For cases unresponsive to medication, additional surgical interventions, which may include therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (PK), anterior chamber washouts with amphotericin B, or evisceration, are considered necessary.
