In the realm of machine learning, dimensionality reduction (DR) methodologies aim to trim the feature set of original high-dimensional (HD) data. By decreasing the feature count to a manageable number like two, researchers can produce low-dimensional (LD) representations suitable for visual inspection. DR techniques are widely employed across various disciplines, such as psychology, where multidimensional scaling (MDS) is utilized for data exploration or hypothesis testing, and principal component analysis (PCA), known for its visualization capabilities, especially when retaining the primary components.

This paper introduces IXVC, a process outlined from Section 2 through Section 9, which elucidates DR visualizations by emphasizing dimensions and clusters. Section 3 emphasizes the importance of explaining visual clusters, which leads to the presentation of IXVC in Section 3.2. Section 4 demonstrates a practical tool employing IXVC alongside application examples. Subsequent sections detail a user-based experiment evaluating the aforementioned pipeline and tool, critically examine IXVC's constraints, chart the course for future research, and ultimately summarize the work.

Nonlinear DR (NLDR) poses a challenge in rendering HD feature contributions to reduced dimensions interpretable due to typically unavailable parameters within the transformation. Researchers like Coimbra et al. and Cavallo and Demiralp have suggested methods to visually represent feature contributions in 2D. Coimbra et al. also propose axis legends for NLDR inspired by curved biplot axes, and Turkay et al. developed dual-view interactive DR analysis tools.

Clustrophile 2 is an example that combines DR techniques with clustering algorithms to visualize and elucidate HD clusters by offering heatmaps and decision trees as explanatory tools. However, its focus lies on explaining clustering algorithms in HD, not the HD-to-2D mapping process generated by DR methods.

Regarding visual clusters, experts generally provide explanations, injecting subjectivity and potential bias. Da Silva et al., Kandogan, and Rauber et al. propose means to rank HD features' relevance to cluster formation, while Parisot et al. describe a method using an evolutionary algorithm to preprocess datasets, aiming for easier clustering interpretation.

The work outlined in this paper builds around the concept that whenever visual clusters are chosen, a corresponding decision tree is constructed, predicting cluster affiliation based on HD features. Through this interactive environment, users can iterate upon their cluster selections, refining their decision tree explanation, and thus deepening their comprehension of the DR visualization.

The paper argues that IXVC facilitates an objective approach to analyzing DR visualizations by revealing how visual clusters correlate with the HD features that generated the visualization. The effectiveness and utility of IXVC were confirmed through a user-based evaluation involving participants with a background in DR and decision trees.
