This academic paper examines the comparison of common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) noise in the context of electromagnetic interference (EMI). It notes that CM noise often has a more significant impact on EMI than DM noise due to the interaction between circuit lines and ground, alongside the non-zero equivalent series resistance (ESR) of capacitors that contribute to DM noises. The literature indicates that CM noise is typically much more prevalent than DM noise, which makes it more critical to address when studying EMI concerns.

The paper then shifts focus to discuss the efficiency of DC-DC converters, especially highlighting the Double Active Bridge (DAB) converters that play a significant role in high-power applications. Despite their importance, DAB converters are complicated by their 8-switch control structure and tend to have high EMI levels because of their output capacitance values. The control of DAB circuits can be managed using various phase shift modulation methods, namely single phase shift (SPS), dual phase shift (DPS), extended phase shift (EPS), and triple phase shift (TPS) modulation. Although SPS is commonly noted in the literature, TPS remains important for achieving efficiency and more nuanced control. It has been observed that using SPS with DAB circuits can result in higher EMI compared to circuits with different topologies.

Notably, the paper underscores an absence of analysis in the literature regarding the impact of phase shift modulation techniques on EMI. These techniques are deemed crucial as they offer the potential to reduce EMI without the need for additional hardware changes, such as gate drive control adjustments or the design of EMI filters. This study specifically analyzes the effects of SPS and DPS methods on EMI in a uniform DAB circuit.

Two different DAB circuits using Silicon (Si) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs rated at 1 kW with 80 V output voltages were designed for this research. The circuits were controlled separately using SPS and DPS modulation techniques. Their performance was initially simulated using the LTspice program, followed by experimental EMI analysis. The paper elaborates on the design of these four DAB circuits and compares their operational parameters such as leakage inductance current, input power, power loss, and efficiency. It also investigates the EMI of the designed circuits.

The study also mentions specific electrical parameters optimized for soft switching in the circuit designs, but notes that soft switching may not always minimize losses. When comparing current waveforms and root mean square (RMS) values between two circuit types, it was evident that the average current due to leakage inductance was higher in one circuit type, which led to a sawtooth current waveform and higher peak values. This is likely to increase the stress on switching elements due to the EMI produced by parasitic components. Consequently, it was anticipated that this circuit type would exhibit higher EMI levels.

The findings and comparisons presented in this paper related to phase shift modulation techniques and their influence on EMI are supported by references to relevant works in the field.
