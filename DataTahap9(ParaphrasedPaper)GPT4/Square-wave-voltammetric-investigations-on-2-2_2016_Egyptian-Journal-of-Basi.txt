The original text appears to discuss the chemical analysis of azomethine compounds and the identification of specific structural features through electrochemical and spectrophotometric methods. Here is a paraphrased version:

The research focused on characterizing the azomethine group's chemical nature. Data from polarographic analysis, along with acid-base dissociation constants (pKa values), were obtained via spectrophotometry to inform the study. Through this investigation, a proposed mechanism for the reduction process was outlined. It was confirmed that the azomethine group is present in its azo form, particularly because of the presence of a nitro group on the para position (p-NO2).

The key observation highlighted is the change in the electrochemical reduction potential of the nitro group, referred to as the 6-electron reduction wave (wave C), which occurs at a more negative potential compared to the 4-electron reduction wave associated with the azomethine linkage. This distinction is significant as it aids in differentiating between azo or hydrazone tautomeric structures within the azomethine linkage. Previous research on azo compounds with a nitro substituent suggests that the position of the nitro group significantly influences the ability to distinguish between these tautomeric forms.
