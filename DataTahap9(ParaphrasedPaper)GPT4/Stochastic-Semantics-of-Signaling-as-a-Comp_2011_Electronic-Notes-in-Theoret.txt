This academic paper presents a method for representing the generator matrix of a Markov process by using Kronecker sums of individual rate matrices tied to specific automaton views. It establishes a framework for understanding automata without birth events, noting that they are finite due to the limited contexts in which an agent can exist within a rule-set. The paper includes an example related to cellular signaling processes.

The work is structured as follows:

1. Section 2 introduces site graphs, which detail the structure of protein networks and the reaction mixture. It employs a unique data structure called a site graph, which is more intricate than standard graphs and includes nodes with specific attributes including internal state sites and binding sites. The edges are formed between binding sites of two different nodes.

2. Section 3 defines rules and rule-based systems, explaining how each system with initial conditions is given continuous-time stochastic semantics through an Interpreted Labelled Transition System (ILTS). The paper also delineates 'agent-view' and 'population-view' projections within this setting.

The paper uses Kappa, a rule-based language, to build its formalism.

An example is given to illustrate the encoding of site graphs using Boolean variables and to explain the valuation approach, highlighting issues such as well-defined valuations and the avoidance of ambiguity in representing bonds between nodes.

The ILTS is proposed as a way to model rule-based systems semantically, with transitions tagged by the triggering rule and states interconnected by valid interpretations of the rules' conditions.

Finally, due to the exponential growth of the state space in the ILTS model, the paper suggests breaking it down into smaller components, modeling each rule separately and then combining them using a composition operator. This is akin to breaking down the ILTS into smaller ILTS units for each rule and then integrating them to represent the entire system.

The paper, thus, details a complex but structured approach to understanding and modeling biochemical networks, emphasizing the value of discrete automaton representations and the management of large, combinatorially complex systems through a decomposed ILTS modeling technique.
