Traversal strategies, essential for automated processing of complex data, including software artifacts, yield programs vulnerable to unique errors beyond classic type issues. These include infinite traversal, inappropriate data reach, irrelevant outcomes, and unsuitable program components during traversal. We introduce a classification of these errors and suggest improvements for programming with traversal strategies.

Despite these enhancements, traversal strategy programming remains a niche skill. The primary hindrance to its broader adoption is the risk of programming mistakes, many of which are intimidating to new users and impede experienced practitioners.

We focus on finite, fully defined data structures and overlook infinite or partial ones. We present a simplified syntactic model for traversals that signal failures or return values upon successful computations.

Traversal programs with conditionally applied components can encounter issues if one part preempts another, potentially indicating mistakes or non-optimal code.

Misunderstandings of traversal schemesâ€™ success/failure behaviors can lead to incorrect results or unnecessarily complex code. While the flexibility of traversal constituents is occasionally required, maintaining original traversal schemes is crucial, although multiple traversals could substitute complex single-pass strategies, at a potential performance cost.

A strategy is termed "infallible" if it is guaranteed to succeed or run indefinitely. We state that certain strategies, when given an infallible sub-strategy, retain infallibility under specific traversal patterns.

We suggest modifications to strategies' types to reflect infallibility and propose using the HList library in Haskell for managing traversal scheme components as a family with a non-overlapping, ordered list.

We propose advanced traversal scheme annotations or automatic inference of constraints to ensure correctness and potentially eliminate errors through static analysis.

By adopting approaches from known functional programming techniques, we hope to explore the optimization and error prevention of strategic programming. Our aim is to align strategic programming styles closely with high-performance code while minimizing errors through analysis and domain-specific feedback.

In summary, this work outlines the strategic programming of traversals, its challenges, and potential methods to prevent common programming errors, aiming to make strategic programming safer and more accessible.
