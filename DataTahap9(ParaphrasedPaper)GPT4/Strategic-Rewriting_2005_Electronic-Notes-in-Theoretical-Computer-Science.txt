The academic paper discusses the complexity of understanding and implementing strategies in rule-based systems. It states that while single actions are generally simple to understand, the overall semantics of a set of rules can be quite complex, depending on how they are controlled. The paper highlights the importance of designing and studying formalisms to describe various strategies, particularly for the ELAN system, using proof terms of a rewriting logic or a rewriting calculus term. The former is more declarative, while the latter offers a more constructive approach to building the desired derivations.

The paper emphasizes the need to find the most effective ways to describe strategies and combine them, such as modeling probabilistic algorithms and proof methods. The rewriting calculus framework is considered promising due to its detailed expressiveness, including typed extensions of lambda calculus, matching capabilities, deliberate non-determinism, and sophisticated exception and control mechanisms suited for defining strategies finely.

Explicit control in rewriting strategies enables sophisticated analyses to optimize and simplify control and generate efficient code. There is potential for further improvements in how strategic rewriting can benefit from partial evaluations and code generation.

Writing strategies for systems is a difficult task that requires sharing knowledge across different environments, such as PVS and Coq. Theorem proving and verification centers around savvy strategies, and programming with strategic views has proven as effective as dedicated model checkers but with more abstract models.

Strategic programming is a young field but is becoming increasingly relevant as shown by the software like ELAN, Maude, Stratego, or Rogue. It necessitates further research into programming methodologies and broader education in this programming paradigm.

Applications in XML and rule-based systems in various domains such as markets, ecological, industrial, or economic processes highlight the significance of rule-based and strategic programming. In particular, these systems could benefit from explicit strategies for rule activation.

Lastly, the paper considers strategic programming as potentially one of the most effective paradigms for simulating and programming biological entities because of its combined declarative and strategic approach, enabling it to naturally specify concurrency. Early experiences with strategic programming in Maude show promise and suggest a need for further development with a strategy-centric perspective.
