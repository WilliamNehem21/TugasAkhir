In recent years, several computational frameworks have emerged to model different aspects of biological systems. However, a unified framework capable of modeling both time and space in reaction systems, along with a logic for proving properties dependent on these dimensions, is lacking. Current approaches usually involve separate formalisms for modeling biological systems and for expressing and proving their temporal-spatial properties.

Constraint concurrent programming (CCP), known for handling partial information, accumulates constraints as more information becomes available, providing a compact state representation as predicates on system variables. CCP has been previously extended with non-deterministic temporal (ntcc) calculus to model timed biological reactions. Spatial distributions in biochemical reactions have also been modeled using ntcc.

This paper addresses specifying and verifying properties of biochemical systems that display both temporal and spatial characteristics. By using linear logic with subexponentials (SELL), the authors encode the systems and focus on the proof technique rather than the CCP language. They demonstrate that two types of subexponentials can represent the dimensions of time and space in models of biochemical systems, where reactions depend on the location and duration of interactions. The paper introduces an encoding for P-systems, a cell-structure-inspired computation model, demonstrating the logical system's ability to precisely emulate the rules of P-systems and to establish temporal-spatial properties.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews subexponentials in linear logic. Section 3 describes encoding biochemical reactions with temporal and spatial considerations. Section 4 explores how to use the underlying logic to express system properties and how to encode P-systems as SELL specifications. Section 5 compares this work with related research and concludes. Detailed proofs and further applications, such as the tweak-fn14 cell signaling pathway, are found in a companion report.

The authors illustrate their model's properties, showing a one-to-one correspondence between focused derivation steps in the logic and system evolution steps. Focusing discipline for SELL is briefly explained, avoiding more complex proof rules.

Related research highlights differences between this approach and others, such as Hybrid Linear Logic (HyLL), used to express temporal properties of biochemical systems. In contrast, SELL is used here to simultaneously consider temporal and spatial modalities. Quantitative aspects of systems, like molecule concentration, are considered, paralleling previous CCP-based biological system modeling efforts.

Finally, the paper discusses other frameworks like BioNetGen, bioambients, brane logic, and beta-binders, which have used various formalisms like modal logic and statistical model checking to analyze biological systems' properties in terms of spatial and temporal modalities.
