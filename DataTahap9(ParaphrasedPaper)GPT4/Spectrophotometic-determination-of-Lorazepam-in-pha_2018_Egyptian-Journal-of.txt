A new spectrophotometric method using reverse flow injection analysis (RFIA) has been developed for measuring lorazepam (LOR) at microgram levels both in its pure form and in pharmaceutical products. This technique relies on a reaction involving LOR and 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH) with ferric chloride in an aqueous setting. This process results in a water-soluble green product that can be measured at a maximum wavelength of 659 nm.

The method proves to be linear in the range of 2 to 40 µg/mL and 25 to 400 µg/mL of LOR for batch and RFIA procedures respectively, with the batch method having a lower detection limit of 0.61 µg/mL compared to 2.29 µg/mL for the RFIA procedure. Key parameters of the reverse flow system were carefully optimized, which allowed both methods to successfully determine the LOR content in various dosage forms.

Lorazepam, noted for its sedative and anticonvulsant effects, is an affordable and long-acting medication used in several medical scenarios, including pediatric care for patients with conditions like status epilepticus and those requiring mechanical ventilation. It has a shelf life of three years and can be administered through various routes like intravenous, intramuscular, or intranasal delivery.

While previous methods exist for measuring lorazepam, few use flow injection analysis (FIA), and these methods may have limitations regarding specificity or require complex and costly techniques, including extraction or heat. The new methods introduced in this study overcome these constraints, providing a simpler, faster, and more sensitive alternative with a broad range for detection. Importantly, the procedures outlined do not require extraction or heating. Findings from this study underscore the potential of these novel methods for routine quality control in pharmaceutical analysis, as they effectively quantify lorazepam at microgram concentration levels in drug formulations. The research concluded that a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min is optimal, as higher flow rates did not permit adequate mixing time for the reactants in the RFIA setup.
