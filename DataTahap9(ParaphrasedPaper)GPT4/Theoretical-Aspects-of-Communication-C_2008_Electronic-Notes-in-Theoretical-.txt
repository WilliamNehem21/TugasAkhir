This academic paper details the creation of a straightforward and type-preserving Endpoint Projection (EPP) which is both sound and complete according to the original dynamic semantics. This EPP framework, together with related type systems and mappings, will be appended to the WS-CDL 1.0 specification as a supplement and will be featured in an open-source reference implementation of WS-CDL. The paper emphasizes the practical origin of this work, its connection to theoretical foundations, and its reintegration into practical applications, highlighting the beneficial interplay between theory and engineering for both advancing rigorous engineering practices and enhancing theoretical knowledge.

Furthermore, the paper underlines the practical origins of WS-CDL (Web Services Choreography Description Language), developed in response to the need for effectively defining business protocols on the internet. The choreography concept central to WS-CDL is described as orchestrating the interactions between independent web services without requiring a central controller. Specifically, the paper mentions the design choice in WS-CDL where a conditional construct is omitted to maintain the independence of the 'seller' role from the 'buyer's' decisions. This is achieved through an external choice, allowing both 'quoteacc' and 'quotenogood' operations to be proposed simultaneously on a session channel 's', eliminating dependencies between the separate entities involved.
