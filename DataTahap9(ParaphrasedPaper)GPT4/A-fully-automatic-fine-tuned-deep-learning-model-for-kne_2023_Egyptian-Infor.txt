This paper discusses Osteoarthritis (OA), which is a degenerative joint disease caused by the breakdown of cartilage, leading to bone friction, joint pain, and stiffness. It commonly affects knees, hips, and hands, and is diagnosed using symptoms and x-rays, though diagnostic errors are possible.

OA has significant economic impacts, accounting for up to 2.5% of GDP growth in Western countries due to healthcare costs and lost productivity. The aging global population indicates that at least 130 million people will suffer from knee OA (KOA), with over $20 billion in associated healthcare spending.

The paper evaluates various models for detecting OA. The Random Forest (RF) classifier was noted to have a classification accuracy of 73.55% on selected risk factors. McCabe and colleagues developed two validated models, diagnostic and prognostic, for knee OA using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The models were externally validated, with diagnostic performance showing an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 67% on validation data and 75% on test data.

Another approach by Liu and colleagues applied a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and Fast R-CNN for knee joint image classification. Custom loss functions and larger image input sizes improved class imbalance handling and model accuracy, achieving over 78% sensitivity, 94% specificity, and about 0.82 mean average precision.

Further, a full-scale modeling approach was described, where after training, a fine-tuning step using low learning rates on new domain data improved performance. They tested and validated the resulting model on unseen images and ultimately deployed the DenseNet169 model for KOA severity grading and localization.

The paper also provides insights into evaluation metrics, including true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN), as well as the F1-score, which combines recall and precision.

It reports the performance of various models: InceptionResNetV2, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and DenseNet169 across different OA severity classifications, with accuracy ranging widely from about 77% to more than 90%, varying by model and classification level (moderate or severe).
