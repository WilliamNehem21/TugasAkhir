The study introduces an enhanced algorithm called GSPAI-OPT, designed to optimize Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioner computation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This algorithm builds upon previous SPAI methods by combining their strengths and incorporating new techniques, including:

1. A strategy for selecting the optimal thread group size, which may be constant or vary depending on the sparsity of the matrix, to process columns of the preconditioner.
2. The establishment of a parallel framework on the GPU to refine the SPAI preconditioner's performance.
3. The creation of a decision tree to identify the best computing kernel for each component of the preconditioner.

Through tests, GSPAI-OPT has demonstrated its superiority, blending the benefits of two precursor algorithmsâ€”SPAI-Adaptive, which uses a constant thread-group size, and GSPAI-Adaptive, which permits variable thread-group size to address performance issues when there is significant variation in the number of nonzero entries per column. This optimization allows for better performance across diverse matrix sparsity patterns, confirming GSPAI-OPT's effectiveness in large-scale matrix applications.
