The paper discusses an advanced rule structure designed to address structural congruence and reduce complexity in transition system rules. This new approach eliminates the need for dual rules in summation and parallel composition because commutativity laws are integrated into the structural congruence.

The concept of semantic inactivity of a name within an agent is introduced, indicating that from an external perspective, the name does not alter the behavior of the agent. Names that are bound are considered internally active but do not affect the external context. Moreover, certain names are never involved in actions, either because they only participate in internal activities or because they relate to actions that are never executed, hence they are deemed 'inactive names.'

The paper explains that complex agents have the ability to communicate internally and with the external environment without any constraints at the top level of their expression. This means that all actions within the agent's expression are potentially executable, and for agents without restricted names, active names can be determined directly from their expressions.

Five specific rules (R1 to R5) stemming from structural congruence are outlined. Rule R1 simplifies an agent combined with a 'stop' agent to the agent itself. Rule R2 removes a restriction operator if the restricted names do not appear freely in the agent. Rule R3 relates to scope extension, where restrictions are elevated as much as possible without changing the expression's size. Rules R4 and R5 deal with replicated agents, removing redundant components when an agent is composed with an identical replicated copy or with itself. It's important to note that these rules apply specifically because replicated agents are bound by an action, which is not necessarily the case for arbitrary replicated agents.

Even with a new rule (R6), the rewriting system can't remove all inactive actions from expressions. This rule captures cases where actions prefixed to an agent cannot engage with the environment due to name restriction. However, other scenarios may exist where agents are unable to communicate, as illustrated in an example where an agent with a restricted action, which cannot interact with its surroundings or another compound agent, behaves equivalently with or without that action.

The paper also discusses the classification of inactive names into free and bound, with free inactive names appearing only in unengageable actions. Bound inactive names, however, can appear in both engageable and unengageable actions, with the subset of engageable bound names factoring into the determination of active names.

Furthermore, the paper presents rules crafted to eliminate unnecessary subexpressions in agent compositions when a restricted action prevents communication with the context. This extends the rewriting system's capability to address inefficiencies in composed agents.

A prototype implementing the new rewriting system, as well as rules R1 to R7, has been developed, with rule R8 currently being worked on. This system has shown promise in initial testing with simple examples, although no comprehensive performance data has been collected at this time.
