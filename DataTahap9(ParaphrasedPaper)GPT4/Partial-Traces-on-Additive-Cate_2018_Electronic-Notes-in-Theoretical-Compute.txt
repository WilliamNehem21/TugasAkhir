In this academic paper, the authors investigate the concept of partial traces in the context of abelian categories, which are important for understanding categorical semantics in recursion and geometry of interaction (GOI). They specifically explore partial traces on additive and abelian categories, noting that while their findings have no immediate practical applications, they may prove useful in future research.

The main results include the identification of a largest partial trace in every abelian category, achieved by constraining the canonical total trace within a constructed category of objects and relations from the original category. This result extends the kernel-image trace concept in abelian categories.

The structure of the paper includes a preliminary section where the authors discuss symmetric monoidal categories, additive categories, and abelian categories, providing definitions, examples, and properties. Following this, they present examples of partial traces in additive categories and demonstrate the superiority of the Haghverdi-Scott partial trace in certain conditions.

In the results section, they establish that each abelian category has a maximal partial trace and, when the abelian category is semisimple, this maximal trace aligns with the kernel-image trace. The authors remark on the role of regular categories in defining partial traces by leveraging the total trace found in a related category, which possesses a compact closed structure.

They demonstrate that the category of abelian groups and the category of modules over a ring are examples of additive categories, with the category of vector spaces over a field being another notable additive category, especially when restricted to finite-dimensional vector spaces.

The paper acknowledges that the current work is driven more by theoretical curiosities than by immediate application but emphasizes the potential future importance of understanding these traces better. It also includes a technical discussion on the derivation of total traces from compact closed structures within the context of regular categories.
