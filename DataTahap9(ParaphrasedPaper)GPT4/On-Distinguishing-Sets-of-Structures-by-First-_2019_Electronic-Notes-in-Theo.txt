In this academic paper, the authors present an algorithm designed to identify a formula with the minimal number of quantifiers required to differentiate between two sets of structures within any given vocabulary. A key feature of this algorithm is the employment of Hintikka formulas. Given its wide applicability to any finite relational structure, the algorithm's operation is necessarily exponential in time. The algorithm is integrated into a system that learns formulas to describe the rules of board games, which in turn supports its use in identifying reductions. The paper also outlines a modified problem that deals with analyzing samples of classified strings.

Furthermore, the authors discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for strategies that lead to victory in so-called EF games, referring to existing literature. Specifically, they offer new insights into the characterization of winning strategies for players within these games. Leveraging these insights, the authors have crafted an algorithm that produces sentences with minimal quantifier ranking consistent with given samples. For classes such as MS, ES, and DULO, it's been discovered that EF-similarity calculations can be achieved in polynomial time relative to the size of the structures. This finding positions the algorithm's performance as polynomially linked to the sample size, an improvement over previous results for the mentioned classes. The authors anticipate that their findings might be adapted to additional classes like trees and strings equipped with linear order relations.

The paper further discusses a contemporary logical framework based on a model-theoretic perspective found in specific literature, where the problem is addressed with a single structure input and the goal is to find a hypothesis that is a first-order formula or a monadic second-order formula consistent with classified elements. In contrast, the authors' own approach considers multiple structures within a sample and does not fix the quantifier rank, unlike the method discussed.

Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is acknowledged as another logical framework addressing related issues, employing logic programming uniformly for samples and hypotheses. However, due to the fundamental divergences in the methodologies, ILP techniques do not directly translate to the authors' framework.

The authors outline the utility of EF games in reflecting structural similarity, where the presence of non-isomorphic structures leads to a winning strategy for the spoiler within an EF game. The notion of EF-similarity encapsulates such similarity-related information, and for certain vocabularies, it's proven that identifying a spoiler's winning strategy in such games is PSP ACE-complete. However, the paper notes improvements can be achieved for select classes of structures.

By using theorems that define conditions specifying winning strategies for spoilers, the authors are able to formulate distinguishability sentences. These theorems ensure that the characterizing conditions for the spoiler's winning strategies can be represented as first-order sentences that are reasonable in size relative to the structures.

The paper describes the authors' algorithm as producing sentences consistent with a given sample and that it returns a sentence with minimal quantifier rank. Additionally, the runtime of the algorithm is proven to be polynomial with respect to the input sample size.

In conclusion, the authors propose extending their work to other logics, including monadic second-order logic, noting that regular languages are precisely those definable in monadic second-order logic over strings. An algorithm yielding monadic second-order sentences consistent with a string sample may thus contribute to the problem of finding a consistent model of a regular language.
