This academic paper discusses various models for understanding concurrent computation that have been proposed over the years, such as transition systems, asynchronous automata, event structures, Petri nets, and geometric models like cubical sets and higher dimensional automata (HDAs). Although these models are quite different in nature, they are all closely related and focused on capturing specific aspects of concurrent processes.

The paper aims to formally link geometric models with other concurrency models. While it may seem intuitive to relate these models, formalizing the connections reveals subtle distinctions. One key result from the study is that strongly labeled HDAs are particularly suitable for comparison with other common concurrency models. The paper also discusses how certain methods used to manage state-space explosion in concurrency can be viewed through the lens of algebraic topology.

The research includes a categorically framed construction of variants of concurrency models and highlights interesting phenomena observed as a result of these formal relationships. The paper suggests hypotheses about further relationships between different models, specifically, event structures and Petri nets are mentioned as areas for continued research.

One key element of geometric models is the representation of concurrency through cells: a 1-cell represents an event's occurrence, while an n-cell represents a relationship like commutation or independence among the 1-cells of its faces. Labeled precubical sets are introduced to keep track of which instruction in a concurrent process corresponds to a specific event.

The paper also revisits asynchronous automata as generalizations of transition systems and introduces automata with concurrency relations to differentiate between true concurrency and mutual exclusion in actions.

Event structures, introduced to abstract the details of event occurrences in distributed systems, are discussed in relation to HDAs, illustrating their connection with transition systems and independence.

The authors present novel contributions by extending previously established relationships between Petri nets and asynchronous transition systems to a more general adjunction between Petri nets and HDAs. For a meaningful adjunction, the paper restricts attention to strongly labeled HDAs.

Additionally, the paper introduces cubical transition systems (CTS), a general methodology for representing concurrent processes within the framework of cubical sets, and extends it to relate to Petri nets.

The paper provides examples to demonstrate how these concepts work in practice, including a case with 1-bounded nets (nets where a place can either have zero or one token) and how nets derived from HDAs are typically infinite, making them challenging to describe in general cases.

Overall, the paper represents an important milestone in understanding and interrelating various models of concurrency, particularly bringing geometric models into correspondence with more traditional concurrency models and broadening the potential for theoretical advancements in the study of concurrent systems.
