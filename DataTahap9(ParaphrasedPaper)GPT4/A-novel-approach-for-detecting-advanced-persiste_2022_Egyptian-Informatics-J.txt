The article discusses the challenges and current state of detecting and mitigating Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, which remain problematic due to a lack of comprehensive datasets that span the entire lifecycle of these attacks. The paper notes that while artificial intelligence (AI), notably machine learning (ML), has been used to detect APTs, attackers are also using AI to create more sophisticated attacks, which makes detection harder.

The paper's motivation is to improve APT detection by employing machine learning classifiers that recognize APT patterns. It emphasizes the need to analyze APT lifecycle stages to better understand and counteract these threats. To this end, the authors created a new dataset based on Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to facilitate the development of detection methods and penetration testing tools.

APT attackers often use ‘living off the land’ techniques, blending their malicious activity with legitimate network tools to avoid detection. To counter this, the authors propose using machine learning to train models that can detect subtle attack indicators.

Prior research mentioned in the article utilized various ML classifiers and feature selection techniques for intrusion detection, but often with limitations like short data collection periods that do not capture the full scope of APT behavior, or reliance on datasets like NSL-KDD, which are not tailored for APTs and may have their inherent issues.

The authors introduce a multiclass classification approach with ML to distinguish between normal network traffic and several stages of an APT attack. They collected data for four months to simulate realistic network traffic by providing user and admin credentials early in the data collection phase.

Various data sources, including CTI and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, were used to gather pertinent APT attack information. The raw dataset underwent normalization and feature selection, with irrelevant features removed, such as IP addresses and timestamps, to reduce bias and data dimensionality.

Several popular feature selection methods were used, and a cross-combination approach evaluated the efficiency of the feature selection and classification technique. Four ML classifiers were tested: Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost (XGB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), using a newly created dataset.

The proposed XGB model, which utilized the ANOVA feature selection method, achieved notable performance, reaching an accuracy of 99.89% using only 12 out of the 65 features. This high accuracy indicates a well-trained model with a fine-tuned selection of components, leading to low false positive and false negative rates.

In conclusion, the authors suggest that their new dataset and ML-based approach are more reliable for detecting APT attacks compared to existing methods. The innovative model, which employs the XGB classifier with an ANOVA feature selection, considerably outperformed other classifiers and showed superior results, thereby validating the use of their dataset and method for APT detection.
