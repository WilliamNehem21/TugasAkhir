Framework for degrees of completeness have been established at varying echelons, for example, the research by Curien and Obtulowicz on partially complete Cartesian categories, by E. Robinson and G. Rosolini on P-categories, and subsequently by Cockett and Lack on restriction categories.

From a syntactical viewpoint, this work is more nuanced than previous models, which is essential for syntax-dependent processes like rewriting systems. The paper outlines pertinent theories and the creation of classifying categories for these theories. It emphasizes how different conceptions of natural transformations are equivalent to various types of homomorphisms in partial algebras under functorial semantics.

We review canonical notions of categories with partial functions and delve into the foundational theory of unitary categories, discussing the influence of the unitary quotient of a category on the global sections functor—a concept critical to understanding completions in partial algebras discussed in section 4.4.

We examine finite limits as limits within an enriched context, focusing on terminal objects and products without fear of confusion. When a restriction category has a terminal object and binary—or any finite—products, it is considered Cartesian. A restriction functor that preserves this structure is known as a Cartesian functor. We refer to the 2-category of Cartesian restriction categories and functors, alongside lax total transformations, as CartrCatL.

The logic introduced is typed—atomic types are labeled as \(a_0, a_1, \ldots\) or \(a, b, c, \ldots\), with complex types composed of the finite products of atomic types, including the unit type denoted by 1.

In universal algebra's treatment of partial algebras, nomenclature differs. Strict, total homomorphisms are termed "closed," whereas what we call lax total homomorphisms are the standard "homomorphisms."

There are multiple methods for rendering a theory total, either by inserting axioms that ensure that every term \(t\) is equivalent to the empty term or selectively for each function symbol. The resulting theory is denoted tot(T), forming a Cartesian restriction category where all maps are forced total. One should not confuse c[tot(T)] with tot(c[T]), which are quite different despite both involving total maps.

A partial theory \(T\) is unitary if the implications between partial terms are mutually inclusive. A model \(A\) of theory \(T\) in category \(D\) is unitary if, given any terms \(t, s\), the implications are mutually inclusive.

Understanding if a theory is unitary is advantageous when contemplating the completion of a partial model. This concept aligns with definitions available in literature on partial algebras.

Lastly, we explore partial combinatory logic and its classifying category, with a particular focus on the global sections of the generic model. Although definitively addressing rewriting systems on partial terms and their properties, such as confluence and normalization, is reserved for future work, preliminary applications relevant to the paper's content are presented here.
