In the study by J. Wang, K. Shang, X. Guo, X. Xia, and L. Da, the authors introduce an innovative and efficient pretreatment strategy aimed at enhancing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from waste activated sludge during anaerobic fermentation. The pretreatment involves using ferrous iron (Fe^2+) as a catalyst in the presence of peracetic acid (PAA). The paper, published in the Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology, volume 95, issue 3, pages 567-576 in the year 2020, provides insights into the efficacy of this method and its potential benefits for the anaerobic fermentation process.
