The primary concern in designing a high-speed permanent magnet (PM) rotor is ensuring that it operates dependably. As the rotor's speed escalates, the press fit connection between the PM and its housing tends to weaken. Furthermore, due to varying rates of thermal expansion for the PM and its housing, the tightness of this fit can be affected by temperature changes. It is crucial that the contact force between the PM and the housing is sufficiently strong throughout the entire operating speed range to ensure that the PM is able to endure compressive stresses.
