The study highlights that music preferences among listeners can be significantly influenced by the genre, sometimes more so than the music piece itself. Music categorization plays a critical role in how individuals appreciate and comprehend music.

This paper is structured to first provide a summary of existing research on music genre classification techniques in Section 2, which encompasses a discussion of the latest advancements in the field. Section 3 details the methodology proposed by the authors. Section 4 discusses the experiments conducted using various classification strategies, input parameters, and the genres of music that were selected for evaluation. The paper concludes with Section 5, which offers insights and conclusions from the research, pointing to the successful outcomes that encourage further investigation.

McKay and Fujinaga argue for continued advancements in Automatic Music Genre Classification (AMGC), highlighting issues with ambiguity, subjectivity, and the dynamic nature of music styles. They note the extensive expertise and time required for manual classification and the lack of consensus among experts classifying music by genre. With few genres having precise definitions and frequent overlap between them, challenges are aggravated. Additionally, classifications are often based not on individual songs but on artists or albums, with MP3 tag metadata commonly being unreliable. The emergence of new genres and evolving conceptions of existing ones add to the complexity.

Panagakis and Kotropoulos introduced a music genre classification framework that aligns with human auditory perception, using 2D auditory temporal modulations and a sparse representation-based classification system. Their approach achieved unprecedented accuracy on the GTZAN and ISMIR2004 datasets, with results of 91% and 93.56%, respectively.

The paper emphasizes that while there is ample research in this field, most studies focus on timbre, rhythm, pitch content, or combinations thereof. In contrast, the authors' work investigates the use of entropies and fractal dimensions, avoiding reliance on conventional musical information like harmony, melody, and rhythm, instead opting for an approach grounded in information theory.

When training the classification system, using 72 songs, or 30% of the database, resulted in full accuracy. However, even with just 10% of the database used for training, the recognition rates were formidable, ranging between 51.8% and 92.6%. Thus, the findings suggest that while high accuracy can be achieved with a substantial training set, decent classification results can also be produced with a more modest dataset.
