In scholarly terms, a composite of two graphs is known as a bigraph and carries two distinct sets of edges. More broadly, graph-like entities with multiple edge sets are termed multigraphs within the realm of graph theory. However, in modal logics and Kripke semantics, such distinctions are often overlooked, and all such entities are simply referred to as labeled graphs.

This study introduces a novel property termed h-v intransitivity which, when combined with other identified properties, becomes a necessary and sufficient criterion for a finite, connected graph to be a product â€” a claim that is straightforward to prove without the graph being finite or connected. To establish its sufficiency, a two-step demonstration is provided: firstly, showing that the horizontal and vertical sections of a graph fulfilling the five previously mentioned properties adhere to a specific isomorphism, and secondly, that a graph is indeed a product when it demonstrates h-v intransitivity and its sections accord with this isomorphism.

Graph and multigraph products are logical extensions in multi-dimensional modal logics as part of the traditional Kripke semantics. Such products are also employed in practical applications, like expressing characteristics of distributed systems through a multi-dimensional modal logic that utilizes the transitive closure of modal logic products.

The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 delves into the definition of a graph product and its associated properties such as left and right commutativity, and the Church-Rosser properties, along with introducing h-v intransitivity. Section 3 discusses graph decomposition proofs necessary and sufficient for graph product recognition. Section 4 explains the non-modal definability of h-v intransitivity and that no modally definable condition can be both necessary and sufficient for identifying a graph product. Section 5 expands the modal language to include a hybrid language for expressing the h-v intransitivity property.

In summary, the paper establishes the importance of a new property, h-v intransitivity, for determining when a finite, connected graph can be described as a product of other graphs. It demonstrates the limitations of basic modal languages in describing necessary and sufficient conditions for graph products, suggesting a richer language is required to capture these properties.
