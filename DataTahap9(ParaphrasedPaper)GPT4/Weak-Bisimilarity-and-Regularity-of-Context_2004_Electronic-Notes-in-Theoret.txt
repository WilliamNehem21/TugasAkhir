The paper discusses the computational complexity of weak bisimilarity for basic process algebras (BPA), and the state of knowledge regarding its decidability. While weak bisimilarity is known to be decidable for a subclass of BPA, namely totally normed BPA, the general decidability question for BPA remains open. In contrast, weak bisimilarity has been proven undecidable for the broader class of pushdown automata (PDA). 

The authors point out that the proof of undecidability for PDAs, due to Srba, based on a reduction from Minsky 2-counter machines, is not applicable to BPA. This is because BPAs lack the ability to retain control information after a decrease in stack depth—a feature that PDAs possess—although BPAs can encode control states while increasing the stack.

Additionally, the authors mention that a certain number of control states in PDA make weak bisimilarity undecidable and cite an undecidability proof for normed 1-reversal-bounded PDA with just two control states. This proof is notable because the stack-maneuvering involves only one transition from increasing to decreasing mode.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the undecidability of weak bisimilarity for even simpler computational models than PDAs, specifically normed 1-counter machines and one-counter nets (a type of Petri net with only one unbounded place). The expressive powers of one-counter nets/machines and BPA are not directly comparable, however, demonstrating that the domain of undecidability stretches across various computation model types.

Finally, the paper delineates an error set related to the computations of a linear bounded automaton (LBA) and defines its counterpart, the correct set (corr), as the complement of the error set, which depends on the specific automaton (M) in question.
