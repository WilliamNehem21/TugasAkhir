This academic paper describes a feature selection process in which initially, the best-performing single feature (top-1 ranked) is selected from all available features using various feature selection techniques. Thereafter, the model's performance is assessed based on this sole feature. Subsequently, features are added iteratively in the order of their rankâ€”meaning that the second-best feature is added to the model that already includes the top feature, and so on. At each step where a new feature is added, the model's performance is evaluated again to observe how the additional information affects the results. This process continues until the model's performance no longer improves or begins to decline with the addition of more features.

The paper also presents experimental results using a specific wavelength of 778.07 nm, which includes 30 different wavelengths, achieving a classification accuracy of 81.28% when considering a set of 105 wavelengths, and 74.14% for the subset of 30 wavelengths. Among the various feature selection methods tested, Fisher's Criterion was found to be the most effective for selecting wavelengths from the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum for the purpose of classifying healthy and defective mangoes. The findings suggest that Fisher's Criterion can be a valuable tool for selecting optimal wavelength ranges when designing models or devices like NIR cameras that utilize the NIR spectrum for classification tasks.
