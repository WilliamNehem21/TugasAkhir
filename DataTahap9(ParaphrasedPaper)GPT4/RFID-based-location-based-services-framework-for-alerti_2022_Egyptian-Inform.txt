Huang and Gao highlighted that Location-Based Services (LBS) are mobile applications that offer information to users based on their geographical position. Mohammadi and colleagues discussed that these services could be delivered either via a pull mechanism, where users request information, or a push mechanism, where information is automatically sent to users.

Yassin et al. noted that the Global Positioning System (GPS) is the most prevalent technology for outdoor LBS, which often utilizes localization methods like the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) to undertake time, angle, or power measurements to deduce a user's location, according to Ahlawat and others.

For the research, simulations using MATLAB were deployed to evaluate a proposed model with a focus on the Rift Valley region, selected due to it being a frequent site for fatal traffic incidents. It's also a critical area as the main highway from Nairobi to the western part of Kenya and Uganda runs through this region. There's a discrepancy in the reported number of black spots—high-risk traffic areas—in Kenya, with official figures from the Kenya police listing 78 and 12 in the Rift Valley region. However, alternative sources claim there are many more: the Standard Digital Newspaper in 2015 reported about 160, and the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA)'s recent findings indicated 273. Given these inconsistencies, this study chose a dataset of 15 black spots for analysis.

The simulation tested two scenarios to ascertain the performance of the model. In both cases, a vehicle passes through the 15 black spots, receiving alerts to reduce speed and enhance safety; however, not all alerts are received due to potential issues with RFID or GPS performance.

Sauro tells us that system usability can be measured through effectiveness, which depends on how successfully a system performs its intended tasks. Failures result in higher error rates and decreased effectiveness, which can be quantified by the task completion rate, defined as the ratio of successfully completed tasks to the total number attempted.

This research sought to craft a framework to prevent road accidents at black spots, combining GPS and RFID technologies to provide reliable alerts and minimize errors inherent to each system used separately. An in-vehicle audio alert system was found to be preferable over visual cues to avoid visual overload and high cognitive demands.

The core aim of the study was to devise a framework to avert accidents at black spots, and the design and simulation demonstrated that the consistent delivery of alerts is crucial to the effectiveness of LBS in these areas. Analysis of death statistics reiterated that human error largely contributes to road accidents. Therefore, by providing timely and relevant information, LBS could help drivers make better decisions and reduce these errors.
