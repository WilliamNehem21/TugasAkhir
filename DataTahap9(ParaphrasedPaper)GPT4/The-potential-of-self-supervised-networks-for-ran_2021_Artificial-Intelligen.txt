In this paper, we explore how the Noise2Void (N2V) workflow, previously applied to natural images and microscopy data, can be adapted for processing seismic signals which are characterized by highly oscillatory patterns and pseudorandom noise. Through detailed hyper-parameter analysis, we determine the best settings for improving seismic data quality, taking into account both immediate enhancements in the image domain and longer-term benefits for subsequent applications like seismic inversion. The study also demonstrates the power of N2V by applying it to real field data.

We delve into the performance of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as loss functions for deep learning in seismic applications, supplying a mathematical framework in Appendix 1 to guide the choice between them. However, we acknowledge the lack of theoretical assurance when facing correlated noise and opt to test both loss functions empirically.

Our findings suggest that while other hyper-parameters have a significant impact, the batch size appears to have a minimal effect. The optimal hyper-parameter combination is determined by summing the ranks for each set across all scoring metrics.

When training on a clean dataset, it is certain that the resulting images will be free of noise artifacts. Yet, the challenge lies in creating synthetic data that accurately represents field conditions, as there's no surety that networks trained on these data will perform well on actual field data. Laine et al. (2019) introduced a blind-spot network technique that matches or surpasses supervised denoising methods for naturally occurring images with additive Gaussian noise. Future studies will assess when self-supervised learning networks might surpass networks trained on synthetic seismic data and when the opposite might be true.

Finally, we express our gratitude to A. Krull, T.-O. Buchholz, and F. Jug for making their TensorFlow implementation of Noise2Void available, and we acknowledge the supercomputing resources provided by the Supercomputing Laboratory at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.
