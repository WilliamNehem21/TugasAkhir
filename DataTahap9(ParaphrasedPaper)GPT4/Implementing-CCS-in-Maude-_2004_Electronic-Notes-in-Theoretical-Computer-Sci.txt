The paper presents a detailed approach for adapting the operational semantics of the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) in the Maude language, where semantical transitions are modeled as rewrite rules, and inference rules are represented as conditional rewrite rules with rewrites in their conditions. Utilizing Maude 2.0's new capabilities, the authors implement both the regular and weak transition semantics for CCS, along with Hennessy-Milner modal logic to describe process behaviors.

The CCS syntax is defined in Maude with a notable difference: non-constant operators are set as frozen, a new feature in Maude 2.0, allowing more precise control over the rewriting process. The paper also introduces a contextual module to handle process definitions with potential recursion.

Two main challenges within the framework are addressed: handling new variables in rule premises that do not appear in their conclusions, and managing nondeterminism where multiple rules could apply. The first issue is solved using explicit metavariables, ensuring variables are bound to specific values when needed. The second challenge involves a general search strategy implemented in the metalevel that navigates possible rewrites to find a correct CCS transition.

The paper extends the implementation to cover metavariables as processes, and by modifying the search strategy, they develop a function providing all successors of a process after a given action. This supports the implementation of Hennessy-Milner modal logic within the framework.

Maude 2.0 introduces several new features including the 'frozen' attribute, which prevents arguments of an operator from being rewritten, and metasearch capabilities essential for handling complex quantifications in modal logic.

The authors believe the new implementation in Maude is advantageous due to its closer alignment with the mathematical and logical underpinnings of the semantics, reducing the need for metalevel strategies. Unlike the previous implementation, Maude 2.0's search command is now capable of handling the necessary rewriting conditions, enabling faster and simpler processes.

Lastly, the paper contrasts Maude with the Isabelle theorem prover, emphasizing how Maude's reflection allows first-order representations to achieve the power of higher-order systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of higher-order techniques within a first-order environment.
