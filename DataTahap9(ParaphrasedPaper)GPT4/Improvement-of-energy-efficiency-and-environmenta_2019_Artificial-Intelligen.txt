This academic paper discusses the significance of fisheries and aquaculture in providing a source of protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2018, the total global production from fisheries and aquaculture in 2016 was around 171 million tons, with aquaculture contributing 53% (91 million tons) and fisheries making up the remaining 47% (80 million tons). Iran was identified as the top producing country for trout species, particularly rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss), with a production of 167,830 tons. A significant portion of Iranâ€™s trout production comes from the provinces of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Lorestan, and Kohgiluyeh-o-Boyer-Ahmad.

The paper also highlights the limitations in fishing and potential water resource accessibility, which have led to maximum utilization of current resources in aquaculture. This increased usage of nonrenewable resources can lead to decreased energy efficiency and additional environmental concerns. Energy-saving measures are suggested as essential for managing and reducing the energy consumption of various inputs such as chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery, labor, water, and electricity. Improved energy efficiency can prevent climate change and reduce production costs, benefiting consumers.

Energy indices are useful for evaluating a system's status based on total energy input versus yield (or energy output). Yet, they do not indicate specific improvements within the system. For example, an increase in energy ratio (ER) might be achieved through doubling the yield with a 1.5 times increase in energy input.

Nutrient emissions associated with fish growth were assessed through nutrient-balance modeling, and the paper describes the calculation of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and solid emissions. These calculations were based on the difference between the nutrients provided to the trout and the nutrients assimilated by the fish, considering the digestibility, the fish's body composition, and the unused portion of feed.

The environmental impact of aquaculture operations was assessed using various categories defined by CML2 Baseline 2000 within the framework of ISO 14040, 2006. SimaPro software was employed for normalization to allow comparison across these categories, which include abiotic depletion, acidification, global warming, eutrophication, and more.

The paper discusses the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, focusing on the input-based model due to the control trout producers have over input quantities. DEA evaluates the performance of decision-making units (DMUs) in terms of technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency, and scale efficiency, considering constant and variable returns to scale.

Lastly, the study provides an example of how different inputs like fish oil, wheat gluten, and rapeseed meal contribute to various environmental impact categories in two regions, emphasizing the importance of efficient resource management in reducing environmental impacts.
