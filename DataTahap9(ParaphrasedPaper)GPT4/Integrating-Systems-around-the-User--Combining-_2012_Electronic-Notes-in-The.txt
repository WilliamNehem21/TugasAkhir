Current practices in interactive theorem proving enable the confirmation of advanced theorems and intricate algorithms, but the procedure is still unwieldy and slow. We are of the opinion that the integration of additional resources, like computer algebra systems (CAS), could quicken this process in numerous cases. Although past research has shown considerable progress in merging proof assistants with auxiliary tools, the growing intricacies of modern proof development introduce fresh difficulties and requirements for the integration of these tools.
