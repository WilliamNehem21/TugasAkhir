The paper states that the algorithm in question is guaranteed to terminate, thereby confirming the result. While it is possible to enhance the algorithm by eliminating balls that are definitively not overlapping the interval [n, n+1], this refinement is not essential for the current framework. Consequently, to simplify matters and avoid additional technical complexities, this optimization step is omitted.
