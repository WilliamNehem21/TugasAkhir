This paper outlines the research presented at the MFCSIT conference in Cork, focusing on the exploration of universal computational devices in three areas: Turing machines, cellular automata, and hyperbolic cellular automata. The discussion encompasses classical computational properties and extends into the realm of super-Turing capabilities.

The authors revisit the technique proposed by Watanabe in the 1950s for simulating tag-system computations using a Turing machine, leveraging an efficient encoding method. In this method, the tag-system program is compactly represented as a string, with specific delimiters distinguishing the productions and the elements within them.

Cellular automata are recognized as a significant model in the computational science community and have gained such prominence that an entire journal is devoted to the subject. A notable result in cellular automata theory is the existence of a universal automaton in the von Neumann neighborhood with three states, as established by Serizawa in 1987. Furthermore, for the Moore neighborhood, a universal cellular automaton can be constructed with just two states, as demonstrated by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy through the universality of the Game of Life.

The paper reflects on the expansion of cellular automata studies from the traditional one-dimensional line to multidimensional Euclidean spaces, with particular attention to planar configurations and 3D models that simulate processes like gas diffusion-reaction.

In 1999, investigations into cellular automata extended into hyperbolic planes, a geometric setting that was pioneered by the co-author and Kenichi Morita. The discovery of an effective location system in 2000 opened new opportunities for research in this field, which has since grown significantly.

Hyperbolic geometry, which deviates from Euclidean geometry by modifying the parallel postulate, forms the basis of this exploration. The authors present three key findings: a weakly universal cellular automaton in the hyperbolic plane with 22 states, a weakly universal automaton in three-dimensional hyperbolic space with 5 states, and a result concerning an intrinsically universal cellular automaton within the hyperbolic plane.

The paper also details how a locomotive consisting of two cells operates within this computational framework, with a mechanism that detects the locomotive and subsequently activates a track change.

Lastly, the authors discuss the potential of utilizing hyperbolic geometry to facilitate super-Turing computations. While traditional models that aim to surpass Turing limitations manipulate time without resorting to real numbers, this work suggests that by leveraging the spatial properties of hyperbolic geometry, it is possible to go beyond conventional Turing power. However, the authors note the limitation that, in computer science, a cell cannot possess unlimited information, and having a cell know only a finite number of neighbors equates to the same computational power as a standard Turing machine.
