This paper explores the evaluation of metrics on different probability distributions, comparing traditional distance measures on classical discrete probability distributions to those on quantum distributions. The primary distance metric considered for discrete probability distributions is the total variation distance, which is a specific instance of the Kantorovich distance, as referenced in various other works. For quantum distributions, the research focuses on the trace distance, which can be thought of as a quantum analogue or generalization of the total variation distance.

The academic work also investigates more theoretical aspects of discrete and quantum distance measures. Sections 3 and 4 of the paper are particularly significant, as they employ logical frameworks to reformulate these distances, specifically using a validity operator |=. These sections also introduce metric interpretations of state-and-effect triangles, concepts integral to the effectus-theoretic framework for probabilistic state and predicate transformer semantics.

Additionally, the paper provides concrete instances, through computational experiments, of applying total variation and trace distances to quantum states such as the Bell state (labeled QS2) and the GHZ state (labeled QS3). The research illustrates how to implement these states as functions in Python and analyze their two-dimensional n-marginals.

The latter portions of the paper delve into these distances in a more abstract context. While one section is dedicated to discussing the intricacies of the total variation distance, the following section turns to an in-depth examination of the trace distance, both aiming to enhance the understanding of these metrics from a broader theoretical standpoint.
