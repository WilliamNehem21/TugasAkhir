This paper discusses the effects of water deficit on seed germination, seedling growth, and biochemical responses in different wheat genotypes. Water shortage is known to impede germination and reduce the growth rate of seedlings. It can also cause changes in the plant's physiology and biochemistry, such as the development of antioxidant enzymes to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are overproduced under stress and can damage cell components.

The study emphasizes the importance of identifying drought-resistant plant varieties, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where water scarcity is a major challenge for agricultural productivity. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used in research to simulate drought conditions by lowering the water potential in the nutrient media, allowing for the study of plant responses under controlled conditions.

The researchers utilized a statistical approach to analyze the data, employing one-way ANOVA to determine significant differences among germination and biochemical parameters under control, moderate, and severe drought conditions induced by PEG.

Findings indicated that, across various wheat genotypes, PEG-induced drought negatively impacted morphological features such as the lengths of the plumule and radicle, seedling fresh mass and water content, and the number of adventitious roots. Some genotypes developed more adventitious roots under mild stress, possibly as an adaptation to increase water absorption. Seedling dry mass also increased, suggesting that less stored food was utilized due to limited water for hydrolysis or reduced consumption by the underdeveloped seedling parts.

The study further noted that water stress inhibited catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities in most genotypes, possibly affecting protein biosynthesis. In contrast, peroxidase (POX) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities were increased in some genotypes, indicating an adaptive response to stress. Similarly, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity generally increased, helping in the oxidation of phenolics as a stress response.

To summarize the overall behavior of the wheat genotypes under study, researchers introduced two indices: the Stress Impact Coefficient (SIF) and the Stress Impact Index (SII). These metrics were used to interpret the effect of stress as either positive (enhancement of parameters) or negative (impairment of parameters).

The study concluded that chemical desiccation with PEG hindered germination and seedling growth across different wheat genotypes, though the impact varied among them. While the morphological traits of wheat seedlings were more severely affected by stress than membrane features and antioxidant enzymes, genotype 'SIDS 13' showed the greatest drought tolerance, followed by various other genotypes, and 'Shandawel 1' was found to be the most sensitive.
