In the remainder of this text, we initially present a detailed explanation of a calculus without type annotations (Section 2) and then demonstrate its versatility through various illustrations (Section 3). Subsequently, we introduce a version of the calculus with type specifications (Section 4), alongside a declaration of its reliability. Section 5 showcases examples of the typing process. We wrap up the paper with a discussion on related research and prospective studies in the conclusion.

Further within the text, we come across several mentions of "checkedmixin" which appears to be a programming construct or class designed to handle a specific functionality—square root in this instance—with integrated checks. For example, "chk_sqrt" is an instance of "checkedmixin" created to manage square root operations with error-checking. Attempts to calculate the square root of a negative number using the standard "sqrt" method return NaN (not a number), whereas the "checked_sqrt" method raises an exception for such invalid arguments.
