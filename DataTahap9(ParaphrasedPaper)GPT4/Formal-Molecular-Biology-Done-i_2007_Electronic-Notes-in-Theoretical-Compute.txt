In this study, we introduce a different approach that employs multisets of actions, or multi-actions, to govern processes. These multi-actions stand in contrast to the typical practice where single actions, or singletons, are the norm. It's possible to perform and revert these multi-actions in any sequence. The concept of multi-actions is presented and detailed within the text.

Prior to our research, there seems to be no consideration given to an adaptation of the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) akin to CCS-R. This oversight could be due to a lack of compelling reasons to explore it. However, utilizing biological characteristics as an inspiration for formal frameworks often leads to valuable insights. Once a biological aspect is modeled formally, the initial motivation can be momentarily disregarded to explore potential applications in other areas. In our particular case, we've considered how our model could represent decentralized transactional processes. There's potential in this area, though it requires further investigation to identify if our approach can yield meaningful results.
