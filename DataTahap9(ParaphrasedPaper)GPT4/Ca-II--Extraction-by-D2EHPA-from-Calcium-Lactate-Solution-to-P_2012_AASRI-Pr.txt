The paper presents a novel method for extracting lactic acid by removing calcium ions using di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA). The method aims to keep lactic acid in the aqueous phase by treating calcium lactate solutions with D2EHPA to transfer calcium ions to the organic phase. Studies on the process focused on the effects of various factors such as the composition of the organic phase, phase ratio, temperature, and calcium ion concentration to optimize the extraction efficiency.

Optimal extraction conditions were identified: a temperature of 323 K, an organic-to-water phase ratio of 4:1, an initial calcium concentration of 1.03 mol/l, a 40% volume fraction of D2EHPA, and the addition of 5% 1-octanol as a modifier. Under these conditions, the process could achieve an extraction rate of 91% and a hydronium ion concentration of 1.4 mol/l.

The study used reagent-grade materials and conducted experiments with precise control over variables like temperature, phase ratio, and shaking intensity to determine the influence on the extraction yield. The kinetic mechanism was analyzed by determining the reaction order for D2EHPA, pH, and calcium ions, revealing that the reaction likely occurs at the interface and is predominantly controlled by chemical kinetics.

The established rate of calcium extraction could be expressed as f = 10^-6.81[Ca2+][H2A2]^0.5[H+]^-1, indicating the relevance of these constituents to the process rate.

This extraction strategy targets the improvement of lactic acid separation from fermentation broths by avoiding the generation of waste salts and the consumption of additional chemicals associated with traditional solvent extraction methods which typically transfer lactic acid to an organic phase. The research provides a detailed investigation into the operational parameters necessary for the improved and environmentally friendly recovery of lactic acid.
