The academic paper asserts that there is a direct correspondence between typed proof structures and type assignment proof structures. In particular, the process of removing type information from terms in typed proofs (via the erasure function j) results in valid type assignment proofs. Conversely, every type assignment proof corresponds to a typed proof from which it has been derived through such erasure.

Notwithstanding, for a thorough understanding, it is essential to grasp the intricacies of rules concerning the introduction and elimination of universal quantifiers. The authors also point out that while creating a practical language system is a valid reason for examining this issue, the study of the connection between typed and type assignment systems is a significant theoretical topic that merits attention in its own right.
