This paper presents an extension of the constructor calculus framework that enables it to work with constructed locations, enhancing its ability to perform generic operations across a wide variety of data types, including abstract types. The enhanced calculus allows for the definition of a versatile generic assignment operation which updates in place when feasible, or allocates new memory as needed, potentially reducing memory overhead common in higher-order polymorphic languages. This capability, combined with standard generic programming techniques, facilitates the implementation of complex algorithms, such as the visitor design pattern.

To demonstrate the utility of this expanded calculus, the paper includes three examples. First, an insertion sort algorithm showcases how to create a space-efficient sorting function employing higher-order functions and pattern-matching. Secondly, an iteration function called 'converge' is presented, depicting efficient space usage during function iteration. Lastly, the generic instantiation of the visitor pattern is described, illustrating its application as a generic function type.

The paper is organized into several sections for clarity. Section 2 revisits essential elements from the foundational constructor calculus. Section 3 introduces types of constructed locations along with elementary operations for their manipulation, such as creation, reading, and writing. Section 4 delves into constructed locations and details the operations that can be applied to them. Examples are provided in Section 5, while Section 6 wraps up the paper with conclusions and a discussion on future research directions.

Initially, constructor calculus was developed to define generic functions like 'map' and 'fold', which are adaptable to a plethora of data types. The new work builds on this by specifying additional constructs and explaining any notation not covered in this paper but are laid out in previous works. A novel stance is taken by introducing unique term forms for each primitive data type, such as those representing floating-point numbers. This allows for easier pattern representation and ensures that, for instance, the visitor function can be reused in various organizational structures without being rewritten for structural changes.

Finally, the paper argues that the principles underpinning constructor calculus can be equally applied to imperative operations by introducing primitive operations for handling locations. This provides a significant benefit by allowing generic functions to perform in-place updates where plausible, a feature not commonly seen in other polymorphic languages.
