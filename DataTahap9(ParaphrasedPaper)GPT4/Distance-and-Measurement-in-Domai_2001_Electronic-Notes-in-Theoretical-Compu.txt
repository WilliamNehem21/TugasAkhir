In the previous section, we discovered that when a partial metric generates the Scott topology on a given domain, it can be concluded that the domain possesses a measurement that also elicits the Scott topology universally. This finding suggests that in developing a concept of distance for domains, we ought to focus on the principle of measurement. We will proceed with an established method from the relevant literature.
