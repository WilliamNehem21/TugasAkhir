The paper emphasizes the importance of sentiment analysis (SA) due to the wealth of information it brings to organizations. There is a challenge in analyzing opinions on Arab social media as most content is in dialectal Arabic rather than Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and research on the subject is at an early stage with room for improvement. Dialectal Arabic is constantly evolving, as new generations introduce fresh terms and language usage evolves.

To address this, the authors propose a hybrid incremental learning approach (HILATSA) to build a sentiment analysis tool for Arabic tweets. This semi-automatic system is able to adapt to the changing nature of the language by crawling Twitter for new tweets, expanding its lexicon with new words, and attempting to determine the sentiment behind those words.

The paper's main contribution is the creation of a sentiment analysis tool for Arabic tweets that can keep up with rapid changes in language usage. As part of their approach, essential lexicons are created for words, idioms, emoticons, and intensified words, along with lists of intensification and negation tools, all made available for public use to address the lack of dialectal Arabic resources.

The paper explores using the Levenshtein distance algorithm in sentiment analysis to handle different forms of words and misspellings.

In the rest of the paper, Section 2 reviews related work in sentiment analysis. Section 3 elaborates on the methodology, datasets, lexicons, and classifiers used. Section 4 presents the results and discusses the findings, while Section 5 offers conclusions.

The paper summarizes the contributions of several researchers in SA for both Arabic and English, using a variety of methods and classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Chi-square extraction, and deep learning approaches such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and deep convolutional networks.

The current work has used SVM, L2 logistic regression, and RNN classifiers. SVM is highlighted for its effectiveness, especially with high-dimensional data and its robustness against overfitting compared to other algorithms. Logistic regression is praised for its regularization capabilities which enhance model generalizability by downplaying less significant features.

The authors demonstrate the performance of their sentiment analysis tool through accuracy and average F1 score, comparing it to other works. They conclude that SVM performs well across various scenarios and that sentiment analysis is more challenging with three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) than with just two. Balanced datasets tend to yield higher F1 scores than unbalanced ones.

Lastly, the paper discusses the practical application of their system with the ARTwitter dataset, training classifiers using lexicons developed from other datasets, and updating the lexicon through learned words from the dataset to enhance the performance of sentiment analysis.
