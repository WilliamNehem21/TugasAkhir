The paper investigates how a particular module involving double negative feedback can produce bistability and hysteresis in biological systems. This mechanism is implicated in the irreversible transition of the cell cycle's start in budding yeast cells. Although bistability has been confirmed experimentally in the cell cycle, the irreversibility of the transition remains untested.

The authors present an analysis of this module using probabilistic model checking and stochastic simulations within a simplified model of the budding yeast cell cycle. Their findings suggest that weakening the positive feedback loop within the system can actually reverse its irreversibility. The paper is structured as follows: a brief description of the budding yeast cell cycle model is provided, with an emphasis on the CDK/CycB-CDH1/APC interaction, which is the main focus of their study on irreversibility. Probabilistic model checking is introduced, and a quantitative analysis of the stochastic model is performed by verifying probabilistic logical queries. Detailed results from stochastic simulation of the full cell cycle model, which includes the core mechanism analyzed earlier, are discussed. The authors then conclude the paper with a summary of their findings.

Additionally, the paper includes an appendix with the Bio-PEPA code resulting from the translation of the original ordinary differential equations (ODEs) used in their model. Although a complete explanation of the Bio-PEPA language and model building procedure is deemed beyond the scope of the paper, a summary necessary for understanding the provided model code is given. More extensive descriptions of the language and modeling methodology can be found in the referenced literature.

Rate functions used in the model are explained, which can either be based on actual numbers for the mass action law or arbitrary functions, such as sigmoidal responses, for more complex interactions. The authors explain that the leap-frog technique is utilized to generate random seeds for simulations, resulting in approximately uncorrelated trajectories. This technique allows for more observations to be collected within a given time frame.

The Bio-PEPA code for the cell cycle model comprises three separate files, one defining the model, another for declaring functions, and a third for type definitions. Each model component is defined through a "let" constructor, with its dynamics represented by a series of events coded with a "when" constructor. Rates are stored as constants, variables, or mathematical functions in the function definition file, with further details on translating from ODE to Bio-PEPA available in the indicated references.
