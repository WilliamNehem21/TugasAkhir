This academic paper focuses on showcasing how the Rogue programming system can be efficiently implemented through a smaller, more elementary rewriting system known as MicroRogue. MicroRogue simplifies term rewriting by applying a global set of ordered rules at the top level of terms and allowing for the dynamic enablement and disablement of rules. Additionally, new rules can be dynamically added within scopes, which can be pushed or popped, and evaluation order can be specified within MicroRogue.

The practical application of MicroRogue means that a Rogue interpreter can be executed in under 40 lines of MicroRogue code, offering a leve of conciseness not achievable in more traditional languages like C++. Theoretically, this transition from Rogue to MicroRogue aligns with the idea that simple rewriting rules form the basis of the operational semantics of rewriting calculi, signifying that a meta-language for implementing Rogue should be rewrite-based.

The paper further explains Rogue's operational semantics, which include a global set of rules for rewriting expressions and a "hold expression" that supports in-place rewriting for evaluation order control. This system also allows for normalized expressions to be affected by dynamically added rules even after being evaluated against a core set of rules.

An interesting capability of MicroRogue is that it can partially compile into C++ code, enabling a performance enhancement of approximately 20% in running times for typical Rogue programs when compared to full interpretation.

Overall, the paper outlines how MicroRogue's capabilities contribute significantly to the ease of development and the minimization of a trusted computing base, which is crucial for security applications. The focus of the paper is to demonstrate these contributions through the simplicity and dynamic features of MicroRogue's term rewriting system.
