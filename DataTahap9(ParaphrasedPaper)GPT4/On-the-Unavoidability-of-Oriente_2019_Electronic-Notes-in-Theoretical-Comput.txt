An academic paper describes a bi-arborescence as consisting of two separate arborescences (directional trees): one in-arborescence and one out-arborescence, which share only their root. This concept was drawn upon in the proof of Theorem 3.1, which also noted the position of the roots in the median order: the root of the out-arborescence appears as the first vertex, while the root of the in-arborescence appears at the end. This insight leads to a corollary that impacts the ordering process of tree nodes.

This research highlights an approach where the vertices corresponding to all the children of a certain node (called 'a') are decided simultaneously. Importantly, the order in which the node 'a' is embedded does not need to be determined beforehand, allowing the embedding order to be decided only after the images of 'a's children are known. Thus, it becomes possible to choose the relative embedding of 'a's children with full knowledge of their eventual positions.

The paper further defines certain terms related to tree structures. For trees that are not linear paths, a "branch-node" is defined as a node with three or more connections. In contrast, a "flat node" simply connects two other nodes. Moreover, the paper defines a "segment" within a tree as a path with a branch-node at its origin and either another branch-node or a leaf at its terminus. The internal nodes of such a segment are exclusively flat nodes. When a segment's terminus is a branch-node, it's referred to as an "inner segment," whereas it's called an "outer segment" if the terminus is a leaf. Lastly, for each inner segment 's', there exists an "opposite" segment, represented as 's-bar', which begins where 's' ends and ends where 's' begins.
