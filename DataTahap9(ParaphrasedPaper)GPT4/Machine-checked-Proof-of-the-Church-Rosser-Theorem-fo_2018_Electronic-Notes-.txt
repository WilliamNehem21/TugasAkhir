Traditional informal proofs often rely on the bound variable convention (BVC). Similarly, in this instance, our induction principle provides us with a separate variable y, which does not match x and is not present in nj. With this setup, we can adhere to the necessary freshness conditions, enabling us to employ Lemma 2.9 on substitution composition. By following these critical steps, we can bring this proof to a successful conclusion.
