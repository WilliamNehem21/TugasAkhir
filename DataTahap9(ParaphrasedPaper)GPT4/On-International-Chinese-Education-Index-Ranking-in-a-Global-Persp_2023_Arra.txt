To enhance the assessment of International Chinese Education (ICE), we present a novel ICE Index ranking system that evaluates 24 characteristics across three dimensions: localization, specialization, and collaboration. These dimensions are further broken down into seven secondary indicators, which offer insights into Chinese language education worldwide. Based on a comprehensive literature review and data availability, we rank ICE across 153 countries.

Despite the global spread of Chinese language education, with its incorporation into national education systems in about 80 countries and over 200 million learners worldwide, in-depth studies on ICE on a macroscopic scale are scarce. To fill this gap, we evaluated ICE in 115 countries, investigating everything from individual language acquisition to broader educational structures like Confucius Institutes.

Our paper conducts a meticulous analysis of ICE, gathering extensive data from 153 participating countries. We aim to understand ICE's global status and further the discourse in this field. We propose an indexing method informed by three sets of 24 indicators in a data-driven manner.

The paper's structure includes a literature review on ICE assessment, an introduction to our ICE ranking system and methodology, the presentation of ranking results, correlation analysis for these results, and a conclusion of our key findings.

We address the ranking problem - a common issue when comparing various items across different criteria â€“ within the ICE context through weighted ranking aggregation (RA) methods. This approach allows us to calculate weights for each indicator, considering intrinsic attributes like the coefficient of variation, entropy, intercriteria correlation, and principal component analysis to create a more objective ranking.

Considering the unique challenges of ICE, we examine development both within individual countries and their collaboration with Chinese resources. We use indirect proxies to account for rapidly changing policies and deploy preference matrices to reduce biases from different measurement scales.

We find positive correlations between ICE and factors like outbound tourist numbers to China and government efficiency, while factors like geographical distance influence localization and collaboration but do not affect specialization significantly.

We emphasize the potential in countries such as Mexico, Chile, and Argentina and suggest that China should strengthen economic ties and educational support to enhance ICE in these nations. Our comprehensive ranking system, when cross-referenced with external data, reveals the United States, United Kingdom, and Thailand as top performers in ICE.

We note that while data from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan may impact overall ICE development in the Greater China region, the amount of available data is generally positively correlated with a country's ICE ranking. Countries with better rankings tend to have more complete data, yet there are exceptions, highlighting areas for improvement.

In conclusion, our study establishes a detailed ICE ranking system using a blend of weighting methods and correlation analyses. We classify countries into different types, demonstrating that while data completeness generally corresponds with ICE ranking, there is substantial room for growth, especially in collaboration-focused indicators.
