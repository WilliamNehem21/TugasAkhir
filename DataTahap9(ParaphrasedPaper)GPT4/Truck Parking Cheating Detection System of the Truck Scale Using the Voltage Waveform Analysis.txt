This paper presents a novel approach to detect fraudulent truck weighting practices known as "truck parking cheating" on truck scales, which can result in significant financial losses for businesses. The method utilizes analysis of voltage waveforms from weighing transducers to identify discrepancies between the number of turning points in the voltage output and the number of truck axles, indicating cheating.

The paper describes the implementation of a detection system that incorporates four weighing transducers under the scale platform. These transducers output millivolt signals in response to the weight of the truck, which are then amplified and processed by a microcontroller unit (MCU) based on the 8031 chip. The data can be transmitted to a controlling computer for further analysis.

The detection system takes into consideration that, during cheating attempts, the voltage signal will show an abnormal inflection point when not all truck wheels are on the platform or when multiple trucks are partially on the platform. In normal conditions, the output voltage signal from the transducers corresponds to the uniform distribution of weight as the truck remains fully on the scale. Any deviation that results in an additional inflection point indicates potential cheating.

Experiments conducted on an actual truck scale within a factory setting have shown that the proposed truck parking cheating detection system works in real-time and offers an effective method for on-the-spot identification of this specific type of scale tampering. This contributes to better enforcement of accurate weighing practices and helps in protecting businesses from economic losses due to fraudulent weight readings of trucks.
