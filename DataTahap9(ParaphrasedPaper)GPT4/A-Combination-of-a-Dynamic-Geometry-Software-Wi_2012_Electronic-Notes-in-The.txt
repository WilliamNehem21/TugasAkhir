This paper describes an interactive geometry proving interface named GeoCoq, which combines the capabilities of dynamic geometry software GeoGebra with the proof assistant Coq. The interface provides users with the ability to create and manipulate geometric constructions within GeoGebra and construct formal proofs using Coq.

GeoCoq enables step-by-step geometric theorem proving in a style akin to traditional high school methods, incorporating both forward and backward reasoning and auxiliary constructions. Through an intuitive interface, users can interact with Coq to construct proofs, drawing upon a rule library developed with a high school teacher's input.

The system simplifies the proof process by offering applicable rule sets and automatic tactics in Coq to handle minor reasoning steps, freeing users from technical proof details unsuited to their abstraction level. It also incorporates formalized automatic proof methods, such as Narboux's area method, allowing users to check facts or incorporate them into their proofs.

The paper is structured as follows: 

1. A brief overview of GeoGebra.
2. An explanation of Coq, Pcoq's communication protocol, and the geometry library.
3. A presentation of the GeoCoq interface and its features aiding proofs.
4. Discussion of implementation details.
5. A review of related work in the field.
6. Conclusions and future outlook.

The authors elaborate on the benefits of using Pcoq with Coq, especially the synergy with GeoGebra's Java-based implementation, and the tree-like management of formulas enabling clear notation and natural language coupling.

GeoCoq's capabilities are demonstrated through a geometric theorem example, highlighting how users can state and prove theorems with a list of applicable rules for each proof step, provided by the interface. Also covered is the addition of new geometric objects and the necessity to validate their existence within proofs.

Furthermore, the paper discusses how the system aids users in identifying relevant tactics based on the geometric significance of formulas.

Finally, the authors compare GeoCoq with other systems like GeoProof and underscore how GeoCoq stands out by allowing users to create custom proofs interactively and establish a logical perspective in solving geometric problems. They conclude that integrating a proof assistant with dynamic geometry software offers a novel educational approach, enhancing geometric problem-solving with logical reasoning skills.
