Current concerns about food safety have led to strict regulations within the European Union (EU) regarding the traceability of all imported food items. Historically, food industry traceability was rudimentary, but evolving good manufacturing practices have made traceability systems integral to the food production process. Traceability involves the ability to follow an item's history, origin, or components through a documented and standardized approach (ISO, 2007). However, implementing these systems in less developed regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, is challenging, prompting the development of innovative traceability strategies. In this context, the study explores identifying biological markers linked to the origin of peach fruit products to monitor them through processing.

The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree originating from northwest China and was first domesticated between the Kunlun Shan mountains and the Tarim Basin. The species name ties back to its widespread cultivation in ancient Persia. The peach is part of the Prunus genus, which includes cherries and plums, in the Rosaceae family, and is closely related to almonds within the subgenre Amygdalus, known for its distinctive grooved seed shell.

In this study, peach fruits were carefully harvested using gloves to preserve their native microflora and stored in sterile conditions before being transported to CIRAD Montpellier in France. The samples' DNA was extracted for analysis of bacterial and yeast communities to determine farm type and harvest date.

Lactobacillus coryniformis was identified as a dominant bacterium in conventionally farmed peaches, known for its lactic acid production, which creates an acidic environment inhibiting harmful pathogens while promoting beneficial plant development. This species has potential therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties.

Tremella flava, a yeast with anti-inflammatory and anti-infection properties, was also prevalent in conventionally farmed peaches. This finding suggests it could serve as a natural alternative for such applications in the fruit's production.

Microbial communities on peaches varied significantly based on farming methods, as seen in the differences in microbial band profiles. Both bacteria and yeast populations were closely linked to farming practices as per the statistical analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles. The significant environmental variations between the two farming methods studied had a major impact on microbial ecology.

In conclusion, it is possible to establish a statistical relationship between the farming method used and the microbial populations on Jordanian peach fruits, which can aid in ensuring traceability and food safety standards for imported food products in the EU.
