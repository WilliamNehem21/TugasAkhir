This paper discusses a method to assign labels to nodes in a structured data graph, such as an XML tree, that helps efficiently determine ancestry relationships between nodes. The labels are generated in a way that the label of each node is derived by combining the label of its parent node with the node's own unique identifier, resulting in two types of labels: an integer-based label and a binary string-based label.

In one innovative approach called the prime number schema, each node's label is defined as the product of its parent's label and a unique prime number associated with the node itself. To determine if one node (u) is an ancestor of another node (v), one simply checks if the label of node v is divisible by the label of node u (node u's label is a factor of node v's label). In such a case, given that the ancestor's label divides the descendant's label without a remainder (modulus operator % equals 0), node u is confirmed as an ancestor of node v.

The paper defines the "divisible property" to prove this approach. If a prime factor is present in integer a but not in integer b, then b cannot be divisible by a. In the context of graph nodes, this means that if the label of node u (l(u)) is not divisible by label of node v (l(v)), then u is not an ancestor of v. The proof explains how the unique prime number associated with node v must have propagated through a path from an ancestor node u to node v, verifying that there is a path of ancestry if l(u) mod l(v) equals 0.

Additionally, when considering the edge between a parent node k and its child node v in XML tree labeling, labels are generated based on the least common multiple (l.c.m) of the labels, so the parent's label is always divisible by any of its children's labels.

Through induction, the paper also establishes that all ancestors of a particular node v will share the unique prime number associated with v, supporting the divisible property and the overall labeling scheme.

The paper applies this approach to the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) as a real example to test the efficiency and efficacy of path-indexing algorithms. IMDb's data is used since it has a highly cyclic structure, as movies reference individuals (actors, directors, etc.), and these individuals in turn reference the movies they were involved in. By generating linked XML documents for a subset of movies and their associated individuals, the paper illustrates how cyclic relationships can be modeled and indexed.

Finally, the dataset used for this study contains over 40,000 nodes and 44,349 edges, with 2718 of those edges being of the ID reference type, providing a substantive testbed for their prime number labeling schema.
