This paper introduces novel algorithms aimed at identifying the best strategies in two-player games characterized by random moves and objectives focused on reaching key positions, a type of game commonly referred to as simple stochastic games. These games, thoroughly investigated in previous work by A. Condon, have significant implications for problems such as parity games and mu-calculus model checking, both of which are reducible to simple stochastic games. A central unresolved question is whether there's a polynomial-time solution for these games.

The paper details the partitioning of the search space into convex segments within a hypercube, using linear optimization methods within each segment for solution identification. The authors provide a process for moving sequentially from one segment to another, eventually encountering the segment comprising the optimal payouts, despite the potentially exponential number of segments. In practical scenarios, the number of segments required to achieve a solution is considerably lower.

Simple stochastic games, beyond their direct importance, serve as a model for a wide array of issues in computer science such as system verification and controller synthesis. This paper narrows its focus on these games due to their ease of reduction from other game types and their relevance to the broader field of general stochastic games, believing this intersection can yield fresh perspectives on graph game complexity. These games also represent open probabilistic systems, where solving algorithms aid in verification and specification compliance.

The paper is structured as follows: section 2 defines simple stochastic games and acknowledges the existence of an optimal value and the principle of memoryless determinacy. Section 3 describes the first algorithm, assuring its convergence to the optimal solution and relates the number of iterations to the number of possible strategies. Section 4 introduces a second algorithm, a revision of the first that simplifies computations at the cost of less optimal iterative enhancements. The paper then compares these new algorithms to the strategy improvement algorithms in section 5 and section 6 details experimental results.

Gameplays involve moving through a graph from a nonterminal position to a terminating sink, with outcomes determined by the final position. The goal of "max" players is to maximize outcomes, while "min" players seek to minimize them. Each step of the initial algorithm necessitates solving a linear optimization problem, which is computationally expensive, prompting the proposal for a subsequent algorithm with simpler computation steps.

The authors remark that while existing methods to solve simple stochastic games lack comprehensive complexity analysis, strategy improvement methods seem to function effectively in practice. The efficiency of the new algorithms is measured against these established techniques.

In summary, the paper's main contribution lies in a new approach for deducing optimal values in simple stochastic games, which leverages the geometrical representation of the search domain within a hypercube and the corresponding strategies aligned with the cube's subdivided areas. This method improves strategy pairs by transitioning through the hypercube's regions in a consistent manner, presenting an alternative to strategy improvement methods.
