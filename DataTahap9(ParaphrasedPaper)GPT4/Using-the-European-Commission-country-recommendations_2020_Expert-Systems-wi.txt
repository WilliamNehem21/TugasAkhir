This study explores the use of text and unstructured data in evaluating sovereign credit risk, proposing a new method to understand and forecast sovereign ratings. The method leverages information from the annual reports of European countries published by the European Commission. It utilizes Doc2Vec, a neural network-based embedding technique, to transform reports into numerical vectors that serve as inputs for a logistic regression model. Training on data from 2011 to 2019, the model successfully predicts 70.27% of country ratings in the test sample, which is a slight improvement over using only macroeconomic factors.

Traditionally, credit ratings have been replicated with econometric models that focus on macroeconomic variables. The study compares the new method with two other models: one based on macroeconomic data only, and another that combines macroeconomic data with information from the Doc2Vec vectors. While the model using only macroeconomic variables also performs well, the combined model does not significantly outperform the model that relies on country reports alone, as these reports already include macroeconomic data along with other explanatory insights.

The paper is structured in six sections. It begins with a literature review on credit rating models, followed by a description of text data handling techniques, with an emphasis on the embedding approach. It reports the research outcomes based on a dedicated analysis of European country reports. Then, it compares the new model to benchmark models using different data inputs. The final section concludes the research findings.

The findings highlight the importance of qualitative information in credit ratings and the utility of natural language processing in enhancing credit risk assessment. It suggests that combining quantitative and qualitative data does not necessarily improve predictions when qualitative data already encompass quantitative insights. The paper implies that future research could explore different embedding models or pre-trained models for credit rating predictions.
