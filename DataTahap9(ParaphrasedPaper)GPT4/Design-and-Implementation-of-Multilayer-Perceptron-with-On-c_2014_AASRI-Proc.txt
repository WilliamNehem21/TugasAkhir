This academic paper discusses innovative developments in technology that have allowed the creation of integrated circuits specifically designed to mimic the "intelligent" functions of the human brain. These neural circuits are often programmed using methods that require external hardware or powerful parallel computers. The paper presents a novel approach using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to create a neural chip capable of learning. This FPGA-driven neural network can exploit parallel processing to improve learning capabilities, making it ideal for real-time applications such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, image processing, and pattern recognition.

The standalone neural network chip created through Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) has the potential to outperform traditional computer-based systems in tasks like pattern classification and data processing. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are touted as a potent modeling tool, particularly when the relationship within the data is not clearly understood. They signify a significant shift in computing methods, often referred to as the sixth generation of computing.

The paper zeroes in on designing an MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) neural network with on-chip learning capabilities that uses the backpropagation learning algorithm to tackle the XOR problem. It reviews the network architecture in one section and then explains the learning algorithm in the following section. The paper goes on to explore the practical implementation of on-chip learning and the results of this process.

During operation, each neuron in the network processes inputs concurrently, passing its output onto the next layer until the final layer produces an output using an activation function to determine the weighted sum total. This outcome is used to calculate mean squared error (MSE). The system's global controller assesses whether learning is proceeding correctly by checking if the error exceeds a threshold, triggering the backward phase of learning if necessary. 

In the backward phase, the gradient value for the output neuron is computed and then backpropagated to adjust the weights of the neurons in the hidden layer. During this phase, weights across all neuron layers are updated simultaneously, and the revised weights are stored for future use. This process marks the completion of a single training cycle, and these steps are repeated with various input patterns until the network is deemed adequately trained. The design achieves a processing frequency of 5.332 MHz and involves a total gate count of 473,237, demonstrating its applicability to real-time situations when implemented on a Virtex-E FPGA using VHDL.
