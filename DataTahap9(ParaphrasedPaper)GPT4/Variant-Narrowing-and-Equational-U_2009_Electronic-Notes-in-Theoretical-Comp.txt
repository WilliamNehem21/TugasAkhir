This paper emphasizes the significance of utilizing order-sorted theories for certain computational approaches. Order-sorted theories have been shown to lead to termination in narrowing processes, which results in a finite unification algorithm in many situations where traditional, unsorted narrowing would not terminate. Additionally, these theories can contribute to a reduction in the search space when compared to unsorted theories. Two notable examples highlighted are the approximate theory for associativity and the Diffie-Hellman exponentiation theory. In both examples, the application of order-sorted theories leads to termination, whereas their unsorted counterparts do not.

The paper also introduces variant narrowing, a technique that is a version of narrowing modulo B. This method is designed to be more efficient than standard narrowing since it can potentially produce a significantly smaller search space while still maintaining completeness. The research demonstrates that with theories possessing the finite variant property, variant narrowing can be specialized to develop algorithms for both calculating the finite variant and for finding a complete and minimal set of E-unifiers. It further illustrates how variant narrowing, based on the finite variant assumption, can play a crucial role in the symbolic reachability analysis methods for concurrent systems that are specified as rewrite theories. This application is particularly relevant for cryptographic protocols defined in this manner.
