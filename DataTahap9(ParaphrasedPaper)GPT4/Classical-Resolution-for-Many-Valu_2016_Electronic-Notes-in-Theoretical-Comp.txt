In the paper, the authors introduce a new method for proving theorems within finite-valued propositional logics, which is based on a reduction process that translates many-valued logics into two-valued (bivalent) semantics. This method incorporates both intrinsic and extrinsic elements relative to the many-valued logic being analyzed, by embedding its language into a wider metalanguage, which helps address the satisfiability issues. Unlike previous methods, the proposed approach uses a classical logic as the target language, simplifying the creation of resolution-based rules for specific many-valued logics. The correctness of this method is proven by leveraging classical resolution results. The paper includes examples of the method’s application, notes its ability to be implemented, and discusses how it can be translated into classical propositional logic to take advantage of existing automated proof systems.

The paper also highlights the historical milestones of many-valued logics, acknowledging their hundred-year anniversary, and the fifty-year mark for the resolution-based computational proof method. It references other comprehensive sources that provide a detailed analysis of many-valied logics and various automated proof methods developed for them. The paper notes that the resolution-based methods, previously detailed in two other papers, are particularly noteworthy and closely related to their own method. Those methods convert formulas from a specific many-valued logic into labeled formats, where labels are symbolic representations of the semantic truth values. These labels allow the resolution rule to be applied to clauses with complementary literals that have consistent and unifiable labels. The key distinction between the methods mentioned is in the label types—one uses single truth values, while the other uses sets.
