This paper addresses the challenge of airwave interference in marine controlled-source electromagnetic (MCSEM) soundings for hydrocarbon exploration in shallow water. The airwave signals often obscure the desired subsurface electromagnetic signals. To combat this issue, the authors propose a curve-fitting strategy to determine a mathematical function or model that accurately characterizes the airwave data pattern. This model could potentially predict airwave behavior.

The researchers utilized synthetic data generated from a geological model typical of the region where actual MCSEM data were taken. The performance of the predictive model was evaluated using several statistical metrics, including the root mean square error (RMSE), the sum of square error (SSE), and the coefficient of determination (R²).

Their findings suggested that an exponential decay function, expressed as f(x) = e⁻ˣ, effectively captures the pattern of the airwaves with a high R² of 0.995, a low RMSE of 1.6e-7, and a negligible SSE of 3.4e-12. These results indicate a strong fit between the model and the data.

The paper emphasizes that the exponent (x) must consistently be positive to ensure the output values of f(x) are either always positive or negative, depending on the sign of the function's coefficient. It is also common practice in calculus and various applications to use the natural number e as the base for exponential functions.

Lastly, the authors acknowledge that while the study's results from simulated data are promising, the next phase is to validate these findings through experimental work with real MCSEM data.
