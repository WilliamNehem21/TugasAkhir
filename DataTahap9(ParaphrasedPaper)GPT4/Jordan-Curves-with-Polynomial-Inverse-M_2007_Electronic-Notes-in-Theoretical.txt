The paper discusses the complexity of Julia sets, with previous research exploring various computational problems within two-dimensional domains. Chou and Ko investigated how to identify pathways, while Ko and Yu focused on calculating single-valued branches of logarithmic and square-root functions. Together with Yu, they also looked into determining the smallest rectangles and squares that encompass a Jordan curve. These studies predominantly used Turing machine models for their computations.

The paper then contrasts a result from a previous theorem, indicating that the curve involved in an upper-bound complexity problem actually possesses a polynomial inverse modulus. The authors present this as evidence that possessing a polynomial inverse modulus can simplify the computational complexity for certain two-dimensional domain problems, like calculating inverse functions, determining set membership, pathfinding, and performing analytic continuation.

The authors note that most Jordan curves used in prior studies for establishing lower bounds of computational difficulty also exhibit this polynomial inverse modulus property. This observation was made after examining issues such as set membership, pathfinding, and calculating area, particularly in the context of nonrecursive results and fractal constructions referenced by Ko, Ko, and Weihrauch.
