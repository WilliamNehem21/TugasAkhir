This academic paper outlines the methodical principles that underpin the research (Section 2); demonstrates this method through a basic hybrid thermostat model (Section 3); discusses an informal mathematical analysis of the model to illustrate central concepts (Section 4); provides a detailed formal analysis using the Coq theorem prover (Section 5); and concludes with final remarks (Section 6).

The paper discusses using a heat pulse in response to temperature (T) falling below a certain threshold, highlighting this as a case of digital control logic interacting with physical dynamics. This simple thermostat model is seen as a starting point for exploring more complex cyber-physical systems, addressing the need to represent these systems causally and to manage ambiguity in the conversion from analog to digital signals.

Regarding the mathematical description, the thermostat's behavior is quantified by considering the thermal dynamics which are linear with respect to the heat input, denoted as Q. Events that transpire at a precise time are incorporated into the model so that their influence is represented accurately.

The formal proof within the paper is organized into four main cases, as previously introduced. Each case is resolved using a specific lemma, with statements that correspond to the conditions outlined in the informal analysis, though the proof details for these lemmas are not provided in the paraphrased excerpt.
