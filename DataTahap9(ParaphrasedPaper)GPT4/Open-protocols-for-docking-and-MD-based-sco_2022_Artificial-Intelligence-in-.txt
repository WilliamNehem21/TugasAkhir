Understanding the spatial arrangement of peptide substrates is critical to predict how they interact with molecular targets. Research in peptide molecular docking has helped address the issue of predicting the bound conformations for these flexible molecules. Several computational strategies have been developed for this purpose, including methods that build the peptide step-by-step to address flexibility while still predicting energetically favorable conformations related to biological activity. Techniques like molecular dynamics (MD) can sample these complexes, using amino acid force field parameters to explore peptide interactions. Additionally, alternative tools can predict peptides' structural conformations, which can be compared with experimental results.

Combining physics-based and machine learning approaches reduces computational costs and enhances the prediction accuracy of traditional methods using existing datasets. Innovations include methods that speed up quantum chemical calculations with models trained on pre-computed parameters. In MD contexts, descriptors can be extracted from trajectory data and merged with chemical information about the molecules. The Molecular Dynamics Fingerprints package (MDFP) can compute a set of fingerprints by averaging energy terms and recording observables from MD simulations, such as solvent accessible surface area and hydrogen bond evolution. These have been used to calculate solvation free energies and in binding studies involving proteins. The protocol can be adjusted for peptides in virtual screening studies.

The main code includes two scripts—one using Bash command lines and another in Python—to extract these descriptors, stored as pickled objects for later use by machine learning models. A protein-peptide MD trajectory example is provided in the code repository for reproducing the results.
