The paper discusses the limited research on the impact of precision agriculture (PA) on yield, quality, and farm income in China, which may be hindering its widespread adoption. It analyzes the economic aspects of PA, accounting for various costs like service charges for cultivation, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and management, noting that labor costs are integrated into the service fees charged by agricultural and farmers' cooperatives.

The study employs a formula to calculate total cultivation costs, incorporating agricultural material costs, agro-mechanization service costs, and managerial pay, based on the amounts and prices of inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.

It references the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an effective tool for assessing winter wheat condition and yield estimates in North China, suggesting that precision sowing and laser land leveling (PSLL) methods can enhance growth and reduce variability in crops compared to conventional farming.

Concerns are raised about increased risks of nitrogen leaching due to higher soil nitrate and ammonium nitrogen residues post-harvest. While some research shows PA technologies improve nitrogen utilization and reduce residues, others doubt the economic viability of these technologies. Studies cited in the paper indicate that the benefits of laser land leveling can last for three years or more, increasing the benefit-cost ratio over time.

The role of agricultural policies is highlighted as influential in farmer decision-making. The development of supportive government policies, such as subsidies for PA technologies, is recommended to help promote the widespread use of PA in China.

The comparison of PA methods, including precision seeding and a combination of precision seeding with laser leveling, shows increased winter wheat yield and reduced spatial variability in conventional large-scale farming. Additionally, PA techniques did not negatively affect the grain protein content, suggesting these methods maintain crop quality.
