The paper discusses that typical power consumption models operate with fixed input parameters, which introduces uncertainty due to incomplete information as these parameters are estimated from a limited number of samples. This form of uncertainty is referred to as epistemic uncertainty and it's important to consider how it propagates to the outputs of the model.

To examine the effects of epistemic uncertainty on power consumption, the authors conducted an empirical study using an ASUS desktop computer, detailing its specifications and workload conditions. They extend their findings to the context of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), focusing on how uncertainty in the power consumption of a server affects the estimated load on the UPS and consequently, its battery life.

Existing power models used in data-center research, including linear models and ones used for energy-aware resource allocation in cloud environments, are discussed. These generally consider power consumption to linearly increase with CPU utilization, and the paper discusses the proportion of idle to busy power consumption and the additional costs associated with cooling.

The study then shifts to assessing the lifetime of a UPS battery under uncertain power model inputs. Several battery models are mentioned, with the Kinetic Battery Model (KiBaM) chosen for its simplicity and accessibility to less experienced users. The authors highlight that previous work has not accounted for the number of input parameter observations when expressing output uncertainty, which their approach considers.

Finally, the paper emphasizes that this is the first time epistemic uncertainty propagation has been applied to power consumption models in this context, setting apart this work from previous studies that have assumed exactness in input parameters without addressing sample size considerations.

Overall, the paper is concerned with understanding and quantifying the impacts of input uncertainties on power consumption predictions and the subsequent effect on systems that rely upon these predictions, such as UPS units designed to maintain server operations during power outages.
