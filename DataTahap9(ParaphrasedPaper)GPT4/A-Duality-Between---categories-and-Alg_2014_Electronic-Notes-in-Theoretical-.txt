Stralka and Lawson's paper discusses two fundamental dualities within domain theory: the initial duality is between the category of partially ordered sets (posets) and the category of algebraic domains. This initial duality can lead to the generation of numerous other dualities. The second duality exists between the category of domains (specifically, continuous directed-complete partial orders or dcpos) and the category of completely distributive lattices.
