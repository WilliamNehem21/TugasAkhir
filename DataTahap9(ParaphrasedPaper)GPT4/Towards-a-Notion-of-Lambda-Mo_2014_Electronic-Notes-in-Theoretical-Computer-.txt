The authors of the paper introduce a definition of algebraic theory that closely aligns with the frameworks used for operads or symmetric operads, acknowledging that such definitions involve extensive structural detail, which in turn supports the use of abstract concepts.

The paper emphasizes a preferred definition of algebraic theory from a category theory standpoint, pointing out the straightforward relationship between cartesian operads and algebraic theories. Specifically, it notes that every cartesian operad can lead to the construction of an algebraic theory, and conversely, one can derive the associated cartesian operad from an algebraic theory with relative ease.

The authors argue that the category theoretic approach to defining algebraic theory is more concise and maintains a focus on the crucial concept of functoriality. When setting aside the category theory view, a simpler and more elementary description can suffice.

Further into the discussion, they address the need for unit and associativity laws to complement identity, projections, and compositions. These laws, alongside those for the monoid, are presented with modifications to account for retraction. They aim to align these laws with those featured in an earlier section of the paper.
