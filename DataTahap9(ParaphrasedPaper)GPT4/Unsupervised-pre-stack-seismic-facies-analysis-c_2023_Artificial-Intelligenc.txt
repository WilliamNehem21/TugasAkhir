In the paper, the authors discuss a novel method for classifying seismic facies, which takes into account the strong correlations that typically exist between adjacent geological reflectors, a phenomenon well-established by geology and stratigraphy. xi denotes the i-th sample and vk is the k-th cluster center, both with the same feature dimension. The probability that sample xi belongs to cluster center vk is represented by uik, and q is a manually specified weighted index that influences this association.

The method presented, Fuzzy C-Means with Cross-Entropy (FCM-CEC), improves upon the traditional Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm by incorporating the lateral continuity of geological formations and recognizing the impact of anomalies such as karst caves and faults that make hard clustering inadequate. The FCM-CEC method utilizes cross-entropy as a measure of distance and includes it within the loss function of the FCM algorithm, accounting for the spatial relationship between elements and thereby increasing the robustness and lateral continuity in seismic facies maps.

The categorization of data points in the FCM-CEC method is a dynamic process in which cluster centers are continually updated, and the algorithm accounts for the effect of all data points, regardless of noise influence. Data less affected by noise are given higher probability values early in the process and have a higher chance of being categorized similarly to neighboring reflectors, thereby having a more significant impact on subsequent iterations. Conversely, the influence of noisier data diminishes over time. This selective weighting of more reliable samples is what the authors suggest leads to the superior performance of the FCM-CEC method.

Traditional seismic facies analysis methods often fail to consider the natural continuity between seismic gathers, resulting in discontinuous maps. The proposed FCM-CEC method, however, incorporates the continuity of formation strata as prior information in the seismic reflection element clustering process. Evaluation using synthetic and real seismic data indicates that the FCM-CEC method provides more consistent seismic facies maps, with clearer geological body delineation and reduced boundary uncertainties, as well as improved insights into lithology.
