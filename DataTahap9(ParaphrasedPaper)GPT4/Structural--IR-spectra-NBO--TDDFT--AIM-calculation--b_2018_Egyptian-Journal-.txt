The Fukui function (FF) is a tool used to identify the reactive parts of a molecule by providing insights into the likelihood of chemical reactions at specific sites. The atom bearing the highest FF value within a molecule is generally considered the most reactive. The research examines how Fukui functions can pinpoint where molecules are most prone to nucleophilic or electrophilic attacks, particularly focusing on how these functions vary when computed using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory.

By analyzing the Mulliken atomic charges in neutral, positive (cation), and negative (anion) states of the studied molecule—2-{[5-(adamantan-1-yl)-4-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl]sulfanyl}-N,N-dimethylethanamine—the research establishes a comparison with other molecules and compounds. For instance, the molecule's reactive nature is compared to that of thiazole azo dyes, which are shown to be nearly one-fifth as reactive.

Additionally, urea, a compound with well-known nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, is used as a reference to gauge the NLO capacity of the studied molecule. The results indicate that the hyperpolarizability (a measure of NLO properties) of the analyzed compound is almost nine times greater than that of urea. This suggests the molecule could be an excellent candidate for NLO materials.
