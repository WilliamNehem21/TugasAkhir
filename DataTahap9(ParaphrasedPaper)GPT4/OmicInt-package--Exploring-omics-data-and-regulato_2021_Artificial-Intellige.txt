The paper discusses a computational tool that enables researchers to categorize phenotypes and provides detailed descriptors of pathologies. The tool offers features such as scatter and dimension reduction visualizations to help analyze clusters and attributes within the dataset. It also generates a summary report detailing cluster classifications, which can be utilized for further analysis in other models. These insights allow for an examination of how different clusters and gene expression patterns are influenced by association and network size. 

Moreover, the tool includes capabilities that facilitate the summarization of gene functional categories and prediction of cellular compartments associated with genes/proteins. When examining expression variations or disease correlations, these functionalities can bring to light patterns within distinct cellular states. A specialized function for extracting gene pattern profiles also exists. This function supports the further refinement of putative causal gene networks while focusing on specific phenotypes or conditions.
