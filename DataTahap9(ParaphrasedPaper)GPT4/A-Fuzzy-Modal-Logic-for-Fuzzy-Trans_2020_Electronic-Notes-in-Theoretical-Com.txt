For the past five decades, the fields of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic have drawn considerable research interest. Various formalisms such as fuzzy automata, fuzzy Markov processes, fuzzy Petri nets, fuzzy reactive frames, and fuzzy discrete event systems have been explored to model computational systems that incorporate uncertainty and imprecision using fuzzy sets. This paper specifically delves into fuzzy transition systems or fuzzy labeled transition systems, which broaden the concept of traditional transition systems.

Kripke semantics, which are used in modal logic, are characterized by graphs with edges labeled by propositional symbols and are versatile tools for modeling various scenarios, including those in network science, graph theory, epistemic logic, and also for considerations related to time, beliefs, and computational systems. Nevertheless, there exist circumstances under which it is not possible to definitively assert the existence or absence of a transition (or edges in a graph). In such cases, the most appropriate approach is to assign a degree of likelihood to the presence of these state transitions, giving rise to the concept of fuzzy state transitions.
