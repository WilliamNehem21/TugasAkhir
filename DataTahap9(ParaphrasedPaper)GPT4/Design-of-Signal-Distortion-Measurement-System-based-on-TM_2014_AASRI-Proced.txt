The Real FFT (RFFT) optimization algorithms we employed substantially reduce the computational workload by nearly 50% and conserve memory space as well. Undoubtedly, this RFFT optimization significantly enhances processing speed, effectively doubling it, and is a central part of our design approach.

Our DSP-integrated ADC is 12-bit; however, actual sampling falls short of 10 bits, resulting in low sampling accuracy. To improve this, we must segregate the digital and analog power designs. In order to minimize the interference from digital signal lines, we connected the ADC input to the ADcinxx pin and used an external reference.

In our research, we developed a signal distortion measurement system based on the enhanced FFT algorithm we proposed. Field testing indicates that this technique is an effective solution for distortion measurement. It has shown notable success in reducing spectral leakage, leading to more accurate measurements. Furthermore, the measuring instrument designed using our method is affordable, simple to construct, and portable, addressing the limitations of on-site testing in engineering projects. The approach presented here holds substantial potential for practical implementation.
