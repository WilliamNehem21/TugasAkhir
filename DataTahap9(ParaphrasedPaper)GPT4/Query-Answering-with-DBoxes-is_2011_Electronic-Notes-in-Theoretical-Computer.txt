Description Logics (DLs) are a group of logics for knowledge representation that underlie OWL 2, a web ontology language. A common purpose of systems based on DL is to store domain facts in a knowledge base (KB) and to query it. A DL KB typically is composed of two parts: the TBox, which is the conceptual framework, and the ABox, containing specific facts about entities. For instance, the TBox may define that a father is a male with children, while the ABox could state that John is a father and Mary is his daughter. Conjunctive Queries (CQs), sourced from database theory, are extensively utilized for querying DL KBs.

An example of a TBox (T) could state that all employees work on a project, and an ABox (A) might declare that John is an employee and 'prja' is a project. Certain answers to the query about who works for 'prja' would be empty because the ABox accepts models where 'prja' could have either workers or none, hence introducing uncertainty for relational database-experienced developers.

To counteract this confusion, DBoxes are recently introduced as an alternative to ABoxes. DBoxes, although syntactically similar to ABoxes, interpret the absence of information as negative, much like database instances. For example, substituting an ABox with a DBox in the aforementioned example would yield a definite answer of 'John' to the query on who works for 'prja'. Related to nominals in hybrid logics, DBoxes create a nexus between hybrid logics, DLs, and databases.

DL-Lite_F with DBoxes aligns with an expressive DL, namely ALCFIO (ALC with functional, inverse roles, and nominals), because it incorporates limited forms of these features. Assessing the complexity of queries in DL-Lite_F with DBoxes presents an intriguing issue due to the unknown complexity in ALCFIO.

The paper is organized into distinct sections. Section 2 reviews DL basics and CQs, explaining their syntax, semantics, and model matching. Section 3 introduces DBoxes for representing knowledge and outlines query entailment with DBoxes. Section 4 details data complexity for DL-Lite_F query entailment with DBoxes, while Section 5 draws a polynomial reduction between query problems in ALCFIO and ALCFI enhanced with DBoxes.

In summary, this academic paper discusses the structure of DL knowledge bases, the concept of DBoxes for clearer semantics in data representation, and the complexities involved in querying such structures. It offers insight into how DBoxes can provide straightforward database-like interpretations while connecting to DLs and hybrid logics, potentially elucidating query complexity in more expressive DLs.
