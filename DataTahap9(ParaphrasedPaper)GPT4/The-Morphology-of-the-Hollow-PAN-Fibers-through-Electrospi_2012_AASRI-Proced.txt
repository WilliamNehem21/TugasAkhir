The paper details a method for creating hollow micro/nano fibers using a dual-component electrospinning process, which also examines how different production parameters may affect the resulting fiber morphology. Experimental results show that uniform hollow PAN fibers are produced when the inner solution is fed at rates of 0.08 ml/h for single hollow fibers and 0.06 ml/h for double hollow fibers. The optimal conditions for quality fiber morphology were identified as a 15kV operating voltage and a target distance of 20cm.

Electrospinning equipment typically includes a spinneret, solution feed system, fiber collection apparatus, and high-voltage power supply. Unlike traditional spinnerets that yield circular solid fibers, a new coaxial electrospinning device can create both single and multiple hollow micro/nano fibers.

For the experiments, PAN with a molecular weight of 50,000 was supplied by Petro-Chemicals Jinshan Co., Ltd. DMF and PVP were acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. A high-voltage power supply from Kansai Electronics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., and a precision syringe pump from Tech-Knowledge International, Inc., were used. Fiber morphology was analyzed using a Hitachi S-3000N scanning electron microscope.

It was found that an excessively fast feed rate can cause double hollow fibers to merge and potentially fracture. Voltage plays a critical role in fiber formation; at low voltages, fibers were irregular with bead-like structures, while higher voltages reduced fiber diameters yet required careful control to avoid excessive continuity disruption and irregular diameter distribution. An optimal voltage of 15kV was determined for fiber quality, and the opportunity to refine fiber diameters further in a post-drawing process was noted.
