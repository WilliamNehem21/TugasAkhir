This academic paper discusses a model called "MCPAL" that facilitates adaptive collaboration in dynamic systems. MCPAL allows for the introduction of new constraints and control mechanisms as needed for system adaptation without requiring a pause in the system's operation. This adaptation is coordinated on-the-fly, ensuring continuous operation during the migration to new collaborative states. The adaptation process and the dynamic consistency of the migrating system are formally analyzed using process algebra. This formal analysis demonstrates that the system properly transitions from its current state (as-is) to the desired future state (to-be).

The system's migration is modeled using process algebra (PA), which captures the communication between components and can formally verify the adaptation process's progress properties. The paper explains how collaborative roles impose dynamic constraints which guide the system through various state transitions, ensuring correct coordination. Special 'connecting traps' act as guards for these transitions, often executed in conjunction with other components.

MCPAL is responsible for managing the migration by initiating and controlling the transition of system components to their new roles. Even if some components are ready for new dynamics, MCPAL ensures these are excluded until the system is prepared. MCPAL's migration coordination is illustrated through four rules that guide the system from the initial state to a round-robin scheduling protocol.

The paper describes how MCPAL and other components are represented as PA processes, allowing for formal proofs of successful migration. This PA specification is also compatible with the model checker tool "mCRL2", enabling further analysis.

It is emphasized that MCPAL's design is more versatile compared to previous iterations because it can handle numerous migration steps, alternative paths, and iterations simultaneously. This flexibility allows MCPAL to manage adaptations that are more complex and comprehensive.

Lastly, the paper acknowledges that while there is significant research on dynamic system adaptation, formal analysis of the adaptation process is often overlooked. Exceptions are mainly found within the WCAT community, which uses process languages and modeling to express and analyze adaptations at runtime. However, there is still a lack of tool support for formal analysis, and typically, components cannot be changed during runtime without replacement.

The five-step framework that MCPal uses to manage adaptation and maintain ongoing collaboration is highlighted as the core process for system evolution, serving as both a redesigner for architectural changes and a redirector for continuous collaboration.
