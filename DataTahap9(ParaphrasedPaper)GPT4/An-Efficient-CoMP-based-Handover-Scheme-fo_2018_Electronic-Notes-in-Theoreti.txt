Inter-cell interference (ICI) is anticipated to be a significant challenge that degrades performance at the edges of cells in future wireless networks. This issue is exacerbated by the dense deployment of micro and macro cells. To address this, the Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) technique has emerged to combat ICI in developing wireless networks and boost performance at cell borders. Though CoMP has been effective in solving various edge-related issues, current CoMP handover strategies still trigger unnecessary handovers.

This paper introduces a new CoMP-based handover scheme designed to decrease unnecessary handovers by considering signal measurements such as Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Received Signal Received Quality (RSRQ). By incorporating RSRP and RSRQ evaluations, a more reliable decision-making process for CoMP and handover actions at the cell edge is enabled. Simulations demonstrate that activating CoMP mode consistently improves network performance by progressively cutting down on needless handovers.

CoMP, a feature of Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A), offers numerous solutions for handling inter-cell and intra-cell interference, playing a key role in enhancing cell edge performance. As user mobility increasingly influences network performance, particularly in scenarios of high-speed travel or crowded venues, wireless networks face greater challenges. The handover mechanism in cellular technologies aims to ensure ongoing connectivity for users as they move from the coverage area of one cell to another, a process that's especially complex at cell boundaries where signals are weaker due to distance and interference from adjacent cells.

LTE-A algorithms exploit hysteresis and handover margin values to minimize nonessential handovers. Some previous studies introduced adaptive hysteresis algorithms and methods to control handovers in dense networks by creating a shortlist of candidates based on their distance and movement direction from the base station. However, these studies often overlooked factors like network load and edge interference, both crucial in future handover decision-making.

The proposed handover scheme in this paper aims to reduce unnecessary switches between base stations, thereby optimizing cell edge user experiences. The scheme is divided into two modes: CoMP mode and handover mode. In CoMP mode, when a user equipment (UE) encounters low RSRP but acceptable RSRQ, the scheme opts for CoMP instead of traditional handover, allowing data reception from multiple base stations or focused signaling from one. Conversely, when both RSRP and RSRQ are inadequate, the scheme initiates a handover. The proposed approach uses a combination of logic and mathematics to determine when to trigger CoMP, with specific emphasis on scenarios where UE experiences power reduction and signal distortion due to distance and environmental factors such as fading. The goal is to enable smarter handovers that account for these challenges, thus enhancing user experience at the edges of network cells.
