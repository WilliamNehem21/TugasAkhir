The detection of personality traits is a vital task in text analytics within natural language processing (NLP). Text analytics involves extracting meaningful information from written content. While deep learning models often achieve high performance in such tasks, they tend to be difficult to interpret. Inductive transfer learning has greatly impacted computer vision (CV), yet NLP strategies often demand task-specific modifications and training from the ground up.

This research focuses on classifying personality traits by applying the Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) approach to detect personality features. ULMFiT, which leverages transfer learning, surpasses traditional shallow word embedding methods and has exhibited superior capability across various NLP challenges.

The link between personality traits and diseases has been thoroughly explored and is acknowledged by healthcare experts. Personality detection is also useful in forensic science, potentially narrowing down the list of suspects at a crime scene by understanding their personality traits.

Deep learning structures and NLP tasks are common topics in scientific literature, which can be challenging to understand due to technical jargon. The rapid proliferation of online documents in multiple languages has created a demand for their critical assessment.

Transfer learning, which involves applying knowledge from a base task to a new task, is particularly effective when the base features are generalizable. In CV, features are often extracted using pre-trained models such as AlexNet, ResNet, and MS-COCO. However, the concept hadn't gained traction in NLP until Howard and Ruder introduced ULMFiT. ULMFiT's significant advancement was its deep pre-trained word representations, transitioning from shallow to profound model architectures. It uses the AWD-LSTM (average stochastic gradient descent-weighted dropout long short-term memory) language model, which has established ULMFiT as a state-of-the-art technique.

Majumder et al. achieved groundbreaking results using an essays dataset by encoding essays from the word to the sentence level and employing 3-dimensional convolution. Future research may involve adding more features and pre-processing, such as filtering out spam or repetitive words.

The study presents an efficient and interpretable model based on language modeling, which is trained using gradual unfreezing and differential learning rates. Varying dropout rates are applied across different layers, with fine-tuning of the forward and backward LMs for 10 epochs each. The fine-tuning process varies in time based on the class, while the classifier, being heavier, requires a smaller batch size and slightly less dropout.

The model showed superior performance on the agreeableness (AGR) personality trait by 2.54% and competitive performance on the other traits by at least 0.5%. It was trained using both forward and backward LMs on general-domain and task-specific datasets, which were subsequently combined into an ensemble for the best accuracy results.
