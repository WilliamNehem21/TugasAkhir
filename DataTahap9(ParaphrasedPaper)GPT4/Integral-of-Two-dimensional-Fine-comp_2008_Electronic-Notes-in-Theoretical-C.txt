The function j(x, n) adheres to the principles of effective uniformity, as described in the referenced context. The topology that arises from the use of i(n, k) is referred to as the fine topology, and any terminology associated with this topology includes the word "fine" as a prefix. Terms that are derived from the Euclidean topology remain without any prefix.

In the demonstration of Proposition 3.1, the essential aspects come from Lemma 2.1. Furthermore, Lemma 3.2 is the specific equivalent in two dimensions. A key observation is that the set complement of a finite, non-overlapping collection of primary dyadic intervals can be expressed as another finite, non-overlapping collection of primary dyadic intervals. This observation is also true for primary dyadic rectangles. These properties allow the assertion of a new proposition related to these concepts.
