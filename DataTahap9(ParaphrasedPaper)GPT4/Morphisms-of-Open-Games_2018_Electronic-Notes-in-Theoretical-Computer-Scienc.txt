This academic paper presents a theoretical discussion on the categorization of open games, emphasizing the utility of characterizing them with universal properties to enable more abstract reasoning. The authors introduce "contravariant lens morphisms" as a general type of morphism between open games, exploring the implications and applications of this structure.

The paper suggests that these morphisms should be representable as visual constructions, such as surface diagrams or cobordisms—a type of topological connection—between the string diagrams that represent open games. The authors aspire to one day understand game theory entirely through these surface diagrams. Further, open games and their morphisms are shown to form a bicategory, but double-categorical structures are proposed to offer more general utility.

Definition 2.4 describes a strategy in an extensive-form game as a function where each player's information set leads to an action choice. A strategy profile is simply a collection of such strategies for all players. Definition 2.6 outlines a subgame as a subtree where if one node is part of the subgame, then any other node with the same information set in the larger game is also included in the subgame. 

The authors propose the term "bimorphic lens" to differentiate it from known monomorphic and polymorphic lenses, with bimorphic lenses not necessarily adhering to the traditional lens laws. The discussion highlights that bimorphic lenses play a role in compositional game theory where arbitrary lenses are considered. 

The paper explains that while there are expectations that all sensible definitions of morphisms between open games will align on what is called globular morphisms, the necessity for more than just these standard morphisms is demonstrated. The authors acknowledge different morphisms than those previously established but note that the underlying globular morphisms remain consistent.

Finally, the paper elaborates on pseudo double categories, where vertical morphisms create standard categories, and horizontal morphisms form bicategories when considering invertible 2-cells. The authors describe a structure where objects are disets, horizontal 1-cells are open games, vertical 1-morphisms are reversed lenses, and 2-cells are the defined contravariant lens morphisms. The paper largely follows established notations for symmetric monoidal pseudo double categories.
