The paper discusses a specific subcategory, termed alg(ffi,), which is a part of the broader category alg s. It is stated that alg(ffi,) is not just any subcategory but a full subcategory within alg s. The authors also note that it is straightforward to confirm that alg(ffi,) is stable with respect to both limits and filtered colimits when considered in the context of alg s.

From these properties, it is deduced that alg(ffi,) qualifies as a reflective subcategory. The details for this can be found in the referenced Theorem 2.48.

Furthermore, the paper highlights that since the forgetful functor associated with alg(ffi,) is simply a more constrained version of the forgetful functor for alg s, the argument or claim initially presented is consequently supported.
