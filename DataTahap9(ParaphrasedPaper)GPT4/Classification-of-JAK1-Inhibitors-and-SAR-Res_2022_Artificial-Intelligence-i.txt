Exploring the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity, known as structure-activity relationship (SAR), is a crucial endeavor in medicinal chemistry. SAR analysis pinpoints essential structural components that influence molecular activity and assists in identifying clinically relevant candidate molecules. A related technique, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), involves predicting molecular properties by linking molecular structure descriptors with biological activity data through linear or non-linear correlations. To construct SAR and QSAR models, researchers have utilized various machine learning (ML) techniques, including decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). These models depend on molecular descriptors, which encapsulate the physical, chemical, or structural attributes of compounds. Finding the optimal descriptors is a key step in model development to enhance predictive performance.

The paper discusses a dataset of 2982 Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitors, among which 1712 were highly active (IC50 < 50 nm) and 1270 were weakly active (IC50 > 100 nm). Compounds with IC50 values between 50 nm and 100 nm were excluded from the study. The dataset is available in a CSV file format as part of the supplementary materials.

Extended Connection Fingerprints (ECFPs) are a variant of Morgan fingerprints used to encode molecular information into bit strings, with the flexibility to adjust radius and bit count based on the molecule's characteristics. Increasing radius and bits can capture more information, but at the cost of generating large, sparse, and potentially redundant matrices. In this study, the authors optimized the information by calculating 4096-bit Morgan fingerprints with a radius of four and then eliminated bits with variance below the average, yielding final molecular fingerprints with 80 bits (MACCS) and 958 bits (Morgan fingerprints).

The researchers utilized the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, an ensemble approach that builds and integrates multiple decision trees based on bagging for classification tasks. To classify their dataset, the trees collectively contribute to the final decision through their individual classifications. The RF algorithm's parameters, including criterion, max_features, max_depth, max_leaf_nodes, and n_estimators, were fine-tuned using grid optimization to identify the most suitable combination within the parameter space.

Lastly, the study identified a subset of inhibitors characterized by a six-membered aliphatic ring lacking heteroatoms or aliphatic chains and containing a pyrrolotriazolopyrimidine feature due to a sequence of three nitrogen atoms. Out of 35 inhibitors possessing these characteristics, 33 were categorized as weakly active.
