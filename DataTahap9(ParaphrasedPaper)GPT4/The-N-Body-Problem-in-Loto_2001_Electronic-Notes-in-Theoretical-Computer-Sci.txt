The academic paper presents the use of the language LOTOS (Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification) as a unified framework to simulate a variety of problems typically treated separately in physics, such as the n-body problem and gas motion. LOTOS allows the consolidation of various problem variants under a common approach for simulation purposes.

The paper outlines a strategy for simulating the n-body problem and its various adaptations using LOTOS. Section 2 introduces the framework and demonstrates how the classic n-body problem can be generalized. It explains how LOTOS is used to represent bodies in the system and manage their interactions, with a focus on both deterministic and non-deterministic behaviors, and the capability to temporarily remove or introduce bodies within the system.

Section 3 provides details on the tools available to support simulations in LOTOS, while Section 4 further explores the problem variations. The process of body state updates, state broadcasting, and synchronization with a step control process is explained, highlighting how interactions between bodies are managed internally within a closed system without external influences.

The body state update mechanism features body activation or deactivation, the waiting phase until an update is available, and a check for matching identifiers to avoid conflicts. The step update process is responsible for accounting for changes in the number of active bodies.

Specification parameters control the simulation, including the number of steps, drawing modes, and various constants related to the bodies and their interactions. Sections 5 and 6 detail applications of the framework to the n-body problem and Brownian motion, illustrating how the specifications were implemented.

The applications include:

- The n-body problem emphasizes calculating forces between masses based on the gravitational constant and updating velocity and position using the simulation time-step.
- An orrery simulation, which is a model of the solar system based on the specifics of the n-body problem.
- A space game inspired by early computer games, where spaceships and missiles are influenced by the gravitational attraction of stars, also taking into account strategic maneuvers and collisions.
- Air traffic simulation, where aircraft adjust velocities toward waypoints while maintaining safe distances, although the rules are simplified and may not prevent conflicts.
- Sailing simulation, representing the influence of wind on a yacht's navigation and adherence to basic sailing rules.

LOTOS is adept at handling these diverse scenarios by specifying different body types, their attributes, and state update rules. Simulation steps are animated graphically, offering a visual representation of systems' behaviors, illustrating the versatility and broad application of LOTOS in modeling complex systems. The paper highlights the framework's capacity to address both conventional and novel applications within the same specification and simulation environment.
