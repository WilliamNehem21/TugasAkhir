In this study, we explore a type theory that includes dependent types, natural numbers, inductive types, and guarded recursion. The paper's presentation is non-formal in nature, but the findings can be systematically represented in Guarded Dependent Type Theory (GDTT) as previously documented. We begin by reviewing the foundational elements of this type theory and will introduce additional constructs as necessary throughout the paper.

In the Topos of Trees framework, the 'd' modality functions as a temporal delaying operator. The interpretation is such that dX(0) is true at the initial stage, but dX(n+1) refers to the value of X at the previous stage n. Conceptually, this means that the 'd' modality shifts the evaluation of a proposition forward by one time step. To illustrate, if the presheaf 0 represents a perpetually false proposition, then d^n0 would indicate a proposition that is treated as true for the first n computational intervals but considered false from the (n+1)-th step onward.
