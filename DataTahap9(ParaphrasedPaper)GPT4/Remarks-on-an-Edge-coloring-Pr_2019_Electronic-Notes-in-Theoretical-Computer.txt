In the given academic paper, the authors discuss embeddings of colored graphs. They define a concept wherein a multicolored cluster graph, denoted as H, is said to include another colored graph F if there exists a subgraph within H that is a color-matching replica of F. Specifically, each edge in F should match in color with the color options present in the corresponding edge's list in H. Furthermore, if F is not just a colored graph but also possesses a specific color arrangement referred to as pattern P, then H is said to "contain (F, P)" if H includes a colored version of F that adheres to a color pattern that is structurally equivalent to P. The authors state that there is an embedding theorem related to this definition, and they note that the proof of this theorem is derived using reasoning similar to that used in proving a key lemma within the body of work.
