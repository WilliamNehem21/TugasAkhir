This paper suggests enhancing the modularity of programming language descriptions by incorporating concepts from aspect-oriented programming into action semantics. Action semantics, which provides modular language feature descriptions, can be improved through an aspect-oriented approach to handle interdependencies more efficiently. 

Modularity, a system design principle that divides functionality into independent units, helps isolate changes to a single module without affecting others, thus promoting easier maintenance. Programming languages, increasingly complex, can benefit from modular descriptions for better analysis. Traditional semantic descriptions, such as operational and denotational semantics, lack sufficient modularity because they directly deal with programming languages' intricate information flow. 

Action semantics tackles this issue by characterizing program behavior with predefined entities like actions, representing dynamic executable units affecting state, and yielders, expressions that evaluate based on the current state.

The recommendation is to create programming language descriptions by merging self-contained elements into a cohesive whole where each element captures syntax, semantic functions, and semantic entities. This method makes individual language features easier to reuse and adapt.

The paper introduces an aspect-oriented action semantics description (AOASD) as a way to enhance modularity and reduce complexity, demonstrating its utility through case studies. It calls for further exploration into complex language descriptions utilizing aspect-oriented principles and suggests creating tools to support AOASD. Future improvements might also include advanced aspect-oriented features, such as inter-type declarations, to strengthen the approach.
