The project's motivation arises from a broader initiative to develop tool support for a real-time refinement calculus, recognizing the significance of real numbers in real-time systems due to their continuous nature. Real numbers are essential, for example, in systems like temperature sensors, where differential calculus, predicated on real numbers, is used to prescribe limits on temperature change rates. If real numbers are not used, only the weaker attributes of a discrete model can be formally asserted.

Mathematicians have defined various algebraic structures, such as monoids, groups, rings, and fields, through axioms, and identified shared theorems within these structures. The real numbers have commonalities with rationals, integers, and natural numbers; thus, by verifying that a model adheres to the axioms of an algebraic structure, one can apply the corresponding theorems to reason about the model. For example, the integers form an Abelian group under addition, which facilitates the reuse of theories and enhances confidence in system validity.

Dedekind represented a real number using "cuts," sets of all rational numbers less than it, subject to specific properties to ensure they form valid cuts. However, defining real multiplication is more complex, as naively multiplying rationals within a cut can lead to results that do not satisfy the conditions of a cut.

A well-structured hierarchy of algebraic structures like monoids and fields allows for theory reuse. The project's support system promotes this through mechanisms like theory instantiation, where including a theory syntactically involves renaming its symbols and retaining its axioms and properties.

Approaches to axiomatize algebraic structures, up to ordered fields, are considered. A single theory containing all necessary elements lacks modularity and creates other issues, whereas a more sophisticated method involves a chain of inherited theories. The selected method utilizes theory interpretation and instantiation, significantly reducing the number of theories needed and enhancing the opportunities for reusing theories and theorems.

Ultimately, the real numbers are proven to form a complete ordered field, satisfying the ordered field axioms and the supremum property. This theory development and axiomatization process is then extended to model the rationals and inherit the ordered field properties.

The process concludes by demonstrating that interpreting theories into a complete ordered field theory, such as with ordered pairs to model rationals, reduces the number of theories and simplifies the establishment of the ordered field axioms.

However, an anonymous referee points out that listing subtheory renamings may compromise the modularity as it causes the theory of rational ordered fields to be aware of the subtheories within the ordered field theory.
