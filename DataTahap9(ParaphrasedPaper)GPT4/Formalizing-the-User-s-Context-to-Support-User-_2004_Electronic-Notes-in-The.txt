This academic paper discusses the intricacy and development of formal specification and verification tools, known as provers, which have seen substantial growth in recent years. Programming languages like Java now have their formal semantics specified using these tools, generating proofs that span tens of thousands of lines and involve numerous strategies to verify thousands of theorems.

In military C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) systems, the concept of agents (such as generals, battleships, or tanks) is described. These agents possess a shared informational sphere with attributes like position and communication capabilities, but they also have unique interactive components based on their distinct roles.

Kind theory is applied to define the semantics of collaborative, reusable artifacts, which are the compositional elements of both proof scripts and theorems. This theory informs the formalization of semantic context in the user interfaces (UI) of theorem proving environments.

Several theorem proving interfaces, including Jape and CtCoq, serve as experimentation grounds for UI and human-computer interaction (HCI) advancements. Innovations from specialized environments are now often incorporated into more general-purpose interfaces. For example, features like proof-by-pointing and pretty-printing initially found in specific environments have been partially integrated into other works.

PCoq and IsaWin are advanced UIs for the Coq theorem prover and Isabelle, a proof assistant, respectively. While PCoq offers a graphical interface based on a structured representation of proof constructs, IsaWin uses an iconic representation which can be challenging to scale for complex artifacts.

Popular computational tools like Mathematica, Maple, and MATLAB offer rich UIs for mathematical operations, but this work doesn't intend to replicate them. Instead, the most useful features for daily work are studied and reformulated for theorem proving environments.

Within the PVS prover, second-level concepts include elements such as theory formals, theory relationships, and declarations. These are essential to define top-level notions in the prover's grammar.

For extended implicit hyperlinking, environments like Emacs or Microsoft Word are considered examples, linking documents to external resources such as dictionaries for spell-checking.

The PVS LaTeX printer, which generates formatted text from typechecked specifications, discriminates operators by arity and defining theory without relying on types to maintain simplicity.

Approaches for embedding alternative logics within PVS are explored. For instance, new parsers have been created for various logics, such as the duration calculus, to be compatible with PVS' abstract syntax.

An integrated environment extension of Emacs allows users to browse and interact with code and documents within a semantic context using a customizable interface.

Lastly, the paper highlights current limitations in UIs, such as symbolic representation challenges and difficulties in managing parameterized theories, suggesting that further research is necessary to overcome these obstacles.

The paper mentions refactoring operations, which are commonly used in programming to improve code without altering functionality, and illustrates how similar processes might be beneficial within interactive mathematical environments (IMEs).
