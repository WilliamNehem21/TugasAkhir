This paper presents an Enhanced Differential Evolution (EDE) algorithm designed to optimize real parameter functions in a continuous space. The key innovation is a novel mutation strategy that leverages both the best and worst individuals in the current generation to guide the search. This new mutation strategy is gradually blended with a traditional mutation approach to control the balance between exploration and exploitation throughout the optimization process.

To counteract premature convergence, the EDE merges a random mutation strategy with a strategy adapted from the Breeder Genetic Algorithm (BGA). Variability in the mutation is further increased by introducing random scaling factors and crossover probabilities.

The paper thoroughly evaluates the performance of the EDE algorithm using benchmark optimization problems, demonstrating its efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness compared to classical Differential Evolution (DE) methods and advanced adaptive DE variants. The results indicate that EDE not only competes well but also outperforms many of these methods in terms of solution quality, convergence rate, and robustness.

The paper is structured to first explain the standard DE algorithm, followed by a detailed presentation of the new EDE algorithm and its modifications. Subsequent sections provide computational results, compare EDE with other algorithms, discuss the effectiveness of modifications, and conclude with insights and directions for future research.
