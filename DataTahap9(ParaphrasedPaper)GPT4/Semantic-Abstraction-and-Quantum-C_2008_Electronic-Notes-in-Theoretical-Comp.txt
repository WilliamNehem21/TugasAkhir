The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse ensures that the abstractions created through the Partially Abstract Interpretation method are optimal. This means they are the nearest representations to the actual semantics when measured by the norm-induced distance in the Hilbert space. This proximity can be quantitatively assessed to examine the amount of information lost during abstraction.

Despite a system having a definitive state, the observation that occurs and the resulting state reduction is probabilistic. The likelihood of particular observations is influenced by the state being observed in relation to the specific observable. The underlying principle for this model of quantum measurement, also known as projective measurement, is based on the ability to perform a spectral decomposition of observables, such as finite-dimensional self-adjoint operators. Theorems from authoritative sources outline this for both finite and infinite-dimensional cases.

The paper also revisits the Deutsch problem along with the quantum circuit designed for its resolution. It examines the scenario for a unary Boolean function. The insights gained from this instance can be extrapolated to n-ary Boolean functions in a manner similar to how the Deutsch algorithm extends to the Deutsch-Josza algorithm.
