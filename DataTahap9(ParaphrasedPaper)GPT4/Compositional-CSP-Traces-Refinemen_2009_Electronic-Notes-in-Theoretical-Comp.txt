This paper discusses the ongoing challenge of state explosion in model checking, even after 25 years, emphasizing that as the number of parallel components in complex systems increases, so does the complexity of state spaces, often exponentially. To address state explosion, the paper highlights techniques like partial order reductions, symmetry reductions, abstraction strategies for parallel systems, and compositional verificationâ€”the area of focus for this study.

Consider a hypothetical scheduler managing a set of jobs, denoted by 'n'. Each job has a start and finish event, with the requirement that a job can only start again after it has finished. The paper then explores modeling these constraints using the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) language.

The article introduces a concurrency operator allowing for the parallel execution of CSP processes, requiring alphabets to specify the events that may need synchronization. CSP processes are defined to capture the scheduling constraints, using CSP's choice operator to handle alternative outcomes and a hiding operator to exclude artificial events from process traces.

The work leverages a learning algorithm for automatic assumption generation within a framework designed to verify properties of the modeled scheduler. By dividing the task between a learner and a teacher, the system incrementally constructs assumptions that can either prove or disprove the properties in question. Notably, the learner focuses on identifying the weakest assumption necessary for a successful verification, though it may also find intermediate, sufficient assumptions that terminate the learning earlier than expected.

To reduce computational overhead, the paper proposes optimizations such as caching and harnessing properties of CSP to avoid redundant computation. It also adopts a heuristic to decide when to make recursive calls to the learning algorithm based on the number of system components.

Comparative results indicate that for certain properties, compositional verification outperforms direct model checking using the Failures-Divergences Refinement (FDR) tool, depending largely on the relative size of the learning assumption compared to the component. The paper suggests that future work should look into predicting when compositional verification is likely to be advantageous.

The paper concludes by noting the benefits of a symmetric parallel proof rule, which allows assumptions to be learned independently for different system components, while ensuring these assumptions do not conflict. The authors' implementation can alternate between two proof rules, enhancing the efficacy and flexibility of the verification process.
