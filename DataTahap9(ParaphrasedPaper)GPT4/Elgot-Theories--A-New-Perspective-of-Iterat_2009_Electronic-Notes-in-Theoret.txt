The subsequent phase involves demonstrating that the morphisms in question, denoted as 'ma,' constitute a natural transformation 'm: rh â†’ zs.' Further, it is essential to establish 'm' as a monad morphism, and specifically, as a morphism of Elgot monads. The complexity of the proof arises from the need to apply Elgot monads' axioms for 'rh' as well as from the intricate definition of the dagger operation within 'rh,' which is elaborated across multiple stages, as referenced. However, due to the limitations posed by the available space, it is not possible to include the intricate details of the proof in this context.
