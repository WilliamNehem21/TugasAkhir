In this academic paper, deep learning (DL) is described as a branch of machine learning (ML) that is influenced by the architecture of the human brain. Unlike traditional ML, where the programmer handcrafts data features for algorithms like decision trees and logistic regressions, deep learning automates feature extraction through representation learning. This approach involves feeding raw data such as images or text to algorithms, allowing them to learn from the information directly.

The paper discusses a specialized deep learning model based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, which incorporates elements like CSP1-N and CSP2-N blocks in the backbone and neck regions, and employs DenseNet for enhancing feature utilization. This model successfully detected four distinct diseases in tomato plants using a Kaggle-derived dataset of 1,200 images, expanded to 12,000 through augmentation, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 96.29%, which surpasses the YOLOv4's 92.84% mAP.

Additionally, a Dense-YOLOv4 model was developed for monitoring mango growth stages, using a 10-fold augmented dataset of 420 images. It achieved a high detection performance with an mAP of 96.20% at 44.2 frames per second, outperforming the standard YOLOv4 by 4.73% in mAP.

YOLOv5 was utilized for classifying seed quality, with a dataset comprising 3,954 images of pearl millet and healthy or diseased maize, attaining 99% precision and recall in the classification task.

In an effort to assist with the detection of strawberry diseases, a modified YOLOv4 network called DAC-YOLOv4 was conceived, incorporating depth-wise convolutions and hybrid attention mechanisms. This network achieved a 72.7% mAP and was significantly more compact than the original YOLOv4.

The study also involved manually collecting images of multiple leguminous seeds, which were classified by the Darknet framework implementing YOLOv4. A TensorFlow-based Faster R-CNN model with an InceptionV2 backbone was compared, requiring conversion of data to the TFRecord format.

The paper explains that object detectors comprise three main parts: a backbone for feature extraction, a neck for feature layer combination, and a head for detection. Object detection challenges include both classification and localization of objects within images.

Two-stage object detectors like Faster R-CNN, which uses region proposals and feature maps to predict classes and bounding boxes, were compared to one-stage detectors like YOLO that predict in a single network pass.

Precision and recall metrics are crucial for evaluating object detection systems, with the potential to adjust the trade-off between them for specific applications. Accuracy can be misleading in unbalanced datasets, whereas the F1 score provides a balanced metric that takes into account both false positives and negatives.

Intersection Over Union (IoU) criteria are used to assess the accuracy of predicted bounding boxes, categorizing them as true positives, false positives, or false negatives, with a common threshold set to 0.5.

The paper also highlights the challenges of small object detection, such as seeds, and asserts that YOLOv4's mosaic data augmentation and transfer learning have been effective for accurate seed identification and localization in complex backgrounds. With less than 2% error rate and under 2 seconds of processing time, the YOLOv4 model is presented as an efficient tool for detecting leguminous seeds.
