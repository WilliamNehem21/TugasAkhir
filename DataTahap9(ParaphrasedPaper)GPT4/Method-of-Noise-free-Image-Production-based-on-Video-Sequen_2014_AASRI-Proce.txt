In examining the operational specifics of the algorithm, we assume the presence of two black and white (monochromatic) images, denoted by imageref and imagecurrent. Both images are characterized by a matrix of dimensions h (height) x w (width). The goal is to identify a transformation applicable to the imagecurrent matrix that would align it with the imageref matrix in a manner that reduces the disparity in luminance between the two images to the lowest possible extent.
