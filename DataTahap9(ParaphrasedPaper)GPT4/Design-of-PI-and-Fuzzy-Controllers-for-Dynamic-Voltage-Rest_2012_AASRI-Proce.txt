The contemporary era places a high importance on maintaining power quality, particularly given the proliferation of advanced equipment that demands a consistent and high-quality power supply to function optimally. To address power quality issues, custom power devices are deployed, among which the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) stands out as an exceedingly efficient and effective solution within power distribution networks. The attractiveness of DVRs is attributed to their affordability, compactness, and rapid responsiveness to disruptions. This study showcases the development, exploration, and simulation of a DVR through MATLAB, examining the device's performance with both Proportional-Integral (PI) and fuzzy logic controllers.
