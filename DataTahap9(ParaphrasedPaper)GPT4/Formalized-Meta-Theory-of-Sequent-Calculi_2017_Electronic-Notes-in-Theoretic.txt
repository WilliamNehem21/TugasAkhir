The researchers have used the proof assistant Abella due to their familiarity with it, although they mention that their work doesn't rely on exclusive features of Abella and similar results could be achieved with any proof assistant that supports induction. An example of this portability is demonstrated through their implementation of a multiset library and certain meta-theorems with proofs in Coq.

The paper describes a scenario dealing with proving properties of an arithmetic function, `plus`, using natural numbers. In one case, they consider the goal `plus (s x1) z (s x1)`, which simplifies to `plus x1 z x1` after applying the relevant arithmetic rule. The task is to prove this new goal under the assumption that `x1` is a natural number, utilizing the definition of `plus`.

It illustrates how annotations, marked with an asterisk (*), are used to indicate relative sizes of instances within their formal system. When they encounter the assumption `is_nat x@`, this annotation means that the size of the instance is strictly decreasing. They utilize the notion of reduction in size to apply inductive hypothesis in situations where, for example, `is_nat x1*` is strictly smaller than `is_nat x@` due to the decrementing property conveyed by these annotations.

They also discuss a more complex case where the inductive hypothesis is applied considering a lexicographic order based on the sizes of two given natural number instances, `is_nat x` and `is_nat y`. They write down specific inductive hypotheses that allow the inductive step to proceed when either `is_nat x` is strictly smaller, or `is_nat y` is strictly smaller while `is_nat x` remains the same.

In the narrative of their proof development, the authors remark that the proof of the theorem `plus_is` is conducted by straightforward induction on the structure of the `plus` function. They comment that additional conditions could have been added to the definitions to facilitate easier proof development, but they have elected to alter the definitions as little as possible to still obtain the necessary conclusions.
