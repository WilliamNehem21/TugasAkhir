This academic paper emphasizes the critical role of evaluation and continuous improvement in software maintenance to enhance software quality. However, the field lacks overarching management models to guide these improvements. The paper discusses the adoption of measurement practices aligned with the Software Maintenance Maturity Model (S3M) for organizations at maturity level 3 and above.

The paper underlines the fact that software maintenance often does not receive sufficient managerial focus and is plagued by reactive, crisis-driven approaches. This is compounded by the perception that maintenance is costly and inefficient. While compelling methodologies for improvement are proposed by researchers, these are frequently too technical and impractical for industry application, especially within smaller maintenance operations with limited resources.

Despite these challenges, some well-managed maintenance organizations have instituted effective practices, which are yet to gain widespread recognition or be articulated for broader industrial application. This contrasts with the software development domain, where numerous maturity models exist to assess and guide process enhancements.

The paper is structured into five sections: Section 2 introduces the interfaces and primary processes in software maintenance; Section 3 details the measurement practices using various sources to identify quantitative aspects essential for achieving maturity level 3 and beyond; Section 4 elaborates on these advanced measurement practices; Section 5 provides a summary and acknowledgments.

Additionally, the paper interacts with IEEE standards relating to software quality measurement, such as IEEE 1061, which offers examples of metrics without mandating any specific ones, and IEEE 982.2, which provides a dictionary of measures focusing on the reliability aspect of software quality.

Moreover, the concept of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is discussed, emphasizing their internal use within organizations to set expectations for maintenance services. While SLAs originated in the computing world of the 1950s, their adoption varies across organizations today.

Customers typically desire seamless and consistent services from their IS/IT departments, favoring SLAs that guarantee end-to-end service over those focusing on individual IS/IT components. Conversely, maintainers often support results-based SLAs, but they may not control the entire infrastructure where their products operate, complicating the measurement process.

The paper argues that at maturity level 3, various software maintenance measures have been defined and implemented as part of an organizational improvement initiative. Measurements should integrate with those for software development and operations. It highlights the importance of identifying key activities, services, and quality attributes of the maintained software for measurement. Clearly documented measurement objectives that align with the business goals and organizational contexts are also essential.

In summary, the academic paper outlines the importance of integrating advanced measurement practices within the framework of the S3M to enhance and evaluate the software maintenance function and calls for a more systematic approach to management and improvement in this area.
