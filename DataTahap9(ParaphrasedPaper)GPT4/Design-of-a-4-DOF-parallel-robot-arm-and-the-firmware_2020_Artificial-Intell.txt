The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a freely available framework designed primarily for robotic tool development. It includes various libraries capable of handling intricate tasks such as robot navigation, coordination of multiple robots, as well as machine vision and integrating sensors. Araujo et al. (2015) engineered a mobile robot platform powered by an Arduino board and managed by ROS. This system controlled the robot's trajectory at a predetermined linear speed, incorporating acceleration at the start and deceleration at the end of each movement for smoother operation. When the robot's manipulator arrived at the desired location, the system generated a handshake signal via serial bus communication to commence the next positioning cycle.

The robotic platform also featured a mechanism that transformed the rotational motion of a stepper motor into linear movement along the z-axis. A parallel jaw gripper was affixed to the robot arm at the juncture of two passive links and was operated by a servo motor to open and close. An additional servo motor provided rotational movement to the gripper within plane coordinates. The robot arm was equipped with four limit switches that served as sensors to determine the boundaries of the robot arm's range of motion. Two of these switches were tasked with identifying the boundaries of the active robot joints, while the remaining two detected the upper and lower limits.

The developed firmware was successfully integrated with embedded hardware to execute the pick-and-place task for pot seedlings on a conveyor, utilizing a parallel arm. The system achieved an average cycle time of 3.5 seconds and a success rate of 93.3%.
