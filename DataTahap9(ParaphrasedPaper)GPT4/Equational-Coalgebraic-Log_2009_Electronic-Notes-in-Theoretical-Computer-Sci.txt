Example 2.3 in the academic paper outlines that coalgebras associated with the covariant power set functor are equivalent to Kripke frames or, put differently, non-deterministic transition systems. These frameworks can be modified slightly to include labels on either transitions or states. Furthermore, coalgebras related to the finite multiset functor correspond to directed graphs that can have multiple weighted edges between nodes, often called multigraphs. Coalgebras for the finite distribution functor represent Markov chains with a finite number of branches and discrete time steps. Coalgebras under the functor 'Q-Q' are recognized within modal logic as neighborhood frames.

The paper discusses how these translations depend on certain conditions relevant to the type functor T and the assumption that the propositional logic is Boolean. Hence, the paper limits its discussion to Boolean algebra-based logics. To extend the findings to distributive lattices it would require the adjustment of the concept of predicate lifting, which would involve endofunctors T over the category of ordered sets, and the 'Q' functor being changed to a down-set functor. However, the paper does not further explore these modifications.

Remark 6.10 considers the identification of a monotone set of predicate liftings as crucial for coalgebraic modal logic because it enables the inclusion of fixed-point operators. The issue of finding these sets is resolved in the context of functors that preserve weak pullbacks, according to the proposition mentioned. The general issue of identifying these sets for functors that do not preserve weak pullbacks remains an unresolved problem in the field, according to the authorsâ€™ knowledge.
