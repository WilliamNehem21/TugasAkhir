The paper describes methods to optimize nutrient concentrations in aquaponic solutions using artificial intelligence. Given the small size of the dataset, dimensionality reduction techniques were employed to identify key chemical predictors of nutrient concentration. Variables with no variance were eliminated, and less important predictors (below 5% importance) were also removed, narrowing down to five primary chemical predictors: potassium, boron, bicarbonate, sulfate, and chloride (all measured in ppm). Two categorical predictors—month and location—were included, resulting in a dataset of 143 observations with seven predictors used to develop classification rules and make inferences.

Predictors such as phosphorus, pH, SAR, and charge balance were deemed less important and thus excluded from the analysis. To guard against overfitting due to the small dataset size, bolstered error estimators were introduced, and the performance of both linear (LDA and linear SVM) and nonlinear (CART with depth=2 and 3-NN) classifiers were evaluated. The CART depth and 3-NN values were chosen based on optimal results on training data to prevent overfitting.

Bolstered resubstitution error estimation was used to assess the classifiers. In this method, classifiers are trained on subsets of data, excluding one point for testing, and collective errors from these subsets provide an overall error estimate.

The research aimed to create a recommendation system for hydroponic setups that alerts users to maintain appropriate nutrient levels for maximum yield. The system advises maintaining the hardness of the aquaponic solution at specific levels to prevent eutrophication, and emphasizes a balance of chemical concentrations to support microbial growth vital to plant nutrient uptake. Previous studies' findings, such as those by Kledal et al. and Nozzi et al., are quantified and supplemented with descriptions of how recommendations impact crop quality.

This study is the first to use AI to optimize nutrients in aquaponic solutions, demonstrating significant cost savings and scalability. The approach prioritizes the avoidance of toxicity and can reduce labor costs associated with aquaponics.

Nevertheless, the study faces limitations such as sparse data that hampers the application of Bayesian approaches, and limited geographic data (sourced only from Southeast Texas), which affects the generalizability of the model.

The paper concludes that the semi-bolstered resubstitution error estimation with linear SVC is the most effective classification technique and offers detailed recommendations for aquaponic practices. Future research will investigate the impact of heavy metals on plant growth and apply the successful classification techniques to other domains with limited data.
