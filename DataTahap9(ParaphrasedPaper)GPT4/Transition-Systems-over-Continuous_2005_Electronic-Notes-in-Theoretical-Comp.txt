To address a specific challenge, the concepts of "fundamental functions" and "speed condition" are introduced. A fundamental function essentially allows one to link every event back to the initial conditions that set the process in motion. Definitions 2.10 and 4.2 in the paper provide the technical specifications for what constitutes a fundamental function. The speed condition pertains to the rules that govern how transitions occur, ensuring that the propagation of an effect due to a wave at speed v does not surpass that very speed. Its precise meaning and conditions are laid out in definition 4.5.

Additionally, it's noteworthy that remark 3.14 refers to the definition of the propagation speed of a state q, pointing out the importance of negative states. Specifically, it highlights how negative states, other than the one of interest, q, can be transformed into a positive state of q. This transformation relates back to what is described in remark 3.11.
