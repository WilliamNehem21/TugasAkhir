This report examines a series of programming examples to determine if they can be assigned types under different type systems, including the Hindley-Milner system, an intersection-type system, and enhanced versions of these systems. It specifically advocates for the use of intersection types as an alternative approach to polymorphism and seeks to establish a basis for creating an algorithm for decidable intersection-type inference.

The examples in the paper involve mutually recursive definitions of the functions double, foo, and goo, with calls to double within foo and goo being recursive. This recursion, coupled with arguments of differing types, causes the type derivations under the Hindley-Milner system to fail.

In an exploration beyond the core analysis, selected examples are translated into Haskell and the error messaging from the Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) compiler is compared with that from the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). GHC's error messaging is based on Algorithm M, which contrasts with SML/NJ's Algorithm W. The translation is only done for examples where the resulting error messages differ notably from those produced by SML/NJ, with an observation that GHC may produce a single comprehensive error message, while SML/NJ may yield multiple messages of varied relevance.

Additionally, the report addresses the critique that some examples (such as matrix transpose and vector addition) do not showcase "true" polymorphic recursion because the polymorphic aspect does not occur at the most outer part of the type expression. The report argues that this definition might be overly restrictive, as it would exclude function types with polymorphic argument types.

The report also discusses the idea that the first argument of a function named map2 (in one of the examples) could be omitted and replaced with a standard map function, yet notes cases where it might be beneficial to pass a specific mapping function as an argument.

Finally, while the report touches on differences in error reporting between SML/NJ and GHC, it suggests that a definitive conclusion on the matter isn't the focus of the paper and recommends the topic for future investigation, directing interested readers to seek more information on the subject.
