In this academic excerpt, the authors discuss their basic system, known as 'kn,' and how it does not attempt to recover all classical inferences. Instead, a weaker system is suggested as a more suitable analog. To elaborate, the system referred to as 'dm' enhances system 'dl' with additional rules described as (dm1.1), (dm1.2), (dm2.1), and (dm2.2). Further modifications create systems 'dmi,' which includes (dm3.1), and 'dme,' which includes (dm3.2). These systems allow for the separate introduction of specific axioms which might otherwise clash in a single system due to what is termed 'frame incompleteness.'

The paper further brings up an alternative, which involves adjusting the semantic framework, a common strategy in the study of intuitive modal logics. This usually involves a secondary relation, such as a quasi-ordering, which operates alongside the primary relation, with a focus on truth-increasing valuations. This revision would enable the preservation of truth towards the future and falsity towards the past, as dictated by the new ordering.

Addressing the limitations of their 'richer language,' the authors note that the restoration connectives defy the heredity conditions. They serve to reintroduce classic-like models when applied to a theory's statements. Identifying the optimal semantic framework to handle these disparities remains an open challenge.

Regarding the 'dm' system, a four-valued semantics is possible, where negation functions nondeterministically, giving two potential outcomes for each input. This non-deterministic negation could be made more deterministic by including rules (dm3.1) or (dm3.2). Incorporating both these rules would fully determinize the system, aligning it with de Morgan logic. In contrast, the non-classical negations discussed by the authors seem to favor an approach that diverges from classical logic.
