The academic paper discusses the challenges of ensuring quality in concurrent programming, particularly the difficulties of detecting issues such as deadlocks, livelocks, and divergence. To assist developers, various tools have been created, including Verisoft which is tailored for C++ applications. The paper also examines the use of Java RMI in distributed environments like client-server systems, and acknowledges that while Java RMI abstracts lower-level details, it does not eliminate the inherent risks of concurrency.

Verisoft operates by exploring the state space of programs for potential concurrency problems, yet it is not directly applicable to Java or Java RMI. The authors propose a method to transform Java RMI code into C++ code analyzable by Verisoft, without requiring a model and thereby reducing the risk of inaccurate results. The transformation process is supported by a custom garbage collection algorithm for C++ mimicking Java's.

The paper introduces the TXL programming language for structural source code transformation and describes how it helps to model Java RMI in C++ for analysis with Verisoft. Verisoft's analysis can be conducted in three different modes, and the work includes a custom smart pointer class in C++ to manage memory similar to Java's automatic memory management.

While the approach presented bypasses some of the limitations of other tools like Bandera and Java Pathfinder, it still faces challenges in modeling dynamic I/O functionality and dynamic process creation. The research shows promise but also the need for further testing on larger systems to assess scalability and dependability. The main obstacles highlighted are the numerous Java library classes a program may use, the transformation capacity of TXL, and Verisoft's capability to handle large transformed C++ codebases.
