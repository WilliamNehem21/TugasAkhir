In the paper, the authors discuss the importance of verifying compatibility between behavioral interfaces of services in service-oriented computing to assure successful interoperability and avoid issues such as incorrect behaviors and deadlocks when integrating services. They introduce a comprehensive model that encompasses value passing and non-observable actions within service interaction protocols.

To assess compatibility, the paper introduces a uniform approach utilizing the Maude rewriting logic system to check for various compatibility aspects including opposite behaviors, unspecified receptions, and deadlock freeness, among others. The approach covers several strategies for managing non-observable actions and is implemented as a prototype tool capable of automatically determining service compatibility and providing counterexamples where incompatibility is detected.

This method serves a range of applications such as service composition, adaptation, and reengineering. The implementation in Maude leverages its efficient rewriting and searching capabilities, providing a highly abstract yet efficient checking framework.

The paper is structured to first formalize the service model, introduce the compatibility notions used, and then detail the Maude-based compatibility check process. It also compares the approach with other related methods and draws conclusions.

Testing on over 75 examples, from simple to real-world use cases, the prototyped tool demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency, with the most extensive example featuring services with over 85 states and 90 transitions being checked in approximately 7 seconds.

Lastly, the paper contrasts its approach with previous studies in software engineering that investigate compatibility, noting that while many studies have addressed this issue, few have combined non-observable actions and value-passing considerations or provided an automatic implementation for checking compatibility notions. The authors' framework is versatile and can be used for a variety of compatibility assessment applications.
