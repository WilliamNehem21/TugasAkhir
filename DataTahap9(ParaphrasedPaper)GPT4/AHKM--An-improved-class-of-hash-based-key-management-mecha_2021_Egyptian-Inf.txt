The paper is structured into five sections. Section 2 explores existing cluster-based key management strategies, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. Section 3 delves into the authors' novel cluster hash key-based key management system for cluster-based networks, including the system model. Simulation outcomes, assessing the proposed model's robustness against an increasing number of malicious nodes, are presented in Section 4. The paper concludes in Section 5.

Lin You and colleagues offered a wireless sensor network key management protocol employing a deployment knowledge hash chain (DKH-KD), which sets up keys between pairs of nodes using a reverse hash chain mechanism, enhancing efficiency but at a higher computation cost during key renewal.

Ehdai and collaborators presented a 2D hash function approach to address security challenges in sensor networks, which effectively counters node capture attacks and conserves energy, though at the expense of increased computational load during rekeying.

Anita and associates introduced a novel hybrid key management framework for secure communications in wireless sensor networks, reducing computational demands and ensuring high-level security, yet the implementation complexity may hinder its application in practical scenarios.

The paper specifies a method for nodes in a cluster to establish pairwise keys, crucial for secure communication. Upon creating a master key (KM), node A can discreetly communicate with node B by setting up a pairwise key (Kpair). This process involves three phases: generating the master key before sensor network deployment, pre-distributing initial keys (KI) among nodes, and establishing secured multi-hop links, where each node generates KM using KI and a one-way hash function.
