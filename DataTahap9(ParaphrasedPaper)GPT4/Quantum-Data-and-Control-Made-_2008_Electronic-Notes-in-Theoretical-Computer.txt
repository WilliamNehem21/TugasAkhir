This academic paper highlights that while new quantum programming languages (like nqml mentioned in the paper) facilitate easier quantum programming, this simplicity overlooks several key challenges. These include imperfect quantum hardware, the necessity for error correction, and the requirement to approximate certain unitary operations, since quantum programs must eventually convert to a circuit form using a standard set of gates. The authors reflect on how similar complications were resolved in the past for classical computing, leading to such complexities being abstracted away in modern high-level programming languages; they posit that a similar approach should apply to quantum programming.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 describes the design of nqml, while Section 4 showcases examples. The authors suggest an extension to nqml in Section 5.

They introduce quantum-specific programming constructs, such as polyifm for quantum measurements and conditional branching, to either execute one of its branches based on the measurement or proceed in superposition if the qubit is not in a classical state.

The authors argue that the complexity of quantum logic can be simplified through constructs like generic unitary transformation expressions, which circumvent the need for explicit unitary matrices, leading to more straightforward representation of quantum algorithms.

The paper demonstrates nqml with examples, including quantum negation (not) and the Hadamard transformation (had), by applying them to qubit expressions.

It proceeds to discuss a polymorphic type system within nqml that could support higher-order functions. The authors indicate a path towards incorporating such advanced features to make nqml a more comprehensive and capable quantum programming language.
