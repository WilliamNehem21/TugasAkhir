Substances used in various products, including cosmetics, medications, pesticides, and household items, must be correctly categorized based on their possible eye toxicity to guarantee consumer safety. Eye irritation or corrosion results from interactions at the cellular level, such as membrane damage or chemical reactions, when a substance contacts the eye's surface, including the cornea and conjunctiva.

Several non-animal methods (NAMs) have been established for in vitro evaluation of chemicals' potential to cause severe eye irritation or corrosion. These methods are based on alternative biological materials such as rabbit corneal cells, isolated bovine corneas, and a layer of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, as well as three-dimensional human tissue models like the reconstructed human cornea-like epithelium test and the Vitrigel-eye irritancy test. These tests aim to mimic the relevant biology of human eye irritation and corrosion.

Computational models, such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, utilize statistical and artificial intelligence methods including machine learning and deep learning to predict the effects of new compounds based on their molecular features. The quality of these predictions depends on high-quality, well-curated data. Success in QSAR modeling relies on the extensive and thorough preparation of the data, as the biological processes underlying toxicity can be complex and not always understood.

The study's dataset contained 3,547 compounds, categorized into non-irritants/non-corrosives and irritants of varying degrees. Using the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) classifications, a multiclass model was created for prediction. The dataset was balanced by including compounds structurally similar to irritants and by random selection to create a challenging training set.

Data curation included standardization of chemical structures, removal of counter ions, inorganics, mixtures, and resolution of duplicates. Using the KNIME analytics platform and the RDKit and Dragon software, molecular descriptors were calculated and redundant or highly correlated descriptors were excluded from the dataset.

Two algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and MUDRA, were used to create the models, implemented through the KNIME platform and Python scripting. The models underwent a 5-fold external cross-validation to ensure their validity.

Finally, the MUDRA approach showed good predictive accuracy when assessing well-known eye irritants such as glutaraldehyde, paraquat, and glyphosate. Furthermore, the models were applied to predict the eye irritation and corrosion potential of thousands of compounds from databases like COSING and the inactive ingredients database, demonstrating the ability of these computational methods to predict eye toxicity in a broad range of chemicals.

In summary, the authors of the study aimed to improve the prediction of severe eye irritation by evaluating and enhancing existing computational models using structured datasets and advanced algorithms, emphasizing the importance of data quality in the predictive power of these models.
