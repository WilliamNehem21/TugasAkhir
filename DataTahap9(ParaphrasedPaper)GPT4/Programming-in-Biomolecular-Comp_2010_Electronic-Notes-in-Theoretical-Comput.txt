The academic paper discusses advancements in biomolecular computation frameworks that circumvent the typical asymptotic slowdowns associated with traditional automata-based computation models, like Turing machines and counter machines. It reviews contributions in this area, highlighting some works that focus on laboratory feasibility of specific biochemical computations, while others address Turing completeness, albeit with less emphasis on algorithmic implementation.

The paper defines a program as a set of action instructions on data, distinguishing it as software – and therefore a data object – that can be replaced to alter its action specifications. Demonstrating Turing completeness for a computation framework involves showing it can simulate the functionality of another, already established Turing complete language, like Minsky register machines or two-counter machines (2CM).

In the biomolecular model being discussed, data must be physically adjacent to the actuator for manipulation, reflecting a biochemical constraint where a chemical bond represents adjacency. Biomolecular systems exploit available resources such as free energy to execute actions like constructing data, altering control points, or adding bonds to data structures, leveraging biological processes like Brownian motion and the use of ATP and oxygen.

To fit within biological feasibility, the model suggests maintaining proximity between the control point, data inspection site, and a focus point where all actions occur. This approach involves continually shifting the program or the data. Blobs, which contain local storage, feature an instruction set alongside an activation bit to denote execution readiness, and they simulate computational actions via biochemical rules.

The paper notes the movement of data points and the rotation of contacts to maintain adjacency, disregarding the efficiency of moving large amounts of data and assuming manageable sizes of program and data blobs. The biomolecular computational model draws parallels with machine language, but with several distinctions, such as a lack of traditional address space and address decoding mechanisms - instead, utilizing unconventional instruction formats and non-standardized data sizes.

The paper illustrates how common programming operations, although not elegant in blob code, can be executed, thus proving the Turing completeness of the model. It also discusses the current use of all instructions in their self-interpreter and hypothesizes that these instructions are minimally sufficient, with a formal proof under consideration.

The discussion extends to comparison with traditional Turing machines and their dimensional limitations. Unlike these fixed-dimensional models, blob machines could have a more robust linear time complexity class, which, unlike Turing machines, is less sensitive to small variations in model specifications.

In summary, the paper explores a biomolecular computing system that harnesses biochemical processes and avoids some limitations of traditional computation models, aiming for a Turing complete, biologically feasible framework that lends itself to potential applications in computing using biomolecules.
