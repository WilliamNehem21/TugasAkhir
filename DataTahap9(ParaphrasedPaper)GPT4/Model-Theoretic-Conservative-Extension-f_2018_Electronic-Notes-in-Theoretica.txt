This section outlines the use of polymorphic higher-order logic (HOL) and the structure of definitional theories, including their semantic interpretation. The authors follow established conventions referenced in accompanying literature and avoid discussing HOL's deductive system as it is not pertinent to this study.

In addition, the authors highlight that merely changing how a certain type variable 'u' is interpreted within a model is not always adequate, as demonstrated by a counterexample in Section 1. This is due to potential dependencies of other types or constants on 'u' or its type instances. Their interpretations may also need modification. The primary finding of the paper is that reinterpretation is only necessary for the types and constants directly dependent on 'u.'

The proof follows from considering a well-defined definitional theory 'd.' It is evident that an empty theory can be modeled, such as by interpreting non-built-in types as empty sets and non-built-in constants arbitrarily using the axiom of choice, among other methods. Since all subsets of 'd' also constitute well-formed definitional theories, the proof proceeds by induction on the finite size of 'd.'

Furthermore, the authors note that while the HOL4 system, formalized and verified by Kumar et al., has examined this concept, the support for ad hoc overloading in theorem provers for HOL differs. For example, Isabelle inherently supports ad hoc overloading, whereas other systems may provide this feature through syntactic conveniences like parsing and pretty-printing enhancements.
