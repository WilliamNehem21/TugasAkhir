In the agricultural sciences, frosts, which form when ice crystallizes within plants and damages their cells, present a substantial threat to both economies and ecosystems. There are several active and dynamic methods to prevent frost damage including the use of heaters, sprinklers, fog systems, and wind machines. Despite these preventative measures, the automation and improvement of frost prediction technologies, which could activate these defenses, remains an area for enhancement.

This paper outlines the experimental methods and settings used in its research. The authors begin by detailing the study area, followed by a description of data preprocessing techniques. The paper then elaborates on the construction and evaluation of prediction models using the processed data, and provides a summary of the experimental procedures.

The research concentrates on winter months (June, July, August) and examines data collected minute-by-minute from 30 weather stations during the winters of 2016 and 2017. The gathered climate data undergo further preparation for subsequent modeling and testing.

The paper is organized into sections: the second section covers the methodology and experimental setup, including the study area, data processing, and the experimental process which compares various temperature prediction models (ANN, RNN, LSTM, GRU), evaluates different RNN model configurations, and assesses the success of forecasting minimum temperature in conjunction with other frost-related variables. Section three discusses the experimental results, highlighting limitations and posing open challenges, and the final fourth section offers conclusions.

During data preprocessing, researchers pinpoint the minimum temperature for the next 60 minutes as the focal prediction variable. Data recorded every minute is used to determine this minimum temperature.

In terms of model construction and testing, the paper describes the computational environment and data utilization, clarifies the model structures and hyperparameters, and delineates the two stages of model building.

All prediction models share a three-layer structure: the input and hidden layers change depending on the model type, with ANN models employing ReLU activation functions and RNN variants using the tanh activation function.

The predictive models developed in this study aim to trigger frost protection mechanisms by predicting the onset of frost using real-time sensor data. The current models, however, do not predict the cessation of a frost event, a function that would offer additional value by potentially reducing operational costs and resource usage when deactivating protection systems. The interaction of active frost protection mechanisms with sensor readings could influence predictions mistakenly, suggesting further research is needed to account for and minimize the effect of these interventions on model accuracy.
