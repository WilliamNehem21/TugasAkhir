Figure 4(b) indicates that the release of acetic acid from the CuO catalyst is a gradual process, with the catalyst achieving a stable level of reactivity after 25 minutes. At this equilibrium state, only 20% of acetic acid was converted, a stark contrast to the 54% achieved with a non-saturated catalyst. This implies that the CuO catalyst’s basic properties are diminished by 34%. Such observations lead to the presumption that the reaction rate is influenced by the catalyst's basicity.

Figure 4(c) details the time-dependent behavior of acetic acid desorption from a catalyst composed of CuO with an addition of 30% NiO by weight. Data shows that acetic acid leaves the catalyst surface much faster compared to the pure CuO catalyst. Consequently, the conversion of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and the formation of acetone escalate promptly over time. The catalyst's effectiveness is substantially recovered (approx. 95%) within a brief period of about 10 minutes, though a small residual effect (around 3%) might be ascribed to the acetic acid's adherence to the catalyst’s highly basic sites.
