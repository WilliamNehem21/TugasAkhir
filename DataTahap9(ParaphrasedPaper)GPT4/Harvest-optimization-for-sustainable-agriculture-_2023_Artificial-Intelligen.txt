The research paper focuses on the optimization of the tea harvest scheduling process. Tea is typically picked from the fields three times annually, with farmers starting at dawn and continuing until the afternoon. The freshly picked tea is taken to designated buy stations, where it is weighed and sold to factories. The capacity of these buy stations must be taken into account to avoid tea leaves spoiling in the sun, which can occur if they are left out due to overcrowding at these locations. Sunburnt tea is rejected by the factories, leading to waste. Efficiently utilizing transportation and considering farmers' harvest day preferences can increase overall national efficiency in the tea industry.

The study's structure is outlined as follows: The second section introduces the problem of harvest scheduling. The third section reviews relevant literature, while the fourth section demonstrates a practical application of the study. The fifth section presents the research findings.

Each farmer is aligned with a buy station based on their residence. The study highlights the wastage caused when tea leaves, having been fertilized, maintained, and harvested, are not accepted by the factory due to spoilage from sun exposure. Thus, incorporating the capacity of buy stations is crucial in the scheduling of the tea harvest.

Two models were developed in the study. The first model seeks to minimize wasted trips without considering farmers' preferences, focusing on adhering to buy station and factory capacities. The second model, while still minimizing trips, does take farmers' preferences into account. The success of these models was tested using a Python-generated matrix with varying harvest days, while maintaining realistic weekly quotas for farmers.

Results indicated that considering farmers' preferences doesn't adversely affect the number of required trips. In fact, the second model, which accounts for farmers' preferences, is seen as superior as it adapts to these preferences without increasing operational efforts.

The paper emphasizes the importance of considering buy station capacities to prevent crop loss, efficient usage of facilities, and sustaining a good relationship between farmers and factories. By analyzing buy station occupancy rates, less busy locations could be made inactive on certain days to improve shipping effectiveness.

A case study was performed on a region with tea fields, multiple buy stations, and a factory. The scheduling models were compared based on the number of factory vehicle trips and their ability to align with farmers' day preferences. The model that included farmer preferences showed a significant increase in preference adaptation, from 52.13% to 97.65%, without an increase in the number of trips, thereby demonstrating that considering farmer preferences can enhance sustainability and incentivize agricultural practices, giving companies a competitive advantage.

For future research, the study suggests integrating vehicle routing and workforce scheduling into the harvest scheduling problem. Decisions could be made on harvest days, vehicle routes, and stopping points for the factory's transport. Furthermore, allowing flexibility in assigning farmers to buy stations could be explored, and larger-scale studies could lead to scheduling for all stations linked to a factory. As the complexity of the models increases, heuristic methods may be necessary to find solutions.
