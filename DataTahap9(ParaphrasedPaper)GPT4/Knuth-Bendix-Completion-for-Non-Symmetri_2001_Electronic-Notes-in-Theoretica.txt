The structure of the academic paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines essential definitions. Section 3 provides an overview of rewriting techniques using non-symmetric transitive relations and quasiorderings. In Section 4, a ground Knuth-Bendix completion procedure for transitive relations is detailed, including a proof of its correctness. Section 5 offers additional commentary on the procedure. The method is expanded to include quasiorderings in Section 6, while Section 7 addresses its adaptation to non-ground instances. Section 8 presents a brief example of the procedure's application. The paper concludes in Section 9.

The paper highlights that although refinements to rewrite rules do not reduce the proof measure, they can potentially disrupt the termination of the completion process. Nevertheless, these refinements maintain correctness because they depend solely on resolving critical pairs. In a completion process focused on critical pair computations, more critical pairs appear without refinements than with them.

When dealing with a quasiordering, the ground completion procedure must be modified to account for reflexivity, meaning that explicit consideration of the diagonal is unnecessary. The rewriting theory changes slightly in this context, as outlined in Section 3, which presents key differences between completing processes using non-symmetric transitive relations and those using quasiorderings.

Section 3 also indicates significant challenges in extending ground completion procedures to the non-ground level. Second-order context variables are introduced to represent variable critical pairs that occur due to non-linear variables. Three cases are of interest: the non-compatible case (where no function is monotonic), the linear case, and the general case, with each presenting its unique considerations.
