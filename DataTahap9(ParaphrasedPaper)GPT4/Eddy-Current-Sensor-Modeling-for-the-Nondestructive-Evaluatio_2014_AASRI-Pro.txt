Several approaches exist for calculating the stress and strain in a structure, with the finite element method (FEM) and the boundary element method (BEM) being among the most commonly used and featured in numerous commercial software solutions. Recently, however, meshless methods like the extended finite element model (XFEM) have started to gain traction due to their advantages, especially in handling fracture mechanics problems.

Research indicates that the location of a defect—whether it is internal, on the surface, or external—significantly influences the measured impedance. Experiments have demonstrated that differential sensors are highly responsive to the presence of surface defects. Nevertheless, these sensors face a notable limitation in their inability to detect flaws situated between two adjacent sensor reels.
