The primary goal of implementing direct torque control (DTC) for a squirrel-cage induction generator is to precisely and promptly manage the speed and torque output of the machine, which is driven by a wind turbine. In this process, a feedforward neural network, utilizing rotor flux and stator current as inputs, is employed to estimate the generator's actual speed. The effectiveness of DTC when applied to a squirrel-cage induction generator in a wind energy conversion system is assessed by comparing it with traditional Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers and those based on neural networks. This comparison includes a detailed explanation of the control strategies and associated mathematical modeling, all of which are simulated within the MATLAB/Simulink environment.

The MATLAB/Simulink platform is used to simulate the DTC of the squirrel-cage induction generator within a wind energy conversion system featuring both PI and neural network-based controllers. The wind energy conversion system is broken down into five main components: a constant pitch, variable speed wind turbine, the induction generator, a three-phase inverter, the DTC controller, and the speed controller, which can be either a PI controller or a neural network controller. The wind turbine operates as a mechanical driver for the induction generator, maintaining a pitch angle of 45 degrees, while the wind velocity varies randomly between 0 and 20 meters per second.
