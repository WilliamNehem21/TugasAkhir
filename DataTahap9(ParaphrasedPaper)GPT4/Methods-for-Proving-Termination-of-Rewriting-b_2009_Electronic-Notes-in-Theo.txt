This paper provides an overview of emerging concepts and strategies that have been developed for assessing the termination of programs within declarative programming frameworks, particularly those that do not conform to the traditional rewriting-based computational paradigm. The authors have introduced various methodologies and tools that leverage existing resources designed for termination proofing in rewriting systems to address the unique challenges posed by such programs.

One key insight of the study is that program termination need not involve explicit rewriting rules. The authors illustrate this point with examples, including a program that determines whether a list of elements is a palindrome, which relies purely on axioms and still guarantees finite computation without rewriting. Other examples, such as ones dealing with nonterminating computations and the involvement of conditional memberships, underscore the nuanced nature of termination in declarative programs.

To address these complexities, the paper champions a proof-theoretic approach to understanding termination, proposing an inference system-based concept known as 'operational termination'. This criterion for termination is adaptable to various logics that incorporate a diverse array of computational relations, including but not limited to rewriting. Operational termination is considered when the well-formed proof trees of a program are finite, ensuring that computations will conclude after a finite number of steps.

The authors further discuss the logic 'L' that is shaped by inference rules and depends on an underlying theory 'S'. This establishes a framework for provability within a broad axiomatic structure, which they argue is necessary for comprehensively defining and evaluating operational termination in different systems.

Additionally, the paper touches on the role of 'membership sorts' within this axiomatic framework. Unlike 'order-sorted sorts', which can be parsed and validated syntactically, 'membership sorts' require axiomatic justification and are captured in the transformed theory by introducing specific truth-valued predicates. These predicates signal whether a term belongs to the original 'membership sort', thus facilitating the assessment of termination in transformed contexts.

In summary, the paper points out that traditional notions of termination are insufficient for a range of declarative programming scenarios and emphasizes the need for a more flexible logic-based method to understand and prove program termination, expanding the applicability of termination proofs beyond classical rewriting systems.
