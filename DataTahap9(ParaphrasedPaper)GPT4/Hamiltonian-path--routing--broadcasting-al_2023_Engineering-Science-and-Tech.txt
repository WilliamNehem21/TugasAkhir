In this research paper, the authors revisit the topic of connected square network graphs (CSNGs) that were previously studied by Selcuk (2022) and Selcuk and Tankul (2022). CSNGs are identified as a two-dimensional mesh network that is a variant of the hypercube. The goal of the paper is to develop algorithms leveraging hypercube properties to solve problems on CSNGs.

The paper presents an efficient algorithm for finding the Hamiltonian path in CSNGs. Additionally, it introduces two algorithms for the tasks of label mapping in the graph and unicast routing. The possibility of parallel processing for these mapping and routing tasks is also explored. Finally, the paper discusses guidelines for broadcasting algorithms in the context of CSNGs.

In Section 2, the paper describes the background and pertinent concepts such as CSNGs, the divide and conquer method, dynamic programming, and problems like the traveling salesman problem (TSP), routing, and broadcasting.

Section 3 introduces a new algorithm for finding the Hamiltonian path using dynamic programming techniques. Section 4 then presents the aforementioned algorithms for label mapping and routing and discusses their parallel implementation. The section concludes with the adapted broadcasting algorithms for CSNGs based on those used for hypercubes.

The paper also touches on the divide and conquer approach implemented in various graphs, including the hypercube, for solving problems ranging from tridiagonal systems to efficient execution in parallel computing. It outlines different routing problems, such as the shortest path problem (SPP) and tour construction problems like TSP, vehicle routing problem (VRP), and bus routing problem (BRP).

The authors mention notable algorithms for solving shortest path problems in various network topologies and explain how to apply these to different kinds of networks such as rings, hubs, and on-chip large scale mesh networks.

For CSNGs, the paper expounds on recursive processes, different base cases for algorithms, and the role of the divide and conquer approach in tailoring broadcast algorithms from hypercube applications. The paper asserts that the algorithms adapted for CSNGs more closely resemble those of hypercubes rather than classical mesh networks.

In terms of complexity, the new Hamiltonian path algorithm for CSNGs has a runtime of O(2^(k+m+2)). The label mapping algorithm for nodes in a CSNG of dimensions k and m operates in time O(2^(k+m+2)), while the unicast routing algorithm has a time complexity of O(max(2^(k+1)−1, 2^(m+1)−1)). Successful parallel and distributed implementations of these algorithms can provide runtime improvements proportional to the number of processors used.
