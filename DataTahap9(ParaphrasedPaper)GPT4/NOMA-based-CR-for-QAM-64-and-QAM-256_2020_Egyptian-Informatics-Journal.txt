This study explores the use of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) with Super Coding (SC) and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) combined with filtering at the transceiver to optimize spectrum use across multiple users sharing the same channel. By taking advantage of both the presence and absence of primary users (PUs), secondary users (SUs) can achieve greater system throughput without spectrum loss. The researchers introduce a novel approach where NOMA is integrated with Matched Filter (MF) detection for more intelligent spectrum allocation. To the author's knowledge, this NOMA-based cognitive radio (CR) application is novel.

The paper focuses on improved spectrum sensing for 5G and IoT communication rates using Matched Filter detection and evaluates performance metrics such as detection probability (Pd), false alarm probability (Pfa), bit error rate (BER) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and power spectral density (PSD). The results indicate that their technique can effectively detect unused spectrum segments, particularly showing improved detection at 25 dB SNR.

The authors propose a cooperative spectrum sensing model based on Decision Fusion (DF) functions and enhance the sensing performance by considering the power, waveform, and spectrum of licensed users. A joint optimization technique that harnesses Lagrange decomposition is presented to address spectrum scarcity and enhance service quality.

In one notable simulation, cooperative CR using a cyclostationary feature detection technique shows improved detection for multiple users, though at a higher computational cost. Again, Lagrange dual optimization is used to resolve optimization challenges within the 5G communication framework, aiming for an energy-efficient system that balances IoT power consumption with performance.

Lastly, the paper emphasizes that integrating Matched Filter spectrum sensing with NOMA for QAM-64 and QAM-256 modulation schemes has not been previously addressed in the literature. The research sets out to design a NOMA-based CR system that uses the spectrum efficiently, improves spectral performance, and maintains quality of service. The proposed method enhances performance in terms of Pd and BER while reducing Pfa. The PSD of the system is explored across various overlap factors, suggesting that the new technique enables faster sensing and detection at lower SNRs with a static threshold.
