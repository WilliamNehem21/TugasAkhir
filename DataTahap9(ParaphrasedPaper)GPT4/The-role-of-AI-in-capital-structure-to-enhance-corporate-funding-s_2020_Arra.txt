This study investigates whether artificial intelligence (AI) can improve the precision of expected return estimations within the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Accurately estimating the cost of capital is crucial for managers to maximize corporate value since it represents the minimum expected return on investment.

The study analyzed the adjusted closing stock prices of 10 high-tech companies from January 2013 to January 2019, using the most recent year's data to calculate CAPM values and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and dropout layers to forecast stock prices for the following year. The traditional CAPM results were compared to the ones generated by AI models.

Relying on long-term averages of yield to maturity on default-free securities shields CAPM from short-term market volatility, bolstering its utility during financial crises like the one in 2008. AI, specifically deep learning and neural networks, is increasingly used in finance for predictions due to their capacity to identify patterns and make decisions surpassing human analysts.

Previous research demonstrated the ability of neural networks to model non-linear effects in financial data, implying AI could refine CAPM by incorporating predictive uncertainty in return estimations or factoring in the reliability based on historical prediction accuracy.

In this paper, the comparison between traditional and AI-improved CAPM calculations revealed that, on average, the AI-driven models predicted returns more closely aligned to actual market performance. Python and Microsoft Excel were the main tools employed for data analysis and management.

Further advances in AI—emphasized by the growth in the use of RNNs for financial forecasting—demonstrate potential for real-time prediction enhancements. AI's predictive prowess suggests a reconsideration of the role of the beta parameter in CAPM, potentially allowing for new methods to assess risk that better reflect AI-informed estimations.

The study's AI method produced returns that were on average 18% closer to actual results than traditional CAPM, suggesting a significant improvement in accuracy. The findings advocate for the use of AI in enhancing CAPM calculations, with future research recommended to validate these findings across different industries and markets and to assess the impact on portfolio planning in comparison with traditional methods.
