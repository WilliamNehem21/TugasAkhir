In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for analyzing rule-based descriptions of how systems change over time. We depict system states using straightforward directed graphs (digraphs) that can be encapsulated by Boolean matrices. The rules that capture the various state transitions are also rendered as Boolean matrices, allowing us to express system modifications using solely Boolean operations.

Graph grammars stand out from other behavioral specification methods because they visually and formally indicate transformations on all sorts of graphs in a declarative manner. Various formalisms offer analytic tools to examine aspects like rule independence, confluence, or termination in certain cases. Notably, the most common formalisms originate from category theory, specifically the single and double pushout (SPO and DPO) approaches.

To manage graphs of varying sizes, we implement a completion technique. This involves padding matrices and vectors with zeros and rearranging them so that corresponding nodes and edges line up correctly. Our examples skip this step for simplicity, but we operate under the assumption that completion occurs as required. In working with production matrices of different sizes, elements must be chosen to ensure proper alignment with elements in the host graph.

We must consider multiple machines and operators for scenarios where both are interdependent, making sure that distinct entities are available for each process in concurrent operations. When expanding this to three productions, the formula used to predict the outcomes becomes more complex.

We observe parallels with local confluence and aim to determine when, depending on permutations and grammar definitions (including rules and host graphs), we can conclude that the end states are structurally identical.

To compute a specific matrix in one of our propositions, one can start with either the maximal initial digraph or several minimal elements from the set of initial digraphs. For the maximal initial digraph, represent elements as variables and employ a SAT solver to derive necessary conditions.

Concatenation beyond a single length must be reduced to one production through composition, as long as it is coherent and compatible with the requirements we set. Full transformation via composition isn't always necessaryâ€”only the problematic parts need it.

We should note that composition requires identifying corresponding elements across rules, analogous to the concurrency theorem. DPO supports non-injective matching that can align different elements in parallel rules, whereas our approach mandates predefined identification before calculating compositions.

Our approach diverges from related matrix graph grammar work, like the DPO method implemented in Mathematica, which also uses Boolean adjacency matrices to represent simple digraphs. However, our aim is to establish a graph rewriting theory based purely on Boolean matrix algebra, setting our research apart from category theory-based relational methods.
