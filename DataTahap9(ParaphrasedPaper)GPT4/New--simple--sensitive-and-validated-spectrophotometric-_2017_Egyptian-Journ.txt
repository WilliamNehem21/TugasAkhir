Salem devised several approaches for estimating sham using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and other spectrophotometric methods. The AAS method involves precipitating the [Cu(NH3)4]2+-sham complex by adding an excess of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ to the sham solution. Afterwards, the amount of Cu2+ ions in the remaining supernatant is measured using AAS. The spectrophotometric method, on the other hand, is based on the detection of a green color that develops upon mixing [Cu(NH3)4]2+ with a 50% dioxane-water sham solution. 

For an accurate analysis, the sample solution, passed through filter paper, is diluted accordingly to fall within the studied linearity range. The sample's absorbance is then measured to determine the salicylhydroxamic acid concentration using a calibration curve. The same preparation process is applied to raw materials, with 100 mg of each being transferred into a 500 mL volumetric flask followed by the usual capsule preparation steps.

The assay for salicylhydroxamic acid was subjected to a validation process that took into account various parameters, namely linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, accuracy, robustness, ruggedness, and specificity. This validation was carried out following the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines Q2(R1) set forth in 2005.
