The remainder of the study is structured into multiple sections. Section 2 critiques the limitations of the current BrightPass system. Section 3 introduces new methodologies. Section 4 delves into an in-depth security evaluation and compares the new methods to the standard BrightPass approach. Section 5 outlines the empirical tests conducted while Section 6 discusses their implications. The conclusion is presented in Section 7.

A graphical password interface using a 7x5 grid with a blend of arrows and numbers generates the secret key. The grid's initial ten cells randomly display arrows, and the subsequent twenty-five cells randomly bear numbers from 0 to 9.

The user starts by choosing a number based on the arrows found in the first four cells, corresponding to their original PIN, which is 1234. The process gets trickier under different screen brightness levels. A low brightness prompts the user to intentionally select the wrong direction, while a high brightness indicates following the given directions. 

The method's security, leveraging the original PIN and matrix-derived directions in tandem with screen brightness, offers protection against repeated recording attempts. Three instances per session allow the user to randomly select one of four directions during periods of low brightness, making it nearly impossible for an adversary to deduce the original PIN.
