This academic paper focuses on the formal properties of certain logical models and the complexity of related algorithmic processes. The key finding is that the series of models known as CHN(S4) for n greater than zero and their definable variants all share a significant feature, termed the co-cover property. The paper reveals how this property is instrumental in characterizing admissible rules for the S4 logic system, with reference to other academic works that provide broader context and similar characterizations for IPC (Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus).

The paper discusses a computational algorithm with three steps and analyzes its complexity. The first step of the algorithm is computationally efficient, being executable in polynomial time. However, the second and third steps require exponential time. Consequently, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is ultimately governed by a doubly exponential function with respect to the length of input 'r'. Further analysis, drawing on techniques from referenced works, concludes that the rule admissibility problem for S4 is of the complexity class coNEXPTIME-complete.

When dealing with quantifiers within the logical formulae, the paper notes that it's possible to remove all existential quantifiers that appear before any quantifiers of 'p' through a process called Skolemization. After this elimination, the quantifiers of 'p' can also be omitted. To make the formulae more manageable, they are split into two parts.

Finally, the paper outlines potential refinements for a generated calculus 'T'. It suggests improving the calculus by repositioning negated conclusions from certain rules into the premise positions. This involves shifting formulae that contain only propositional variables and lack complex modal terms. For each rule, the paper asserts that it is not challenging to verify that the modifications preserve soundness and constructive completeness, referring to conditions provided in another academic source for this verification.
