The paper discusses ongoing research in the formalization of distributed component behaviors, acknowledging that similar work has been conducted by the SOFA team, which relates to the Fractal component model. SOFA defines components with a frame (specification) and architecture (implementation), which are verified through trace language inclusion. Carrez et al.'s research differs in their focus on behavioral typing within the CORBA component model (CCM), lacking a hierarchical structure of components.

The authors note that verification tools for hierarchical component behaviors are scarce, with SOFA being a unique example offering static analysis and its own model checker. In contrast, the authors' approach includes techniques to reduce state space, crucial for addressing the state explosion issue early in the design process.

To specify behaviors, they've created "parameterized FC2" (an enhanced version of the FC2 language) designed not for manual writing but for structured and compact representation.

The "FC2Instantiate" tool, also by the authors, inputs parameterized networks and outputs a finite system of communicating automata in FC2 format. LOTOS specifications of components are compiled using the CADP's Caesar tool, but there is no automatic mapping between LOTOS gates and actions in the network.

Exposure of potential design flaws is illustrated by modeling a login process that leads to a deadlockâ€”a situation the platform can detect through model checking. The authors acknowledge that incorporating asynchronous mechanisms could prevent such deadlocks, which isn't yet possible in their current tool but may be addressed in future releases.

The new version of their tool ADL2N will compile ADL files in two phases to accommodate different fractal implementations. Integrating with tools that handle infinite models, such as those from the PERSEE project, is seen as non-trivial but promising for avoiding state explosion.

While not yet complete, the authors are confident their platform is progressing toward a realistic framework for automatic component verification, easing the manipulation of complex intermediate formats with supportive tools and aiming to provide diagnostic insights for intricate design issues.
