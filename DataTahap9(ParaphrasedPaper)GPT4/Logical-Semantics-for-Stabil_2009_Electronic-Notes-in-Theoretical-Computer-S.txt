Reworded Abstract:

We observe that Lemma 3.5 is applicable only when the conditions of legality are met. The principle described by the subsequent theorem—specifically, the concept that in a derivation, the basis accumulates only the essential information from the premises necessary for the typing—plays a pivotal role in the construction of a model derived from a type assignment system.

Proposition 5.6: Consider X and Y as objects within the category COH. Let 'I' represent the set of all conceivable isomorphisms between X and Y, and 'T' symbolize the set of all potential iso-coherent bijections between the cardinalities of X and Y. A one-to-one correspondence can be set up between the sets 'I' and 'T'.
