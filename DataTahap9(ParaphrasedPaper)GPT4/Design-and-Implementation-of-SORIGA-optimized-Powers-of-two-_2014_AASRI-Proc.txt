Recent advancements in complex algorithms have broadened the scope of signal processing significantly. This expansion has been accompanied by a growing interest in developing hardware-efficient digital systems. This paper explores the creation of a hardware-optimized powers-of-two finite impulse response (FIR) filter, employing a type of evolutionary computation known as the self-organizing random immigrants genetic algorithm (SORIGA). A key part of the research includes a comparative analysis of various multiplier-less FIR filters, specifically examining their hardware complexity when deployed on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The research concludes by underscoring the superior hardware efficiency of the proposed FIR filter design relative to other leading powers-of-two FIR filters.
