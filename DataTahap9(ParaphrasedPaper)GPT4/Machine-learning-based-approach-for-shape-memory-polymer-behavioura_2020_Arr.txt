The academic paper discusses a method involving the use of thermal video data to model the thermodynamics of a Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) foil. The technique entails tracking multiple feature points on the SMP surface to monitor temperature changes while the material is being heated by a constant electric current. This approach goes beyond conventional methods, as it provides a distributed temperature profile across the SMP, demonstrating how the thermodynamics evolve during the heating process.

Subsequently, these temperature profiles from key points were employed to inform a Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) model. The model was trained with data that included the temperature readings from various points on the SMP and aimed to learn the polymorphic transformations observed through video analysis.

The research was conceptualized, executed, and the machine learning modeling was conducted by RD, DR, CC, and DL. They also contributed to the manuscript's writing. Support for this research came from the Data61 business unit and the Active Integrated Matter Future Science Platform, both initiatives of CSIRO, Australia.
