The paper presents OOPS as a user-friendly educational tool, emphasizing its graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is straightforward, allowing students to input formulas effortlessly, or to manage files with ease. Comparable tools like Lotrec, MSPASS, and the Logics Workbench also provide GUI-based interactions.

In the study, it is demonstrated that OOPS is theoretically sound and complete for S5N logic, aligning its implementation with the formal proof method. Nonetheless, OOPS requires exponential time in worst-case scenarios, despite S5N satisfiability being known to be PSPACE-complete. The authors argue that the educational benefits of OOPS outweigh its inefficiency. Future enhancements could include substituting the current algorithm with a more efficient PSPACE algorithm.

The tool allows for variable input, acting as placeholders in rule definitions and creating templates for formulas that can be customized via substitution. Variables are alphanumeric strings beginning with an uppercase character.

Integration with the Lua scripting language ensures that all OOPS methods are accessible within the 'oops' Lua namespace. A theory in OOPS is described as a set of formulas, and it is easy to interact with OOPS via Lua, as shown by an example of adding a formula to a theory in the paper.

OOPS, written in Java, is platform-independent and doesn't require complex installation processesâ€”common issues with other proof tools. It can run on any system supporting a Java Virtual Machine, and is distributed as a zip file that includes all necessary dependencies. Users simply need to extract the zip and run the enclosed OOPS.jar file, making it highly accessible and easy to use.
