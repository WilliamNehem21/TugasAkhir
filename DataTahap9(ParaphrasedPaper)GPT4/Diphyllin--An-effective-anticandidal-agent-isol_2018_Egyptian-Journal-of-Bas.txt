Recent studies have demonstrated that bioactive compounds, both pure and crude, derived from aromatic, toxic, and medicinal plants have been effective in combating bacterial and fungal diseases. There has been a significant rise in research into botanical-based treatments against Candida species over the past ten years. Traditional plant-based remedies have been employed by the population of the Indian subcontinent to address a range of microbial infections.

The identified plants underwent crude extraction using a Soxhlet apparatus, employing distilled water and ethyl acetate as solvents. These crude extracts were then concentrated under vacuum and stored for subsequent experimentation.

For anticandidal testing, C. albicans (NCIM 3471), C. tropicalis (NCIM 3118), and C. glabrata (NCIM 3236) strains were procured from the National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms at the National Chemical Laboratory in Maharashtra, India. Preliminary testing of the water and ethyl acetate extracts, including fractioned compounds, was conducted using the well-diffusion technique, as depicted by Magaldi et al. Inoculum was prepared from 18-hour-old mother cultures of yeast and spread across Petri dishes with Sabouraud dextrose agar. After wells were created with a sterile cork borer, the extracts and fractioned compounds dissolved in 4% dimethyl sulfoxide were introduced in varying concentrations ranging from 100 to 800 mg.

Approximately 179 mg of dry residue was retrieved from the fractionated samples, which yielded green, crystalline compounds that were soluble in organic solvents. The fractioned compound showed an Rf value of 0.37 when a toluene/ethyl acetate mix (4:1 ratio) was used as the mobile phase.

The pursuit of plant-derived therapeutic agents for treating infections has seen an uptick in research endeavors. This botanical material has undergone various biological analyses, with a particular focus on antifungal properties. Typically, Candida species exist harmlessly in healthy humans. However, these yeast-like fungi can result in skin and mucosal infections in individuals with compromised immune systems. The current study assessed the anticandidal efficacy of C. collinus leaf extracts and their specific fractions.
