The paper discusses Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which Yick et al. (2008) define as networks composed of several smart sensor nodes functioning cooperatively to observe and track conditions in various environments. These sensor nodes, containing sensors, processors, memory, power supplies, radios, and actuators, have limitations in energy, communication range, link capacity, and processing and storage abilities. The application and setting for WSN deployment require careful planning. 

Chen et al. (in press, IEEE Sensors Journal) introduced an algorithm to improve coverage in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) and prolong their lifespan by deactivating unnecessary sensors. Their method calculates the rotation angle of sensors using the Overlap-Sense Ratio (OSR) and utilizes the centroid of overlapping areas to determine rotation direction. Yildiz et al. (in press, IEEE Transactions on Computers) addressed optimal camera placement for angular coverage in WMSNs.

Sarisaray-Boluk (2012) compared image quality assessment techniques in WMSNs, finding that PSNR is unaffected by packet size and node/link correlation, while larger packets lead to lower WSNR and higher SSIM and VIF. They suggested a new method, Block-Based Weighted Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (WBPSNR), for on-the-fly image quality evaluation and recommended combining different metrics with assigned weights.

Pudlewski et al. (2012) advocated using Compressed Sensing (CS) as an alternative to traditional video codecs for low-complexity encoder deployment in WMSNs and introduced the C-DMRC algorithm for video streaming over such networks.

Tsai and Lin (2012) proposed a coding approach for Video Sensor Networks to boost efficiency and reduce complexity, compressing MacroBlocks (MBs) by exploiting the redundancy found in foreground and background elements of an image.

Kandris et al. (2011) suggested a routing scheme marrying an energy-efficient routing protocol with a video packet scheduling algorithm to minimize distortion utilizing predicted distortion models. They expanded their work to cater to scalable video coding.

Li et al. (2011) presented a coding and routing strategy using a Power-Rate-Distortion (P-R-D) model for Distributed Video Coding (DVC) to diminish video distortion and extend the network's life. Dai et al. (2012) introduced the Correlation-Aware Quick Response (CAQR) scheme to optimize energy consumption in wireless video sensor nodes under QoS constraints through correlation-based compression and balanced load distribution. They integrated both approaches into a distributed, optimization-based QoS routing framework.

The paper highlights several future research opportunities in WVSNS, emphasizing routing protocols with high QoS and energy efficiency, combined compression, aggregation, and routing strategies to minimize node energy usage, and congestion-aware routing. Optimal sensor camera placement is key to reducing redundancy and addressing mobility challenges for tracked objects or nodes. For multimedia data collection in WMSNs, robust data aggregation, and fusion protocols are necessary.

The field poses various open research questions, indicating WVSNS's relevance across numerous applications. The paper provides a thorough overview of recent research in WVSNS, focusing on video coding and routing, and presents an outlook for ongoing studies in this burgeoning research domain.

Shu et al. (MUM 2007) also contributed research on transmitting streaming data in WMSNs with network voids, indicating the breadth of issues addressed in the field.
