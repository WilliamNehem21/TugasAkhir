To ensure a reliable electricity supply, it is essential to quickly and accurately identify faults in transmission lines, particularly within large-scale networks that include distributed generation (DG). These DG contributions can diminish the effectiveness of traditional current amplitude-based protections, compromising system reliability.

In response to this challenge, an online fault classification method leveraging Global and Local Discriminant Analysis (GLDA) has been developed to improve phase-based fault detection while reducing computational demands. This technique involves analyzing phase shifts in local currents during Single Line to Ground (SLG) faults which helps to enhance the detection of spatial and temporal characteristics.

To accurately assess the organization of these spatial and temporal characteristics, the paper introduces an axiomatic definition for Characteristic Entropy (CE) of grid impedance at individual network buses. This method uses the distribution of characteristics to determine CE. Using GLDA in combination with Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), the proposed system can prioritize and coordinate fault phase classification more effectively.

This multi-priority GLDA-CE fault classification approach can dramatically lower computational load while maintaining resilience against measurement noise and changes in transition resistance. Efficiency and speed are shown to outperform standard statistical entropy and neural network methods when tested on an IEEE 39-bus system equipped with 10 PMUs. This method can classify a range of power outages quickly—226 entire outages and 600 single-phase outages within 1.621 seconds.

In practice, when a fault occurs, the affected branch is isolated by protection relays, which may place additional stress on the remaining grid. Fast classification and self-healing of the fault section is necessary in such events.

The method accommodates random fault distances within a circuit-analysis derived model and estimates the relationship between voltage phase angle shifts along extensive transmission lines during dynamic events. The nonlinear characteristic model for active power flow, with a hyperbolic tangent function description, represents the entropy index and measures matrix consistency.

Fault classification is a two-stage process: first, potential fault sections are estimated using wide-area PMU monitoring; then, voltage and current phases at the potential fault site are analyzed to identify the fault phase.

The characteristic model notably distinguishes fault current flow direction changes with higher acuteness during faults, capturing the dynamic behavior of high-resistance faults on the power line.

The proposed fault classification approach based on spatiotemporal characteristics yields a high generalization capability when faced with measurement noise and fault resistance. It also minimizes the search area and reduces response time, demonstrating 92.414% accuracy and a 1.274-second response time—superior to other tested methods. Consequently, the GLDA-CE method enables synchronous power system monitoring and contributes to rapid restoration efforts.
