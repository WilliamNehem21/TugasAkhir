Scholars have shown an increasing interest in the categorical axiomatization of differential structure, as seen in various works focusing on forward differentiation, reverse differentiation, and tangent structures. A critical aspect of such axiomatic approaches is assessing whether the axioms are appropriately chosen. Often, proponents demonstrate that the axioms are valid in conventional constructions, such as in Cartesian differential categories concerning the category of real number powers and smooth functions, indicating that these axioms are, to a degree, accurate. However, a further inquiry is whether these axioms provide a complete characterization of the concepts at hand, meaning that there might be no axioms left unspecified or omitted.

To address the completeness of such axioms, we use an interpolation theorem, specifically a theorem by Severi concerning Hermite interpolation problem solvability. Hermite interpolation is an extension of Lagrange interpolation, where instead of simply seeking a polynomial that fits a set of points, Hermite interpolation additionally involves matching values of higher-order partial derivatives. Lagrange interpolation's extension to multiple variables is clear and Hermite interpolation further expands this by incorporating the specified derivative values.

Our semantic approach to partial differentiation employs smooth functions over real numbers to provide a concrete function notion. However, to handle the more sophisticated requirements of second-order logic's general theory, a more abstract treatment of function is necessary. Various formulations for such an abstract concept exists, including abstract clones, Lawvere theories, or, conceptually, monoids in a presheaf category of contexts as referenced in the literature.
