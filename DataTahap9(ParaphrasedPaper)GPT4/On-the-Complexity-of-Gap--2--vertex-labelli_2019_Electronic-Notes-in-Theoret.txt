In 2013, A. Dehghan and colleagues introduced the concept of gap-[k]-vertex-labellings for graphs. Their study explored the difficulties of determining whether certain graph families can be labeled accordingly, as well as identifying the minimum k value for which a graph can have such a labeling. They found that the problem of establishing if a graph has a gap-[k]-vertex-labelling is NP-complete, a class of problems known for their computational complexity. The research also referenced a particular way of organizing all the triangles in a given graph G, denoted as T=(t1, t2,..., tp), and utilized this ordered sequence in their analytical discussions, sometimes simplifying the language by stating that a triangle ti is formed by the edges ex, ey, and ez in the edge set E(G).
