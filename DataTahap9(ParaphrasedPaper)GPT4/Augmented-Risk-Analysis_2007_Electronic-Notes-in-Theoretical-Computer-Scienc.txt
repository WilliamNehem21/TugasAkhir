The academic paper discusses the enhancement of traditional risk analysis in modern companies through the introduction of three innovative modificators that refine the assessment of security risks. These modificators adjust existing indicators that quantify key concepts guiding an enterprise's security and safety investments.

1. Exposure Factor During Critical Time (EFCT): This modificator represents the potential percentage of loss or damage an asset may sustain from an attack occurring at a time-sensitive period, emphasizing the importance of temporal context in risk evaluation.
2. Exposure Factor Under Retaliation (EFR): It captures the potential reduction in loss or damage from an attack on an asset that can be countered or avenged by the affected company, highlighting the mitigating effect of the ability to retaliate.
3. Mitigated Risk Against Collusion (MRC): This indicator considers the reduced effectiveness of a security measure when faced with a collusion of attackers rather than a single individual, underscoring the heightened risk of coordinated threats.

The paper also reiterates the process of traditional risk analysis, starting with the identification of assets, followed by the analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, and recommendation of countermeasures. It then details the implementation and assessment of security measures to mitigate risks.

Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the complexity of estimating probabilities such as the Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for different threats, and discusses the interpretation of existing risk indicators like Single Loss Expectancy (SLE), Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE), and the necessity to consider both micro and macro details in a risk analysis.

The paper also critically examines the assumption that an attack's likelihood is unaffected by temporal factors, the mesh of settled precautions, and the traditional approach to security protocols which often call for redesign upon discovering flaws—arguing instead for the practicality of considering retaliation when assessing risks.

In conclusion, the paper argues that its proposed modificators—EFCT, EFR, and MRC—offer profound insights into security risk analysis by considering time-criticality, retaliation, and the reality of collusion among attackers, providing a substantial contribution to the field of risk management. Results from simulations back the potential benefits these novel insights bring to risk analysis.
