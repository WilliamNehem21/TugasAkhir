The commercialization of concurrent software, such as operating systems, emphasizes the significance of their design. Operating systems, as system software, undergo continual enhancements to accommodate new features and hardware. In designing such software, considerations such as reusability and adaptability are crucial.

The principle of separation of concerns suggests handling one issue at a time. It is crucial for the development of concurrent software, providing several benefits, including improved reusability and adaptability. However, there is no universally accepted guideline to help programmers effectively achieve these qualities. Developers must consider how separation of concerns can be applied during design and implementation phases to enhance the systemâ€™s reusability and adaptability.

Design patterns have a role within the concurrent aspect framework. Abstract factory and bridge patterns are employed to construct aspect components. An abstract factory pattern separates the creation process of objects from their representation, improving consistency upon modifications. The bridge pattern, on the other hand, prevents the rigid linkage between abstractions and their implementations, allowing flexibility and extension without affecting functionality. Proxy patterns manage access to these components, organizing responsibilities when they are accessed.

The concurrent aspect framework supports both adaptability and reusability by independently conceptualizing functional and asset components. Design patterns woven into the moderator enable these components to work together without modifications when new system assets are introduced. Reusability is achievable both vertically and horizontally: Vertically, by allowing higher-layer components to utilize abstractions from lower layers, thereby saving time and cost; Horizontally, by supporting the development of different domain objects within the same layer through a common interface.

The framework allows extraction and concern separation through asset components. A moderator orchestrates the interaction between functional and aspect components at joinpoints, ensuring system assets can be reused and adapted independent of functional components, and vice versa. It offers developers the flexibility of language choice for the system and promises time and cost savings in the development of concurrent software. However, a potential drawback is the increase in class numbers.
