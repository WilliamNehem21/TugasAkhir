The paper discusses the critical role of agriculture in food production, income generation, and employment in developing countries, particularly in Africa. With the growing global population, agricultural systems are under increasing pressure to meet the demand. Accurate diagnosis of crop nutritional status and nutrient requirements is essential for farm management, environmental protection, and economic sustainability. Inadequate nutrient management can lead to yield losses, resource inefficiency, soil carbon depletion, and other issues.

This paper reviews machine learning (ML)-based algorithms used over the past decade for estimating fertilizer needs and assessing nutrient status. It identifies common elements, discusses weaknesses, and suggests future directions for this field. The review includes an analysis of detection and classification methods and the challenges that remain in this domain. The paper is structured into sections that cover ML algorithms, feature selection methods, performance metrics, common features for nutrient management, and study selection methodology used in the research.

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, uses mathematical models and complex algorithms to learn from data and perform tasks like classification, prediction, and providing recommendations. The paper discusses various ML algorithms, such as regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees (DT), each with different applications and approaches to solving problems.

The study emphasizes the importance of feature extraction in ML experiments to identify the most informative features from raw data, which is crucial for effective classification. Climate conditions, harvest data, biomass measurements, and nutrient uptake are examples of data points relevant to agricultural productivity and nutrient management.

Recent applications have focused on nitrogen management due to its significance for yield estimation. ML techniques are used to calculate the economically optimal nitrogen rate (EONR) and nitrogen nutrition index (NNI), incorporating factors like rainfall and management practices. Various studies have applied ML to improve nitrogen recommendations, considering soil and weather data, and respective algorithms' performances.

The paper acknowledges the rapid advancements in image-based input analyses, indicating the growing trend in multi-source imaging supported by technological development and computational power. Machine learning models combined with Internet of Things (IoT) data are turning farm management systems into AI systems that make better recommendations for increased productivity.

Despite the advances in nutrient management through digital imagery and ML, practical application faces challenges due to limitations in methodology and data accuracy. The paper also highlights issues with the quality of research publications and stresses that accurate ML applications require expertise in both ML and soil-plant nutrient knowledge.

Overall, the paper suggests that successfully integrating ML with a comprehensive understanding of soil and plant dynamics could lead to improved nutrient management and agricultural yields.
