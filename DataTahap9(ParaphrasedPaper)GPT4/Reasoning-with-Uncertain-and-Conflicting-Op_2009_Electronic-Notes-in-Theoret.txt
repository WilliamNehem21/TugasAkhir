The paper discusses the significance of trust in the context of online services and platforms, which have become ubiquitous in recent years. Users frequently interact with various services and other users, with whom they generally lack prior experience or knowledge. Determining whether these services and users are trustworthy, meaning that they behave as expected (e.g., competent and reliable information sources, responsible handling of personal information), is a critical concern.

The paper describes systems that aggregate user recommendations regarding the trustworthiness of online services and other users. These systems use a trust model to process and calculate a reputation score, which is challenging due to the uncertainty and potential conflicts in trust statements.

To better handle the intricacies of trust, the paper introduces new representations for trust relations and values, capturing degrees of belief, ignorance, disbelief, and conflict. The authors also present a method for logical reasoning with these trust values, improving upon prior models.

A deterministic calculus for discrete trust values is initially employed, which is later extended to handle continuous trust values. This approach to evaluating trust is designed to manage conflicting opinions more effectively and does not suffer from the issues associated with re-normalizations. Additionally, it can be applied to trust graphs of arbitrary structure.

The paper specifies inference rules that determine how reputation systems should combine opinions and the resulting reputation value based on the initial trust relations. It outlines deterministic operators for conjunction, disjunction, negation, recommendation, and consensus used to formulate these rules and later shows their application with both discrete and continuous trust values.

A probabilistic initial view approach is favored, leading to the definition of corresponding probabilistic operators. The authors suggest using these to compute continuous trust values by simulating random experiments based on first-hand trust statements. These experiments then determine the likelihood of different trust outcomes (belief, ignorance, disbelief, and conflict) and thus define the continuous reputation value.

In summary, the paper proposes innovative methods for the assessment of the trustworthiness of online services and users by developing more nuanced trust models capable of managing uncertain and conflicting information.
