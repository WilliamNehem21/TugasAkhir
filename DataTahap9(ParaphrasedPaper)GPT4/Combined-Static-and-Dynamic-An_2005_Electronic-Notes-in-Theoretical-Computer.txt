This paper discusses a method of program analysis that bridges the gap between static and dynamic analyses by employing a "graph-free" approach. Unlike conventional static analyses that use a graph to represent the program's possible states and transitions, this method analyzes properties without such a graph and instead closely simulates dynamic execution.

In the tool named JNuke, static analysis simulates program execution by following computation paths and expanding successor states—similar to dynamic execution—but only considers nondeterministic control flow. Instead of storing a flow graph, a priority queue controls the symbolic execution, and a separate analysis module manages the abstract data and assesses the semantic properties of interest.

During execution, the control module selects unvisited states, the analysis algorithm processes these states to verify properties, and valid successors are queued for further exploration. The approach efficiently manages memory usage by only storing states that are branch targets, although this can lead to revisiting some states multiple times.

Static and dynamic analyses differ in that static analysis considers all possible states whereas dynamic analysis only considers the active states during runtime. The paper introduces a "generic" algorithm that can operate in both static and dynamic environments by encapsulating data representation and instruction semantics within event handlers.

The analysis further employs a summarization technique for method calls that can be context-sensitive (each call is analyzed in its individual context) or context-insensitive (method calls are analyzed with an empty context to avoid repetition).

Ultimately, the paper suggests that most data flow problems can be rendered as set-theoretic issues and approached via a generic algorithm. However, the precision of the analysis hinges on the accuracy of approximating data value relationships like pointer aliasing. The paper claims that adapting static analysis algorithms for dynamic analysis is made more straightforward with this approach. 

The experimental results with JNuke demonstrate that the static version of a stale-value detection algorithm works faster but with less precision than its dynamic counterpart, highlighting the advantages of employing static information to reduce runtime analysis overhead. Lastly, the paper proposes a system that could employ runtime verification for problem cases identified through static analysis, combining the strengths of both analysis types.
