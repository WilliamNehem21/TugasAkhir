This academic paper discusses the properties of subject reduction and strong normalization in the context of a typing system called STA+ (Soft Type Assignment Plus). It revises the definition of strong normalization to consider that a term may have multiple normal forms. The paper establishes that if a term can be typed using STA+, it can achieve any of its normal forms through a polynomial number of reduction steps, assuming reductions are carried out carefully. Additionally, the paper claims that every non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP-time) decision problem can be encoded and simulated by a term typable in STA+, showing that STA+ is both correct and complete for NP-time computational problems.

The structure of the paper is as follows:

1. A recount of Soft Linear Logic (SLL) is provided in Section 2.
2. Section 3 introduces the type assignment system STA, discusses its derivation from SLL, and addresses technical challenges.
3. Section 4 elaborates on how STA, based on SLL and utilizing a natural deduction framework, is designed to maintain subject reduction while also inheriting SLL's favorable computational properties. Linear construction of terms and managing duplications of subterms through specific rules related to the modality are key components of subject reduction in this system.
4. The paper also suggests that to characterize FPSpace (a computational complexity class), the calculus could be enriched with boolean strings and an accompanying type, as well as a rule within the type assignment system to manage them. It implies that while this extension is technically mundane, there are no significant obstacles to incorporating boolean strings into the theory.

In summary, the paper posits that STA+ is an effective typing system that not only ensures correct type assignments through subject reduction but also maps well to computational complexity, representing polynomial-time computations, and potentially, with additional work, FPSpace characterizations.
