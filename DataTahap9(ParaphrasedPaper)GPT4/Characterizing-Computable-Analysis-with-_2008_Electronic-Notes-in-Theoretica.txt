Definition 2.3: Consider a set of functions, referred to as basic functions, denoted by 'b'. Also, consider another set consisting of operations, denoted by 'o'. The term 'fa[b; o]' refers to a function algebra, representing the minimal collection of functions that includes all functions in 'b' and is closed under the application of operations found in 'o'. To enhance readability, the elements of 'b' or 'o' are frequently enumerated as a sequence of items, each separated by commas.
