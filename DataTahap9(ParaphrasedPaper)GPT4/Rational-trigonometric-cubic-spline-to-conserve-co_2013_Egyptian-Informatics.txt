Researchers from various disciplines often require spline interpolation methods that maintain the inherent trend of the data they analyze. This paper introduces a rational trigonometric cubic spline with four adjustable parameters, specifically designed to preserve the convexity of two-dimensional (2D) data. Constraints have been formulated for two of these parameters, b_i and c_i, which are incorporated into the rational trigonometric function to uphold the data's convexity, while the other two parameters, a_i and d_i, remain free. The paper provides numerical examples to show that the interpolation curves generated by this new method are continuously differentiable, denoted as C1 smooth.

The paper underscores the importance of retaining key shape characteristics such as positivity, monotonicity, and convexity in data analysis. Although numerous spline interpolation techniques can produce smooth curves, many fail to conserve the essential shape attributes of the original data, specifically convexity, which is the central focus of this research.

Convexity is a crucial property in various real-life applications including the manufacturing of lenses, the design of automobiles, economic analysis using indifference curves, nonlinear programming, and function approximation. The preservation of convexity is critical in these areas, and any loss of convexity can lead to unacceptable results.

Significant progress has been made over time in the realm of shape-preserving interpolations for data exhibiting a convex pattern. A range of approaches has been developed to effectively preserve convexity. Among the past contributions, Brodlie and Butt's work is highlighted, which succeeded in conserving the convex shape of data by implementing a piecewise cubic function. However, their method introduced the disadvantage of needing extra knots, or interpolation points, in intervals where convexity was compromised.
