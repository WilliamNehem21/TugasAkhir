The paper discusses the application of tropical analysis—a mathematical framework—to understanding and simplifying biochemical networks. The multiscalar nature of these networks, which covers a range of scales, is inherently connected to the concept of dominance. Recent semi-formal methods have used tropical analysis to reduce and hybridize these complex biochemical models. By exploiting the diverse scale differences (multiscaleness), these methods establish dominance relationships among different parameters or reaction rates. This enables the simplification of the original model into a truncated set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by removing less influential terms.

One of the key benefits of using dominance relations within multiscale networks is their potential to manage parameter uncertainty. Rather than exact parameter values, the methods consider their orders of magnitude, which are generally easier to ascertain. However, ensuring that the simplified model's solutions faithfully represent those of the full-scale model remains a significant hurdle, an issue examined in work where a reduction framework was proposed based on timescale separation. Although this timescale separation is supported by theoretical asymptotic convergence results, there is still no clear information on the exact accuracy of the reduced model's trajectories for specific parameter values.

The paper also highlights the Michaelis-Menten system as a straightforward example where the reaction rate constants define the dominance region in which the system operates. However, in more complex biochemical networks, the state can pass through several dominance regions with changing dominant monomials as concentrations vary. Accordingly, the authors present a case study where dominance is concentration-dependent, and the dominance region is dynamic.

To accommodate this variability, their method calculates the most accurate bounds possible for each partitioned state space. Without knowing which region the original system is in at any particular moment, the approach conservatively selects the least accurate bound to ensure overall soundness.

When computing upper bounds for functions, the occurrence of a variable in an expression results in a new safe upper bound. By choosing the minimum such bound, the most precise upper bound is obtained locally. A similar process applies to lower bounds, but with the use of the maximum operation instead.

For the final interpretation of variables on hyperfaces, any instance of a variable is replaced by its equivalent appropriate to the hyperface under consideration, while the others are adjusted based on the context provided in an earlier note.

Lastly, a conservation law is described in the context of a specific biochemical example involving the total initial concentration of kinase Cdc2. Reaction rate constants are set to specific values to ensure the model exhibits oscillatory behavior, illustrating the practical application of the methodology described in the study.
