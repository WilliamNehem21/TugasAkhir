This paper discusses the significant progress made in the realm of biometrics and its application in healthcare. It focuses on the identification of patients through periocular biometric recognition—using the area around the eye—and proposes a novel technique that combines periocular biometrics with the electronic master patient index in healthcare systems to securely identify individuals. This research includes a detailed comparison of various periocular biometric recognition methods, including those based on traditional and deep learning techniques.

The paper also examines situations where biometric identification can be particularly beneficial, such as in cases where patients are unconscious and lack identification. Comparisons are drawn with the use of biometrics in smartphone technology, which helps users access their devices securely without needing a password or PIN.

The paper is methodically laid out, beginning with an introduction to biometric systems and the specifics of periocular biometrics. It continues with an exploration of the functionality and performance metrics of biometric systems, followed by a discussion of the healthcare system, with a particular emphasis on the role of master patient indexes and health information management systems. The paper includes a literature review around biometrics, healthcare systems, and security concerns.

The authors explore their suggested approach for integrating biometrics in healthcare and summarize their findings. Additionally, the paper addresses seven factors for assessing the suitability of biometric traits for authentication. Practical applications are exemplified through the implementation of healthcare information systems with biometric authentication, such as fingerprint and PIN.

Furthermore, the paper delves into the performance assessment of combining different biometric techniques, like online signature and voice recognition, and proposes a deep learning-based classification method for patient biometric data using a modified AlexNet for quicker and efficient identification.

Finally, the paper acknowledges the partial financial support from the NSF and the U.S. Department of Education and clarifies that the findings and recommendations are those of the authors and not necessarily reflective of the supporting institutions' views.
