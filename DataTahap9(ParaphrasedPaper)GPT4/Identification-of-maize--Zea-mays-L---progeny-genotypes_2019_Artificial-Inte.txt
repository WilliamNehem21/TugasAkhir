The study presents a model that calculates the likelihood of a progeny's traits based on its ancestry using Bayesian classification, where 'blc' and 'jne' are the potential class outcomes. This model multiplies the class label's initial probability by the likelihood of given attributes to determine the class label's posterior probability. This approach is deemed distinctively discriminative, in contrast to the generative methods such as logistic regression, as described by Ng and Jordan (2001).

In the research, two maize strains were distinguished by their kernel colors: 'blc' had white, translucent kernels, while 'jne' had yellow kernels. The 'blc' strain was selectively bred for three generations to enhance leaf size, quantity, and plant height, whereas the 'jne' strain underwent random selection. Selected seeds from each strain were acquired through controlled pollination, using a mixture of pollen from multiple male flowers within the same strain and safeguarding the ear shoots with paper bags.

To evaluate the models' effectiveness, accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics were employed, considering the 'blc' genotype as the positive class. Analysis was carried out using the statistical software R.

Breeding efforts for the 'blc' population aimed to produce plants with larger and more numerous leaves, and increased height, with three rounds of selection showing progress towards these goals. The 'blc' genotype had more individuals developing the intended traits, resulting in a more uniform group that was better predicted by the models.

Research by others, such as Kudaravalli et al. (2009), Bersaglieri et al. (2004), Enattah et al. (2005), and Tishkoff et al. (2007), provided evidence of selection pressures altering gene expression and thus phenotype. Additionally, Wang et al. (2018) found that maize leaf width was predominantly controlled by dominant genes unassociated with other identified genes.
