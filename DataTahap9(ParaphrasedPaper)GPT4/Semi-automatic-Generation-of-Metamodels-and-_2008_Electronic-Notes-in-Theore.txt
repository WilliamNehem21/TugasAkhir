The academic paper suggests a framework that enables the automatic creation of a metamodel based on the grammar of a programming language. This is significant because most textual languages currently lack a complete metamodel, which creates a gap in model-based software development tools' ability to process these languages.

The framework not only generates a metamodel but also crafts a compiler that translates programs written in a particular grammar into models adhering to that metamodel. The authors present a method to customize the generated metamodel through annotations inserted directly into the language's grammar, ensuring its appropriateness for different applications.

The paper is organized to first discuss related works, then introduces a quality measurement to evaluate the framework. The framework itself is detailed in Section 4, followed by a discussion of the authors' current implementation. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary.

It criticizes prior work on metamodel generation for being too specific and manual, noting its limitations, such as lack of generality and still unresolved concerns at the model level (M1). In contrast, the proposed framework emphasises adding information to the grammar to improve the metamodel without altering intermediate models.

The authors view quality in a context-dependent manner: the suitability of the metamodel to specific needs reflects its quality. They focus particularly on enabling model transformation into instances of other metamodels.

Key to their approach is the emphasis on semantics over syntax. They suggest starting with an abstract grammar by removing syntactical elements unnecessary for the abstract representation. This shift away from syntax-focused elements such as identifiers allows for direct object referencing within metamodels.

The paper also explains that the framework uses a repository system conformant with the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) 2.0 standards for model generation and transformation, highlighting that their implementation would facilitate the migration of legacy code to modern model-based software development practices.

Ultimately, the authors aim to enhance the understandability, ease of use, and reliability of software development, reengineering, and modernization by leveraging model-based tools for programs written in traditional textual languages. The paper cites scholarly sources to support its contentions and methodology.
