Control operators display a wide range of forms, and there is often confusion in their terminology, as seen in the use of 'catch' and 'throw' in different programming languages, which may share names but not functionalities. For instance, 'catch' in early versions of the Scheme language and 'throw' in Standard ML of New Jersey differ significantly from their namesake constructs in LISP, despite the fact that LISP's 'catch' is, at its core, akin to exception handling mechanisms.

These control structures facilitate labeling and jumping within a programming language, with 'here' and 'go' being a symmetric pair handling continuations. 'Here' aligns the jump continuation with the current continuation, whereas 'go' switches the current argument's continuation to a specified jump continuation. Variable and function application clauses don't directly manipulate this additional jump continuation: variables ignore it, and function applications pass it along to their components.

In typing systems, particularly when dealing with call-with-current-continuation (call/cc), the interplay between 'here' and 'go' becomes evident. A 'go' can move out of a 'here' context or enter into one, relying on statically determined bindings for functionality.

Two key scenarios illustrate that although function calls receive a dynamic jump continuation as an argument, it is generally not utilized within the function body. Function definitions should account for this by expecting an argument of a certain type, which should be polymorphic to handle the diverse 'here' contexts from different calls.

The study analyzes control mechanisms by employing continuation-passing style (CPS) transforms and by evaluating the typing systems of the original source code. Another approach would involve examining the typing within the CPS target code. The study notes that on the source side, there's a split between intuitionistic and classical typing, while on the target side, the delineation falls between linear and intuitionistic typing. Future work aims to bridge the gap between these differing perspectives.
