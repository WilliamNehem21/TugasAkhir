This study collected over 100 research papers on deep learning applications in computer vision for agriculture, reviewing their use in tasks like plant health monitoring, disease identification, and yield estimation. The authors emphasize the increasing role of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification and object detection, which are crucial for automating agricultural activities. GANs and other deep learning methods also contribute to soil analysis and disease identification.

Techniques such as wavelet transform for soil texture classification and computer vision for weed detection demonstrate the potential for these technologies in optimizing resource use and streamlining farm operations. Advances in computer vision help with precise plant species identification, which is vital for weed control and cataloging plant species.

Deep learning algorithms like AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet have shown promise in distinguishing crop species and weeds, outperforming traditional image processing approaches. For example, CNNs successfully classified leaves of various crop species and weeds, aiding in yield estimation. Studies indicate that deep learning models using aerial images can provide more accurate yield predictions than standard methods.

The paper also highlights the deployment of computer vision in livestock management, where startups provide AI systems to monitor animal health and behavior. The authors note the importance of addressing challenges associated with implementing such technologies on a larger scale, including integration with other digital solutions like IoT and ensuring data security.

In conclusion, deep learning and computer vision are significantly advancing agricultural practices by enhancing precision and efficiency, though scalability and security remain key considerations for widespread adoption.
