This paper presents Bio-PEPA, an extension of the Process Algebra (PEPA) developed for computer system performance analysis, now tailored for the modeling and analysis of biochemical networks. Bio-PEPA enhances PEPA with capabilities to represent biological features such as stoichiometry and diverse kinetic laws. It serves as a formal, compositional framework that can support various types of analysis on biological systems and represents a high level of abstraction, focusing on species interactions without detailing their structures.

In Bio-PEPA, species are represented as processes that can engage with each other, with their interactions modeled by actions connected to functional rates expressing kinetic laws. These rates are calculated at the time of the system's reduction, or simplification. Bio-PEPA is designed to be applicable across various biochemical networks, including gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways, and metabolic pathways.

Key aspects of the language involve characterizing the roles of different species in reactions, capturing the dynamics of the system through kinetic laws, and using functional rates to describe these dynamics flexibly. Moreover, Bio-PEPA introduces stoichiometric coefficients into the syntax, which play a critical role in the rate calculations and subsequent analysis, although they do not affect the concentration levels of species represented.

The paper includes a case study of a simple genetic network modeled in Bio-PEPA to demonstrate its application. This example describes a network involving the inhibition of a process by the final product, transcription of a protein, degradation of molecules, and dimerization reactions with varied kinetics, including mass-action and inhibition/Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

Bio-PEPA's introduction is intended to address the limitations of standard PEPA for representing biochemical systems more realistically, considering stoichiometry and kinetics. The authors suggest future work to delve deeper into the relationship between Gillespie simulation and general kinetic laws and to explore the use of model checking techniques in analyzing Bio-PEPA systems. This direction points towards expanding the tool's analytical capabilities and refining its adaptability to various biological contexts.
