The study of concurrent systems can benefit significantly from examining their geometrical properties. This perspective has been gaining traction in the field of concurrency theory. In our research, we present a new concept of directed homology tailored to semicubical sets. This concept aims to serve as a robust invariant for higher-dimensional automata, weakly synchronizing PV processes, and other frameworks associated with concurrency. We anticipate that directed homology will have multiple applications in these areas.
