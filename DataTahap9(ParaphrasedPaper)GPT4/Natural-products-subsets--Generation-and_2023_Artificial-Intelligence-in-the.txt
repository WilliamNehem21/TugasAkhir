The study discusses the use of various compound databases, particularly focusing on those that catalog natural products, in order to evaluate structural diversity and natural product-likeness (NPL) scores of compounds. Among these, COCONUT and the Universal Natural Product Database (UNPD) stand out as two of the largest public databases, with COCONUT hosting 389,184 unique structures and UNPD comprising 153,375 compounds, the latter also including chirality information. Additionally, the BIOFACQUIM database, which contains 531 natural products from Mexico, notes the chirality of its entries.

For the purpose of this research, three natural product datasets (COCONUT, UNPD, BIOFACQUIM) and one dataset targeting DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitors, an epigenetic target of interest in drug discovery, were used. The dataset of DNMT1 inhibitors was sourced from ChEMBL database release 31.

Data curation involved the removal of compounds with valence errors or uncommon elements, retention of stereochemistry where applicable, separation of multi-component compounds, and tautomer standardization.

T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and Tree Map (TMAP) techniques, as well as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), were utilized for visualizing compound arrangements based on similarity and to organize compounds hierarchically by common substructures.

The study also presents the creation of three UNPD subsets through the MaxMin algorithm, identifying 14,994, 7,497, and 4,998 of the most structurally diverse compounds. It was found that structural diversity is not influenced by the division of original databases and that UNPD subsets maintain high diversity. The visualization of chemical space via extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP6) was deemed more accurate than ECFP4 and MACCS keys in reflecting structural diversity.

Finally, the paper concludes that the natural product subsets (from COCONUT, UNPD, and BIOFACQUIM) exhibit a wide range of structurally diverse compounds with properties important for pharmaceutical applications. The NPL score, which is used to measure how typical a compound's chemical structure is of natural products, confirmed the high diversity of structures within these databases, with values close to 5 indicating significant variance.
