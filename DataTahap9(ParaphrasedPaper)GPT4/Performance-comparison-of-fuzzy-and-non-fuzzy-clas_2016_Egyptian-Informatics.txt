Data analysis encompasses a variety of techniques and tools for data management, with classification and clustering being prominent multivariate methods that organize datasets into homogenous groups. The goal is to sort objects in such a way that those that are similar end up in the same group, whereas dissimilar objects are placed in different groups. Clustering is widely used across many fields, including pattern recognition, machine learning, image analysis, medical diagnosis, and bioinformatics.

One particular fuzzy iterative algorithm, called GK (an extension of Fuzzy C-Means or FCM), was originally devised by Gustafson and Kessel and later refined by Babu≈°ka and others. These improvements included an adaptive distance norm designed to detect varied cluster shapes within a dataset, especially when the covariance matrix 'FI' is near singular. This flexibility is achieved by the introduction of matrix 'AI'. Application of the GK, KM (K-Means), and FCM algorithms to a dataset led to the categorization of two clusters with varying accuracy levels with regard to how well they correctly classified samples into two predefined classes.

In a liver disease dataset, the K-Means algorithm showed an accuracy of around 9.85% for Class 1 and 87.94% for Class 2. The FCM method had an accuracy of about 11.97% for Class 1 and 81.91% for Class 2, while the GK method posted accuracies of approximately 15.49% for Class 1 and 77.38% for Class 2.

Comparative analyses determined that on the liver disorder dataset, K-Means had the highest overall classification accuracy at 55.43%, followed by FCM at 52.79%, and GK at 51.62%. Similarly, for a dataset on wine, K-Means achieved the best performance with a 70.22% accuracy rate, while FCM and GK achieved 68.54% and 60.68%, respectively. These figures illustrate how the respective algorithms perform on different datasets and highlight the strengths and limitations of each technique.
