The academic paper discusses the concept of reachability within the context of nondeterministic communication automata (NCAs), comparing it to reachability in nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) and deterministic finite automata (DFAs). The paper states that reachability in pointed NCAs is analogous to that in NFAs: there should be no proper sub-automaton within a pointed NCA, similar to the context of NFAs. In the case of pointed DFAs (which can be seen as NCAs with identity closure), the idea of reachability is standard since each state can be reached by a unique path from the initial state.

For pointed NFAs, however, there is always a smallest reachable sub-NFA, obtained by removing all states that cannot be reached from the initial states through transitions. This reflects a categorical principle: the intersection of all reachable pointed sub-NFAs must exist.

The paper also claims that for any pointed NCA, one can always construct a unique reachable sub-NCA, implying that the intersection of all reachable pointed sub-NCAs exists as well.

Example 4.3(1) from the paper further discusses NFAs and the topological nature of an NFA when it has identity closure. The example given illustrates a special case where the number of states of a state-minimal DFA (denoted as dl) is twice the number of states of a state-minimal NFA (denoted as nl) accepting the same language L.

Furthermore, the paper proposes that if N(L) is topological, then so is N(rev(L)), indicating that the property is preserved when reversed. This is based on the fact that closed sets forming a distributive lattice in one configuration will imply that their order-dual (or reverse) will form a distributive lattice as well, and this reverse will be isomorphic to the closed sets of the reverse language (rev(L)).
