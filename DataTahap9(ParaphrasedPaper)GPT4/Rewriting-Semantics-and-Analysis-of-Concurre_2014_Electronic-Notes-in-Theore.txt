When a function is invoked, a set of three elements is placed onto the function stack: the function's name, the environment at the time of the call, and the remaining steps of the computation. Subsequently, the function's body takes the place of the current computation while the argument-value mapping updates the environment. Upon completion of the function, the original environment and computation are reinstated, with the function's outcome substituting for its call.
