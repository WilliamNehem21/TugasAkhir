In this section, the authors introduce a concise process calculus to analyze the PDL (Propositional Dynamic Logic) programs discussed in Section 2. They demonstrate that two processes are equivalent in terms of bisimilarity precisely when they share an identical set of potential finite runs within their context. This concept draws inspiration from previous work.

To establish the soundness of their approach, the authors must confirm the validity of each axiom within the specific frame types and ensure that the validity is maintained by the inference rules. The validity of Axioms 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, as well as the associated inference rules, are acknowledged within the existing PDL research community, as referenced. The paper proceeds to specifically prove the validity of Axiom 4.

Looking ahead, potential research could focus on determining the exact computational complexity of the satisfiability problem for the extended version of PDL, termed PDL+. While PDL already established EXPTIME-hardness, the authors hypothesize that PDL+ could also be EXPTIME-complete, similar to PDL. To support this conjecture, the authors aim to develop an EXPTIME algorithm to solve the satisfiability problem for PDL+.
