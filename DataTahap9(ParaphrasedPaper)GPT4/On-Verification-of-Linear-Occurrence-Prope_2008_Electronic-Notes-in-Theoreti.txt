In the paper, the researchers delve into a specific subset of probabilistic real-time automata that is deterministic except where decisions about timing are concerned. These models are used to explore real-time systems. They then introduce an extended logical framework, known as Pwdc, which involves formulas that constrain the probability that a given satisfaction condition—represented by a WDC formula—is met by potential adversaries within the model of a deterministic probabilistic real-time automaton, within a certain time frame.

The researchers have also developed methods to verify whether these deterministic probabilistic real-time automata meet certain criteria expressed by Pwdc formulas.

Furthermore, the paper presents the concept of Linear Occurrence Invariants (LOIs), alongside an algorithm that can validate whether a real-time automaton complies with an LOI through the use of integer programming. WDC, or Weakly Dynamic Constraints, are used to define these LOIs. Though the authors postpone a detailed discussion of probabilistic WDC to a later section, they initially describe WDC formulas as an extended version of DC (Dynamic Constraints) formulas. In this context, the extension includes terms that reflect the count of a state variable's occurrences, and it is noted that multiple state changes may occur simultaneously.
