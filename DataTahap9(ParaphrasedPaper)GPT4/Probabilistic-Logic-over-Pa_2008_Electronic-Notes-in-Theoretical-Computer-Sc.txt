In this academic paper, the authors present a probabilistic modal logic named PPL that builds upon previous work, integrating a probabilistic path operator capable of arbitrary nesting, and they demonstrate its completeness. The authors establish that this logic surpasses previous logics in expressive power by analyzing a probabilistic extension of CTL (Computation Tree Logic), illustrating the necessity of this enhanced expressiveness in certain applications.

The paper references the study of various probabilistic temporal logics during the 1990s which involved the integration of probabilities into temporal logics. In particular, the probabilistic extension of CTL was explored in previous works, which also addressed the decidability of model checking. The current definition of probabilistic extension differs only slightly from these earlier definitions.

To support their claims, the authors offer a proof of soundness which they describe as relatively straightforward. To establish completeness, they demonstrate that any consistent formula can be represented within a model. Notably, the constructed model contains only a finite number of worlds, and the maximum number of worlds is determined by an exponential function in relation to the formula's size. The paper begins by defining some essential notation, stating that every term can be reduced to a linear sum of primitive terms, as indicated in definition 1.1.
