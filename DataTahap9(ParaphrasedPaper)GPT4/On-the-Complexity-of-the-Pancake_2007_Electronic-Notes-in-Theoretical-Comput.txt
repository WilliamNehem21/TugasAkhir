This paper investigates the computational complexity of determining a bisecting line (a bisector) for two distinct scenarios within a two-dimensional plane, often referred to as the "pancake problem," using Ko's oracle Turing machine model. The first scenario involves finding a bisector for a single set at a specific angle; the second entails finding a common bisector for two sets.

The key findings of the research are as follows:

1. The computational task of finding a bisector for a single "nice" (also called "thick") set that can be approximately solved in polynomial time at a given angle is associated with the #P complexity class.

2. Identifying a common bisector for two "nice" sets that are linearly separable and can also be approximated in polynomial time falls into the #P complexity class.

3. Computing a bisector becomes exceedingly difficult when the "niceness" (thickness) or linear separability criteria are not met, and this holds true even if a unique solution exists.

The paper discusses the relevant computational models and the definitions of discrete complexity classes. It also touches on theoretical concepts, such as the Intermediate Value Theorem and the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, and how they relate to the Pancake Theorem within two dimensions.
 
In essence, the paper's contribution is the characterization of the difficulty of finding bisectors within the given contexts, highlighting that while certain bisector problems are manageable and can be categorized within known complexity classes, others are computationally intractable.
