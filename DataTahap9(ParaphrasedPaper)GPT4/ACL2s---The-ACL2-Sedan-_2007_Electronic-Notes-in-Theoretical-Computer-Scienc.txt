This academic paper discusses an analysis method that significantly simplifies termination analysis for students, allowing instructors to postpone or avoid teaching this complex topic until after students are comfortable using ACL2. The tool, ACL2s, is designed with multiple levels to aid learners from beginners to experts, breaking down the major concepts of ACL2 into digestible modules.

The paper introduces a programming mode in ACL2, aimed at helping newcomers learn ACL2 as a language for writing untyped, total functions. This mode relaxes the usual logical constraints, preventing all runtime errors except those caused by memory exhaustion. It also supports macro definition and usage.

It further explains the visual feedback provided in the source editor: when the '(begin-book)' command is initiated, the editor highlights the section with a light purple color, which expands as long as subsequent forms are legally part of a book. Following '(begin-book)', an '(in-package...)' is required, and then only 'events' are permitted.

Additionally, the session editor of ACL2 can handle non-command inputs, such as yes/no prompts and proof checker interactions, which all expect a single Lisp object as input. The plugin is designed to identify when such input is requested by ACL2.

The paper also describes a basic script management interface within the DrScheme environment that allows interaction with the theorem prover. Although this interface is still in development and can be unstable, it raises an important observation about the potential disconnect between two interfaces that operate on the same input buffer, where actions in one interface may not be reflected in the other. For instance, defining a function in the read-eval-print loop does not guarantee it will be defined in the theorem prover's logical environment.
