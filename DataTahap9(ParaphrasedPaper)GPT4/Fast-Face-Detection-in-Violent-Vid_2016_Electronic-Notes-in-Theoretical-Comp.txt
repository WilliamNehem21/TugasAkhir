In this research, we focus on recognizing faces in violent scenes to aid in security monitoring. Initially, we employ the Violent Flows (ViF) descriptor with the Horn-Schunck method for detecting violence in videos. To enhance video clarity, we employ a non-adaptive interpolation super-resolution technique. We then use the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) algorithm to detect faces. To ensure rapid processing, we run the super-resolution and face detection algorithms in parallel using CUDA technology. We gathered data from surveillance camera footage to create a violence dataset and also utilized the BOSS dataset. Our approach shows promising results for detecting faces in violent settings.

Surveillance camera systems are prevalent, and despite their ability to monitor situations, they're often hampered by the limited attention span and training of those tasked with monitoring the footage. Thus, we're driven to develop technological solutions that enhance safety by detecting potential violence. Identifying violent individuals in footage is crucial for public safety.

Our solution demonstrates good performance using the MediaEval cost function metric. The MediaEval 2013 dataset used in related works comprises movie clips with ideal conditions like lighting and resolution. Other studies have looked at combining audio features, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), with visual features like Histogram of Flows (HOF), ViF, and color descriptors, and evaluated their algorithms on the MediaEval 2014 dataset. These studies suggest that audio cues may be more indicative of violence than visual ones and that combining audio and visual data can yield even better results.

Our super-resolution technique involves projecting a low-resolution image onto a high-resolution model to estimate its degradation, generating simulated low-resolution frames, and then correcting the projection errors iteratively until the image quality improves significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached. The process iteratively refines the high-resolution image using the accumulated projection errors.
