This paper presents a semantic approach to modeling concurrency, where the concept of concurrency is separate from non-determinism, and targets the representation of deterministic concurrent behavior in recursive processes that deal with consumable resources. The semantic framework is built upon newly conceived algebraic domains called real and complex multi-polyadic partially ordered sets (multi-pomsets). The process language in focus includes various deterministic and quantitative operators—such as renaming, hiding, restriction, and operators for serial and parallel execution—alongside a recursion operator. An operational machine that is deterministic in nature generates both linear and complex operational semantics. A compositional denotational semantics is also established using complex multi-pomsets in a functional domain, which is proven to be fully abstract when compared to both the linear and complex operational semantics.

The paper notes that the only concurrent semantics models that have been developed with corresponding operational and denotational programming semantics, which include process combination and recursion, were introduced in past research. These models rely on pomsets, a specific kind of event structure that easily denotes truly concurrent process combinations and is inspired by the relationship between processes and resources.

The paper's format is methodical: it revisits the fundamentals of partial orders, introduces the real and complex multi-pomsets, describes the process language and its semantics for resource consumption, presents the deterministic operational machine with the ensuing semantics, and finally details the compositional denotational semantics. It concludes with the primary findings that this denotational semantics matches the operational semantics well. 

Using the developed framework, the multiplicity in the actions towards resources can represent different measures like time or quantity. Through concrete computational and workflow management examples, the semantics of actions consuming resources are illustrated.

Moreover, the paper outlines the generalization of the semantics for parallel composition using channels for synchronization. This model can simulate data-parallel programs on parallel random-access machines (PRAMs).

However, unlike classical process languages, this paper deliberately excludes non-deterministic choice, suggesting that domains over complex multi-pomsets can handle choices more transparently, albeit with added complexity in the domain-theoretic tools. An alternative philosophy would be to enhance real multi-pomsets with an additional relation indicating event conflicts, bringing the model closer to traditional event structures.
