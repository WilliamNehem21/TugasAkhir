This academic paper describes the development of a GIS server system application using ArcGIS technology, aimed at enhancing the support for biodiversity observation studies. The system's effectiveness was tested utilizing a survey database from China. The developed application has proven beneficial for the creation, distribution, and use of biodiversity information.

Asia faces significant biodiversity loss, with critical observation sites located in China, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Japan. Within these locations, collaborative efforts between scientists, citizens, and public entities focus on integrated observations. The paper's goal is to present a GIS-based server system database that streamlines data integration and expedites the dissemination of updated biodiversity data.

The paper outlines key challenges faced by researchers when managing complex GIS datasets, which vary in data types, volumes, and structures. It emphasizes the need for centralized databases to improve the monitoring of workflows and the management of Asian biodiversity information.

Remote sensing data forms a cornerstone of biodiversity monitoring, presenting difficulties in terms of data access performance due to its sheer volume and historical depth. The proposed research aims to use GIS image server technology to improve access to large image datasets.

Moreover, the research highlights the necessity for collaboration across various sectors. There is a need for accessible applications that allow scientists and the public to interact with GIS data without requiring extensive technical expertise.

The paper suggests that the development of an integrated high-performance dynamic data-sharing system, consisting of GIS server, image server, and engine applications, will enhance efficiency and effectiveness. By leveraging GIS portals, a variety of intuitive tools can be offered to users at different observation levels.

The advantages of sharing GIS resources on servers include ease of access to geographic biodiversity data through web applications, ranging from simple map displays to applications with complex GIS tools.

The research is evolving towards the development of server applications via ArcGIS Server Manager, providing web service applications and web mapping applications that cater to the diverse functions required by users, such as data display, printing, querying, editing, and creating thematic maps.

Finally, the paper presents a case study from the East Tiaoxi River basin in China to evaluate the efficiency of the GIS server system in disseminating biodiversity information. The study finds the developed application useful for integrating and sharing observational data online, with current limitations in displaying complex spatial relationships, such as those found in gene and species information.
