In this paper, the authors demonstrate the application of information theory to quantitatively define the concept of interference among variables within imperative programming languages. Specifically, the paper concentrates on a case where this definition is applied to the transfer of information from private variables to public ones in programs written in the WHILE language. The key contribution of the paper is a quantitative analysis for this language that uses a graph, called a use-definition graph, to estimate the upper limits of information leakage into each variable.
