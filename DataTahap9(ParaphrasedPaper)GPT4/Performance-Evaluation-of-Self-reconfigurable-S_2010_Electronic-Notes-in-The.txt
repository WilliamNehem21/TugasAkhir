In the emerging framework of open-world software, the landscape is dynamic, necessitating that software programs adjust and modify their operations in real-time. This open-world concept allows for the incorporation of new components that the software can identify and integrate on the fly. Rather than developing software from the ground up, this paradigm shifts towards the aggregation of pre-existing services created by external parties. Current methodologies, such as publish-subscribe systems, grid computing, autonomic computing, and Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), alongside their practical implementations like web services, partly endorse the principles of open-world software. These services act as adaptable abstractions, designed to bridge various technologies like sensors and GPS.

The paradigm recognizes two principal roles: the service provider, who develops services in diverse environments for unknown future use, and the service integrator, who constructs applications by calling on those externally hosted services. Effective service integration requires that these services distinctly delineate their capabilities and limitations, broker quality of service (QoS) levels through service level agreements (SLAs), are discoverable and can be linked during runtime, and permit monitoring of their actual performance. This study primarily addresses the latter two requirements.

This work acknowledges that service workloads can differ and that while some studies assume negotiated QoS values from third-party providers to be trustworthy and stable, it advocates for a cautionary approach. To this end, it seeks to assess and predict the provider's current QoS without relying exclusively on pre-negotiated values, which may affect the precision of the results. This investigation draws inspiration from several existing works that tackle the challenge of ensuring QoS from potentially unreliable third-party services. Contrasting with approaches that distribute the workload across multiple providers to introduce fault tolerance, this paper proposes a system that targets the selection of optimal services based on their QoS performance.
