The last lines of a Java class discussed in this paper indicate that the methods f and h are native methods with specific signatures, and they are implemented in languages such as C or C++. To integrate these methods with Java, the Java Native Interface (JNI) is used. Executing the tool 'javah' on a class file generates prototype declarations necessary for the JNI, producing a file that specifies the expected C or C++ procedure names for these native Java methods.

RIPLS (Reasoning about Interoperability of Programming Language Systems) is a formal system with a focus on reasoning about interoperability between different PLSs, such as JVM and C++ runtime. RIPLS has type safety and progress properties established through formal proofs, and it allows for the reasoning about multiple PLSs by using effects and mechanism annotations. Exception effects are uniquely handled in RIPLS, where they are retracted by exception handlers if the exception is always dealt with within a particular expression, raising questions about its external effect.

The paper discusses the naming conventions mandated by JNI for the native methods, consisting of the prefix 'java_', the class name, and the method name. Overloaded methods would have additional information in their name to indicate argument types. The paper also notes that programmers have to write glue code due to this naming structure.

When examining interoperable Java and C++ code using RIPLS, issues undetected by conventional compilers were revealed through type-checking in RIPLS, showing the value of translating components into this common formal language.

The authors have started developing practical methods and automated tools based on these formal foundations to assist developers in creating correct systems with components in different languages, demonstrating prototypes that facilitate the generation of interoperable Java and C++ classes, particularly when handling exceptions.

The promising outcomes of the RIPLS approach motivate further development of both the formal foundations and practical tools. The paper suggests future work to refine and extend RIPLS to cover additional aspects of multi-lingual object-oriented programming, such as method dispatching and parametric polymorphism, as well as potentially supporting various memory models like garbage collection and explicit memory management.
