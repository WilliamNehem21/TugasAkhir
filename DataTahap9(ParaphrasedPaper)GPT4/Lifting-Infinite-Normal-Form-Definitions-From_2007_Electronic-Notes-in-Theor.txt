Non-confluence in prior research led to technical issues which had to be resolved anew for each defined infinite normal form. An improved method was suggested, segregating issues linked to substitutions from those tied to rewrite systems. This separation involves defining a term graph's infinite normal form in relation to its unwinding's infinite normal form. An implicit assumption is needed wherein a graph's infinite normal form matches the unwinding's infinite normal form.

This framework creates complications for modeling certain side-effects, like assignments that are sensitive to sharing, within programming languages using `letrec` for recursion. Nonetheless, these effects can be modeled non-recursively before implementing recursion with `letrec`.

The paper outlines preliminaries before introducing a definition of infinite normal form. It also discusses adapting rewrite relations and infinite normal forms from terms to graphs, enabling identification of certain term graph rewrite systems and their corresponding infinite normal forms.

For deriving cyclic extensions, one may start by integrating `letrec` for substitutions into the rewrite rules' right-hand sides, add rules that maintain the unwinding, and then perform some form of completion. This forms a simple cyclic extension akin to the one presented in the introduction. If the extension comes from an orthogonal CRS, an existing theorem can be utilized to demonstrate infinitary soundness.

Despite this, one cannot equate a single rewrite step on a cyclic term with a corresponding step on an approximation. Comprehensive discussions on completeness are found elsewhere, and this paper merely describes a potential solution.

The main contribution is a framework allowing infinite normal form definitions to transition from term to term graph rewrite systems. It tackles the issue of non-confluence by shifting the focus to infinitary soundness proofs. For such proofs, established results regarding rewrite rules that maintain term unwinding are applicable. Although this new approach asserts benefits, the previously established concept of skew confluence remains valuable for proving certain characteristics of rewrite rules related to term unwinding.
