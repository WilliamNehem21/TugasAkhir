Protein denaturation experiments were conducted with some alterations to previously established protocols. In summary, 0.1 ml of egg white albumin was combined with 1.9 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.4) and 1 ml of various concentrations of a water-based plant extract, resulting in final concentrations ranging from 31.25 to 250 µg/ml.

Ever since Folkman proposed the concept of tumor angiogenesis, the inhibition of tumor-induced blood vessel growth has been considered a promising approach to cancer treatment, with the potential to be effective across varying types of cancer. The plant extract in question demonstrated strong anti-angiogenic capabilities by preventing blood vessel formation in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), with the degree of inhibition being correlated with the dosage. Throughout the range of doses tested, there were no fatal incidents among the embryos, suggesting that the observed anti-angiogenic effects were not attributable to the toxicity of the plant extract. This particular extract exhibited greater anti-angiogenic activity compared to the aqueous extracts of Oncoba welwitschii and Tetrorchidium oppositifolium, which had shown an 83.334% inhibition at a concentration of 500 µg/ml. The CAM is a membrane outside the embryo mainly used for gas and nutrient exchange and is heavily vascularized, making it an ideal model for researching tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, and for screening anti-tumor drugs. Hence, the results point towards Lophira procera extract's potential to inhibit tumor growth by obstructing angiogenesis, offering scientific support for its traditional use in treating breast cancer.

The diverse biological activities exhibited by Lophira procera are believed to arise from the presence of different chemical groups within the plant, particularly due to its rich content of phenolic compounds. Thus, the traditional use of this plant for treating conditions such as ulcers, breast cancer, and pain is substantiated. Future research will focus on isolating and identifying the specific phenolic compounds responsible for these beneficial activities.
