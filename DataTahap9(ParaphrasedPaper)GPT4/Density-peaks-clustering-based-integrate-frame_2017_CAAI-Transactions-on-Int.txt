We introduce an innovative unsupervised integrated scoring system for generating general extractive summaries from multiple documents that involves ranking sentences using a dynamic programming approach. This framework is superior because, unlike earlier cluster-based approaches that overlook the significance of words, it accounts for relevance, diversity, informativeness, and sentence length limitations in a comprehensive manner. We utilize density peaks clustering to simultaneously obtain relevance and diversity scores for sentences. On the DUC2004 benchmark, our system achieved the highest performance, yielding a ROUGE-1 score of 0.396, ROUGE-2 score of 0.094, and ROUGE-SU4 score of 0.143, surpassing common baselines including DUC Best, FGB, and BSTM.

In the digital age, the overabundance of information such as news, emails, tweets, and blogs has created a pressing need for multi-document summarization (MDS) to enable consumers to quickly understand the extensive information contained in large document collections. Current extractive methods, which simply string together key sentences without modification, warrant an enhancement that considers four pivotal aspects.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the background motivating our research. Section 3 outlines our multi-document summarization framework and procedure based on dynamic programming. Sections 4 and 5 present the evaluation of our technique on the DUC2004 dataset for multi-document summarization, concluding with future research directions.

Existing summarization methods are mainly extractive and vary from supervised approaches (which rely on labeled training data relevant to the model) to novel applications of sparse coding. Supervised methods are limited by their dependency on training data, which causes problems when the summarization goal or document characteristics change, necessitating retraining.

Our method diverges from prior cluster-based models by integrating a weighted score framework to rank sentences based on their salience and remove redundancy. We utilise dynamic programming to select optimally relevant sentences.

To ensure broad topic coverage, it's necessary to capture core and subsidiary topics without sentence overlap. Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) is a known method to avoid redundancy by considering both relevance and information novelty. Our density peaks clustering approach ensures diverse sentence selection by maximizing distance from higher density points.

We experimented with our integrated scoring system on the development dataset, optimizing parameters a, b, and g to achieve the best summarization results.

Finally, using DUC2007 as the development set, we investigated the relationship between the integrated score parameters and the summary quality as evaluated by ROUGE metrics. Our integrated score system used informative content words for informativeness while employing DPC for sentence relevance and diversity. Through dynamic programming, we chose sentences while honoring length restrictions. Our extensive experimentation on standard datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our multi-document summarization method.
