In the academic paper summarized here, the authors discuss the use of Matching Logic as a program logic within the framework of traditional axiomatic semantics. Similar to Separation Logic, Matching Logic facilitates the specification of a program's structural state properties. However, this application shares a significant drawback with Hoare Logics: it necessitates the redefinition of the target language's formal semantics axiomatically and requires the arduous task of proving soundness. The authors opt for a different approach, leveraging the operational semantics of the programming language for verification.

The paper details the methodology of using the K framework for program verification through several sections. Section 4.1 presents the programming language employed for demonstration, Section 4.2 explains how to use K for symbolic execution, Section 4.3 demonstrates its application in verifying implications of Matching Logic formulae, and Section 4.4 discusses abstraction patterns.

It is noted that the verifier applies rules only from a specific subset (C) when rewriting a pattern with rules from both S and C, unrolling loops and calling functions only when they lack specifications. The tool utilizes abstraction axioms to generate a more concrete pattern based on the current pattern's implications. For instance, if the pattern suggests that a linked list's head is not null, the tool will perform automatic list unrolling.

The paper mentions analysis of tree data structures, verifying that functions preserve the data structure's invariant and that the element multiset matches expectations. Considering performance, the paper indicates that analyzing the AVL insert and delete functions takes about 3 minutes due to executing the bodies of unspecified auxiliary functions, leading to an increased number of analytical paths.

Regarding the Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm, which is widely used in garbage collection, the paper describes its analysis by the K framework, validating that a node is marked if and only if it is reachable from the initial nodes without altering the node set. This algorithm is challenging to verify; however, the authors achieved this for both the algorithm and its simplified version, where the graph is actually a tree.

The paper also discusses the compatibility of shape analysis with Matching Logic for verifying heap structures, suggesting that previous work with shape analysis and Separation Logic could be integrated with Matching Logic to infer patterns for programs operating on lists.

Lastly, the paper introduces MatchC, a Matching Logic verifier for a deterministic subset of the C programming language based on the K framework. It details the implementation aspects of the verifier and establishes its soundness grounded in the Matching Logic reachability proof system. MatchC has been tested on various programs, some posing significant verification challenges, demonstrating its effectiveness in program verification.
