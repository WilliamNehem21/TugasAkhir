Formal modeling techniques provide a framework for analyzing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Colored Petri Nets (CPNs), an advanced form of Petri Nets, are a potent modeling tool. This paper introduces a CPN model for examining and assessing the performance of an energy-aware Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol in WSNs known as the Sensor-MAC (S-MAC) protocol, which focuses on efficient node scheduling.

Formal modeling and analysis methods serve as a complement to simulation, enabling performance evaluation and model checking. These techniques are standard in conventional networks; however, WSNs with sophisticated protocols pose a unique set of challenges for formal modeling. CPNs offer a promising solution, with a graphic representation supported by a sound mathematical foundation, allowing for simulations and various kinds of analytic methods to achieve unambiguous specifications of system behaviors.

The paper is organized into sections covering background information, related work, the proposed modeling approach, and results. Conclusions are presented in the final section. CPNs enhanced with time dimensions allow for describing system dynamics over time using a global clock and time-stamped tokens, which specify the earliest point in model time that a token can be utilized.

Building expansive CPN models can be cumbersome, akin to modular programming; however, this complexity can be managed by dividing the construction into smaller, more manageable pieces through substitution transitions, thereby creating multi-layered, detailed models.

The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model's MAC layer plays a crucial role in network communication by regulating node access to the physical medium and minimizing transmission collisions through the Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) mechanism.

Existing literature documents the successful use of formal techniques, such as Petri Nets, for modeling and analyzing traditional network protocols. These models aid in performance evaluation, such as assessing the IEEE 802.3 protocol and the MAC layer in computer networks.

Our CPN model for S-MAC leverages CPNs' hierarchical structure to create a global model composed of interconnected, smaller models, representing detailed operations of the MAC layer and node scheduling. Although the model assumes no node movement or propagation delay, it can adapt to mobile networks by accounting for dynamic neighboring detection via physical location and radio range.

We have modeled the S-MAC protocol for WSNs to reduce energy consumption, using CPNs to simulate a wireless environment, and assessed performance metrics with the CPN-Tools software. The results from this case study can inform the design of real wireless networks, demonstrating CPNs' versatility for modeling and evaluating both WSNs and ad-hoc networks. Hierarchical CPN models enhance the process by providing flexibility and scalability when creating models for WSNs.
