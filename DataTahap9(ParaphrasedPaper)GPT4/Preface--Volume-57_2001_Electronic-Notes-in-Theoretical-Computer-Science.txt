This forum was established due to the growing interest over recent years in reduction strategies in both rewriting and programming. With the advent of new reduction approaches and the discovery of fresh insights pertaining to specific strategies in computation, the subject has seen considerable advancements. The research scope encompasses theoretical aspects of reduction strategies as well as their practical implications in application and implementation. The significance of fully comprehending these strategies is clear, as they serve as a conduit between the less constrained domain of general rewriting (or computation) and the more controlled environment of strategy-informed rewriting (or programming). Furthermore, reduction strategies play a pivotal role in transitioning from operational concepts, such as graph and term rewriting, narrowing, and lambda-calculus, as well as semantics involving normalization and computation of values, to the practical realisation of programming language implementations.
