The paper focuses on the exploration of the Pure Pattern Calculus (PPC) and its introduction of two remarkable features within the realm of pattern calculi, namely path polymorphism and pattern polymorphism. Path polymorphism permits the definition of functions capable of traversing any data structures in a uniform manner, and pattern polymorphism allows patterns to be utilized as dynamic, run-time parameters.

Creating this calculus presents a variety of complex challenges to ensure a well-behaved operational semantics in an untyped setting. To address these difficulties, a static type system has been developed for the Calculus of Applicative Patterns (CAP), a subset of PPC, which covers the path polymorphic aspects. In addition, type-checking procedures for this system have been researched as preliminary steps toward establishing a typed functional programming language embedding these features. Furthermore, work concerning the definition of normalizing strategies for PPC has carried over to CAP via a straightforward embedding, where the static type system further ensures the term semantics are well-managed.

The paper also examines translations between PPC and a variant of PPC that uses De Bruijn indices (PPCDB), which are designed to preserve the operational semantics of both calculi through the matching operation. Notably, these translations are inverses of each other, facilitating a strong bisimulation between the two systemsâ€”a significant result that allows the importation of well-established properties from PPC to PPCDB, such as confluence and the existence of normalizing strategies.

The PPCDB, a novel development presented in the paper, extends De Bruijn's concepts to accommodate a binder capturing more than one symbol, distinguishing between variables and matchables. This is done by using bidimensional indices that identify both the binder and the specific symbol it captures.

A translation process from PPC to PPCDB is covered, which interprets terms in the context of nested lists that represent both variables and matchables. The nested structure reflects the distance to the binder and the unique identity of the bound symbol within the multitude of symbols bound by the same binder.

Lastly, the paper discusses the simulation and strong bisimulation between PPC and PPCDB, underscoring the importance of maintaining the matching operation. This simulation proves that all redexes in PPC correspond to redexes in PPCDB. As a result, many crucial properties of PPC can be inherited by PPCDB due to the strong bisimulation.

The paper mentions work by Van Oostrom and Van Raamsdonk, which frames the dynamic pattern calculus as a higher-order pattern rewriting system, discussed at an international workshop within the Vienna Summer of Logic.
