The paper discusses the challenges in the microfinance sector, including a lack of trust due to insufficient documentation and unreliable representatives, which leads to inefficiency and untraceable transactions. To address these issues, blockchain technology is proposed. Blockchain has been successfully applied in various fields beyond cryptocurrency, such as finance, identity verification, supply chains, and certification, due to its ability to handle trust and security issues that conventional databases cannot.

The paper is structured into six chapters. Chapter 2 delves into blockchain, smart contracts, Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, and identity management on blockchain. Chapter 3 presents the proposed design, while Chapter 4 details its implementation. Experiments and results are shared in Chapter 5, and a conclusion is drawn in Chapter 6.

The proposed microfinance framework, called MicroChain, eliminates intermediaries like banks from the loan management process, reducing processing time and preventing defaults. MicroChain enables higher interest earnings for lenders and lower interest rates for borrowers compared to traditional banks.

The concept of blockchain can be traced back to David Chaum in 1982 and was later developed by mathematicians Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in 1991, who aimed to create tamper-proof timestamps for documents. Their work incorporated Merkle trees in 1992, paving the way for the first decentralized blockchain described by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

Smart contracts are automated scripts that run on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology. They facilitate various financial and digital transactions but are not legally binding without additional legal agreements linking them to the terms set by involved parties.

The main goal of the MicroChain lending model is to create a secure peer-to-peer network between lenders and borrowers, safeguarding transaction data using blockchain's secure storage capabilities.

The paper also addresses the risk of data misuse in current KYC verification processes, which involves multiple parties holding sensitive documents. The proposed model introduces an additional verification level to ensure the integrity of the verification process and prevent identity fraud.

Blockchain and smart contracts are increasingly recognized as revolutionary tools, especially in the financial sector, offering cost-effective, quick, transparent, and secure transaction solutions, which motivate the development of blockchain-based payment systems.
