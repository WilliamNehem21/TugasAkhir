This academic paper introduces an adaptive non-linear control system for managing non-linear electromagnetic actuators commonly used in industrial systems for precise positioning and tracking tasks. The proposed control methodology is grounded on Lyapunov theory, from which a continuous control law is initially derived for the actuator. Subsequently, the paper suggests a discretized approximation of this control law. The central feature of the control scheme is its adaptability, driven by the actuatorâ€™s changing inductance, a critical factor that helps to avert saturation during operation.
