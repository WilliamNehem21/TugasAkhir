The transition rules in MSDF closely resemble the conventional mathematical notation for such rules, but some clarification might be needed regarding the notation for label patterns. In MSDF, labels can use ellipses (...) or a dash (-) to signify all indices in a label that are not precisely specified. Ellipses indicate that the associated part of the label can be altered during a transition, while dashes imply the opposite. If these symbols appear multiple times within the same rule, they reference the same subset of indices. Additionally, metavariables like x1 and x2 are utilized to reference subsets of label indices, helping to differentiate between various index sets within a rule.

The derivation strategies in MSDF are not specific to any computation model, such as CCS, and can be generated automatically by examining the semantic rules. They reflect the MSOS derivation process. However, they require the concretization of the preliminary strategy 'prem-strat'. Furthermore, these strategies are only applicable when a certain rule (like r2) fails to apply. This establishes a hierarchy for rule application, where a rule can only be used if its premises hold true and no higher-priority rule is applicable.

The current prototype version does not support including multiple strategy modules, even though the notation and semantics exist for them. Therefore, all strategies must be defined within a single module. Future updates will aim to introduce full support for the strategy language, improve the automatic translation of negative premises into strategies, and implement the semantics of E-LOTOS, where negative premises help ensure that urgent actions precede the passage of time.
