Genome rearrangements are alterations to genome segments. The set of possible rearrangements used to measure evolutionary distance is defined by a rearrangement model, 'M.' Reversals, which invert the order of genomic elements, and transpositions, the swapping of two adjacent genome segments, are two common types of genome rearrangements.

Genomes can be represented as a string of integers, with each number representing a fragment found in the compared genomes, and no repeats allowed. A signed permutation indicates the direction of genes when known (each element has a '+/-' sign), or an unsigned permutation is used when direction isn't known.

Sorting unsigned permutations with reversals is a complex, NP-hard problem. The closest solution to this has an algorithm with a 1.375 approximation factor by Berman et al. Sorting signed permutations with reversals is manageable in polynomial time, as Hannenhalli and Pevzner demonstrated. Sorting unsigned permutations with transpositions is also NP-hard, with the best method being an algorithm with a 1.375 approximation factor by Elias and Hartman.

When both reversals and transpositions are considered in the rearrangement model, sorting both signed and unsigned permutations becomes more complicated, and the complexity of these problems is currently unknown. For unsigned permutations, the best-known method is an algorithm that doubles the approximation factor for cycle decomposition of breakpoint graphs. For signed permutations, Walter et al. have provided a two-approximation algorithm.

It's noted that the distance is bounded by O(n^2), as a permutation of n elements can have at most n(n-1)/2 inversions. When considering a short rearrangement, the number of inversions that change can be determined quickly, in constant time, since no more than three elements are affected. Given that there are O(n) potential short rearrangements, the algorithms can take O(n) time to identify the optimal rearrangement for each step. Consequently, all three algorithms run in O(n^3) time complexity.
