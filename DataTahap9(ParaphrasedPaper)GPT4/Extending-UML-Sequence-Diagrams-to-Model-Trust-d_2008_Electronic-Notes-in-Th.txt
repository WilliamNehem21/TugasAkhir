When analyzing systems where trust plays a key role, it's essential to incorporate how actors determine their actions based on trust. These decisions can be influenced by various rules or measures, which require an in-depth understanding of the system to evaluate their efficacy. For instance, if honest sellers typically ship goods before receiving payment, a rule enforcing this might be effective; alternatively, if a buyer can accurately predict seller behavior after a conversation, a different rule could be beneficial.

Involving stakeholders with diverse expertise and training—like end-users, decision-makers, and engineers—is vital for an accurate system analysis. The language used should foster a shared and clear comprehension of the system under an analyst’s supervision. This implies that the models conveyed must be intuitive and accessible.

Additionally, depicting system interactions such as message exchanges should reflect the chronological occurrence, ensuring messages are sent before receipt.

For example, Billy’s decisions, such as canceling a deal, carry probabilities that demonstrate trust's impact on behavior. Yet, traditional representations lack an explicit portrayal of decision-making based on trust. To remedy this, it's important to articulate what trust entails.

Defined as the trustor's belief about the behavior of the trustee, trust is inherently subjective. An actor, whether an individual, an organization, or an automated entity, has intentions and capabilities and acts accordingly. Trust usually hinges on certain conditions, termed the antecedent scenario for the transaction.

In the given scenario, Billy (trustor) anticipates the seller (trustee) will dispatch goods post-advance payment. The degree of Billy's trust, quantified as a 0.9 probability, influences his decision-making. The asset at stake is both the item's value and the purchasing power at Billy's disposal, with trust affecting whether the asset's value increases or decreases based on transaction outcomes.

Understanding the purchaser agent’s degree of trust in the seller and how trust steers the decision to provide advance payment is crucial for system analysis.
