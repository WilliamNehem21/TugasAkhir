In the referenced academic paper, the authors explain that traditional transition-system specifications (TSSs) commonly express premises as sets including both positive and negative atomic propositions. Though these sets are typically represented by a conjunction of statements (and sometimes universally quantifying negated atoms), there are cases where infinitary conjunction operators would be necessary. However, the authors admit that there is currently no feasible way to implement such operators.

The selection of Isabelle/HOL as the proof assistant was due to its alignment with the authors' reasoning methodology outlined in section 3 of their paper. The support for meta-variables, which are pivotal in their reasoning process, is particularly noted. In Isabelle/HOL, proofs are structured around a single formula.

To demonstrate their approach, the authors present an example where they automatically prove the soundness of a system. They use various symbols such as "=>" for meta implication (the line separating premises from conclusions in SOS rules), as well as "->" and "&&" for logical implication and conjunction. Variables that are not bound within the proof are treated as universally quantified.

When running their examples in Isabelle/HOL, three possible outcomes occur: If the proof of soundness is successful, no errors are reported. If issues are encountered, errors will signal an incomplete proof, or the system may run indefinitely without a resolution.

The authors note that the tested cases typically conclude in under a minute. This timeframe is due to a method of combining all axioms into one relation, which creates numerous branches within the proof that are exhaustively examined but do not necessarily contribute to demonstrating soundness. They observe that using multiple smaller relations significantly increases performance, reducing proof time to a few seconds.

Finally, the authors express interest in exploring whether their method could address other problems beyond soundness, such as proving properties like commutativity, transitivity, and congruence. They also speculate that their approach may be valuable in areas outside process theory.
