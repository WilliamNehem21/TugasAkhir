This academic paper discusses multilinear expressions, which are mathematical expressions where each variable appears only once (linearly) and each term is a product of distinct variables. The authors prove that multilinear expressions are either constant or they do not have any local minima or maxima. As a result, the range of these expressions can be determined by evaluating them at the limits of their variables' domains.

The paper offers a method to perform interval analysis on general expressions by first converting them into their multilinear form and then evaluating their intervals.

The paper's organization is as follows:

1. Section 2 lays the mathematical foundation and defines multilinear expressions, as well as presents the main results.
2. Section 3 describes the algorithm used for interval analysis of multilinear expressions and examines its computational complexity.
3. Section 4 extends the proposed method to non-multilinear (general) expressions.
4. Section 5 presents the authors' conclusions.

The work also provides background on polynomial functions, which are mathematical expressions involving sums of powers of variables. For instance, in one variable \( f(x) = 5x^3 + 2x + 7 \), and in two variables \( f(x, y) = xy^2 + 2xy + y + 1 \).

To transform a given expression \( e \) into one linear in \( x \), the paper suggests a particular algorithm procedure, indicating that in the worst case, \( d/2 \) iterations are required, which would introduce \( d/2 \) new variables. This is generalized for each nonlinear variable, resulting in \( n(d/2) \) iterations in total for the worst-case scenario.
