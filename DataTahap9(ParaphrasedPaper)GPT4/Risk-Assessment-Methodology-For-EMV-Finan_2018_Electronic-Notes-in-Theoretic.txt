This paper discusses the introduction of the EMV system—named after its creators, Europay, MasterCard, and Visa—into the banking sector to aid in managing local and international money transfers between accounts. The system's primary goal was to mitigate fraud risks. Despite its adoption, vulnerabilities have been identified, and it has faced certain attacks. The paper's objective is to propose a risk assessment method specifically tailored for EMV transaction systems.

The novel approach is intended to support decision-making by thoroughly analyzing, modeling, and evaluating potential risks associated with EMV payment transactions. It is a component of a larger research initiative aimed at establishing a risk management framework for financial transaction systems, with a focus on EMV systems as the initial case study.

The paper outlines a process of assessing and managing risk, which includes identifying risks, modeling the risk scenario, and evaluating the risks present. It then provides comprehensive background information on EMV systems, including their operational mechanisms, authentication methods, such as "Chip and PIN" or "Chip and Signature," and a review of the existing literature on risk assessment in financial transaction systems.

Additionally, the paper describes a structured approach for systematically reviewing past papers that deal with risk assessment or modeling of financial transaction systems, incorporating criteria for article selection.

The researchers detail their methodology for assessing risks among various financial transaction systems by first analyzing the business processes involved. They highlight the use of BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) as a powerful tool for visualizing these processes, and discuss the intention to use continuous time Markov chains (CTMC) for modeling EMV processes in the PEPAdigital tool.

Ultimately, the paper discusses the importance of stakeholder-specific risk evaluations that consider both the likelihood of adverse events happening and their potential costs. The end goal is to correlate the risk findings with the consequences for each stakeholder, such as identifying which system flaws could lead to financial losses and who should bear the associated costs. This further emphasizes that this component remains a subject for ongoing investigations.
