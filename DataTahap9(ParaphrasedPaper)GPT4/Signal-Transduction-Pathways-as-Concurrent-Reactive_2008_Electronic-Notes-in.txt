Signal transduction pathways are complex molecular circuits that process external signals at the cellular membrane, transmitting them internally through intricate biochemical interactions to ultimately alter genetic activity within the cell nucleus. This flow of cellular information is essential for understanding cell behavior. Simulating these pathways can clarify their complexity, verify scientific hypotheses, and validate experimental data.

In this context, pathway databases that consolidate biological pathway knowledge are valuable resources. We have built a flexible system to create various models from these databases using different modeling languages, enabling simulation with appropriate tools. Unlike other methods that typically involve manual model construction or database-derived models of only one type, our approach facilitates diverse model representations for a given pathway. Currently, we leverage a major pathway database, which we will describe in more detail.

The paper is structured to first introduce signal transduction pathways, with a focus on a specific example. We then describe our method for modeling and simulating these pathways, highlighting Live Sequence Charts (LSCs) and the Play-Engine tool. The fourth section details our techniques and the tools we developed, followed by a section presenting initial simulation results. We conclude by summarizing our findings and outlining future work.

The inner workings of signal transduction involve multiple molecules, such as proteins, enzymes, cofactors, second messengers, and small effectors, which transmit signals by changes in molecule conformations and complexes formed through biochemical reactions, ultimately amplifying the signal to reach the nucleus.

One real-world application of understanding these pathways is the analysis of sepsis, an overwhelming immune response to infection. Innate immunity recognizing bacterial/viral elements is vital here. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR4 in humans and mice, are critical in recognizing bacterial endotoxins like LPS, which can trigger sepsis.

The TLR4 pathway splits into MyD88-dependent and independent branches, outlined in the text. LSCs in this pathway distinguish between behaviors that can happen (universal charts) and those that must happen (existential charts), with conditions set in precharts and prohibitions on certain actions.

We also discuss representing signal pathways with Colored Petri Nets (CPNs), which, unlike standard Petri nets, include distinguishable tokens with values (colors) tied to data types (color sets).

Our modeling setup comprises a pathway database with pathway maps (in GIF format) on one side and the Play-Engine tool with a GUI, capturing system behavior in LSCs and storing them in XML files on the other. These elements are linked by the LSC Transformation module and the Pathway-Editor.

The Pathway-Editor aids users in constructing pathway maps as Play-Engine GUIs and exporting these maps in GIF format. While the algorithm cannot automatically depict certain cellular components due to database limitations, we provide graphics for users to manually complete these maps, allowing for further customization.

In summary, our system advances the field of pathway simulation by enabling different model representations from pathway databases, thus fostering a deeper understanding of cellular signal transduction mechanisms.
