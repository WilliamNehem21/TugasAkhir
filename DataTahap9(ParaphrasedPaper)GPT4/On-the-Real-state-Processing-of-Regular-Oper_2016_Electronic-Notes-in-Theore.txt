In this study, the authors delve into aspects of state complexity related to the Sakoda-Sipser problem, examining the challenges of simulating nondeterministic finite state automata (1NFAs) with efficient deterministic counterparts. They consider traditional deterministic finite state automata (1DFAs) and two-way deterministic finite state automata (2DFAs) and investigate a newly proposed concept: real-state processing.

Real-state processing reflects whether an automaton can efficiently process regular languages and expressions in terms of state complexity. The authors present a survey of existing knowledge, along with new, simpler proofs for some well-established results. They explore whether any model of deterministic finite automata supports real-state processing of regular expressions.

Their investigation reveals no deterministic finite automata model that supports real-state processing for regular expressions in general. However, they propose a new automaton, a deterministic pebble automaton variant, which is shown to handle star-free regular expressions with real-state processing, signifying an efficient processing capability for certain operations like union and concatenation.

The paper introduces a novel deterministic model called multiplebble automata that can handle star-free regular expressions with real-state processing. Still, it is suggested that it is unlikely to find deterministic models capable of real-state processing for full regular expressions, including those utilizing operations like the Kleene star.

While the analysis indicates that 2DFAs are unable to perform real-state processing for regular expressions, the authors conjecture that there may not be a feasible deterministic finite automata model capable of real-state processing for all regular operations. Despite this, they present the model of deterministic pebble two-way deterministic finite state automata (dp2dfas) as achieving the best-known result in real-state processing for star-free regular expressions.

The authors call for further investigation into real-state processing, underscoring its importance for understanding computational advantages of nondeterminism in finite automata, and position their work in the context of broader state complexity research related to finite automata models. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse around the Sakoda-Sipser problem by offering a refined perspective on automata efficiency and processing power.
