The Hindu Kush-Pamir Region (HKPR) undergoes complex deformation, with a distinctive slab geometry and moderate levels of seismic activity. Recent advances in the quantity of seismological data have enabled the use of deep-learning techniques to gain new insights into the region's tectonics. This paper introduces a fully automated deep learning method that improves earthquake cataloging in the HKPR, capable of event detection, phase picking, and source estimation. The approach employs a deep learning model with an attention mechanism that distinguishes earthquake signals in time series data and refines the identification of P and S wave arrival times within seismic waveforms.

Seismic data from the last two decades have increased, yet smaller, low signal-to-noise earthquakes often go undetected. Finding these events would enhance our understanding of local tectonics and the HKPR's unique structure. The process of detection aims to reduce false positives and false negatives, while phase picking focuses on the precise timing of seismic wave arrivals. To detect earthquake signals, the algorithm analyzes time series data, after which a local attention model pinpoints the precise P and S phase arrivals within the waveform.

The study used the Stanford Earthquake Dataset (STEAD), a global collection of seismograms linked to numerous earthquakes, as training data. This dataset includes a vast range of detailed information about earthquake events, such as origin time, phase arrival times, magnitude, location, depth, and the signal-to-noise ratio. The dataset, detailed and diversified, mostly records smaller earthquakes with magnitudes under 2.5. This study only considered events with a minimum of five P and S phase picks for location determination, prioritizing the precision of seismic analysis.

Analysis of newly identified earthquake events has revealed the presence of northwestern trending strike-slip faults in the western Pamir and the Vakhsh thrust system, which pose potential seismic hazards. These faults and the seismic activity that surrounds them are indicative of the tectonic forces at play, including north-south shortening and east-west extension, resulting from the interaction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.

Earthquakes deeper than 150 km in the central and eastern Hindu Kush may be due to the stretching of the subducting Indian lithospheric slab, leading to thinning and higher strain rates. A hypothesized slab breakoff coincides with a reduction of crustal earthquakes, suggesting a transition from upper plate coupling to decoupling in these depths.

The seismic hazards in the HKPR, with its focused seismic activity and deep intermediate earthquakes, continue to be a key concern. The patterns of seismicity reveal two distinct zones with varying dip directions, demonstrating the complexity of deformation due to tectonic processes in the region. This study's enhanced earthquake catalog thus provides a more comprehensive understanding of seismic activity and active faulting in the HKPR, crucial for assessing future seismic risks.
