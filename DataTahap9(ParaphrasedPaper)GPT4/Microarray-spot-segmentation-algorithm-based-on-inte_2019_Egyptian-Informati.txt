The recent surge in microarray technology has opened a plethora of possibilities for its application in drug design, cancer detection, clinical diagnosis, treatment, and environmental health studies. Despite these advancements, accurately segmenting spots in microarray images remains a challenge due to variability in spot quality, shape, and size. To address this, we have developed a novel microarray spot segmentation approach that utilizes the Integro-Differential Operator (IDO). This technique is adept at identifying spots within a microarray image irrespective of their individual sizes and shapes, involving a step for spot detection. Utilizing IDO on cDNA microarray images has shown to enhance the precision and effectiveness of the spot segmentation workflow, leveraging the maximum illumination disparity at the pixel boundaries of the spot's edge to delineate each spot.

Our approach was also validated using data from the Stanford Microarray Database (SMD), and the empirical outcomes indicate that IDO significantly bolsters the segmentation process, yielding superior results in both spot separation and subsequent analysis.

Contrasting with methods that presuppose uniform, circular spot shapes and sizes, such as those in Scanalyze by Eisen (1999) and GenePix by Axon Instruments Inc. (1999), our IDO-based method is more adaptable. Whereas adaptive shape segmentation techniques like watershed and seed region growing address variability by progressively expanding a spot from an initial point until a certain criterion is met—a methodology applied in the SPOT software—IDO surpasses these by merging border detection and regional analysis to facilitate quicker and more reliable spot identification.

The structure of our paper includes a detailed examination of our proposed techniques in the second section, a discussion of the experimental outcomes after applying our method to images from the SMD in the third section, and a final analysis of the results in the fourth section.
