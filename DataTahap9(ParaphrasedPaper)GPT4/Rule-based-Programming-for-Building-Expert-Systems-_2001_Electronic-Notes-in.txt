In this study, we evaluated three rule-based programming tools to create an expert system for validating microbiological laboratory data and monitoring bacterial infections. Initially, the system was built using Kappa-PC, and this paper focuses on comparing its implementation and performance to two newer tools, Jess and ILOG JRules. We designed simple test applications simulating essential functions of our expert system to assess each tool.

The research contributes to a broader project aimed at monitoring nosocomial infections, which are infections acquired within hospitals. These infections are often more difficult to treat than non-nosocomial infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

A key aspect of microbiological lab analysis is the quality of antibiogram results, which clinicians rely on for determining therapeutic strategies. The expert system is designed to flag critical situations like unexpected bacterial resistance or contagion in hospital units.

Our paper details the first expert system prototype developed to spot critical scenarios and trigger alerts using a rule-based approach. The rules were derived from international standards for microbiological lab practices and expert input.

After the initial creation with Kappa-PC, we explored commercial tools for the final prototype, selecting Jess and JRules for further analysis and testing. The paper outlines the functionalities of these tools and our testing methodology, emphasizing real-time performance since our expert system works live. We discuss basic microbiological data analysis concepts, expert system specifications, development tool features, and testing and performance results. An overall comparison of the tools is presented, leading to our conclusion.

Antibiograms reflect bacteria's antibiotic resistance patterns, with results classified as resistant (R), intermediate (I), sensitive (S), or unknown (null). Identical antibiograms indicate the same bacterial strain.

The expert system should also ensure that standard guidelines for antibiotic testing are followed. It could correct inaccuracies, control tested antibiotics, predict outcomes, and adapt reporting based on numerous factors like antibiotic costs and infection site.

Expert systems use AI to simulate human expertise by turning knowledge into data structures and rules. An inference engine then applies these rules to perform tasks.

The paper also describes the inference engines and rule syntax for Kappa-PC, Jess, and JRules, highlighting their distinct approaches and features. 

The testing applications for each tool followed similar procedures to the expert system, handling the data and tasks relevant to microbiological lab work. Performance during these tests was a critical factor for selecting the final tool since the system needs to operate in real time.
