This paper describes the process of converting mobile ambients, which are a formalism for representing mobile computation without communication and replication features, into P systems with mobile membranes. P systems are a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological cells, where each compartment or membrane has a specific role, and together they work towards a collective goal.

The authors aim to show how the behaviors of mobile ambients can be replicated within P systems, drawing an operational parallel between the two. They do this by defining a set of developmental rules within the P systems that correspond to the behaviors of the ambients. Additionally, the paper discusses how the movements of mobile ambients, such as entering or exiting a location, are mirrored in P systems through the mechanisms of endocytosis and exocytosis.

The paper is structured as follows:

1. An introduction to pure mobile ambients.
2. Presentation of P systems with mobile membranes and their local evolution rules.
3. The core part of the paper, where the translation from mobile ambients to P systems is detailed, showing how specific rules can simulate the behavior of ambients within the membrane system.
4. A discussion of how the tree-like spatial structure of mobile ambients is mirrored in the membrane system, with ambients and capabilities being represented as nodes in the system.
5. A final discussion on how to simulate ambients' deadlocks in the P systems using a special object called "dlock" that prevents the execution of certain rules.

The paper concludes with the assertion that they achieve an operational correspondence between mobile ambients and P systems, with further details and references for interested readers to explore the topics in depth.
