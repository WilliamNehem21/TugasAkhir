Intel has declared that upcoming computer chips will feature multiple processors that will work in parallel, using the same memory simultaneously through a finely interleaved pattern of memory access. These processors won’t be much faster individually than today’s processors. Therefore, future gains in computer performance will largely depend on programmers' ability to efficiently exploit the multi-core structure by writing concurrent programs. However, concurrent programming introduces additional complexity and potential issues like race conditions, non-determinism, deadlocks, and livelocks.

To mitigate these risks, we put forward a comprehensive theory for verifying the correctness of fine-grained concurrent programs, borrowing tenets from various established concepts like flowcharts, assertions, Petri nets, process algebra, separation logic, critical regions and rely/guarantee reasoning. We propose a structured calculus that incorporates elements of a concurrent programming language to ensure program correctness.

A Petri net can be structured modularly by encapsulating subnets within a box and annotating it with ports. These ports carry assertions that spell out the box's expectations and assurances with its neighbors. This simplifies the reasoning process by allowing us to view the entire boxed subnet as a singular action, despite ignoring its detailed dynamics.

The dynamic behavior of a boxed subnet is often intended to reflect its contained subnets' behavior. By hiding internal ports and replicating their port names on the enclosing box, we can apply the same regular expression to describe both levels of behavior. This technique is integrated into a calculus for structured composition of Petri nets. Defined by the way the net's components are connected, this calculus provides a framework for demonstrating how an enclosing box replicates the behavior of its operands.

In Petri nets, concurrency is facilitated through transitions—primitives that enable tokens to pass through, providing these tokens represent simultaneous claims to the system’s resources. Tokens are only transmitted through a transition when each entry port presents a token, allowing the synchronized exit of new tokens. These transitions can regulate the distribution and synchronization of concurrent threads, and each token can carry both full and partial ownership rights over specific resources or system states.

The idea is to maintain a clear delineation of resource ownership at all times, preventing conflicts by ensuring tokens always carry disjoint permissions. In multi-core systems, the precision with which resources are generated or split ensures these disjoint ownerships.

To further aid in the reasoning process regarding ownership and concurrency, separation logic is employed. It emphasizes ownership through assertions that intrinsically or explicitly stake claim to variables. In particular, separated conjunction allows us to assert that predicates are true while their implied ownership remains disjoint, crucial for the correctness of Petri net transitions.

To prevent false postconditions in our calculus, any constructs that could result in such outcomes are pre-emptively assigned false preconditions, avoiding race conditions as concurrency is enforced. When two threads make conflicting updates to a shared variable, it could potentially lead to inconsistency at the synchronizing fan-in, but this is preemptively stopped by the logic's axiom of assignment.

To enable thread communication while maintaining the concurrency model, shared memory serves as the medium. Tokens that represent ownership of shared resources move through the Petri net, and threads can temporarily acquire and release these tokens to access and update shared states, all orchestrated by critical regions that regulate access granularity.

Lastly, dealing with non-deterministic outcomes of shared resource usage involves abstracting the process through "rely" and "guarantee" conditions, which provide boundaries and expectations for shared resource state changes between critical regions of thread execution. Proper concurrent operation is achieved when each thread's guarantee condition upholds the rely condition for every other thread, and this applies to scenarios involving multiple resources as well.

In conclusion, Intel’s recognition of the permanence of processor speed has shifted focus to effectively managing concurrent programming challenges through a theoretical structure designed to ensure correctness by blending established concepts and providing logical tools to address the complex dynamics and ownership issues inherent to fine-grained concurrency.
