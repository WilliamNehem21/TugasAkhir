The paper discusses a method for proving the termination of certain types of inference systems, which have the potential to solve satisfiability problems within theories that define recursive data structures, despite these theories being typically described by an infinite set of axioms. The authors propose a problem reduction technique that enables the verification of this termination across said theories. Furthermore, the paper illustrates how a theorem-proving strategy that adheres to these systems can handle satisfiability problems not only within individual theories but also in combinations of various theories, simplifying the combination of satisfiability procedures.

Most existing verification tools are built upon complex and theory-specific satisfiability procedures that often require substantial effort to develop and prove sound. A novel method was previously proposed that demonstrated how a complete theorem-proving strategy could solve satisfiability problems for different data structure theories by proving its termination with a given theory and a set of ground literals. The superposition calculus (SP), a standard inference system, was successfully applied to theories such as arrays and lists.

The concept of variable-inactive theories was introduced to help ensure SP-based strategies could terminate and operate effectively on multiple theories when it already terminates on each one individually. This approach simplifies merging different theories by treating their combined presentations.

The paper introduces an algorithm that utilizes a multi-sorted logical framework to make decisions for various potentially interdependent recursive data structures, each possibly comprising multiple constructors. This algorithm elegantly combines established inference rules with specialized ones for tasks like type completion or cycle detection, offering an effective way to handle complexity.

A key observation presented in the paper (Proposition 4.7) describes a scenario involving a model, a set of selectors, and a path within the model, detailing a property that emerges when the path exceeds a certain length.

Finally, the paper acknowledges the existing procedures as being exponential in complexity and expresses the intent to explore complexity reductions. The authors plan to investigate approaches that might allow a polynomial algorithm when uninterpreted function symbols are present, even in more complex scenarios beyond what was previously established for simpler cases like integer offsets.
