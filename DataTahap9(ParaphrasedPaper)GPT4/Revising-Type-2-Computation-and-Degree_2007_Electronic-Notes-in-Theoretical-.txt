A key but less obvious aspect of defining a Type-2 machine is the requirement that its output tape operates in a one-way fashion, as referenced in [21, at the start of page 15]. This characteristic permits the termination of a computation involving a real number once the required level of accuracy is achieved, with the assurance that the tentative result obtained will remain unchanged. Furthermore, this one-way output tape feature is essential for the validity of the central theorem presented.
