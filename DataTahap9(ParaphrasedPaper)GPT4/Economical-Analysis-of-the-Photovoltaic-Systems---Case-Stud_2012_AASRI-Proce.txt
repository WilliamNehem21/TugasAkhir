The purpose of this study is to evaluate the economic performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems within the current regulatory framework of Slovakia. The analysis focuses on a government building in Eastern Slovakia and aims to identify the most beneficial usage pattern for a 100kWp PV system installed onsite. The study compares two types of grid-connected PV systems: one that compensates for surplus energy production and one that fully integrates excess electricity into the distribution network. This comparison is centered around the financial impact on the client, determining which option provides the greatest benefit.

The research considers state support mechanisms such as feed-in tariffs, which are reflected in the economic indicators developed for the analysisâ€”these include costs, revenues, payback periods, cash flow, and discounted cash flow. Essential to the analysis are both constant and variable factors. Constant factors include characteristics of the public sector building, its energy consumption patterns, PV system size and efficiency, system cost, project and engineering expenses, depreciation period, and insurance. Variable factors consist of the type of grid connection and varying levels of government support through different electricity repurchase prices. The study aims to address these economic indexes to ascertain the most economically viable option for the client regarding the deployment of PV systems in Slovakia's current legislative context.
