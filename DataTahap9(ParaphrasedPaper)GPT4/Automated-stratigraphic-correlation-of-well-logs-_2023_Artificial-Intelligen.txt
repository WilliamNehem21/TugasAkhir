Developing a stratigraphic framework is a key technology in geologic interpretation, crucial for estimating reservoirs and constructing geologic models (Cross and Lessenger, 1988). Stratigraphic correlation is a common method to glean insights about stratigraphic relationships and compartmentalization within reservoirs. Traditional seismic interpretation for stratigraphic correlation typically requires manual input from geologists, which can be time-intensive and dependent on the interpreters' expertise. To overcome these limitations, automated stratigraphic correlation techniques have been developed using computational algorithms and statistical methods to analyze stratigraphic information from various locations, thereby determining the relative ages of rock formations or sedimentary deposits. 

Over the years, numerous automated strategies have emerged, including cross-correlation methods (Southam and Hay, 1978; Mann and Dowell, 1978), dynamic waveform matching techniques, and dynamic time warping (Wheeler and Hale, 2014; Behdad, 2019), and their enhancements. These methods decrease the dependency on experienced interpreters.

A proposed deep learning model, the Attention-based Dense Network (ASDNet), shows promise for improving automated stratigraphic correlation of well logs. A transition layer addresses the challenge of dealing with a significant number of feature maps by reducing the channels between dense blocks. The ASDNet's second half functions as a decoder, using several convolutional blocks and up-sampling layers, along with an outconv and reshape operation, to correlate the size of feature maps to the original well log length and to achieve accurate stratigraphic correlations.

In this study, training focused on 88 wells using well logs like borehole diameter (CAL), spontaneous potential (SP), gamma ray (GR), acoustic (AC), and formation resistivity (RT). Due to confidentiality constraints, additional well log types were not included, preventing a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of well log types. Yet, performing such an analysis is important for deep learning-assisted stratigraphic correlation.

One limitation of the ASDNet model is that it requires a large volume of labeled data, which must be interpreted by experienced geologists or derived using traditional methodsâ€”a process that can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. The accuracy of these training labels is crucial to the model's success. Future work aims to include advanced techniques for estimating confidence intervals for automated stratigraphic correlations and possibly use unsupervised models, like those based on Gaussian mixture models, to address automated well log correlation challenges.

Finally, while the stratigraphic correlation of well logs is treated as a segmentation task in this study, with the proposed ASDNet model being tailored to enhance performance, the same approach could potentially be applied to other geologic segmentation tasks, such as horizon picking and fault interpretation.
