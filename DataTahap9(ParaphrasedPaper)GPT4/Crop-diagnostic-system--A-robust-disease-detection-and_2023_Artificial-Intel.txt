The paper introduces a systematic framework for disease detection in aquaponics systems, leveraging image processing and decision tree techniques, and a CNN-based method for hydroponic plants. Several attempts for plant disease detection are discussed, with most research focusing on open-air farming. This work distinguishes itself by targeting multiple leafy green crops in aquaponic settings (lettuce, basil, parsley, spinach). Data is sourced from various channels and annotated using LabelImg, informing the training of object detection models including two-stage and one-stage detector architectures.

Based on previous studies, where Faster R-CNN bested other models for apple disease detection, this research compares Faster R-CNN to YOLOv5, with YOLOv5 demonstrating superior speed and accuracy. Models are developed using PyTorch with transfer learning from ResNet-50 and trained on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.

Once disease is detected, related information is extracted from an ontology model for use by practitioners. Deep learning models face challenges as they must evaluate class, bounding box locations, and confidence scores. Performance testing on a trained system shows YOLOv5s to be advantageous in accuracy and run speed, encouraged by its results in detecting objects of varying sizes efficiently.

The study emphasizes consistent treatment strategies for certain diseases, such as downy mildew, across different crops, acknowledging that symptoms may vary, necessitating individual crop classification to avoid treatment errors.

Looking forward, the system will be expanded to other crops, with a broader dataset incorporating more real images, and the development of a mobile app to improve response time and data privacy compared to cloud systems, contributing to reduced waste and economic and environmental benefits.
