These findings offer a fresh viewpoint on the theory of higher groupoids. While topologists have been familiar with concrete versions of higher groupoids for decades, there is an inquiry into whether a similar theoretical framework exists for non-reversible or directed paths. A corresponding type theory for directed paths could enhance our understanding of the more complex theories of higher categories and directed spaces, which both fundamentally involve directed paths. Given the variety of competing models for both theories, a unified approach to directed paths could provide significant insights into their structures.
