The concept of employing modal logic to characterize graph properties is a compelling approach for several reasons. Modal logic strikes a fine balance between its expressive capabilities and the computational complexity of drawing inferences within its framework. It surpasses propositional logic in expression yet remains decidable, in contrast to first-order logic. Moreover, modal logic's evaluation structures closely resemble graphs, making it particularly suited for our purposes.

Definitions for a bounded morphism and the disjoint union of frames can be created in a manner similar to previous descriptions, only omitting elements concerning valuations. The paper references two foundational theorems on modal definability, which are applied in subsequent sections, and are initially proven for a simpler language, though their proofs can be extended.

We define two tiers of graph connectivity. At the first tier, a graph G is weakly connected if for any two vertices v and w within G, a path exists connecting them in the underlying undirected graph. At the second tier, a graph G is strongly connected if for any two vertices v and w, there is a directional path from v to w within G.

To characterize Hamiltonian graphs with a formula, we must consider some graph-theoretical challenges. No current graph theory provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph being Hamiltonian. Should we discover such a formula for Hamiltonian graphs without identifying the actual cycle, we would have determined this condition. Instead, our formula must exhaustively check all paths in the graph for a Hamiltonian cycle, leading to a formula length that grows factorially with the number of graph vertices.

Conversely, describing Eulerian graphs is hampered by language limitations rather than theoretical barriers. Known theorems articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be Eulerian. However, the hybrid graph language lacks the strength to express edge cardinality conditions as specified by these theorems without resorting to another factorial-length formula.

Alternatively, one could try to construct a formula that directly denotes an Eulerian path within the graph. However, many modal logics, including hybrid graph logic, struggle with edge-specific discussions due to modal operators' inability to distinguish between edges emanating from a vertex. Although nominals provide vertex names, they do not help keep track of used edges when traversing a graph. Section 6 of the paper introduces a naming method for edges within a hybrid language framework, which subsequently aids in defining the Eulerian property.

The impracticality of factorial-size formulas negates the possibility of verifying Hamiltonian properties. Although we cannot anticipate polynomial-time verification since identifying Hamiltonian graphs is an NP-complete problem, our objective is to achieve verification in a time frame faster than factorial. We introduce the formula to accomplish this.

For describing the Eulerian property without using theorem 3.10, we must devise a formula that conjures an explicit Eulerian path. This task is complicated due to the difficulties discussed at the end of section 4, which stem from hybrid languages not having the facility to identify individual edges. Thus, a method to label edges within the hybrid language framework is established before utilizing it to determine the Eulerian property.
