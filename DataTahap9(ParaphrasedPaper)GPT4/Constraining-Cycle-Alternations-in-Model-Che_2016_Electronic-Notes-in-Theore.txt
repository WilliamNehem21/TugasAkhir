Model checking, a highly effective system verification technique, compares a system's specified properties with its behavioral model. Although extensively studied within classical, point-based temporal logics, its application to interval logic remains relatively unexplored. Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) has been suggested as a robust formalism for temporal reasoning and has broad applications in computer science, yet its model checking, especially for the Halpern-Shoham logic (HS) and related fragments, is under-researched compared to more common logics like LTL or CTL.

Typically, system models are expressed as labeled state-transition graphs, known as Kripke structures, with point-based temporal logics evaluating how state labels evolve along each path. In contrast, HS model checking interprets each path as an interval, considering how properties span across sequences of states.

A specific condition (Condition (iii) in Def. 2.10) prohibits isomorphic subtrees from having the same parent node in a tree representation. Additionally, for tracking interval properties, a "B0-descriptor" is introduced, which uniquely identifies the root of a track.

The paper acknowledges that the proposed algorithm is incomplete in that it doesn't evaluate all system behaviorsâ€”instead, it searches for counterexamples to the system's properties by only considering representative computations bound by a limit on cyclic subtracks. This compromise reduces the algorithm's spatial complexity exponentially, making it more manageable for implementation and practical usage.
