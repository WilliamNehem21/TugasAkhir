In the paper, the authors present a uniform proof of the IEEE FutureBus+ cache coherence protocol using a network invariant. To achieve this, they utilize the PAX tool to compute the invariant and then verify it using model checking. The invariant allows them to prove cache coherence correctness for any number of components on a single bus within the system, including a previously unproven progress property. They extended their results to tree-shaped systems with multiple data buses, marking a first in proving the protocol's correctness in such a context.

Prior efforts in verifying the FutureBus+ protocol lacked a uniform proof valid for all parameterized network instances or only managed to verify a partial cache coherence specification. The authors base their proof on methods that employ the theory of Weak Second Order Logic of One Successor (WS1S) to model parameterized networks. They also introduce synchronous parallel composition to the proofs.

The paper is organized into sections explaining notations and definitions, describing the proof method extension, briefly covering the FutureBus+ cache coherence protocol, recalling L-simulation and network invariants, and constructing the network invariant. Notably, the authors worked to minimize the WS1S transition system to manage computational complexity, focusing on keeping the transition relation formula small.

In the following sections, the authors discuss the protocol's operational details, including cache line state transitions and interventions. They also specify how transactions are split based on access times compared to bus speeds and define illegal attribute combinations that trigger bus-errors.

The network invariant construction process is detailed, which involved creating a parameterized model of the protocol and minimizing it. It concludes with a proof establishing that the single-bus system's network invariant can be abstracted to a tree-shaped network without changing its behavior. The validity of the network invariant for tree-shaped networks is then justified using a compositional method.

The authors compare their work to similar efforts and emphasize the advantages of their semi-automatic method, which significantly reduces the verification time compared to conventional model checkers. This approach increases confidence in their proof and highlights the potential for applying similar techniques to other protocols.
