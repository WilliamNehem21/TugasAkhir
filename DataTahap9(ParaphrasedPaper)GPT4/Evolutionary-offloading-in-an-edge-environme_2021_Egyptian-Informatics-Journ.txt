This paper presents a strategy to optimize task offloading in mobile edge computing environments. It proposes a method combining queuing networks with a genetic algorithm (GA) to model and minimize mobile task response times on edge servers. The queuing network models the waiting and service times for tasks, while the GA identifies the best task allocation across edge servers, taking into account transmission times and server load conditions. This GA-based methodology is tested against a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based approach and the round-robin strategy, demonstrating superior performance in improving response times for mobile applications.

The paper outlines the challenges of managing limited computing resources on edge servers, known as cloudlets, focusing on achieving low response times and energy efficiency. An inappropriate allocation of tasks can lead to increased response times due to the limited capacity of edge servers compared to traditional cloud infrastructures.

Following an introduction to related work and system modeling, the paper discusses the design and implementation of the proposed evolutionary algorithms for task offloading. Experimental results indicate the efficiency of the GA-based approach over its counterparts. Lastly, the paper concludes with a summary and suggests areas for potential future research, such as investigating multi-objective offloading strategies and exploring other evolutionary algorithms for task scheduling and offloading.
