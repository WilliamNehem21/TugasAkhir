In this academic paper, the authors introduce a new extension called RPooT for the object-oriented Petri-net modeling language RPoo. The extension incorporates timing strategies from timed colored Petri nets, allowing for the modeling of time-based activities both internally within objects and inter-object interactions. 

A primary example presented is the modeling of a simple stop-and-wait network protocol to demonstrate the capabilities of the RPooT extension. The paper details a case study and performance measures, demonstrating how RPooT can model real-time systems and support performance evaluations.

The paper is an expanded version of an article originally presented at the Brazilian Symposium on Formal Methods in 2004. It is supported by the CNPq Brazilian Research Council and CAPES.

RPoo is praised for allowing a formal concurrent semantics to object-oriented models and promoting semantic composition over mere syntactic integration for complex systems. The main goal of the extension is to enable precise time modeling in RPoo, making it possible to evaluate time-constrained functionalities.

The RPooT approach adds a global clock to models, timestamps messages, and redefines transition rules to handle time efficiently. As such, RPooT is also considered an object-oriented extension to timed colored Petri nets (TCP-Nets).

The paper is organized with introductory sections, a case study, performance analysis results, definitions of RPoo, and the timing extension, concluding with the authors' achievements and benefits of RPooT, such as support for model checking and the ability to incorporate a variety of statistical timing distributions. It highlights the independence of RPooT from the underlying Petri net models used to describe classes.
