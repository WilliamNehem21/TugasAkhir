The current universal remote control operates on a one-to-one communication model, sending commands directly to a single designated device within a network that employs a star topology. Each device is connected to a central controlling unit yet operates autonomously from the others.

The existing functionalities of this remote control can serve as a foundation for creating an Android app, which would enable smartphones to function as universal remotes. Additionally, integrating a touchscreen interface into the remote could enhance its aesthetic appeal. Considering recent technological advancements, such innovations are likely to be feasible in the near future.
