This paper explores the concept of freeform path fitting to reduce the number of transitions between the perimeter (headland) path and the internal lanes within agricultural fields, aiming to minimize soil compaction and awkward vehicle maneuvers. The study investigates fitting paths to actual field shapes, including those with obstacles, to minimize the number of interior lanes compared to traditional straight lane fitting methods.

The research falls within the production stage of the agri-food supply chain, which involves production, harvesting, storage, and distribution. In-field logistics, a critical component of this stage, face challenges due to the diversity of field shapes. The paper builds on existing literature that measures field complexity and studies the impact of field dimensions on tractor performance.

Focusing on the initial stage of in-field logistics—fitting lanes within field contours—the study shows that freeform path fitting can effectively reduce the number of internal lanes, potentially lowering soil compaction and the need for sharp turns. The research method involves eroding field contours to create headland paths, selecting a reference path segment, and generating a grid of interior lanes with appropriate spacing.

The proposed fitting of lanes is analyzed and presented in comparison to existing literature that addresses route planning and trajectory smoothing. It emphasizes the potential of optimizing freeform paths even in scenarios where it may not seem intuitive, highlighting the need for numerical optimization methods.

While freeform path fitting may demand more steering effort—which is primarily a concern when manually operated—this disadvantage is negated in the context of fully automated agricultural vehicles.

The paper concludes with suggestions for future research, such as considering the total length of interior lanes as an optimization criterion and evaluating the process over three consecutive layers: selecting a reference path, optimizing routing for lane coverage, and creating trajectories that consider vehicle constraints and aim to minimize overlap or gaps.
