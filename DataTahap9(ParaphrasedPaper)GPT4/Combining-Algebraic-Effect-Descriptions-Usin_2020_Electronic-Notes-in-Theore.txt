This paper's principal contribution is the formulation of a universal technique for merging effects detailed by algebras based on local functions applied to effect operations. By employing the tensor product on complete lattices, a process evidenced in several references, the authors have created an approach that merges distinct concepts of 'truth' across multiple effects. This tensor product upholds the property of complete distributivity within complete lattices, an essential attribute for analyzing the structure resulting from combining complete lattices.

To provide a practical example, consider a program simulating a fair coin toss, where heads yield the outcome of 3, and tails yield 6. To evaluate how frequently this program produces an even number, a predicate 'p' assigns a zero probability for 3 being even and a one probability for 6. The algebra formulated in the study synthesizes these two possibilities, given the coin's fairness, to predict an even outcome 50% of the time.

The differentiation between linearity and ilinearity arises due to disparities between the requirements of the truth space 'a' and the methodology for response computation within an algebra. Linearity is an intrinsic characteristic of morphisms housed within the 'com' category that envelops our truth spaces. However, the local functions forming our algebras are commonly ilinear but not necessarily linear, as illustrated in Subsection 3.2.

Additionally, the paper discusses an alternative scenario involving a global numeric store. In this case, the state lookup operation has an infinitely countable arity, with the state set represented as 's= nloc', functioning analogously to a Boolean store. To maintain focus, further discussion within the paper will center solely on the boolean store.

Subsection 3.2's examples make it evident that local functions are typically ilinear. To merge ilinear functions, a methodology is required, and fortunately, when all complete lattices involved exhibit complete distributivity, the provided bijection 'f' retains ilinearity. This preservation enables the same framework to fuse ilinear functions.

The methodology described is demonstrated through various scenarios, where the authors append specific effects to an arbitrary effect description to create viable interpretations of combined effects. Comprehensive examples of more specific effect combinations will be addressed in subsection 7.1.

In certain cases, extra axioms are necessary to articulate the interaction between effects intended to be joined. These axioms, containing operations from both theories, are named interaction laws, with a common example being a commutivity law referenced in the literature.
