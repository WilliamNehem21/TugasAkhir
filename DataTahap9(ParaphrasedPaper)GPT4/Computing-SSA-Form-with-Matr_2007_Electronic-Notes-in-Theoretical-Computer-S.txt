The academic paper discusses an alternate method for constructing Static Single Assignment (SSA) form, a valuable intermediate representation in compiler design and virtual machines that aids in implementing program optimizations like constant propagation, dead code elimination, and partial redundancy elimination. Traditionally, the construction of SSA form requires computing complex graph relations such as dominance and dominance frontiers. While efficient graph algorithms exist to compute these relations, they are challenging to implement. 

The authors propose a new approach using Boolean matrix calculus to compute the dominance relation and its corresponding frontiers, including non-iterated and iterated dominance frontiers. In their method, the dominance relation is represented by a binary matrix, where a value of one indicates that one node dominates another. Similarly, the dominance frontier is represented as a bitwise vector-matrix product that identifies the set of nodes forming the frontier. 

To carry out these computations, the authors suggest using a simple binary matrix calculator capable of handling transitive closures and their extensions. These operations can be performed through straightforward recurrence patterns until the output stabilizes, although more sophisticated methods exist within existing literature. 

The authors highlight the practicality of past algorithms in the exploration of the dominance relation. While some algorithms achieve linear time complexity, their high constant factors and implementation complexities make them less desirable in practice.

The proposed algorithm was implemented and tested against existing techniques using the SPEC95 integer benchmark suite on a Linux platform. The performance of their approach demonstrated cubic time complexity, in agreement with the authors' theoretical expectations, and suggests that performance could be improved significantly with a better algorithm for transitive closure computations. 

They emphasize the minimal implementation effort required for their proposed method, needing only a simple binary matrix calculator, and noted that their method required the fewest lines of code in their comparative experiments.
