Temporal logic is valuable for characterizing the dynamic behavior of reactive systems, and it's useful for asserting universal properties (which must be true in all program executions), existential properties (true in some executions), safety properties (preventing undesirable events), and liveness properties (ensuring desirable events occur). However, verifying temporal logic formulas, such as ensuring a system state fulfills a given property, is challenging. For finite-state systems, the problem is decidable using formalisms like CTL* and CTL, with CTL* verification being PSPACE-complete in complexity and CTL verification having linear time complexity.

One significant issue in model checking, particularly with concurrent processes in programs, is the state explosion problem, where the total state count representing program behavior can grow exponentially with the number of processes. This complexity and the state explosion issue significantly hinder the practical application of temporal logic for model checking, more so when using the more complex CTL*.

The paper refers to an example where abstraction (`signv`) of a system leads to Model A. A different example shows a less precise model, as it lacks representation of the `z` element, highlighting precision issues in abstract models. The discussion centers around compressing disjunctive information to create a minimal abstract model using the notion of the least disjunctive bases.

Consider a linear sorting algorithm: if `n` is the number of cells to sort, then the abstract state space becomes `2^n + 1`, whereas the concrete state space can be infinite or `2^rn` for a given range `r` of integer numbers.

The paraphrased content outlines that while temporal logic is instrumental for describing and verifying properties of reactive systems, the inherent difficulties, particularly those associated with state explosion and the computational complexity of CTL* verification, must be addressed for these techniques to be practically viable. Moreover, the paper discusses the trade-off between model precision and abstraction, with a focus on optimizing the abstract models used in these verifications.
