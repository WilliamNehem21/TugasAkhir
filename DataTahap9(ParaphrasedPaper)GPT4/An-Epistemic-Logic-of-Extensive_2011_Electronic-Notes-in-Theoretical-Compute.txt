The study of epistemic games—games that involve knowledge and beliefs—has been a major focus in the field of economics, particularly within interactive epistemology. While several researchers have used modal logic to analyze such games in both strategic and extensive forms, there is a lack of a comprehensive logic that formalizes the reasoning about extensive form games, particularly one that encompasses concepts like knowledge, rationality, and backward induction. The logic proposed in this context treats these notions as fundamental propositions without delving into more profound semantic detail, instead of relying on a specific set of axioms.

In the concept of rationality at an end vertex, as defined by "ratend," an agent is considered rational if they choose an action that maximizes their payoff, without depending on knowledge of other players' beliefs or states.

The paper introduces constraints such as C6 and C7 to ensure that players have perfect recall of their uncertainties regarding strategies and maintain awareness of future uncertainties without the ability to dismiss any strategies as the game progresses, signifying that they cannot learn or simplify their strategy space over time.

The authors acknowledge that others have made contributions to this field through various logical systems aimed at intensive form games. The intention is to compare these systems and find how the proposed logic ELEG(Extensive-form game Logic with Epistemic and strategic reasoning) differs and potentially improves upon them.

While the current research thoroughly axiomatizes this new logic, future work aims to extend its language to encompass not only future scenarios but also past events and counterfactual situations, indicating an interest in an even more dynamic and robust logical system that can analyze extensive form games with greater complexity.
