The escalating demand for plastics used in a myriad of applications ranging from packaging and construction materials to personal hygiene products presents significant waste management challenges. Conventional plastics derive from crude oil, a finite resource, and their resilience to degradation has created substantial environmental hazards. This issue has spurred interest in the production of biodegradable polymers on an industrial scale. Biodegradable polymers differ from oil-based polymers in their ability to decompose via the action of soil microbes, breaking down into carbon dioxide and water vapor due to these organisms metabolizing the carbon and nitrogen within the polymers.

The study explored optimizing conditions for the production of a biodegradable polymer, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), using a local bacterial strain. Response surface methodology (RSM), effective in optimizing industrial processes, was applied to evaluate the effects of various factors and their interactions on PHB production. The study employed Minitab 16 to design experiments with different carbon and nitrogen sources, monitored by optical density (OD600) and PHB yield.

Fructose was particularly used at a concentration of 40 g/L for producing PHB and 10 g/L for cultivating the inoculum, with the brothâ€™s pH adjusted to 7.0. Experimental designs identified optimal nutrient concentrations for maximum PHB production. Previous studies indicated certain amino acids like glycine and arginine enhance microbial biomass and PHB production.

The study's findings suggested fructose, ammonium chloride, maltose, and arginine as critical factors for bacterial growth and PHB accumulation. For cost-effectiveness, arginine was substituted with ammonium sulfate, with the ideal ratios for maximum PHB production determined experimentally and mathematically. Although the prediction for peak PHB production was 6 mg/L, the actual yield was slightly lower at 5.4 mg/L.

The growth and PHB accumulation by the isolate were affected by sugar and nitrogen consumption, indicating that PHB serves as a reserve material in microorganisms. The local Egyptian isolate Microbacterium sp. WA81 yielded the highest PHB at a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 8.2:1. Subsequent bioreactor testing showed a significant improvement in PHB production, suggesting that further optimization could enhance its potential as an industrial-scale biopolymer producer.
