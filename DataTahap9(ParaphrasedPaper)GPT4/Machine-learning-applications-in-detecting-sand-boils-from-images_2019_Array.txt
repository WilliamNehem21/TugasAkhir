Levees are vital for preventing floods in areas adjacent to water bodies, but their effectiveness can be compromised by structural issues indicated by the emergence of sand boils. Manual monitoring of these phenomena is resource-intensive and slow. Hence, this research presents an approach to automate the detection of sand boils through the use of advanced machine learning techniques. The study uses a diverse dataset comprised of manually collected satellite images, including challenging terrains that test the algorithms' robustness.

Aiming to provide an accurate and efficient sand boil detection tool, the researchers have tested several machine learning models. Significant events, such as the devastating 2005 hurricane Katrina, underscore the critical need for reliable levee monitoring. This event led to catastrophic failures in the levee system around New Orleans, emphasizing the potential consequences of insufficient levee maintenance.

This study explores computer vision and object detection algorithms to identify sand boils in images. Object detection technology, which distinguishes instances of target objects and outlines them, leverages a combination of computer vision and machine learning. This process is distinct from object recognition, which compares image similarity, such as grouping faces in photographs.

The dataset for this research had to be collected from varied sources due to the lack of centralized levee and sand boil data. Some of the machine learning methods tested involved extensive manual annotation of images to identify areas of interest within them. Different feature extraction techniques were utilized depending on the algorithm, with some algorithms like Viola-Jones using internally calculated haar features and deep learning algorithms extracting features through convolutional neural networks.

Machine learning trials included the use of a genetic algorithm to optimize feature selection and tests on various machine learning techniques, such as the single-shot multibox detector (SSD). The SSD approach proved to be fast and accurate. After training and testing different models, the best-performing methods and feature sets were identified, providing a foundation for a more targeted and efficient levee monitoring system.
