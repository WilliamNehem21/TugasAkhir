This paper examines the response to the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Bangladesh, focusing on public opinion as expressed through social media. Despite mass vaccinations taking place globally, few studies have addressed Bangladeshi perspectives on the matter. By January 2022, Bangladesh had made significant progress, administering over 160 million doses and fully vaccinating more than 62 million individuals. The researchers aim to analyze and capture the sentiments and themes within Bangladeshi online discourse regarding the vaccines, employing machine learning and deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis.

The paper then reviews related literature, revealing a variety of approaches and findings from studies on public sentiment towards COVID-19 and vaccinations. Some studies utilized topic modelling and sentiment analysis techniques such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and deep learning models to uncover public feelings and attitudes across different regions and subjects like misinformation and vaccine hesitancy.

In this Bangladeshi context, to sift through social media content for public opinion, several machine learning models and natural language processing (NLP) methods are employed. The paper also outlines the data collection and annotation process, involving volunteers to categorize sentiments into positive and negative polarities. The research utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling to discern prevalent themes in the discourse.

Among the methods tested, a Bi-directional LSTM model with a pre-trained Word2Vec embedding achieved the highest accuracy of 87.44% in classifying sentiment polarity. The study collected data from June 2020 to July 2021 and validated the labelling reliability through inter-rater reliability tests.

The authors conclude by highlighting the research contributions and potential future work, crediting the paper's collaborators who contributed through methodology development, data curation, analysis, and writing. The study provides new insights into public opinion surrounding COVID-19 vaccinations in Bangladesh, showcasing the application of advanced analytical techniques to social media discourse.
