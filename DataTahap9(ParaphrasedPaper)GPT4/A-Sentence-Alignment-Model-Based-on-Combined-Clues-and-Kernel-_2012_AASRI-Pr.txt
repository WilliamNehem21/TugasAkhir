In the field of natural language processing research, the significance of bilingual corpora is increasingly acknowledged. Diverse applications necessitate bilingual corpora with different alignment resolutions, including article, paragraph, sentence, phrase, and word alignments. Sentence-level alignment, in particular, is crucial for example-based machine translation.

To address alignment discrepancies, a multi-alignment penalty factor is utilized. For example, in cases of alignment conflicts where it's uncertain whether the correct alignment should be 1-2 or two separate alignments, 1-1 and 0-1, the proposed method involves computing the similarity across these possible alignments and applying a penalty factor to adjust the similarity scores for comparison.

In performance comparisons, our alignment system demonstrates a lower error rate than the competing GALE system. Specifically, our system has an error rate of 2.3% compared to GALE's 3.5%. This comparative analysis and the experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed computational model.
