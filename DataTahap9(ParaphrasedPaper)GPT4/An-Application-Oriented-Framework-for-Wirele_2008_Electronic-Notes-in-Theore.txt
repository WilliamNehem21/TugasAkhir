Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) typically comprise small, cost-effective, and battery-operated sensing units with wireless communication capabilities, which can be deployed over a certain area to create an impromptu network. These sensors often have limited energy sources, computing capacity, and memory. They are utilized for various purposes such as disaster assistance, acquiring seismic data, wildlife observation, and military reconnaissance. After distribution across an operational environment, the sensors aim to establish a network to share and relay information.

Because WSNs usually don't have fixed infrastructure and the sensors have constrained computing resources, key predistribution is a common method for establishing cryptographic keys. Keys are preloaded into sensorsâ€™ memory by a trusted entity prior to deployment. Post-deployment, sensors generally lose access to this trusted entity and must rely on preloaded keys to establish secure communication channels, with some capable of serving as local key distributers.

The study primarily addresses schemes that depend on key predistribution and presumes a global passive adversary model, in which an attacker can potentially compromise nodes to extract keys and intercept network communications. It excludes schemes based on continuous access to a secure base station or public-key cryptography.

Communication within sensor networks is frequently modeled as t-complete networks, where 't' represents the subset size of sensors that can communicate securely. Typically, the 2-complete or pairwise complete structure is utilized, suitable for networks where node deployment locations are not controlled.

Various parameters, such as communication range and available power, are adjustable factors influencing key establishment approaches in specific sensor network scenarios. These parameters tend to be interdependent, with particular applications imposing different limitations on them.

The study references a multitude of key management schemes including probabilistic methods and threshold-based strategies, as well as hierarchical adaptations and other approaches that suit certain types or configurations of sensor networks.

The paper also notes that many applications do not require an ideal pairwise communication structure but rather involve a mobile data collector communicating with sensors. In such cases, designing for pairwise communication structures becomes necessary, especially when sensor deployment cannot be tightly controlled.

Most existing literature focuses on heterogeneous sensor networks with a central base station. The paper encourages further research on networks with various sensor capabilities but without a central base station, and in particular, hierarchical networks with partial knowledge of sensor locations.

The diversity of WSNs means there is no single definition for them, leading to variations in networking setups supporting various applications, a factor that should be taken into account for the development of key establishment schemes. This paper provides an overview of the landscape up to 2005 and suggests areas for future research and development.
