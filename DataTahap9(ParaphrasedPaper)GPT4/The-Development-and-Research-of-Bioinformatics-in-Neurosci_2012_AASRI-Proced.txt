In recent times, an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines bioinformatics and neuroscience has begun to flourish, as an increasing number of scholars conducting molecular and cellular level research has produced a vast array of publications and discoveries. Utilizing the scientometric tool CiteSpace II, with data sourced from the Web of Science, this study has identified prominent themes and tracked the progression of this interdisciplinary area through the creation of an evolutionary knowledge map spanning from 1991 to 2012. Through co-citation analysis, five dominant research clusters have been discovered, helping outline the field's development.

Neuroscience, which emerged in the 1960s, primarily focuses on the structure and functions of the nervous system, with significant attention paid to molecular and cellular research. The expansion of information technology and molecular biology has enabled neuroscience researchers to integrate bioinformatics into their studies, especially in areas like genetics. This junction has spurred novel advances within both bioinformatics and neuroscience.

Co-citation analysis, a method where two pieces of literature are connected when they are referenced together by a third, is used to assess the strength of linkage between publications. A higher frequency of co-citations indicates a stronger association. This analysis serves to categorize different research areas by organizing key publications within a given field based on their co-citation relationships.

One study analyzed genome-wide expression data from DNA microarray hybridization, presenting the results visually in a biologist-friendly manner, showing both clustering and underlying expression data. The study revealed that genes with similar functions tend to group together, and this pattern also appeared in human data. As a result, it was suggested that genes with known functions co-expressed with poorly characterized or new genes could help infer functions of many genes for which information was previously scarce. Parallel to this, advancements in information technology have led to the creation of network databases, mitigating the issue of scattered biological knowledge. For instance, Hosack demonstrated the use of DAVID for obtaining graphical abstracts that facilitate gene and protein identifier annotations and summaries.

Cluster C5 homes in on codon usage and transcription studies, citing works published between 2011 and 2012. Grantham initially proposed in 1980 the concept of a codon usage catalog and the genome hypothesis, which suggests that codon selection is driven by the genome as a whole rather than individual genes. Then, in 2000, Yusuke Nakamura discovered the p53AIP1 gene, which significantly influences cell apoptosis and can be transcriptionally activated by Ser-46 phosphorylation. Castro-Chavez's research compared human codon usage with other species, like Drosophila and squid, indicating distinct patterns in common codon usage, with the most frequent human codons ending in CGA (nucleosides) versus the UAG (nucleotide) ending observed in squid.
