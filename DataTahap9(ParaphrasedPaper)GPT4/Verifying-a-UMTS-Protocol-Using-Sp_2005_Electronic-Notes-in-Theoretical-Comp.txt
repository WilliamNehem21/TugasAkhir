This paper examines the model checking of the Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol within the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), focusing on incorporating the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) data models into a model checker. The authors briefly introduce EASN, which integrates control structures based on PROMELA with ASN.1-based data models, and compare it to the SPIN model checker.

Model checking is recognized as a useful verification method, but it faces challenges such as state explosion in real-world programs. SPIN is an established model checker with capabilities like deadlock detection and temporal logic properties verification, and it has been enhanced for efficiency with features like bit-state hashing and partial-order reduction. The paper suggests merging ASN.1, a data definition language for telecommunications, with model checking to improve the standardization process of protocols.

The article is laid out systematically, outlining the tools SPIN and EASN, the RLC protocol, the modeling approach, verification results, and concluding remarks. The EASN project aspired to adapt the SPIN system to handle ASN.1, with the EASN language designed to blend ASN.1 data typing with PROMELA's control constructs harmoniously.

UMTS, employing a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) radio access technique, introduces the RLC protocol. Implemented in March 2000 by 3GPP, the RLC protocol serves layer 2 of the OSI model, ensuring reliable data transfer. The paper zeroes in on the acknowledged transfer service, which guarantees the delivery of Protocol Data Units (PDUs) and provides several services, including dynamic QoS adjustments and error notifications.

While simplifying the RLC model, details like segmentation, concatenation, and ciphering are excluded for a focused examination of reliable data transfer. The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, modeled as unreliable FIFO queues, works below the RLC layer to transfer PDUs unreliably.

The real UMTS stack communication is also simplified in the model. The model uses an oracle for direct synchronization between Radio Resource Control (RRC) entities to streamline the creation and termination of RLC connections.

EASN evolves from SPIN, with rewrites in state encoding and management, leading to memory performance gains. However, the revised components in EASN demonstrate longer run-times than SPIN. Notably, EASN leverages the GNU Multi-Precision arithmetic package for hash-value computations of system states.

The paper also investigates discrepancies between SPIN and EASN's state counts in their models, revealing and correcting an issue with SPIN's handling of rendezvous channels, with the fixed version being SPIN 3.4.6 (dated March 29, 2001).
