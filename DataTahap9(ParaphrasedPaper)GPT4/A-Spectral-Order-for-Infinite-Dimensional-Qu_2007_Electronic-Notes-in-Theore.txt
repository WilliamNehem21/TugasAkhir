In 2002, Coecke and Martin introduced a Bayesian order for finite-dimensional classical state spaces in physics and established a corresponding spectral order for finite-dimensional quantum states. These ordering systems provided the state spaces with a structure akin to that of a domain, which enabled the evaluation of state information content and assessment of how partial states serve as approximations of pure states. In a prior study, the author expanded the Bayesian order to cover classical states in infinite-dimensional spaces. While this ordering retains many features significant to physics in the infinite-dimensional context, it no longer possesses the domain-theoretic structure found in finite dimensions. Consequently, measuring information content and defining approximations is no longer feasible in the same manner as it is with finite-dimensional spaces. This paper aims to develop a spectral order based on the Bayesian order for infinite-dimensional quantum state spaces.
