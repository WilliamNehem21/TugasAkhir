Falls represent a significant issue in public health, as the severity of injuries and associated medical costs are often influenced by how promptly assistance is provided. Developing efficient methods to detect and communicate falls can expedite aid, potentially mitigating further harm.

The study utilizes background subtraction for image segmentation, which involves calculating the difference between the current image and a background model. A threshold is then applied to distinguish between background and foreground pixels, isolating the region of interest. To reduce shadow effects, the method proposed by Elgammal is employed. However, the resulting foreground images may still contain imperfections like small gaps and noise, which are addressed using morphological operations such as dilation and erosion. A binary motion image is ultimately achieved by applying a threshold.

When assessing a fall, relying solely on an individual's aspect ratio, which may exceed 1 during physical activities, can lead to incorrect conclusions. In such instances, because the bounding rectangle and the effective area ratio of the individual decrease, it is possible to avoid misjudgments by considering both the aspect ratio and the effective area ratio together.
