The paper discusses an advanced method for detecting vehicles, crucial for the functionality of smart transportation systems dealing with complex traffic scenarios. To address the issues of extensive computational requirements and lack of prompt processing in conventional vehicle detection techniques, the study introduces a vehicle detection algorithm that combines the principles of Compressive Sensing (CS) and the background subtraction technique, aiming at real-time performance. Furthermore, the research applies the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm for the reconstruction of the foreground vehicle images, yielding better detection accuracy, reduced computations, and enhanced image quality over traditional methods.

In more detail, the proposed background subtraction method leverages CS to gather video measurements through compressive sampling of the input video frames. Successive background image measurements are generated from these initial measurements. Real-time updating of the background image is essential due to environmental changes. For the background subtraction process, the measurement of the background model and the real-time video frame are compared through a differential thresholding operation to identify the presence of a moving vehicle. If no vehicle is detected, the frame is discarded; otherwise, the OMP algorithm is used to reconstruct the image of the vehicle. This approach enhances the efficacy and speed of vehicle detection systems.
