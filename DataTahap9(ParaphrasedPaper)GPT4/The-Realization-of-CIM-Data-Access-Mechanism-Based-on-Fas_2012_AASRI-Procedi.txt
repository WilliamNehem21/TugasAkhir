The Data Access Facility (DAF) is a key component of the IEC61970 standard, aimed at enhancing the interoperability and collaborative capabilities of Energy Management Systems (EMS) and related applications. It accomplishes this by providing a standardized Application Programming Interface (API) and service mechanism for various vendors to access and utilize Common Information Model (CIM) public data.

The DAF's design principle revolves around offering an easy-to-use API to simplify application development. As a fundamental interface standard within the CIM system, the DAF encompasses several modules, including descriptions, identifiers, queries, and events, each with corresponding interfaces. These modules provide comprehensive functional interfaces for both internal and external systems to retrieve CIM data. This paper, however, focuses solely on three DAF modules: DAFDescriptions, DAFQuery, and DAFIdentifiers, as specified by their .idl files.

In terms of DAF's querying capabilities, it deals with resources, properties, and values to construct the queries. A resource represents any uniquely identifiable entity, usually denoted by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with an optional fragment identifier. For the purpose of DAF queries and results, a more concise form of the URI, termed ResourceID, is preferred. A property characterizes an attribute of a resource, and when used in queries, it is referenced by a type known as PropertyID. Since properties themselves are resources, the PropertyID is also considered a ResourceID. Properties define a domain (a set of resources) and a range (a set of values), establishing relationships between resources via these properties, with the nature of these domains and ranges being resource collections as well.
