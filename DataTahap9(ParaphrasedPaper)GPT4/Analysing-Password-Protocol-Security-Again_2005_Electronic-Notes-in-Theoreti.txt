The academic paper discusses the limitations of analyzing password protocols using ideal encryption because practical encryption schemes often do not achieve this ideal and introduce vulnerabilities. When designing password protocols, it is important to consider the specific encryption scheme being used, as the security against dictionary attacks will be influenced by the properties of the chosen encryption method.

Two key properties of encryption schemes relevant to protocol security are repetition concealment and which-key concealment. Repetition concealment prevents adversaries from recognizing when the same message is encrypted multiple times with the same key, typically requiring probabilistic or stateful encryption techniques. Which-key concealment hinders adversaries from deducing whether different messages are encrypted using the same key.

However, each encryption system may have specific characteristics that could provide extra clues to an attacker. For instance, RSA public keys have particular structural properties that could expose them to dictionary attacks when used with the Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) protocol.

The paper identifies a vulnerability in EKE related to ciphertext identifiability, proposing a new modification to mitigate this issue. It also discusses how terms are handled in the protocol environment using variables, allowing references to transmitted terms without needing to know their atomic names.

Encryption modeling in this context accounts for randomness, essential for probabilistic encryption, through names acting as randomness parameters. This modeling approach allows for a distinction between repetition-concealing and repetition-revealing encryption systems.

The paper further explains how ciphertexts can sometimes be distinguished from random noise without revealing plaintext or encryption keys, due to subtle clues like message length or structural characteristics in specific cryptosystems, such as block ciphers or RSA.
