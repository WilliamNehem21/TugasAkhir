Tofte and Talpin have developed a region calculus, which is a memory management system used within a specific type of annotated lambda calculus designed to keep track of memory allocation and deallocation explicitly. This calculus serves as an intermediate language in the compiler for programming languages similar to ML, where memory regions are managed through static inference, potentially replacing the need for garbage collection. Ensuring the region system works correctly is essential for preventing memory safety issues, such as deallocating memory prematurely.

The proof of the correctness of the region calculus presented by Tofte and Talpin is complex, largely due to its reliance on co-inductive proof methods and the intricacies of its operational semantics, which manipulate an explicit store of memory. This paper offers a simplified approach by introducing a small-step operational semantics relying on syntactic rewriting and providing a more straightforward inductive proof of type soundness, based on Wright and Felleisen's methodology.

In addition to its role in memory management, the region calculus deals with the allocation and deallocation of memory at the right times to avoid performance issues due to excess memory use and the risks of using invalid memory references. It enables instantaneous deallocation of memory regions, ensuring safety and potentially eliminating the need for traditional garbage collection in some cases.

This paper explores the entire polymorphic region calculus, considering the nuances introduced by polymorphic recursion. It compares this work with another soundness proof by Calcagno, who provided a structural operational semantics and also related it back to the original semantics by Tofte and Talpin.

The paper is outlined as follows: The region calculus is introduced, followed by the presentation of the small-step operational semantics, extensions to the static semantics by Tofte and Talpin, and the proof of the type soundness. An example is provided to illustrate the concepts, and the conclusion is presented. Additional work is being conducted on a version of the region calculus that includes binding-time annotations to ensure the correctness of binding-time analysis and to prove other properties, namely the preservation of semantics.
