This academic paper examines communication protocols through simulation, focusing on the performance of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) in 802.11 networks. The study initially discusses various classes of Petri nets, tools for network protocol modeling, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses for rigorous, formal representation. Subsequently, the paper introduces a detailed model of the 802.11b standard utilizing Object-Oriented Petri Nets (OOPNs), which accurately depict the backoff procedure and time synchronization aspects.

The research progresses to performance analysis using simulations within dense wireless network environments. These simulations aim to provide a modular model facilitating the assessment of how network performance affects the operation of distributed discrete event systems.

The paper is structured to begin with a mathematical description and comparative analysis of different Petri net classes, addressing their advantages and limitations in protocol modeling. Following this theoretical groundwork, the paper provides an overview of the IEEE 802.11b DCF and elaborates on the proposed model. The final section confirms the model's validity through simulation-based performance analysis.

Petri nets, conceptualized by C. A. Petri in 1962, serve as a versatile formalism for describing a variety of systems, including distributed, parallel, and stochastic systems, specifically in the context of discrete event dynamics. Petri nets can be represented both mathematically and graphically.

Timed Petri nets are discussed as a solution to resolve timing conflicts within the model. However, the paper recognizes that these nets do not address stochastic behaviors (like bit rate errors) nor the modeling of time intervals, as they assume constant time delays.

Beyond timed Petri nets, the paper touches on Object-Oriented Petri Nets (OOPNs), which employ tuples of object instances as tokens, enhancing the model's representational flexibility and simulating complex system components.

The 802.11 Mac protocol, an IEEE standard for WLANs, employs two medium access mechanisms. DCF, the primary focus of the study, uses a CSMA/CA technique for random access, while the Point Coordination Function (PCF) offers centralized, priority-based access.

Simulations carried out in the study assume a network landscape with numerous workstations transmitting at 11mbps, each with a queue of 1000 packets of an average size of 1150 bytes, aiming to send data at the first opportunity. The results aim to validate the model and its modular framework for performance evaluation in densely populated wireless networks.
