Example 3.9 highlights a binary method issue, which are known to cause theoretical challenges in the field of object-oriented programming and affect certain coalgebraic properties. Coalgebras serve as a foundation for coalgebraic specification, similar to how algebras underpin algebraic specification. This paper introduces the concept of dialgebraic specification, though due to space constraints, details and proofs are not provided.

While coalgebras are closed under intersection and composition, they are not closed under union. This paper speculates whether findings similar to Theorem 3.20, regarding closure under union for congruences, could apply to extended polynomial functors.

Coalgebras exhibit properties like closure under union for invariants and bisimulations, whereas general dialgebras do not; this limitation is attributed to binary methods. Without binary methods, dialgebras retain these closure properties.

Although there's a duality between algebras and coalgebras, the paper didn't identify algebraic properties that fail in dialgebras, suggesting further exploration could uncover such properties by carefully dualizing lemmas 3.10 and 3.16.
