This paper introduces the concept of syndetic modeling, a method that combines both user behavior and computer system modeling within a unified mathematical structure to enhance our understanding of human-system interaction. It elaborates on the theoretical origins of the approach, achievements to date, and prospects for future research.

The syndetic modeling approach arose from the collaborative AMODEUS II project, involving experts in computer science and cognitive psychology, and supported by the EU. The project's goal was to develop methodologies for designing and analyzing interactive systems by integrating Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) modeling results.

Syndetic modeling employs specific system modeling methods such as 'Interactors' and cognitive modeling approaches like 'Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS).' The choice of a mathematical framework in this case is Modal Action Logic (MAL), though it's acknowledged that this selection is somewhat arbitrary and motivated by the existing methodologies in the AMODEUS project. Despite other formal notations existing, such as LOTOS and the interval temporal logic MEXITL, the authors decided that MAL and its early versions would suit their purposes for integrating cognitive and computer models.

ICS principles can be formalized axiomatically, comparable to other information processing systems, allowing one to describe the cognitive processes of a user and a computer interface within the same framework. By doing this, the cognitive models and device models can be directly integrated, giving researchers the ability to use formal representation to explore how users deploy cognitive systems when interacting with computers.

The concept of 'Interactors' in particular provides a useful generic component for encapsulating the behavior of complex systems. The paper mentions a specific model of ICS that revolves around transformation processes and mental representations, with more detailed discussions available in other publications.

Furthermore, the paper touches upon the inclusion of deictic capabilities in systems, given that deixis is a key feature of human-human interaction, and explores its potential utility in human-computer interaction through syndetic modeling.

Discussions also include the challenges in modeling memory and mental representation structures due to their complexity. Brief mentions of models in auditory processing highlight potential similarities in underlying operations across different sensory systems, suggesting a goal of finding mathematical models for these fundamental cognitive operations.

Finally, the paper identifies the need to expand understanding beyond individual user interactions to group behaviors, as real-world systems often have multiple users. This points to a long-term objective of developing a framework that can account for the emergent behavior of user groups as well as individual users.
