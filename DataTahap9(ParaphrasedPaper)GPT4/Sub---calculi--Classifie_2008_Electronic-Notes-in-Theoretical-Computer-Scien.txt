The excerpt discusses certain cases within the scope of a theoretical framework that most likely involves lambda calculus or a related formal system. Let me provide a paraphrased version:

If a certain term (referred to as the 'superterm') contains the entirety of a reducible expression (the 'redex'), there are three possible scenarios to consider: The first scenario is when the variable 'y' occurs outside of the redex; the second is if 'y' is found within the term 't'; and the third scenario is if 'y' is within 'u'. The first two scenarios are straightforward to resolve, but the last scenario requires the acknowledgement that the number of occurrences of 'x' in 't' is one. For each scenario, we find that the number of occurrences of 'y' in 'v1' is also one.

The paper goes on to discuss a property of disjunction in relation to stability, as noted in Remark 7.2, suggesting that disjunction does not behave well with respect to stability. Despite this, a subsequent proposition reveals the unique behavior of the number one (1), suggesting that the specific choice of the function p(1) may be inconsequential to the stability of function p.

The summary acknowledges that the paraphrasing of earlier results is less broad but points out an intriguing, emergent structure that appears to be unrelated to any familiar algebraic systems. This observation serves as an indication that the structure may either be sufficiently interesting to warrant comprehensive examination or it might hint at an even more captivating general structure. This potential overarching structure could lead to a significant generalization of the concept known as 'subcalculus'.

(This paraphrase attempts to convey the original meaning in a different wording without being too technical, assuming that the original content is aimed at readers familiar with advanced theoretical concepts within computer science or mathematics.)
