In this study, capital letters such as X, Y, and so forth (potentially including subscripts), are utilized to represent upper indices within predicate formulations, such as P X(X, Y). Lowercase letters, possibly including subscripts, are employed for all other instances. It is presumed that the set comprising uppercase variables and the set containing lowercase variables are mutually exclusive.
