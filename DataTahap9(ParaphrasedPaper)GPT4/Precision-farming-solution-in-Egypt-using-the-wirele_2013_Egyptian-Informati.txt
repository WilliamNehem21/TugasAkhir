A range of technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have played key roles in precision farming. The critical phase of precision farming involves producing detailed soil maps with various characteristics, through methods like grid soil sampling, yield monitoring, and crop scouting. By integrating RS with GPS, high-accuracy maps and agricultural field models are possible. Data collection, often by electronic sensors like soil probes and remote optical scanners on satellites, is digitized into GIS databases. Subsequent statistical analysis identifies variability in agricultural land properties.

The Egyptian agricultural sector is a cornerstone of the country’s economy, supporting and employing a significant portion of the population, contributing to GDP, and earning foreign exchange. The sector aims to increase animal protein provision, though it contends with vast unsustainable rangelands.

Potato exports from Egypt see seasonal variation. For instance, exports increased from 2010 to 2011, mainly to Russia, the EU, and Gulf states. Potatoes are planted and harvested in cycles conducive to both domestic consumption and export.

Pest and disease management is crucial, as potatoes are vulnerable to multiple pathogens such as early and late blights, bacterial rot, ring rot, common scab, and various nematodes and viruses, as well as insect pests. Efficient management includes prevention and early detection which can be supported by wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

WSNs are needed that promptly react to environmental changes with a balanced focus on energy efficiency, accuracy, and response times. Advanced querying systems are needed for timely, reliable data. The Adaptive Periodic Threshold-sensitive Energy-Efficient sensor network (APTEEN) strategy is an ideal approach to routing for precision farming, blending proactive and reactive actions and providing timely data while responding to significant environmental changes.

APTEEN's scalability for large agricultural areas is realized through a hierarchical network structure. In terms of network longevity and energy use, APTEEN outperforms other hierarchical protocols like LEACH and LEACH-C.

This paper highlights the potential benefits of implementing WSNs in Egypt’s precision farming, particularly for strategic crops like potatoes. WSNs can address various agricultural problems in Egypt and enhance crop management and productivity.
