Our paper addresses the limitations in current agent communication language (ACL) proposals, particularly regarding the semantics' definition. We propose defining ACL semantics as the specification of the analytical effects that agents' communicative acts have on their social relationships. While borrowing from speech act theory, similar to prior research, we diverge from the conventional approach in artificial agent research by focusing on communicative acts that alter social relationships through commitments.

Commitment is considered a foundational concept for understanding the social fabric of multi-agent systems. We introduce an essential artificial institution designed to facilitate agents in manipulating their mutual network of commitments through communication. We conceptualize communicative acts as institutional acts executed through message exchanges, which agents are allowed to perform by this institution.

We detail how commitments and pre-commitments emerge from these communicative acts—when agents exchange messages, specific events can constitute actions that create, alter, or nullify commitments, reshaping the agents' relationships and obligations.

The institution allows five operations for commitment manipulation: creating or canceling commitments and creating, canceling, or accepting pre-commitments. We define actions—make commitment, make precommitment, cancel commitment, cancel precommitment, and accept precommitment—through axioms that explain their essential effects.

Regarding temporal references, we establish truth conditions for commitments based on the logic of ‘clauses’—a commitment's content is fulfilled, violated, or pending if it is true, false, or undefined, respectively, relative to the event that generated it.

We establish the meaning of messages in terms of their impact on the commitment network. The mapping between message exchanges and commitment manipulation actions is dictated by institutional conventions, which are formally stated.

We discuss ambiguities in cancel message exchanges, noting that such a message can correspond to different actions (canceling a precommitment or a commitment), with the context clarifying the intent due to ontological presuppositions that prevent overlap.

Finally, we provide a general definition of communicative acts based on conditions classified as ontological presuppositions and authorizations. Authorizations are the institutional power granted to agents, while ontological possibility relates to the necessary pre-existing conditions for a communicative act to occur.

We conclude that all communicative acts can be executed as declarations within the basic institution, simplifying ACLs to a single type of message—declarations. This performative approach to communication means that while other message types can serve as shortcuts, they do not enhance the ACL's expressive power beyond what declarations already provide.
