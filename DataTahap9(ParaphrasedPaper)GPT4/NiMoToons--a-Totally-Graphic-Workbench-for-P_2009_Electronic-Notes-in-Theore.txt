The academic paper discusses the development and features of NIMo (a specific graphical programming environment) and compares it with other existing tools and languages. Below is a paraphrased version of the original text provided:

NIMo's full semantic framework was specified using graph grammars and was realized in a graph transformation system. This initial version, known as NIMoAGG, laid the groundwork for the creation of NIMoToons, NIMo's graphical interface. The version discussed in the paper represents a significant progression from the initial work. The previous publication dealt with the system's overall design and technical details. In this paper, the focus is on the latest additions to the system and their practical applications. The innovative features include:

A. The red multi-edges represent duplicate expressions generated by duplicator components. In NIMo, only constants (depicted as circles and list-ends) are actually duplicated, while other sub-networks are reused to conserve resources. However, to make the outcomes clearer, users can opt to duplicate values. This duplication can be localized to an input port or be forced on a sub-network's output by placing a special process indicated by a double-green-triangle near the duplicator. In the earlier, lazy evaluation setting, this process was utilized at network outputs to maintain continuous demand. Now, it also serves to duplicate shared values when required. The duplication algorithm is complex due to the existence of processes with multiple outputs.

B. Type inference in NIMo is static and incremental. As the network is constructed, each connection maintains type consistency. The type inference mechanism is graphically an extension of the classic Hindley/Milner algorithm that accommodates multiple outputs and the conversion between curried and uncurried forms. With each connection made, a type graph specific to the network is constructed and updated incrementally.

C. Several tools and languages have features in common with NIMo. Some tracers, debuggers, and visualization tools for functional languages were compared previously. For example, GemCut is a graphical interface for viewing functions in the Haskell-like language CAL, employing the language's compiler for type inference to avert type errors. Similar to CAL, NIMo provides graphical type inference with real-time visibility of the process. Web-based tools like TypeTool and System I serve to visualize the type inference of lambda expressions, aimed at teaching the basics of type inference in functional programming.

D. Regarding evaluation methods, Ptolemy can be considered. It is an actor-based visual language with ports for inter-actor communication. Unlike NIMo, which visualizes the entire program state, Ptolemy shows actor parameters in a separate window. Ptolemy handles continuous data, while NIMo is limited to discrete data. Ptolemy features various domains with uniform evaluation policies, such as the data-driven process network domain, contrasting with NIMo's approach.
