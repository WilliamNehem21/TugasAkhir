The World Wide Web, now the most extensive library in human history, presents a complex challenge for search due to the overwhelming volume of information and the inherent language issues like polysemy (one word with multiple meanings) and synonymy (different words with the same meaning) that can make search results less relevant. Addressing the need for personalized web search, this paper proposes a novel multi-agent system approach to tailor search outcomes to individual user preferences.

A new model is introduced, which commences by crafting a user profile from basic initial information and continually refines it with implicit user feedback, ensuring that it stays comprehensive, dynamic, and current. It optimizes user queries semantically in two stages: first by incorporating profile preferences, and second by using the WordNet ontology. This model enhances current search engines by leveraging their retrieval capabilities for better precision.

A methodical case study and simulations assess this approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving traditional search engines' accuracy and resolving vocabulary issues.

The paper is structured as follows: related work review, an outline of the proposed model's conceptual view, a detailed exploration of the model's architecture, a case study with simulation results, and finally, a conclusion summarizing the research.

The model uses three interacting agents with standard agent communication protocols to personalize search results. The user interface agent assists users in submitting search queries and displaying personalized results, drawing from the user's profile preferences and WordNet synonyms for query optimization. The meta-search agent then collaborates with syntactic search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo) to amalgamate results before returning them to the interface agent. User interactions with search outcomes are monitored for feedback, which the profiler agent uses to continue updating the user profile.

In conclusion, the paper discusses how the multi-agent system-based model for web search personalization dynamically builds and maintains user profiles, semantically optimizes queries, and, through a concrete case study, demonstrates its ability to enhance the precision of search engines and address vocabulary issues by integrating user preferences and WordNet.
