With the advent of advanced electronic communication technologies, the ease of accessing and sharing information has unfortunately facilitated the proliferation of online piracy. Textual data, which is paramount in educational content and official publications, remains the most prevalent modality of information, even more than images, audio, and video. It is also the most straightforward medium for converting speech into a written form. Alongside electronic text, text-images retain significance, particularly for official records and in instances where authors release their books in this format. These text-images, however, are vulnerable to infringement of intellectual property rights and unauthorized use. Watermarking is a technology employed to safeguard against such issues.

Text-image watermarking is fraught with challenges, notably because text-images contain minimal redundant information to accommodate watermark embedding, unlike more detailed general images where modifications can go unnoticed. Text images exhibit stark contrasts between text and background, making any alterations easily detectable.

The paper is structured into several sections, with each covering different aspects of text-image watermarking. Section 2 reviews methods related to watermarking text images. In Section 3, the paper discusses various transformations used in the proposed watermarking technique. The new method, including its embedding and extraction processes, is explored in Section 4. The experimental setup is described in Section 5, followed by Section 6, which details experimental results pertaining to the method's imperceptibility and robustness. Lastly, Section 7 summarizes the paper and outlines future research directions.

The paper discusses a novel watermarking technique involving a three-character window moving along text lines, a word classification-based word shifting method, and embedding watermarks in grayscale text images using edge direction histograms. While each approach has its strengths, they are susceptible to different types of attacks such as image attacks and binarization attack. Another method employs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for watermarking sensitive text-images but faces vulnerability to geometric attacks. Additionally, a technique based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) demonstrates good robustness and security but can lead to information loss during inverse operations.

The proposed watermarking method uses Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) and DCT. The process begins with applying IWT to the cover image, followed by DCT to the LL sub-band. Watermarks are embedded into the low to medium DCT coefficients, with the inverse processes subsequently applied to obtain the watermarked image. During extraction, a comparison of DCT coefficients from the original and watermarked images facilitates the retrieval of the watermark.

Compared to existing methods, the proposed method shows improved robustness against compression and noise, taking advantage of DCT's resilience to compression attacks. It claims superior robustness compared to methods utilizing SVD but acknowledges its own limitations when faced with rotation attacks.
