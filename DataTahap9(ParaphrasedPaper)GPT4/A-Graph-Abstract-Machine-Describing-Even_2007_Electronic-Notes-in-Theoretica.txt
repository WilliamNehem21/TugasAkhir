This paper outlines the collaborative efforts and inspiration drawn from discussions with various experts in the field, including Nobuko Yoshida and Daniele Varacca, whose input has been particularly influential. The authors express gratitude to multiple individuals for their useful feedback and constructive criticisms.

The primary focus of the study is to explore the mechanics of game semantics strategies and their relation to event structures. A key realization is that linear strategies, which can be identified with the multiplicative-additive structure of linear logic, exhibit a strong connection with event structures. The main characteristic of these strategies is that they represent confusion-free partial orders with conflict relations, leading to the insight that many properties underpinning successful composition may stem from this confusion-free nature.

The overarching ambition is to conceptualize confusion-free event structures as a broadened interpretation of strategies and to understand the composition of these structures through the lens of game semantics. In this context, a new machine is introduced to provide a unified presentation of composition, with further developments planned in subsequent work.

In game semantics, strategy plays a pivotal role in dictating a player's responses to moves made by their adversary, with the interaction between the two forming a play. Examples of event structures, both confusion-free and not, are provided to illustrate key concepts such as conflict representation.

The composition of event structures is governed by synchronization and enabling, which involve coinciding matching events and ensuring that an event can only occur if all preceding events have been enabled. This is exemplified in the article with a more detailed explanation in a specific section.

A novel perspective is presented, viewing confusion-free event structures as layered combinations of conflict-free structures or "slices," which simplifies their analysis by reducing it to the examination of these individual slices.

Furthermore, the authors extend their work to include the implementation of strategy composition through the creation of a new machine, elaborating on how it behaves similarly to its predecessor (the 'lam' machine) when handling linear strategies.

The research also intersects with another stream of work that bridges graph strategies and proof-nets. Proof-nets are a graphical representation of proofs within linear logic that have been instrumental in analyzing and optimizing functional programming, specifically via localized rewriting rules.

Event structures are envisaged as multiplicative-additive proof-nets, with aspirations to leverage associated technologies. A central concept in proof-nets, the correctness criterion, ensures that proper normalization occurs without deadlocks. The authors plan to investigate the applicability of this criterion or a similar principle to event structures for maintaining deadlock-free compositions. 

This abstract summarizes the inquiries and findings presented in the paper, potentially serving as a roadmap for continued exploration of game semantics in relation to event structures and strategy composition.
