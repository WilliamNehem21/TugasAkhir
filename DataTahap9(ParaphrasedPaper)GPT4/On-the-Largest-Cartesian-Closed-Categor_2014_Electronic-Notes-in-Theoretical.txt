The academic paper states that it is uncertain whether the category SAL possesses the property of being Cartesian closed. This uncertainty arises from an incomplete understanding of whether compact elements in CM function spaces are adequately represented by their traces, as discussed in Section 5 of the paper. Nonetheless, this issue is not of primary concern for the purposes of the paper since the focus is on the universal characteristic of function spaces as outlined in part (iii) of Definition 3.1.
