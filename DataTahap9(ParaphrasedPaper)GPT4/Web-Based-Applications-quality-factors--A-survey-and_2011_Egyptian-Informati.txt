This paper focuses on identifying, categorizing, and modeling quality factors for web-based applications (WBAs). As the World Wide Web has become a vital source of information, ensuring high-quality WBAs is increasingly important, given their complexity and the varying requirements of users. Despite the importance of WBA quality, defining and organizing these quality factors is challenging.

The paper sets out to create a conceptual quality model for WBAs considering different stakeholder perspectives, including visitors, owners, and end-users. It reviews existing quality models, both general and those specific to WBAs. The recognized ISO/IEC 9126 standard acts as a basis for defining key quality factors, which has been adjusted to accommodate the specifics of WBAs.

The model adopts a structure where quality factors are broken down into sub-factors, drawing from previous research and new insights to cater to web-specific features. It acknowledges the distinct needs of WBA users compared to traditional software and the impact that the diverse skill sets of developers have on quality. The model also considers both the technical aspects (like interface design and security) and the importance of addressing user needs.

Finally, the paper outlines the future work necessary to embrace experimental studies and a validation framework, aiming to provide empirical support for the proposed quality factors and sub-factors specific to web-based applications.
