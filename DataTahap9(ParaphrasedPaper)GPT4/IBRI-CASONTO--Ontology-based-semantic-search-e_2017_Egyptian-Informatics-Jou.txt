The paper discusses the challenges posed by the rapidly growing body of information in data repositories and the difficulty of extracting precise and relevant information. To address these challenges, developers are vying to advance technology capable of understanding researchers' intentions and the contextual meaning of terms. Despite significant competition in developing semantic search systems for the English language, efforts to create such systems for Arabic have been relatively limited, which can be attributed to Arabic's complex morphology, grammar, and semantics, as it is a highly inflectional and derivational language.

This paper introduces Ibri-CASOnto, an ontological search engine for the Colleges of Applied Sciences in Oman, which supports both Arabic and English languages. The engine offers two search modes: keyword-based and semantics-based (ontological). It employs technologies like Resource Description Framework (RDF) data and ontological graphs.

Three types of ontology are discussed: top-level ontology (general concepts applicable across domains), domain ontology (specific to a particular domain with terminologies and relationships), and application ontology (generated from reference ontologies for specific applications). Meanwhile, classical search engines rely on keyword matching, leading to irrelevant and inaccurate results, while semantic searches aim to comprehend user intent and term context.

The paper is divided into several sections, detailing the efforts behind ontological search engines, intricate aspects of the Arabic language related to ontology, components of ontology, and the details of Ibri-CASOnto, including its development process and evaluation through both simple and complex queries.

The authors emphasize ontology's capability to enhance engine intelligence and its potential in the context of emerging web generations. Arabic language relevance is also noted, being a widely spoken Semitic language and one of the official languages of the United Nations.

Ibri-CASOnto's structure includes classes as the core components, with data individuals that instantiate these classes. Ontology implementation also involves determining representation languages (like OWL) and the use of triple-stores like Jena TDB for RDF storage and query support, alongside MySQL for keyword searching.

Indexing is performed using Lucene for the MySQL database and indexing for TDB on the Fuseki server. Semantic searching in Ibri-CASOnto is facilitated by Apache Jena Fuseki, and user interface design is stressed as a critical component of system effectiveness.

The paper concludes with an evaluation of the system's recall, precision, and accuracy, suggesting improvements to Ibri-CASOnto in future works.
