The transportation problem (TP) is concerned with moving goods cost-effectively from their origins to their destinations while adhering to demand and supply limits. The goal of TP is to determine the least total cost as the best solution. Originally developed by Hitchcock as part of linear programming, TP has applications in real-world issues, including worker assignment, task distribution, flow shop scheduling, and vehicle routing.

Optimal solutions for TP are derived from an initial basic feasible solution (IBFS), which is a necessary starting point. The closeness of IBFS to the optimal solution is crucial as it can reduce the number of iterations needed to reach the optimal solution. The focus of this research is to find an effective IBFS to minimize the total costs in TP.

The Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) is broadly recognized as a good starting point for an IBFS. VAM has received significant modifications from researchers who have also introduced methods to address complex transport problems involving multiple objectives and more intricate decision elements.

This paper is structured as follows: The mathematical basis of TP and the total opportunity cost matrix are described in sections 2 and 3. Section 4 gives an overview of existing methods, section 5 explains the total opportunity cost matrix method (TOCM-MT), and section 6 showcases numerical examples. Section 7 discusses the experimental results indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method, and section 8 provides the conclusion and future research directions.

The paper unders you selected various methods, including TOCM-MT, for finding IBFS and determines the usefulness of these methods through numerical examples and comparison.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that TOCM-MT outperforms other methods in achieving optimal solutions based on the numerical examples tested, obtaining a 77.42% success rate in finding optimal solutions. Conversely, traditional methods like VAM, JHM, and TDM1 show lower accuracy levels at 32.26%, 70.96%, and 45.16%, respectively.
