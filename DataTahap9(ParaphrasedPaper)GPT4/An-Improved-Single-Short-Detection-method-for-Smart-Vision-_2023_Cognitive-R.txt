To mitigate the risks to humans during water surface cleanup and enhance cleaning efficiency, autonomous cleaning robots could replace traditional manual methods. These robots are capable of reaching hazardous areas inaccessible to people, ensuring more comprehensive removal of plastic debris. With a high degree of automation, these robots can execute tasks like carrying, containing, removing, and steering materials autonomously, significantly enhancing cleaning productivity. To ensure the complete elimination of plastics and other waste, robots must adequately cover the water surface. Therefore, devising effective coverage cleaning paths is vital for guiding these robots. Techniques such as the boustrophedon cellular and line sweep-based decomposition algorithms have been utilized in the current system. Coverage area planning needs to adapt to more complex shapes and obstacle-filled environments beyond traditional methods. In optimizing coverage, the motion parameters of the robots, specifically their turn speeds and acceleration, are crucial as they are directly linked to cleaning efficiency.

This research introduces a new prototype of an autonomous robot designed to clean waste from water surfaces without the need for human aid. This robot is suitable for real-world water environments such as lakes, oceans, coastal areas, and rivers. We advocate for an innovative path planning technique to advance the robot's ability to clean effectively. Our proposed path planning method is tailored to navigate waterways with irregular perimeters and obstacles. In addition, to enhance precision, we utilized single shot detection (SSD) in the design.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews existing work on plastic waste removal robots and coverage path planning in water bodies; Section 3 details the proposed robot prototype and coverage area algorithm; Section 4 presents experimental results and discussions; and Section 5 concludes the study.

We examine unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), specifically, water garbage collection robots, which serve various functions including transportation, surveillance, and research. Researchers have designed a robot boat for autonomous transport across multiple urban waterways, modifying its size and shape for this purpose. Other studies have focused on USVs for tasks such as hydrographic surveys in nearshore shallow waters and oil spill management. Additionally, methodologies have been proposed for employing small USVs in structural health monitoring for building management.

Despite these innovations, there remain two significant challenges with current water surface cleaning robots. Firstly, many robots exhibit a low level of automation and lack detailed path planning, which is essential for comprehensive area cleaning. Secondly, although robots have been tested in simple water bodies, adapting them to complex, real-world environments remains a challenge.
