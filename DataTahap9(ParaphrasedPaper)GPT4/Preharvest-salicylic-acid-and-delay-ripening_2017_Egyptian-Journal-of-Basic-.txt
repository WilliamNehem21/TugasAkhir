The research paper focuses on the role of salicylic acid (SA), a naturally occurring plant growth regulator, in enhancing the quality of superior seedless grape berries. The investigation took place across two seasons, 2014 and 2015, examining how foliar application of SA impacted various physical and chemical attributes of the berries. When the soluble solid content of the berry juice reached an average of 17%, clusters were harvested and divided into two groups for different analyses. The first group (120 clusters) was used to study the changes in physical and chemical quality during a four-day shelf life, while the second group (100 clusters) underwent non-destructive evaluations like rachis browning, water loss, and berry shattering percentage. Analysis took place at Mansoura University's Faculty of Agriculture.

Quality assessments included measuring soluble solid content with a refractometer, titratable acidity as tartaric acid via titration, and calculating the SSC/TA ratio as a maturity indicator. Berry firmness and the force required for separation were recorded with a penetrometer, and weight loss, berry shattering, rachis browning, and color were also evaluated, with color analysis conducted using ImageJ software.

Rachis browning, a critical factor for freshness perception, showed that SA treatment at 4 mM significantly reduced browning and water loss compared to lower SA concentrations, potentially by inhibiting the activity of polyphenol oxidase enzymes. Membrane damage, indicated by increased electrolyte leakage, was alleviated by SA treatment, which also delayed respiration and ethylene production, contributing to better preservation of quality over the shelf life.

Statistical analysis, carried out using ANOVA and the Genstat software package, indicated that the SA treatment helped maintain fruit quality during storage. In summary, the paper suggests that SA is an effective and safe treatment to delay ripening and improve the shelf life and quality of superior seedless grape berries.
