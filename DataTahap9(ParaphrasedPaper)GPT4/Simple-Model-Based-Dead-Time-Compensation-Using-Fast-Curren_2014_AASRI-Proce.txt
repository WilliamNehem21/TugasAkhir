Some approaches address switch-related issues using additional detection devices that are inexpensive compared to fast current measurement tools and rapid A/D converters. Although affordable, these detectors can struggle to accurately identify current direction during switch transitions, especially in waveforms with multiple zero crossings within a single switch cycle.

A maximum current ripple can be determined using established formulas. A novel algorithm was developed to compute the actual current ripple for the purpose of dead time compensation, allowing for proper management of continuous currents with the use of slower current measurement techniques.
