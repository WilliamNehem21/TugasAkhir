The polarity of the initial P-wave in earthquake signals is a critical factor for accurately inferring the earthquake's focal mechanisms, especially for smaller tremors. Current manual practices to assess the polarity are not only laborious, but also susceptible to inaccuracies. "PolarCap," an automated deep learning solution employing an autoencoder framework, has been developed to enhance the determination of first-motion polarities from seismic waveforms. Training on over 130,000 labelled examples from the Italian Seismic Network and validation on 22,000 instances led to the selection of the best hyperparameter set, achieving a 98% accuracy rate on a separate test set of nearly 33,000 unseen traces. The model's robustness has been confirmed by outperforming previous methodologies in classifying both positive and negative first-motion polarities across diverse datasets.

Manual interpretation of P-wave polarities has shown inconsistencies, with previous research citing a 10-20% error rate, emphasizing the urgency for more reliable, automated systems due to the increasing volume of seismological data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to various seismological tasks such as event detection, phase picking, and magnitude estimation, demonstrating their effectiveness in determining first-motion polarities.

Our study emphasizes the use of a supervised autoencoder model, which solely concentrates on polarity classification given pre-determined P-arrival times. Training data has been augmented by shifting the timing of a portion of the traces to better accommodate inaccuracies in P-arrival time picking. Although our method does not address the emergence of P-wave onsets due to lack of relevant metadata, it incorporates data window selection and normalization techniques, and applies strategies like early stopping and learning rate adjustments to enhance model performance.

Overall, the Polarcap model has shown high reliability in matching human-assigned polarities and often surpassing them, reflecting its potential to reduce human error in polarity determination, although the model's performance can still be influenced by factors such as incorrect P-arrival picks, emergent arrivals, and indirectly, the earthquake's depth.
