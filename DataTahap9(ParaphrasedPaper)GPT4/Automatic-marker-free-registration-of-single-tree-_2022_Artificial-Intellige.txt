The paper discusses two principal methods of point-cloud registration: marker-based and marker-free. Marker-based systems use human-placed artificial markers that are detected in scans to align multiple point clouds, utilizing commercial software to calculate the transformation matrix. Though accurate, this method is often impractical in complicated settings and time-consuming.

The paper introduces an automatic marker-free registration method for 3D point clouds. This two-phase approach first projects 3D point clouds onto a sphere, creating 2D images that permit feature-point extraction and estimation of a coarse transformation matrix. Second, it refines the registration by estimating the centers of tree trunks and branches through point-cloud slicing and fitting methods, using these central points as tie references for precision adjustments.

This projection method involves creating a binary image where pixels are set based on whether they have corresponding scanning points. However, different scan perspectives can lead to varying projected images, presenting challenges in matching corresponding points. Moreover, point-cloud slices at different heights yield varied numbers of points, with lower layers mainly deriving from the stem and higher layers from branches. The team employs circle fitting for the stem and cylinder fitting for branching centers, using the geometric axes of these features to enhance alignment.

The study provides evidence of the method's feasibility and effectiveness in tree point cloud registration through tests on simulated and real trees, demonstrating its potential in forestry research and tree structure analysis without the need for artificial markers, offering a new approach to tree structure examination.
