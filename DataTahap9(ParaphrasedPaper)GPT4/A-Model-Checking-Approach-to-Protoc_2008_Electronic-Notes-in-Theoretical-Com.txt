The approach outlined in this paper bears resemblance to the discrete controller synthesis methods that use temporal logic and control-d systems, but there are key differences. The compared methodology is limited to generating controllers capable of merely preventing certain transitions in a system that could violate CTL (Computational Tree Logic) specifications. It does not offer solutions for managing liveness properties. In contrast, the approach introduced in this paper allows for more sophisticated control. Specifically, it can not only prevent certain system transitions, but also buffer events to be processed later, which is crucial for protocol communication.

An illustrative example provided, the SynConsumer, demonstrates a scenario where a producer component can generate multiple 8-bit data packets following each handshake, while the consumer (slave) can only handle one 8-bit data packet per handshake. The converter that is created through the new approach effectively manages the data exchange, ensuring that both components communicate without data loss.

The paper also discusses three case studies that are adaptations of established NuSMV examples. These were altered to exhibit a mismatch in the system. The 'size' mentioned in the results table for the last two cases pertains to the total size of the orchestrated system (the size of p1 combined with p2), highlighting the scope of the application for this approach.
