This academic paper discusses the challenges in version control systems (VCS) when it comes to managing conflicts that arise during concurrent file modifications. The authors describe a scenario with two users, u1 and u2, where u1 first transforms a file named "a" into "b" by applying a patch called "f." Then, u2 imports this change. Next, both users concurrently modify "b," resulting in two different file versions "c" and "d" via patches "g" and "h" respectively.

The paper acknowledges the issue that not all concurrent modifications (or coinitial morphisms) can be merged cleanly due to potential conflicts, such as both users editing the same line. Addressing these conflicts is a complex part of VCS development as evidenced by various proposed solutions like mergers, conflictors, and graphictors.

To better handle conflicts, the authors explore the free completion of a category "L" under pushouts, which they denote as category "P." This category includes all possible conflicting file versions and is constructed by applying the theory of presheaves. The "P" category results from completing "L," ensuring that it contains every conflict outcome. This comprehensive approach is based on abstract definitions and aims to underpin a VCS with properties derived from universal categorical principles.

The paper is structured into seven sections, with the latter parts providing a more detailed exploration of how the approach applies when dealing only with line insertions, giving examples, and expanding the framework to more complex situations involving multiple file types and operations.

The researchers use a simplified instance of the category "L" where objects are considered as integers to improve the readability of their methodology. The objects in "L" represent files with linearly ordered lines, while objects in "P" can be viewed as files with partially ordered lines, reflecting the outcome of conflicts.

In summary, the paper presents a categorical model for representing the states of files affected by conflicting patches. This model is finitely cocomplete, which means that any file modifications can be theoretically merged. The authors suggest that their approach can potentially adapt to more sophisticated scenarios involving multiple files, different file types, and the structure of repositories in future work. They believe that this methodology will enable a more rigorous and systematic approach to resolving conflicts in version control systems.
