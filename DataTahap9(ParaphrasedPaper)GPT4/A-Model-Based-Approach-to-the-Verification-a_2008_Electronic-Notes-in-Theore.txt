The paper introduces a method for verifying and adapting software components and services created with Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). It starts by proposing an abstract representation of WF workflows and formalizing the process of extracting Labelled Transition Systems (LTS) from these workflows. The paper then discusses the use of model checking for verification and existing model-based methods for adaptation. It further outlines how to generate a WF workflow from an adaptor protocol.

The field of software adaptation is highlighted as an area focused on reusing and customizing software entities to suit different systems' needs, thereby simplifying application development. However, the paper acknowledges that most adaptation approaches are disconnected from specific programming frameworks, with only a few studies looking at integration with common programming languages and platforms, such as COM/DCOM, BPEL, and SCA components.

The paper is structured with an overview of WF and defining abstract notations for WF workflows, providing an example involving WF components for an online computer sale, and formally extracting LTS from WF workflows. It then delves into verification and adaptation of WF components using model checking and model-based adaptation. Furthermore, it discusses how an adaptor LTS can be encoded back into a WF workflow and compares the contributions of this approach with existing methodologies.

The paper explains that WF is part of the .NET framework 3.0 and is supported by Visual Studio 2005 with workflows implemented in either Visual Basic or C#. The paper chooses C# as the programming language for implementation. Various WF activities, such as 'listen' and 'while', are described in the context of their roles within workflows.

The paper emphasizes that the generation of complete systems via parallel composition and subsequent reasoning through visual and model checking is efficient for detecting architectural issues. At the core of the process is the automatic generation of an adapter protocol, which is vital due to the complexity of manual derivation in some cases.

For encoding an adaptor LTS into a WF workflow, the paper offers guidelines rather than a formalized function, due to the complexity of preserving LTS behavior, especially when dealing with cycles within the LTS.

The paper also refers to related work, comparing its approach to others that have focused on similar problems but with different tools and methodologies. Specifically, it discusses how other research has used WF as an alternative to BPEL for creating not only web services but various software components, and highlights the automated support that both platforms provide for code generation.

Finally, the paper concludes by demonstrating the practical application of the proposed approach using a simple, realistic example. It positions the work as promising for the future of software adaptation, particularly within widely utilized implementation platforms like the .NET framework.
