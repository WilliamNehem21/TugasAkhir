The software CALA facilitates the analysis of two-dimensional transient temperature fields through the method of control volumes. It includes tools to create computational geometry for both vertical and horizontal cross-sections. This software allows for the visualization of temperature distribution on the surface of peripheral panels, which can be compared to thermographic images. The temperature fields calculated by the software also enable the assessment of thermal bridges in prefabricated peripheral panels, especially at connection points. Additionally, the software can compute the linear coefficient of thermal bridges using heat flux data.

A particular prefabricated peripheral panel with dimensions of 3550 x 1170 x 260 mm consists of a reinforced concrete structural part that is 160 mm thick, coupled with 50 mm of foam polystyrene insulation and a 50 mm thick external reinforced concrete layer. The vertical connections in this panel are facilitated by a vertical drain, while a 'tooth' system manages the horizontal connections. Contact joints are sealed with micropore rubber and an asphalt-based permanently flexible sealant. The computational model of this panel was created on a grid with 5 x 5 mm cells.

Experimental thermographic measurements revealed significant thermal bridges within the reinforced concrete framework known as MS-OB. The most critical thermal bridges were found in the horizontal and vertical connections of the prefabricated peripheral panels. In the CALA software, the panel connections were represented as a steady two-dimensional thermal field for simulation purposes. The resulting surface temperatures from the simulations were then compared with those obtained from thermographic measurements.

This research received funding from the Czech Republic's state budget allocated for specific research in universities through grant FAST-J-12-1781, issued by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports. It also benefited from financial support from the European Union's Operational Programme Research and Development for Innovations (grant number CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0097), as part of the activities of the ADMAZ regional center focusing on "Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies."
