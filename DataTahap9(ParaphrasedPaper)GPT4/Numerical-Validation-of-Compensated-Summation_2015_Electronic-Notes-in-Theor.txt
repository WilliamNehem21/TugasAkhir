Computational capabilities are consistently advancing, and there is an expectation to reach exascale levels of performance, which is capable of executing a quintillion (10^18) operations per second, within the next ten years. With each operation performed using floating-point arithmetic, there is a potential for rounding errors to occur. As computations become more complex and involve more operations, the likelihood of significant error accumulation increases. This can result in computed results that deviate considerably from their exact values.

To address the insufficiency in accuracy due to rounding errors, precision can be increased using compensated algorithms. These specific algorithms take advantage of the fact that rounding errors for basic operations like addition and multiplication can often be calculated exactly. Assuming the use of IEEE 754-2008 standard floating-point arithmetic, and with rounding to the nearest value, the resulting rounding error from an addition can be exactly determined. The methods that allow for the precise calculation of these rounding errors are known as error-free transformations (EFTs). Compensated algorithms that utilize EFTs can enhance the accuracy of computations.

This paper focuses on analyzing the impact of random rounding modes on a particular algorithm (referred to as Algorithm 3), which uses compensated summation based on the FastTwoSum algorithm, and examines its validation when using discrete stochastic arithmetic, even in the absence of valid EFTs due to directed rounding modes. The discussion also addresses the implications of using directed rounding without instability detection in summation algorithms, a practice that is generally not advised as it prevents the self-validation of digital stochastic arithmetic (DSA).

The findings demonstrate that compensated summation can still be validated under these constraints. Plans for future research include extending this analysis to other EFTs, such as TwoSum and TwoProduct, and exploring the possibility of validating compensated algorithms for other numerical operations like dot products and polynomial evaluations using the compensated Horner scheme within the framework of discrete stochastic arithmetic.
