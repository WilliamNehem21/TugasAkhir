In the study of program analysis through its runtime behavior, it is considered beneficial to amass and synthesize as much data as possible, particularly by merging multiple execution traces to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the program. This approach is reflected in various research efforts for specific objectives.

The technique proposed in the paper is not ideal for scenarios requiring formal verification and guarantees against software defects, as it relies on assumptions and produces only approximate models that can lead to incorrect model checking results, including false positives and negatives. Nevertheless, an approximate model can still be valuable when no complete understanding is available and can be refined by incorporating additional and more extensive traces.

The paper assumes the availability of program traces and only specifies a format for reading them using a proof-of-concept tool, which is not limited to any particular type of program. Section 3 lays out the theoretical framework for the merging algorithms, which are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 explores how to use the merged traces for model checking, while Section 6 provides practical experiments using an economic simulation. Section 7 reflects on the achievements and discusses remaining work.

The authors clarify that while other works focus on specific aspects, such as extracting program invariants or mining temporal logic formulae, their work instead generates state spaces that could facilitate similar analyses. Unlike other research that derives approximations from a formal system analysis, the authors' method is based on runtime traces.

The paper further discusses the complexities of a change-preserving trace merging method and the practical implementation of model checking using merged state spaces, translating them into a format suitable for an existing model checker like NuSMV.

The model checking limitation to a specific number of states is deemed reasonable given the limitations inherent in the accessible traces. The paper also describes how simulation variables, such as inflation, economic activity, and standard of living, are updated and result in trace files that can be merged.

The validity of answers from the model checking process is uncertain due to imperfect approximations, but such answers still offer valuable insights, guiding further investigation yet should not be considered definitive without additional analysis through extended traces or other verification methods.

In conclusion, while the paper emphasizes certain merging techniques, it acknowledges that these are not exclusive and different problems might require alternative methods. The gathered state space from trace merging can serve not just for model checking but also for extracting new behavioral insights using machine learning algorithms, identifying otherwise unknown pattern relationships.
