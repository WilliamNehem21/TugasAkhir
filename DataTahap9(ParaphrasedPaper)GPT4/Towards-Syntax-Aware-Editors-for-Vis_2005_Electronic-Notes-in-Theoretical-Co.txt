In this study, the authors present a method for creating syntax-aware visual language editors that incorporate incremental subsentence parsers into free-hand editors. By using LR-based parsing techniques adapted from visual languages and general incremental generalized LR parsing techniques from string languages, they enhance the editing experience through error recovery strategies and contextual prompts related to user input.

The resulting editors allow for syntax-aware free-hand editing of visual sentences. The parsers work incrementally, providing real-time feedback by identifying correct and incorrect subsentence structures and suggesting optimal ways to construct the visual sentences.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews existing approaches, Section 3 explains the xPG grammar formalism and subsentence parsing for visual languages, Section 4 shows how parsers can facilitate syntax error recovery and guide users during the editing process, and Section 5 discusses conclusions and future research directions.

The paper introduces the intelligent diagram metaphor, which allows an editor to parse diagrams on the fly, correct errors, and maintain geometric relationships among components using a constraint solver. This capability is exemplified by the PENGUINS environment.

Furthermore, they explore non-correcting error recovery strategies within the context of atomic relational grammars, as implemented in the VILPERT system using Java.

An example using xPG grammar to model a data flow diagram language is provided, along with the specifics of the parserâ€™s operations and stack management to handle ambiguities efficiently.

The authors describe a bi-directional parsing strategy, where forward parsers can interact with backward parsers during the reduction process to complete parsing efficiently.

The paper also details how editing support is enhanced by tracking relationships among grammar symbols and providing cues on what symbols to insert next during visual sentence construction.

In conclusion, this research introduces a practical approach for constructing visual language editors that are aware of syntax. This allows for advanced features like immediate parsing feedback, non-correcting error recovery, and contextual prompts that facilitate the user's drawing and editing process.
