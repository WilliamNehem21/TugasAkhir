The paper analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting medical sciences in the face of this crisis. Over the past couple of years, AI tools such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have advanced the interpretation of diagnostic images, patient monitoring, and sound analysis. The study reviews recent research involving ML, DL, and their integration with AI in various formats of data to address challenges posed by COVID-19. A comparison is made between studies solely utilizing ML or DL and those combining these technologies in the context of COVID-19. After a thorough assessment, the paper answers specific research questions and suggests future directions in the field, aiming to support researchers in developing effective AI-based applications for healthcare.

The pandemic has prompted governments worldwide to enforce strict lockdowns to maintain social distancing, limit the spread of the virus, and protect public health. As part of the response, the health sector is exploring technological solutions, including AI, to effectively manage the disease's spread and progression.

The paper discusses the application of various AI techniques to detect COVID-19, replacing traditional RT-PCR tests, and notes the extensive use of AI for patient management. It describes the methodology for selecting relevant studies and how these works were evaluated for their contributions to the field.

The authors note that despite previous reviews on AI and ML's role in managing COVID-19, few have looked at the combined use of ML, DL, and AI. This particular study expands on various data types used in research and includes the analysis of the latest research in addition to earlier studies.

The paper points out that while ML was initially used for geographic analysis of the virus spread, it now supports a range of objectives, including diagnostic processes through imaging and audio data. Moreover, integrating ML, DL, and AI techniques has led to better understanding and management of COVID-19, developing diagnostic methods that complement traditional RT-PCR testing.

Several research questions facilitate discussion on the advantages and challenges of using AI techniques and addressing the need for better evaluation methods, emphasizing the importance of recall over accuracy to prevent missing infected cases. The paper also outlines common challenges facing researchers and suggests the need for reliable remote diagnostic solutions.

In conclusion, the study examines the findings of 88 prior research works employing ML, DL, and combinations thereof, highlighting methodological approaches and comparing model performances. It acknowledges the potential for missing significant resources due to search term limitations during the research process.
