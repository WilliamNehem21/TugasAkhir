The contemporary industrial landscape is marked by stark competition, necessitating rapid adaptation to changing consumer demands and the need for shorter product lifecycles. Companies are pressured to respond briskly to maintain their competitive edge, creating a substantial challenge: to integrate adaptability and flexibility into mass production processes that can handle both high product variability and large volumes.

Historically, industry has always shown a keen interest in innovation, particularly methods that lead to cost-efficient revenue spikes, a concept often linked to industrial revolutions. The ongoing "fourth industrial revolution" or "Industry 4.0" is characterized by the application of advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTs) to revolutionize production systems.

However, despite fervent academic exploration into these technologies, their industrial adoption lags due to their complexity and the unique challenges of real-world environments. The primary issues being their relative immaturity and the need for comprehensive integration and validation in genuine industrial settings.

This paper scrutinizes literature on the application of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) in Advanced Manufacturing Systems (AMS), analyzing scientific contributions across various research domains. It assesses these contributions based on the level of system autonomy imparted, referring to a taxonomy created by Peres et al., through two key research questions: first, examining the scope of AIS applications within multiple research areas, and second, evaluating existing literature on the subject and the necessity for a systematic literature review that amalgamates these discussions.

Germany has proved a manufacturing powerhouse, leading the charge in innovative manufacturing technologies. This was formally recognized when the term "Industrie 4.0" was coined at Hannover Fair in 2011, with a detailed report following two years later. Various international initiatives mirror Germany's approach, recognizing the significance of AMS, like the U.S. Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition and China's Made in China 2025.

Industry 4.0 has sparked immense research interest, uniting practitioners and academics in Europe around a revolution that had been declared before it had even begun. This allowed stakeholders to actively shape the trajectory of Industry 4.0.

Modern AMTs are often about intertwining computational and physical processes, linked through billions of internet-connected objects. The overlapping of multiple technologies like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and others leads to terminological ambiguity within the AMS paradigm. Establishing a concrete definition is challenging because of the vastness of research in these areas, which often evolve into their own research domains.

The paper describes core AMTs foundational to the development of recent AMS. Technologies like MAS, cloud/edge computing, industrial robots, computational biology-inspired methods, and AIS for anomaly detection in CPS are detailed. Each represents an evolutionary step in the manufacturing industry, combining for a paradigm-shifting impact on production systems.

Despite clear opportunities, these technologies still face slow industrial adoption. Validation predominantly occurs in controlled environments, not reflecting the full complexity of real-world applications. The primary contribution of this study is the comprehensive analysis of AIS models applied to various AMS contexts, providing a thorough understanding of AIS's role across industrial scenarios.

In summary, while AIS technologies possess potential for profound effects on industry through adding robustness, adaptability, and autonomy, their practical application remains limited outside of academic research, pointing towards a need for further development and real-world integration to fully harness their benefits in advanced manufacturing systems.
