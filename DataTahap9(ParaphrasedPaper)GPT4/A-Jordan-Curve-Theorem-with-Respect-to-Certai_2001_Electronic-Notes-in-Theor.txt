The research paper discusses an alternative approach to the Khalimsky topology that is commonly used in computer graphics and image processing tasks. This alternative involves the use of specific closure operations, which are shown to have potential advantages over the traditional Khalimsky approach.

The paper goes on to explain that these closure operations, denoted as UR, possess characteristics making them closure operations on a set X. UR is considered idempotent—that is, applying it multiple times doesn't change the outcome—only if the space (X, UR) forms an Alexandroff topological space. However, UR does not generally exhibit additivity, which means that the union of closed sets might not be a closed set in (X, UR). Despite this limitation, the union of closed subsets is indeed closed.

Further, the paper identifies shortcomings in a theorem which had been anticipated to parallel the classical Jordan curve theorem—a foundational result in topology that asserts simple closed curves in the plane divide the plane into an interior and an exterior region. Specifically, the sets J referred to in theorem 3.9 are not, in general, simple closed curves in the space (Z2, VN), preventing a satisfactory analogy to the Jordan curve theorem. The authors commit to providing a criterion that would allow them to establish when a simple closed curve in their space does indeed divide the space into two components.

An example involving a digital plane is given where a triangle (ADE) behaves differently under the two topologies being compared. In the ternary digital plane, this triangle is analogous to a Jordan curve, but in the Khalimsky plane, it fails to meet the criteria of even a COTS-Jordan curve unless points A, B, C, and D are removed. By removing these points, the triangle in the Khalimsky plane can become a Jordan curve; however, this transformation would require altering the original shape of the triangle, resulting in deformation.

Overall, the paper suggests that their proposed closure operations could serve as viable alternatives in specific contexts related to computer graphics and image processing and provides insights into the conditions under which these operations behave in ways that are consistent with well-known topological theorems.
