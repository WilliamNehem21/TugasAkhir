This academic paper discusses the role of Cyber-Threat Intelligence (CTI) as a knowledge base that encompasses the context, behavior, implications, and measures taken against cyber attacks, with the goal of equipping organizations to make informed decisions regarding future threats in cyberspace. It places an emphasis on creating knowledge repositories and leveraging frameworks like the MITRE ATT&CK to understand attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and to attribute cyber actors to attack patterns.

This research proposes a feature extraction model called Similarity-Based Vector Representation (SimVer) to extract features from unstructured CTI reports and compare it with existing models like Word2Vec. By applying deep learning models to 238 CTI reports, the study seeks to attribute cyber threat actors based on their distinct attack patterns, since attackers find it difficult to change their tools and techniques.

The paper highlights the challenges in the field of CTI, such as the limited availability of reports due to privacy concerns, the unstructured nature of available data, and biased or unreliable reports. Furthermore, the research suggests that including additional features like target country, organization, and application can improve the cyber-threat attribution process.

Lastly, the paper calls for future work to focus on including behavioral features to enhance the attribution of cyber threat actors, though the availability and extraction of such data remain significant challenges.
