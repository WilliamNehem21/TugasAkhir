Recent advancements in developing textual case-based reasoning (TCBR) applications have brought forth an approach called Sophisticated Information Analysis (SOPHIA), which is noted for its ability to function independently of prior knowledge engineering, domain, or language constraints. SOPHIA employs a distributional document clustering method to create a robust knowledge discovery framework for retrieving cases.

This paper introduces improvements to the SOPHIA approach aimed at boosting retrieval efficiency and accuracy, ensuring that all search results are relevant to the user's query. These improvements involve automated classification of the case base before indexing and classification of the user's query before retrieval. The paper also establishes SOPHIA's domain and language independence by applying it to the Arabic language domain of Islamic jurisprudence.

TCBR is often applied to question-answering (QA) systems, where users receive answers to inquiries in natural language. SOPHIA, presented by Patterson et al., utilizes a distributional clustering technique based on conditional probability of terms within documents to discover key themes and organize cases into thematically clustered groups. This allows for efficient retrieval and meaningful similarity comparisons, even among cases using different terminology but addressing similar subjects.

Han et al. described a QA system with an interactive and introspective engine that ranks results based on keyword relationships, dynamically adjusting keyword weights according to user feedback. The CBR architecture is expanded to three layers for scalability and maintenance, splitting representation into feature, problem description, and answer levels.

Additionally, the paper explores the use of a taxonomy for capturing semantic knowledge beyond statistical methods. A novel CBR-specific disambiguation algorithm is proposed to guide the generation of this taxonomy.

The paper contrasts two search options: keyword search, which is independent of TCBR and relies on matching query terms to case base terms after stemming; and similar cases search, which uses TCBR and a divergence function to assign questions to clusters for similarity checks. The technical aspects of the experiments used Microsoft SQL Server Edition for database management and C# 2010 for form creation. Execution times varied, with the first experiment ranging from 19 to 30 seconds depending on cluster size, and the second experiment ranging from 2 to 3 seconds.
