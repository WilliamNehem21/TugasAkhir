The study investigated the anti-cancer effects of Polyphenon E (PE), a green tea polyphenol, encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) and its potential as a platform for cancer chemotherapy. The encapsulation of PE into CSNPs enhanced its anti-cancer activities compared to free PE. In mice treated with CSNPs loaded with PE, tumor cell proliferation was inhibited as evidenced by decreased levels of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and an increase in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The CSNPs-PE treatment induced a series of apoptotic and anti-survival signals within the tumor tissue, including the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and p53, activation of caspases 3, 8, 9, and CD95, and reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, the treatment suppressed angiogenesis by inhibiting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and CD31 expressions in tumor tissue.

The research paper also highlights the chemopreventive abilities of natural polyphenols found in dietary compounds like green tea which can induce apoptosis by targeting molecular pathways. PE, specifically, was shown to modify microRNA profiles in MCF-7 cells, promote apoptosis in bladder cancer cells, inhibit prostate cancer progression, and prevent chemically-induced carcinogenesis in renal cells.

CSNPs were prepared using ionotropic gelation, resulting in opalescent hydrogel nanoparticles (NPs). Their morphology and size were analyzed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The studyâ€™s methodology also included administering treatments to mice with Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells and analyzing the effects via flow cytometry and various molecular assessments to determine the levels of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and protein expression in tumor cells.

Results indicate that CSNPs-PE has a more substantial effect in reducing tumor growth and inducing cancer cell death compared to free PE, confirming the potential of polyphenol encapsulation in improving therapeutic outcomes for cancer treatment. This finding also resonates with previous research showing PE can induce cell death in lung and colon cancer cells. The paper suggests that PE's activity might involve inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and a caspase-independent cell death pathway in prostate cancer cells.

In summary, the encapsulation of PE in CSNPs provides a promising approach to cancer chemotherapy by enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy of polyphenols and offers new insights into the use of these natural compounds in nanochemotherapy and cancer prevention.
