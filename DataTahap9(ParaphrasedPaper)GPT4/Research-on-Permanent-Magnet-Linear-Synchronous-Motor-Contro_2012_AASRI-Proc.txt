The article discusses the utilization of gearboxes, chains, and screw couplings to achieve precise control in high-performance CNC machine tools. It particularly highlights the increasing use of linear motors, specifically permanent magnet synchronous linear motors (PMSLM), due to their ability to offer high precision control, superior dynamic performance, and the ease of changing speeds. These systems have garnered considerable interest among researchers both domestically and internationally.

To validate the PMSLM vector control system simulation, the researchers conducted an experiment using MATLAB 7.1 software, employing the ODE23tb algorithm with variable step size and error tolerances set to 0.001 for both relative and absolute errors. The parameters for the PMSLM included a phase resistance \( R = 3.2 \Omega \), an \( d \)-axis inductance \( L_d = 8 \ mH \), a \( q \)-axis inductance \( L_q = 8 \ mH \), and a specified permanent magnet flux.

The simulation focused on three critical performance indicators for AC servo control systems: rapidity, accuracy, and stability. Results demonstrated that when a speed command is issued, the PMSLM can quickly achieve the desired speed by adjusting the speed and current loops. The time domain response curves presented ideal performance, suggesting that the system can operate smoothly with excellent dynamic and static characteristics. The successful experiment not only confirmed the accuracy of the mathematical model for PMSLM but also substantiated the effectiveness of the control algorithm, providing insights for the design and fine-tuning of direct drive systems in the future.
