The academic paper discusses the study of essential oils' effects on human health, particularly focusing on rosemary essential oil and its impact on the nervous system, which has not been thoroughly researched despite its long use in aromatherapy. The study involved 20 healthy volunteers who inhaled rosemary essential oil, and several subjective feelings and objective autonomic nervous system indicators were monitored, including body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, in addition to EEG measurements to assess brain wave activity. The findings indicated that inhalation of rosemary essential oil led to increased blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and a sense of feeling refreshed, with EEG data suggesting a stimulating effect on the brain.

Further research measured the concentration of 1,8-cineole, a component of rosemary essential oil, in the blood, and correlated it with the efficacy of task performance. The results confirmed that inhalation of the essential oil improved task performance speed and accuracy, although mood effects were not substantially notable.

The paper details the statistical tests used in the analysis, including the Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, Chi-Square, and Student's t-tests, and mentions that data was collected in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using the Statistica 6.1 program.

Additionally, the research provided insights into how different essential oils might influence human behavior, such as lavender oil increasing trust and peppermint oil decreasing it, with implications for consumer behavior and decision-making.

The paper emphasizes the lack of comprehensive research within Ukraine regarding the behavioral effects of essential oils. The Ukrainian study adds to the global body of knowledge by confirming that rosemary essential oil can significantly enhance short-term image and numerical memory in individuals compared to a control group. This contributes to the understanding of cognitive function related to essential oils' effects.
