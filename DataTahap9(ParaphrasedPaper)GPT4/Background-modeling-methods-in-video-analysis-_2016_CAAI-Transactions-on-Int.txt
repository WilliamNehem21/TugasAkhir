In recent decades, researchers have developed numerous methods for background modeling to detect foreground objects in video. Typically, these methods initially construct a background model using early frames of a video and then compare subsequent frames against this model to identify foreground elements, updating the model as needed. These methods can be categorized as pixel-based, region-based, or hybrid, and further divided into parametric and non-parametric approaches.

One of the most notable pixel-based parametric techniques is the Gaussian model, which, among other methods, has been evaluated based on its performance under various conditions. The GMM algorithm, for instance, is particularly sensitive to changes in lighting but remains relatively stable under minor fluctuations in illumination by setting an appropriate threshold for pixel variation. To counter brightness changes, other models utilize different color spaces or combine long-term and short-term models for quick adaptation to scene changes.

In terms of handling dynamic backgrounds, approaches like GMM and SOBS use multimodal distributions to model pixel intensity, accommodating more complexity than unimodal models. Sample-based methods like ViBe and SaCon use a selective update strategy to manage lighting changes and integrate new or moved objects into the background model.

Region-based models often employ texture or other descriptors to handle dynamic backgrounds and lighting shifts effectively. For example, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) have proven useful in modeling textures in a scene.

Shadow detection within background modeling also poses challenges, with some models leveraging color variations and chromaticity coordinates to distinguish shadows from foreground objects. ViBe and SaCon demonstrate resilience to noise due to their method of sample selection and conservative update schemes.

The traditional GMM has its benefits but may not effectively model quickly changing backgrounds due to its dependency on the learning rate. As a solution, approaches like KDE have been developed to adapt rapidly to background changes.

The codebook algorithm excels in dynamic background modeling over extended periods without the constraints of parametric assumptions, although it can struggle if foreground and background colors are too similar.

Moreover, various algorithms like ViBe employ spatial consistency to maintain an accurate background model, while methods like PBAS take an adaptive approach to segment the foreground by adjusting parameters dynamically.

The evaluation of background modeling methods was done at the pixel level, with binary classification used to measure the accuracy of detecting foreground pixels. Metrics used to assess performance included recall, specificity, false positive rate, false negative rate, the percentage of wrong classifications, precision, and the F-measure.

The GMM, ViBe, and PBAS were among the eight background modeling methods evaluated in this study, with method performance tested without pre- or post-processing. Computational resources for each method were also documented.
