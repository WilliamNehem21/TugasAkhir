This academic paper discusses the complexity of decision-making when knowledge is imprecise or uncertain. Recognizing this challenge, the paper builds on multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods adapted for a fuzzy context, where information isn't black-and-white but rather involves degrees of uncertainty.

Focusing on the TOPSIS method, originally formulated by Hwang and Yoon, the paper extends it to accommodate intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which include degrees of membership, non-membership, and hesitation. This reflects a more nuanced approach to dealing with ambiguity in preferences. Using concepts from other researchers, including the construction theorem and a specific distance measure, the paper adapts TOPSIS for more realistic, complex situations.

The paper goes on to place importance on criteria by weighting them via an intuitionistic fuzzy entropy measure. The adapted TOPSIS method is then used to rank four organizations based on various important criteria. The rankings derived from this method are applied to a portfolio selection problem, demonstrating how they can inform financial decisions regarding risk and return.

The method, outlined step-by-step in the paper, uses a set of alternatives and selection criteria. It calculates the relative closeness of options to an ideal. The most suitable alternative, according to the adapted TOPSIS, is the one that most closely approximates this ideal while also being furthest from the least desirable conditions.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the concept of risk in investments, distinguishing between zero (or risk-free) and positive (or risky) assets. It breaks down risk into systematic risks, which are macro-economic in nature, and unsystematic risks that are specific to individual companies or events. The preferred investment would be one that manages these risks effectively according to the investor's criteria.

In summary, the research adapts a well-known decision-making technique to suit conditions of vagueness, applying it to financial decision-making scenarios to inform asset selection based on risk assessment and returns, and specifying the optimal choice as one that aligns closely with the ideal criteria defined.
