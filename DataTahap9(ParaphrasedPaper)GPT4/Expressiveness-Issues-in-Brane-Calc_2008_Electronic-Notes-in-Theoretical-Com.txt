The paper discusses two computational models, PEP and MBD, inspired by biological cellular processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis, membrane fusion, and fission. The PEP model uses primitives similar to endocytosis and exocytosis, with bitonality ensuring no mixing of inside and outside substances, except when externally wrapped membranes are brought in. Due to complexity, the primitives are narrowed to phagocytosis (engulfing one membrane) and pinocytosis (engulfing no membranes).

MBD's primitives come from ideas of membrane fusion (mate) and fission (mito), where to control fission, it utilizes budding (splitting one internal membrane) and dripping (splitting no internal membranes). The paper notes a complexity difference between MBD and PEP, evident in the capacity for PEP to model deterministic random access machines (RAMs), a feature not present in MBD.

The paper is structured with syntax and semantics of both calculi detailed, followed by the modeling of RAMs in PEP, a discussion on decidability of universal termination for MBD using well-structured transition systems, and the examination of non-deterministic/deterministic encoding of RAMs in MBD. The authors show that universal termination is decidable for MBD, while PEP can simulate deterministic RAMs. They identify an expressiveness gap between the two models, indicating PEP's higher capability. The paper also includes analyses on properties like control state maintainability and inevitability, and the potential application of these results in analyzing biological pathways, such as LDL cholesterol degradation.
