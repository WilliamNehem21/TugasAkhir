The paper discusses a tool designed to improve the understanding and debugging of the programming language Curry's lazy execution semantics. This tool automatically modifies the source code before running it to enable the evaluation of data structures or functions in a separate window. This step-by-step presentation aids beginners by showing the progress of executions distributed over multiple systems to avoid memory overload. Observation sessions can be saved and reloaded for debugging.

The `observe` function effectively acts like an identity for its argument but also produces a trail file as a side effect, which captures the evaluation of observed data. Different observations are distinguished by labels, and the observers are explicitly annotated for each type as opposed to type classes in Haskell. This explicit annotation allows using different observers for the same type for selective data structure masking.

Debugging larger programs involves an iterative process of adding and removing observers to locate bugs, and the tool supports this by facilitating the management of observers. It automates the derivation of observers for both user-defined and imported data types, which are automatically integrated into the program for observation purposes.

The paper further discusses `icode`, a component that allows users to select and observe subexpressions from function definitions, providing a tree representation of the entire program. `icode` also labels the observations to help users identify and manage them and supports distributed programming models using TCP communication for client/server architectures.

`icode` improves upon the original `coosy` tool by using a more efficient algorithm for updating observed values and handling non-deterministic computations in Curry. It sends events representing computation progress via a socket connection to trace windows for easy visualization.

Moreover, `icode` assists in tracking which parts of the program have executed, simplifying the debugging process by focusing on executed code. It offers a feature that marks executed lines and supports reverse and forward stepping through the marked code, similar to program slicing techniques.

The tool provides a user-friendly interface, adding annotations for the desired observations automatically and supporting large projects with multiple modules. It plans to improve the observation of polymorphic functions and serve as a platform for other development tools, utilizing meta-information for enhanced debugging capabilities.

The paper concludes by referencing previous work on a Haskell tracing tool, `Hat`, suggesting the possibility of future improvements.
