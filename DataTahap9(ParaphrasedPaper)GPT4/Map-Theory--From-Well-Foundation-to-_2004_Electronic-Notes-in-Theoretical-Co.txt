Here is the paraphrased abstract of the academic paper you've provided:

In Section 2, the paper offers a casual introduction to the models MTF and MTA, and their shared foundation, referred to as MT. In Sections 3, 4, and 5, the authors sequentially introduce sets of axioms and rules which facilitate the incorporation of propositional calculus, predicate calculus, and the ZFC set theory into MT, and subsequently MTF and MTA. Sections 6 and 7 focus on confirming the validity of FA within MTF and AFA within MTA. The final part, Section 8, addresses an unresolved issue related to an alternative axiom system for MTA.

Further details suggest that the model M eschews the classical Law of Excluded Middle, instead fulfilling a more robust version called Strong Quantum Non-Datur (SQND), as shown in Remark 2.10 and Definition 2.11.3.

When discussing set theory within the context of this model, certain axioms that ascertain the existence of specific sets – such as those stipulating the presence of the empty set or asserting the concept of infinity – are tied to respective terms within the model's own language, described as 'set constructors.' While a comprehensive catalog of these constructors exists in a referenced work, this paper provides just three essential illustrative examples.

Remark 5.2 indicates that the validity of the infinity axiom in MTF can be deduced from the MTF-Prim axiom. For MTA, it suggests that rather than using MTF-Prim, an alternative called MTA-Coprim was considered but ultimately the paper reverts to using an MTA-Infinity axiom due to issues proving the consistency of MTA-Coprim with the other existing MTA axioms. Finally, the paper proposes a brief discussion on the MTA-Coprim axiom initially intended for inclusion in MTA and elaborates on why it proved problematic in relation to the other MTA axioms, necessitating further examination in Section 8.
