This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting performance anomalies and identifying bottlenecks in cloud-based distributed applications through Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The method works in real-time and does not require prior knowledge of the application or application-level instrumentation. By leveraging the capabilities of an SDN controller, the algorithm collects data from network switches to compute performance metrics such as application response time, throughput, and per-tier session count, as well as network packet loss, delay, and available bandwidth per link.

By implementing a Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (MCSVM), the algorithm discerns whether performance issues stem from network-related problems like packet loss, delay, or bandwidth constraints or from issues at the end-hosts. This targeted monitoring approach focuses on relevant switch ports, reducing data collection volume and speeding up bottleneck identification. Once identified, the source of the bottleneck is reported to the administrator for remediation.

The paper is organized into sections. Section 2 reviews SDN technology and methods for application performance detection. Section 3 examines previous works on distributed application anomaly detection. Section 4 details the design of the proposed algorithm. Section 5 analyzes simulation results, and Section 6 offers conclusions.

The paper also discusses related work in the field, covering various monitoring techniques and their trade-offs, as well as several proposals that utilize SDN for more efficient and accurate monitoring and anomaly detection in data centers.

The proposed technique utilizes SVM to evaluate distributed application performance, establishing a dynamic baseline of normal behavior to identify deviations. Accurate performance classification avoids relying solely on problematic accuracy measures in imbalanced classification problems, by including precision and recall metrics.

The algorithm is designed to minimize monitoring overhead and reduce false alarms, affording real-time, informed management of the data center infrastructure without the need for pre-existing application information or modifications.

Future work aims to include additional data center metrics, particularly at the end-host level, test the approach on big data frameworks like MapReduce, and compare the efficiency of different machine learning models in the monitoring context.
