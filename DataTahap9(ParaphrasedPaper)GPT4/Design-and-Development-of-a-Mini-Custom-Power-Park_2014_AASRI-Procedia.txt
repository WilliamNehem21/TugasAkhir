This paper introduces an enhanced operation protocol for a custom power park (CPP) by incorporating a novel control algorithm for a series active filter. The CPP is a shared power distribution network designed to provide multiple customers, typically in an industrial setting, with higher quality and more reliable electricity at differentiated service levels and prices. A central feature of the improved CPP operation is the use of a GTO-based static transfer switch and both shunt and series active filters.

The shunt active filter functions to correct power quality issues by compensating for harmonics and providing reactive power support within the CPP. Conversely, the series active filter is responsible for managing voltage sags and swells and mitigating voltage harmonics using the newly designed control algorithm.

To validate its functionality, a complete simulation model of the CPP was created and tested using MATLAB/Simulink. The study found that traditional sources are often unable to supply varying levels of power quality required by modern demands, emphasizing the significance of a CPP in tailoring power delivery to multiple customers.

The paper elaborates on how the series active filter (SEAF) ensures voltage stability for critical (AAA) loads, especially when voltage falls below 90%, and how it absorbs extreme voltage levels up to a threshold. The SEAF is notably capable of providing full voltage support for a short duration when feeders' voltage drops below 60%, backing up loads until distributed generation (DG) or renewable energy sources (RES) are operational.

The transition from utility feed to DG/RES is expected to be quick, with synchronization achieved in a few seconds. Renewable energy sources, when connected via voltage or current source inverters, offer the promise of an almost immediate transition without delay.

The paper also discusses the speed of system isolation and switching, which depends on the voltage detection scheme employed, highlighting the use of an ABC to DQ0 transformation method. This process involves converting the measured voltage to the DQ0 axis, filtering out transients, and relaying the filtered signal to the CPP main controller for further action.

Finally, the document presents how the CPP maintains voltage levels for AAA loads during various system disturbances. Even when feeder voltage drops to 70% or spikes to 120%, or when harmonics are introduced, the series active filter efficiently maintains the desired voltage for the AAA loads, showcasing its robustness against voltage-related issues on the feeders.
