This paper introduces a Petri net model for handshake protocols which are forms of asynchronous communication methods emphasizing non-interference during transmission and are not affected by propagation delay. The authors propose a concept they term "handshake Petri net," which features a specialized external interface. They demonstrate that the observable quiescent traces produced by these nets align with the key principles of handshake protocols. Moreover, they establish that for any given handshake protocol, a corresponding Petri net can be constructed.

Asynchronous systems, mentioned in the paper, operate without a central clock, as opposed to synchronous systems, and they intend to prevent transmission and computational interferences that disrupt communication. Traditional graphical representations for asynchronous circuits were found insufficient, prompting the need for new models, such as the one proposed by Dan Ghica, which was designed to enhance hardware design languages rather than encapsulate all handshake behaviors.

Petri nets, the foundation of the proposed model, appropriately match the asynchronous nature of handshake communication protocols. Although existing models represent asynchronous features, they lacked a graphical formalization of delay-insensitivity and freedom from transmission interference, which this paper addresses through the concept of handshake Petri nets.

The paper defines handshake languages using traces and introduces handshake Petri nets, highlighting both deterministic and certain non-deterministic behaviors that can't be broken down into deterministic components. The interpretation between handshake Petri nets and languages is provided, proving that the representation is both correct and complete, with a specific focus on deterministic behaviors.

The researchers assume the reader's familiarity with Petri nets, focusing on "unsafe" Petri nets that allow multiple tokens in a single place, a necessary condition for their proposed models. They explain that their models may extend to infinite sizes, with potentially unlimited places and/or transitions.

The paper also discusses marked graphs, recognizing them as deterministic structures capable of modeling circuits constructed from channel, synchronization, and fork operations, with a historical significance in handshake protocols. However, they note that marked graphs don't cover all forms of deterministic behavior.

The authors suggest improvements to the graphical representations and propose a complete process calculus for handshake circuits, acknowledging the limited existing work in this area. They hint toward future research, potentially exploring data-exchange handshake languages and subclasses that offer finite representations of specific handshake language subsets.

Two technical concepts described are the definition of "complement" transitions within a handshake Petri net, and the claim that handshake deterministic behaviors (db) nets are receptive, meaning an input transition is always ready to activate due to its alternation with the corresponding output transition.

In conclusion, the paper covers the theoretical groundwork for handshake Petri nets in asynchronous communication systems, providing a detailed investigation of their behavior, determinism, and representation.
