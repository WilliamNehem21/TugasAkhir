The size of the population in a genetic algorithm (GA) is a crucial factor that significantly affects the ability to find an optimal solution within the search space. Previous research indicates that a larger population generally improves the chances of reaching the optimal solution. However, a large population is not beneficial when the search space is small. Even though an optimal population size has been suggested, keeping it static throughout the GA process can lead to increased time complexity and a more complicated path to convergence due to a higher number of generations required.

This paper introduces an adaptive population size GA, referred to as APOGA. It adjusts the population size dynamically at each iteration, expanding or contracting based on the algorithm's current performance. APOGA was benchmarked against a standard GA using different sizes of search spaces. The results highlight that APOGA consistently outperforms the standard GA across the board.

APOGA and the standard GA start with the same initial population, leading to similar performance in the early iterations. However, as iterations progress, APOGA demonstrates faster convergence due to its ability to adjust its population size, effectively fine-tuning the pool of chromosomes. The impressive results suggest that further testing of APOGA with various benchmark functions and comparison to other GA variants is warranted.
