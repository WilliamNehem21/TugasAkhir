Our research suggests a strategy for diminishing the number of peptides without antimicrobial properties that advance to in vitro testing. We argue that experts would benefit more from a machine learning model capable of generating a smaller number of viable solutions rather than one with higher accuracy but producing false positives with high confidence. Our methodology involves a logical conjunction operation between the predictions of the physical-chemistry model and encoding-based models to reduce the false positive rate (FPR), and findings show this combined prediction framework could significantly decrease the FPR in peptide discovery.

In the chemoinformatics field, to effectively differentiate between classes, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with an RBF kernel adjusts for data instances' distances when constructing an optimal hyperplane for separation. This model takes into account the scale of features, with one-hot encoded and binary encoded features being on comparable scales, while physical-chemical features require adjustment due to their varied ranges.

The SVM model is prominent for its capacity to manage binary classification by fitting a hyperplane that distinguishes classes, mainly because it uses the kernel trick to allow for separation in higher dimensions where it's not possible in lower dimensions. SVM is a preferred choice for AMP prediction due to its reputation for high performance in previous studies.

The applied models generate a precision-recall trade-off; the multi_comb_1 approach promotes precision by predicting fewer peptides as antimicrobial, ensuring higher true positive rates. Conversely, the add_comb_1 approach is less stringent, identifying more peptides as antimicrobial, but with increased false positives, thus boosting recall at the expense of precision. Similarly, combinations of the physico-chemical model and binary_encoding model into multi_comb_2 and add_comb_2 methods also adjust this balance between precision and recall.
