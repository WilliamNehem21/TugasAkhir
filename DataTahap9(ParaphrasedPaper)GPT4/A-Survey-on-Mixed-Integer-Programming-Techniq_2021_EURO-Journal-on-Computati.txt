In summary, the paper discusses the research and advancements in the field of bilevel optimization, which has its roots in leader-follower game theory initially conceptualized by von Stackelberg. Bilevel optimization has grown into a significant tool for modeling hierarchical decision-making processes, exhibiting broad application across sectors like energy and security.

The paper provides an overview of various uses of bilevel optimization and delves into specific types of these problems, including those with linear or convex lower-level problems, bilinear problems, and mixed-integer linear and non-linear optimization. Techniques and algorithms to solve these problems are reviewed, while interdiction problems in particular receive focused attention, addressing discrete and continuous interdiction as well as their assorted applications and algorithmic solutions.

The paper acknowledges the extensive literature on practical applications—that cannot be entirely covered in the review—but refers to detailed surveys by Dempe and Sinha et al. It also notes connections to statistics and machine learning, such as in hyper-parameter selection for statistical learning methods and evolutionary bilevel algorithms.

Key components of optimization problems are highlighted, such as the bilevel feasible region and complementarity conditions relevant for problem-solving. Various methods for handling bilevel problems are presented, including reformulations, decomposition techniques, and branched approaches tailored to these unique problems.

The paper also explores local methods for optimization, network pricing problems, and Stackelberg security games, addressing their complexities and proposing solution approaches. There is also a focus on value-function reformulation, interdiction problems, and their algorithms.

To conclude, the paper provides a broad yet detailed perspective on bilevel optimization, stressing its importance in academic and practical applications and indicating potential directions for future research within the field.
