In this academic paper, the problem of graph coloring is addressed with a focus on the total coloring conjecture (TCC). The paper provides a detailed classification of graphs that are fully resolved in terms of total coloring.

- All cases for graphs when `k = 2` have been resolved.
- The cases for `k = 3` and `k = 4` are also completely solved.
- Graphs in the column `2k + 1` are complete and of type 1, because the value `2k + 1` implies an odd number, therefore these graphs conform to type 1 characteristics.
- The column `2k + 2` has been fully solved.
- The TCC has been successfully demonstrated for the range of columns from `2k + 3` to `2k + 5`.
- The verification of the TCC holds for even values of `n`.
- Additionally, the conjecture is validated for `ck` graphs where `n = r(2k + 1) + k` and `r > 0`. This finding also confirms the TCC for certain specific values of odd `n`.
- The `ck` graphs, where `n = r(2k + 1)` and `r > 0`, are identified as type 1.

The complete graph `K_n` is type 1 when `n` is odd, which is indicated through the mathematical condition `n mod 2 = 1`. However, this characterization is not complete for cycle graphs because there exist cycle graphs that are conformable and yet are categorized as type 2, such as the graph `C7`.

The structure of the paper is laid out as follows:

- Section 2 defines various operations and operators which are then applied in Section 3 to establish a criterion for determining when the even power of a cycle graph is type 1.
- Section 4 introduces a method to decompose a power of a cycle graph into several smaller power cycle graphs.
- Section 5 concludes the paper while suggesting potential further research directions and practical uses for the methodologies introduced.

There are descriptions of matrix manipulations involved in the coloring process:

- Cells with highlighted colors indicate the starting vertex colors for the procedure.
- Different shades within the cells denote the vertex colors that require swapping.
- Description (d) pertains to the state of matrix `M` after the colors have been swapped.
- Description (e) refers to the state of matrix `M` after adding the colors of the cells that are present in `M` but not in `L`.
