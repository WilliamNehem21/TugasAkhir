The rest of this paper is structured in the following manner: Section 2 contains a review of pertinent literature. Section 3 presents the wavelet approach, along with methodologies for determining effective price correlation and causation. Descriptions of the dataset and the empirical findings are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 delves into the theoretical and methodological contributions of the study, along with its practical implications for scholars, policymakers, and industry experts. The paper concludes in Section 7.

Previous research has delved into the mechanisms of price discovery for future contracts of the same commodities across different exchanges, generally agreeing that markets with greater liquidity usually attract more trading, though traders may prioritize hedging effectiveness over liquidity (Silber, 1981). To examine if and how information is transferred between markets, Granger causality is often employed (Granger, 1969), along with cointegration techniques (Granger, 1981) and an error correction model (Engle and Granger, 1987) to expose the data-generating process of cointegration relationships. These methods are particularly useful to explore price discovery in the context of various agricultural commodities, drawing on the economic principle of the law of one price (Ardeni, 1989).

Note that in the context of this paper, 'US', 'CN', and 'Diff' signify the returns from U.S. and Chinese soybean futures and the price differences between them, respectively. 'D1' through 'D6' correspond to six different observation periods within the trading day.

The study finds that U.S. and Chinese soybean markets tend to show positive correlation with their price differences, suggesting that fluctuations in soybean prices in either the U.S. or Chinese markets tend to increase or decrease the spread between the two due to inherent connections. This underscores the significance of relative price levels in influencing returns in the U.S. soybean futures market, and similarly for Chinese soybean futures.

Additionally, after the imposition of tariffs and subsequent trade agreements, the U.S. soybean market became less responsive to price differences. With a significant uptick in U.S. soybean inventory during the trade war, its market became less price-sensitive. Conversely, the Chinese soybean prices began to correlate more with price differences, meaning increases in Chinese soybean prices did not necessarily cause U.S. prices to rise, thus widening the price disparity.

This study contributes methodologically by leveraging wavelet analysis to capture complex cyclical relationships and time-varying correlations that traditional cointegration and causality methods may overlook. It establishes the significance of price differences between countries in understanding soybean futures price discovery, in line with theories on market integration. The study also examines external factors like trade wars and public health crises to demonstrate wavelet analysis's utility in uncovering novel data science applications, therefore broadening the theoretical framework for the evolution of soybean futures price dynamics between major producers and consumers, and applying wavelets in this new context.

The paper used wavelet analysis to dissect the dynamic relationship between U.S. and Chinese soybean futures. Given China's significant increase in soybean imports and the rise in trading volumes in the Chinese soybean futures market, the study enriches the existing literature by elucidating price discovery dynamics between the U.S. and China in the crucial global soybean market.
