In the realm of healthcare and wellness, a surge of applications leveraging personal health records (PHRs) has emerged, granting patients command over their personal health information. Both patients and healthcare providers, including those focused on wellness, contribute data to PHRs. While the data enrich PHRs and support medical care, its reliability can be inconsistent, particularly when provided by patients or non-professional sources.

This paper introduces Hedaquin, a system aimed at offering healthcare professionals insights into the reliability of health data within PHRs. The system's trust mechanism reflects real-world trust-building practices and assesses data credibility by considering the provider's reputation and metadata from medical devices.

Unlike data held in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), PHR data can vary in quality due to the diverse medical wisdom of data contributors. By considering this, Hedaquin enables professionals to factor in data made by patients and wellness providers, leading to potential cost savings and enhanced quality of healthcare.

Quality evaluation of health data is subjective, hence Hedaquin employs a reputation system to indicate quality through the provider's reputation. This reputation score factors in the provider's credentials, user and peer ratings, and metadata from medical devices. To calculate reputation, Hedaquin adapts the Beta Reputation System, which also expresses the uncertainty of reputational assessments, thereby helping healthcare providers make more informed decisions.

Reputations are shaped by user interactions and follow specific functions that prioritize recent interactions and those relevant to the current medical context. Providers have reputations for both the accuracy of their measurements (functional reputation) and their trustworthiness in appraising others (recommendation reputation).

Additionally, the paper discusses methods for calculating aggregated ratings through comparison of near-simultaneous measurements from different sources, adjusting reputation based on the match of these data points.

Hedaquin positions itself as a tool to aggregate and interpret health data from both professional and non-professional sources, aiming to offer healthcare providers a nuanced understanding of data quality. This insight is provided with minimal overhead for users, advocating for an informed and effective use of health information in medical care, contributing to both reduced costs and improved outcomes.
