It is straightforward to show that a general 'a' can be simplified to 'i', and multiple arguments can be consolidated into one argument through the process of pairing. Furthermore, applicative processes can be simplified to semigroup operations, as demonstrated by the equation k(xy) = bx(ky) mod beta. Moreover, there exists an additional simplification that can be described as 'lambda i'.
