The "Confidentiality & Security Scheme Applied to the Urban P2P VANET Network" (CSP2P) has been designed to address performance and security issues faced by users with common interests in the Urban Peer-to-Peer VANET environment (UP2PVANET), enhancing the certification system and effectively protecting the network. It includes an intelligent cooperative detection system that utilizes homomorphic encryption to identify routing attacks. When CSP2P was integrated with the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, simulation results indicated its effectiveness, with a nearly 10% improvement in system performance across all conditions, particularly in detecting black hole attacks and reducing transmission delays.

Vehicle users in VANETs, due to mobility, often communicate with each other or with nodes on the P2P network to share resources like multimedia or e-books, leading to the formation of UP2PVANETs. CSP2P introduces a certification mechanism where a mobile proxy (MP) distributes certificates and private keys to vehicle user interface (VUI) nodes. These nodes are then able to re-sign and verify certificates using proxy re-signature cryptography.

The article is structured to first review current literature on video streaming over P2P and VANET networks, and existing privacy and security measures. It then details the application of the CSP2P video data replication model and outlines the replication algorithm. Following this, it provides a security analysis of CSP2P and reports on simulation results. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research.

Earlier work has suggested a strategic selection of rebroadcast nodes in VANETs for video streaming, introducing diffusion capacity (DC) as a metric to categorize vehicle nodes. This method showed improvements in streaming quality compared to other methods. Homomorphic encryption (HE), while not commonly used in VANETs, is also discussed with variations such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) methods applied inscribed data sorting and encryption optimizations using fast algorithms. Simplified FHE techniques have been devised to manage the complexity of cryptographic challenges effectively.

CSP2P focuses on the various elements within UP2PVANET, including the authentication of vehicle nodes and the protection of video data integrity and confidentiality. It uses proxy re-signature cryptography to efficiently manage certificates and their expiration. The scheme also examines transmission delays caused by black hole attacks and the necessary encryption and decryption, proposing methods to mitigate these delays and improve the average waiting time in node buffers.
