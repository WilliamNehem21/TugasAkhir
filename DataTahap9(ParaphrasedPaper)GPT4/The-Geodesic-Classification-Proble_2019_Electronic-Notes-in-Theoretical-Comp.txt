This paper introduces a new problem termed the Geodesic Classification (GC) problem, which is based on the concept of geodesic convexity as a means to generalize Euclidean convexity to graph structures. The authors offer an integer programming framework to tackle the GC problem and implement a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve it. The paper consists of computational experiments aimed at assessing the efficiency of this combinatorial optimization method and the accuracy of the classification system it provides.

The paper also delves into supervised learning, a method for predicting the behavior of unknown data by learning from a labeled dataset. This process involves two phases: training, where the system identifies patterns within the data that differentiate between classes, and then application, where the learned patterns are used to classify new, unseen objects.

A notable challenge in classification tasks is handling outliers, or misclassified objects, which can distort the pattern recognition process. The paper addresses this issue, highlighting the necessity to identify and exclude these outliers for precise results.

Technical details about the computational experiments include the usage of an Intel i7-7700 processor with 3.6 GHz, 8 cores, and 32 GB RAM, under a 64-bit Linux operating system. The algorithms are programmed in C++, with CPLEX 12.8 serving as the optimization solver. The approach includes the introduction of separation procedures into CPLEX's default branch-and-cut method.
