The phenomenon of blogging has become more intriguing when one considers the demographics of those who create blog posts and comments. According to Blogging.org data from 2012, roughly 60% of bloggers write as a hobby, without business or professional agendas, sharing thoughts on topics from politics and religion to general societal issues. Blogging's appeal can be attributed to its simplicity, low entry barriers, open content generation standards, and an unstructured writing approach. However, the key factors are people's desire to express themselves and the convenience of the platform, which have contributed to the expansive growth of the blogosphere.

This research paper examines an underexplored aspect of the blogosphere: its potential as a rich source for cross-cultural psychological and sociological studies. The paper outlines a computational analysis of blog text data intended for such inquiries. Section 2 details the motivations behind the study, Section 3 describes the computational methods employed, Section 4 discusses the data collection and its characteristics, and Section 5 details the experiments and their outcomes. The paper finishes by summarizing the key findings in Section 6.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a statistical method explained in the paper, which models documents as if they are composed of various topics. By assuming that there is a set number of topics shared across a collection of documents and that each document combines these topics in unique proportions, LDA seeks to uncover the thematic structure within the documents. Beyond LDA, the paper also mentions several other variations of topic modeling, such as Bayesian non-parametric topic models, dynamic topic models, and correlated topic models.
