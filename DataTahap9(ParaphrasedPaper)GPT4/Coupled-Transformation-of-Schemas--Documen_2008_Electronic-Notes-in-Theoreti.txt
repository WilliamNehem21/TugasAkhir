The paper discusses techniques for the automatic transformation of data types and their instances across different programming paradigms, like object models, relational schemas, and XML schemas. These transformations are particularly important for interoperability and persistence. The primary method involves transforming a nested type through a process called two-level transformation, where both type-level and value-level compositions drive the transformation.

A significant challenge in developing this framework is ensuring that from the type-level transformation, it is possible to derive value-level transformation functions that convert between the values of the types dynamicallyâ€”that is, without prior knowledge of the target type. The paper discusses ensuring these transformations are type-safe by linking the value-level transformations with type-level ones statically.

Additionally, the paper addresses post-processing of conversion functions to optimize their efficiency by reordering and fusing conversion steps. It also emphasizes adapting the constraints associated with data schemas when transformed.

The paper describes a framework that incorporates constraints similar to value conversion functions and queries, by embedding the constraints into type representations. It utilizes typed strategic term rewriting and data refinement theory to form a foundational framework for two-level transformation, ensuring that transformation steps, when composed at the type-level, lead to well-typed compositions at the value-level.

The paper compares the two-level transformation concept with lenses that define abstract views on a concrete representation, while two-level transformations derive a concrete representation from an abstract one. It covers related work in optimization of program transformations using fusion laws and discusses how constraints can be modeled as unary predicates to distinguish between valid and invalid data values.

The authors suggest future enhancements including handling more complex data type constructions like mutual recursive datatype definitions, inheritance, and parametric polymorphism to support a wider range of data formats. They also aim to cover different kinds of behavioral descriptions, like structure-shy queries or imperative programs with side effects, and the possibility of extending this methodology to the transformation of components and services, which could benefit web service evolution.
