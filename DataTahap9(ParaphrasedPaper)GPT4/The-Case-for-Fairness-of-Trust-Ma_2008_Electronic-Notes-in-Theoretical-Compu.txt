The paper presents an evaluation method for assessing fairness within trust management systems, provided agents' utilities are defined. Two practical case studies demonstrate its application, one focusing on a new reputation algorithm and the other examining resistance to discrimination of a simple one. Discussion then turns to fairness's role in trust.

Fairness in trust management systems requires definition and abstraction. The paper will show how reputation mechanisms can be assessed with fairness.

When users provide negative feedback despite disincentives, it suggests significant dissatisfaction. This feedback might be weighted more heavily, a concept known as negative feedback stressing.

The simulator design balances realism with simplicity, closely mimicking the reputation system and incorporating authentic user behavior regarding reputation consideration, feedback provision, and potential cheating.

Agents are divided into "honest" and "dishonest" sets with specific attributes. The server computes reputations and payoffs, the latter influenced by reputation efficacy; scarce feedback results in unreliable reputations and decreased honest agent payoffs. The simulator's effectiveness is verified.

A reputation algorithm with implicit and stressed negative feedback is tested with two feedback behaviors: perfect (always truthful) and poor (positive feedback more likely than negative). Parameters were informed by a Polish auction site's transaction data.

Monte Carlo simulations yield average payoffs and Gini coefficients (fairness measures), presenting results with 95% confidence intervals.

A case study looks at an open market with "old" agents often cheating "new" onesâ€”demonstrating fairness's impact on trust management system evaluations.

Fairness in trust management systems raises questions about its necessity and practical implementation. If perfect fairness were attainable, like in a closely monitored auction, trust management would only reflect fair actions. However, designing such ideal systems is complex.

Fairness could also emerge from individual agent conduct, with systems incentivizing fairness without central control or global information. Trust is also influenced by adherence to norms and values, enhancing agents' trustworthiness.

In summary, the paper argues for incorporating fairness into trust management evaluations, suggesting its importance in system design and the broader implications for trust as influenced by agents' principles and societal norms.
