This academic paper underscores the growing importance of safety cases in the certification of software, highlighting the essential role of models in gathering and integrating information to construct these safety cases. The paper proposes a vision for an ideal model-based safety case that incorporates both defect hypotheses and descriptions of potential failures, and from this vision, it identifies open research questions that need addressing.

Models are emphasized as the key in building safety cases, evolving from structured model reviews to the incorporation of formal verification methods for model analysis. Yet, there is a lack of standardized methodologies for creating these models, and questions remain regarding the models' sufficiency for capturing all the relevant safety concerns, including hazards, system failures, component faults, and the causal connections between them.

A safety case presents a comprehensive argument demonstrating the safety of a system, a challenging task due to the need to amalgamate diverse types of information. No single method can fully capture the multifaceted nature of safety; therefore, various techniques like formal verification, statistical testing, and process adherence must be collectively utilized to create a compelling argument.

The paper further details how the envisioned model-based safety case would work, outlining two constraints (C2 and C3) and four refined goals (G2 through G5) aimed at addressing defects, failures, and hazards, with the support of specific solutions (SN1 through SN4) and taking into consideration several contextual factors including failure characterizations and models of system behavior (C4) and environmental conditions (C5).

Model-based development has become increasingly standard in the creation of embedded control software. Such models detail the expected functionality and are used for various purposes, including in-the-loop testing and production-code generation, with code generation from models already a regular practice in some domains. The paper, by addressing these concepts, invites further research to refine the integration of models within safety cases in the pursuit of safer software systems.
