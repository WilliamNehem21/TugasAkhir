Recent research has shown a growing interest in developing AI social agents with complex behaviors capable of engaging in social interactions. One approach to building these behaviors is through the use of behavior trees, which can be structured as cognitive scripts. These scripts enable the behavior trees to evolve by learning from repeated enactments of behaviors or from similar actions. When behavior trees with similar contexts interact, they can learn from each other, resulting in trees that carry a broader range of experiences.

The main hurdle in this process is efficiently retrieving and identifying behavior trees that are contextually similar from a database full of diverse scripts since it is a computationally demanding task. This paper introduces an innovative application of the map-and-reduce technique for retrieving cognitive scripts quickly and with minimal computational resources.

The study addresses the challenge of creating a structured collection of cognitive scripts and how the map-and-reduce approach, enriched with semantic information, excels in identifying contextually similar cognitive scripts. This method is compared against other techniques, such as the one employed by Pharaoh which utilizes the least common parent (LCP) approach. The findings demonstrate that map-and-reduce achieves a high accuracy rate of 92.6% for script retrieval while remaining cost-effective.

Moreover, though previous research focused on machine learning and graph theory to enhance behavior tree learning directly from observations or past experiences, it typically assumed that the relevant behavior trees were already identified, with no need to search for similar ones. This research goes beyond existing methods by not only capturing user behaviors through sensors and modeling them with behavior trees but also by investigating methods to retrieve functionally similar behavior trees. This helps to facilitate further evolution and learning of new, unforeseen behaviors. Additionally, the paper outlines a scalable and efficient storage system for the used cognitive scripts, leveraging JSON files and textual information for commonly used words to underscore the agility of the retrieval process.
