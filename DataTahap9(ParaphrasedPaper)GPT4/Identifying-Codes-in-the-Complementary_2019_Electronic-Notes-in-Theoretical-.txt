The academic paper indicates that finding the smallest possible identifying codes for planar graphs, even with significant girth, is computationally challenging. Previous research has extensively explored exact numbers, density implications, and strong upper and lower bounds for a variety of special graphs. This notably includes those generated through product operations with basic components like grid structures. In this study, the authors focus on identifying codes within the complementary prism of cycles. This investigation builds on prior work that examined the concept of locating-domination within these types of graphs.
