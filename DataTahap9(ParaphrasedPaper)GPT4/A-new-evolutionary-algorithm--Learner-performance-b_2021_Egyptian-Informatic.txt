Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are categorized by their characteristics into population-based methods and single-point (trajectory-based) algorithms. Single-point algorithms, such as hill climbing, tabu search, and simulated annealing, manipulate only one solution per iteration. Population-based methods, like genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization, modify a group of solutions at once.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the inspiration behind the proposed algorithm. Section 3 details the features of genetic algorithms (GAs) incorporated into the new method. Section 4 presents the techniques and pseudocode relevant to the Local Best Position (LPB) operators. Section 5 compares results on benchmark tests and a real-world problem, and Section 6 concludes the study and suggests future research avenues.

The transition from high school to college learning can be improved through specific strategies, identifying strong learners by behaviors such as interest level, deep processing, and self-study, with high creativity also signifying strength.

The proposed algorithm selects individuals from a population, placing them into sub-populations based on fitness. This selection method prevents premature convergence to local optima. Group work and mutual assistance, coupled with metacognition and interaction (modeled as mutation and crossover), further enhance individual improvement.

Genetic operators mimic gene heredity in producing new individuals. Crossover combines parts of two individuals to form offspring, while mutation introduces random changes to prevent gene loss and introduce new genetic variants.

The LPB algorithm has demonstrated faster convergence and optimization than some existing algorithms on traditional benchmark functions due to its subset selection approach. When tested on the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP), which involves assigning tasks to workers efficiently, the paper's method was applied to assign court cases to judicial teams, optimizing workload distribution.

This metaheuristic, inspired by the academic transition to college and the consequent evolution in study behaviors, balances exploitation and exploration phases, grouping individuals by performance metrics like GPA and enhancing skills through simulated learning behaviors.

The paper concludes that the proposed algorithm is effective, particularly in real-world NP-hard problems, and suggests larger combinatorial optimization issues as possible areas for future application and research by scholars in various fields.
