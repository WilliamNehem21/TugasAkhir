The paper discusses the importance of efficiently managing updates between informal and formal representations of mathematical logic without the need to completely transform entire documents. Directly reprocessing the entire document every time a change is made could result in the loss of the original natural language text and reset the proof assistance system to a more basic level. An example given is the need to parallelly apply any developments, such as calculus operations, to the updated traditional document. It mentions XML-RPC, a simple protocol that uses XML for encoding calls and HTTP for transportation, with a concise two-page description available online.

The authors propose a neutral formal representation language for mathematical content, independent of any specific logic or calculus, allowing for the representation of various concepts and the ability to cope with underspecifications. This language is particularly suitable for representing proofs composed naturally by humans and differs from the MathLang project, which prioritizes the analysis of abstract representations through type checking and does not entirely bridge the gap between theorem provers and mathematical assistance tools.

Lastly, the paper describes an action execution mechanism that takes evaluated arguments such as the session name, action identifier, and a list of name-value pairs. This mechanism returns a list containing updates for the current menu, the document, a custom response, or an error message when executed.
