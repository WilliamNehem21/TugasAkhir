The paper discusses the complications and limitations associated with using top-down parsers for source-to-source transformations, specifically when dealing with grammars that contain left recursion. Top-down parsers require grammars to be free of left recursion, but transforming grammars to eliminate left recursion often results in less readable versions, which complicates the user's understanding and maintenance of the original semantics.

The paper focuses on how to manage the migration of semantic rules when a grammar is altered to remove left recursion. It presents an approach that allows for automatic migration of the semantic rules alongside the grammar transformation, enabling developers to continue using the original semantic rules even when modifying the grammar to fit the requirements of top-down parsing tools.

It highlights the necessity of this transformation in various scenarios beyond compiler construction, including language development, prototyping, and software maintenance. The issues outlined include reduced readability, impacts on semantics when syntax is altered to meet technical constraints, and the reusability of existing semantic rules written for the original left-recursive grammar.

The paper is structured to first recap the concept of attribute grammars and semantics. Then, using an example of arithmetic expressions, it details the algorithm for left recursion removal and the associated migration of semantic rules. The paper also provides justification for the transformation and discusses other types of attribute grammars, practical experiences with the approach, related work, and concludes by summarizing the paper's contributions.

The presented approach is implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype using the TXL language transformation tool. The paper acknowledges challenges with the method, such as increased numbers of attributes, the introduction of extra copy rules, and potential time overhead during tool development. Adapting semantic rules for each new tool construction, especially in interpretive environments like Prolog, can be cumbersome.

This academic contribution aims to aid in simpler, more accurate grammar transformations where the semantics of the original language are preserved and can be employed within the new, non-left-recursive grammar required by top-down parsing tools.
