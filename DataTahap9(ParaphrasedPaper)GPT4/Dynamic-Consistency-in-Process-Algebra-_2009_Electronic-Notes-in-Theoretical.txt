The paper discusses a method for modeling collaboration among software components called the Coordination Modeling Language (CML) paradigm, which uses dynamic constraints to establish how components interact. It outlines a way to consistently define the behavior of components at different abstraction levels. To support automated checking of these models' consistency and correctness (verification), the paper offers a technique to translate CML into a form of process algebra. It gives specific examples, describes a step-by-step method to convert CML into the Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP), and presents verification outcomes using the mCRL2 toolset.

Additionally, the paper references other approaches that connect software architecture with automated verification, like the use of Unified Modeling Language (UML) with Rebeca, Promela, and the Spin model checker or UML with Object-Z and Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to the FDR model-checker. It also touches on the use of process algebra in prototyping, specifically referencing the use of Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) within the TITAN framework for aspect-oriented software engineering.

The paper's structure is outlined as follows: Section 2 introduces the CML paradigm alongside two illustrative examples. Section 3 gives a brief overview of process algebra. A detailed description of how to translate CML models into ACP is presented in Section 4, with a general translation method discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.

The key principles of the CML are outlined with the help of two running examples, and the way in which dynamics of collaboration among components is accounted for in CML is detailed. The paper also proposes a UML-style diagram to help visualize the interactions between components.

A comparison is made between deterministic and non-deterministic protocols, emphasizing how CML can represent simultaneous events and communication between processes. It explains how ACP's mechanisms for action synchronization can effectively represent the dynamic constraints in CML.

For the verification of CML models, the paper uses the mCRL2 toolset, which is built upon ACP principles. The results from the verification process confirm that the translated CML models into ACP are correct, and the translation process itself gives the models a formal semantics. The experiments confirm that it's possible to apply various verification techniques to process algebra specifications, aiding in the analysis of the correctness of CML models.
