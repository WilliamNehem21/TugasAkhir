The paper introduces a thermomagnetic motor prototype, which is developed from a thermal-magnetic coupled dynamic model that uses a ferromagnetic material operating near its Curie temperature. This motor integrates both magnetic and thermal attributes, particularly magnetic permeability and thermal conductivity, to function, and considers the influences of thermal conductivity, convection, and advection on thermal processes. It also provides an analytical formula that correlates the generated torque to the magnetic, thermal, and geometric parameters of the motor. 

A practical motor design based on the theoretical model is proposed and its performance is numerically simulated. The prototype motor was built, using gadolinium for its rotor, to enable experimental evaluation.

The paper posits the significance of alternative energy sources due to rising energy demands. It argues that a thermomagnetic motor, which can spin continuously and yield useful mechanical output, could be connected to an electric generator for electricity generation. This Curie motor functions by transforming thermal energy straight into kinetic energy, where the motive force arises from a difference in thermal permeability in two regions of the rotor created by heating. This contrast in permeability is amplified when one side of the rotor is heated above the Curie temperature and the other side remains below it, and if positioned within a magnetic field, this can generate a continuous driving force, assuming the motor maintains these temperatures.

Traditional ferromagnetic materials are unsuitable for such motors because they have high Curie temperatures, leading to poor performance in experimental trials. These trials typically show limited speed and torque, demonstrating a reciprocating motion rather than continuous rotation.

This design aims to maximize thermal coupling by enhancing the contact area between the rotor and the heat sources. The rotor is comprised of several tubes arranged circumferentially, which serve dual functions: housing the ferromagnetic material that transitions during heating and cooling, and optimizing heat exchange.

The machine's rotor is constructed by filling the tubes with gadolinium powder. The heating system devised generates distinct hot and cold regions, and two measurements are made: the torque at standstill in relation to heat flow, and an analysis of the acceleration curve.

Overall, the paper details the concept and mathematical foundation of the Curie motor, explaining how temperature differences are crucial for torque generation and are influenced by thermal conduction and advection within the rotor. The paper reports that the motor is capable of sustained rotation and significant torque generation, offering experimental evidence that validates the theory behind its design.
