We propose a universal approach for analyzing security protocols that is not limited to any specific modeling formalism or assumptions about the intruder's capabilities. This methodology can be applied to various representational systems such as multiset rewriting and process algebras as well as different intruder models, including the Dolev-Yao model. Our findings support the formal use of the Alice & Bob notation in security protocol analysis tools, including those dealing with message forwarding and conditional termination.

Moreover, we don't delve into this here, but our work lays the groundwork for creating protocol implementations from Alice & Bob descriptions that include necessary checks for execution viability and conditions for early protocol termination.

Dealing with protocol commitments, we explain a scenario in which participant B receives a piece known as N1 and must halt the protocol if N1 doesn't match a previously stored value, without even finishing the current communication sequence. This challenge of maintaining commitment integrity is typical in security protocols.

We also discuss the relationship between two concepts, close(s) and synth(analyze(s)), explaining that in specific cases where only atomic keys are considered, they equate. Generally, however, there's a notable distinction, with the former containing a more extensive set of messages.

Our analysis disregards the messages sent by a principal X, justifiably, as X doesnâ€™t learn by sending messages. Nonetheless, we assume X has the information needed to compose these outgoing messages, a presumption typically implicit in protocol evaluations but made explicit in our framework.

We also clarify that atomic messages are inherently transparent and therefore any collection exclusively containing these messages doesn't involve any opaque elements. Based on this, we conclude that operations on such a set will also lack opaque components, ensuring transparency throughout.

Lastly, we highlight that, in specific scenarios, only message forwarding is necessary. The meticulous definition of forwarding is further explained by referencing relevant propositions, emphasizing that any opaque message component sent by a principal must be a part of an opaque message they previously received.
