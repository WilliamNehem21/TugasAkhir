Topic detection is the process of identifying the main themes within a collection of text documents. Among various techniques, one approach is the use of clustering, particularly methods that view the central points of clusters (centroids) as the topics themselves. This clustering strategy is advantageous because it can manage data that includes negative values and can be paired with more comprehensive representation learning methods.

This paper introduces a deep learning-augmented topic detection method using fuzzy c-means clustering in conjunction with deep autoencoders. The proposed method involves transforming the text data into a reduced-dimensional space using singular value decomposition and then applying k-means clustering in this space to identify topics. These topics are then projected back into the original space.

Fuzzy c-means clustering is favorable as it allows for soft clustering where data points can belong to multiple clusters, and therefore, potentially relate to multiple topics. The combined method of fuzzy c-means with latent semantic analysis (eigenspace-based fuzzy c-means) has shown potential, falling in coherence scores between nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), both standard topic detection methods.

The study aims to improve topic detection with deep learning by integrating a deep autoencoder-based fuzzy c-means algorithm. The autoencoder's encoder reduces the data to a lower-dimensional representation, then fuzzy c-means clusters it to identify topic centroids, and finally, the autoencoder's decoder reconstructs the topics in the original representation space. This approach demonstrates better performance in simulations, achieving coherence scores that are competitive with or surpass those of NMF and LDA.

To handle high-dimensional data in the era of big data, two previous approaches have been used for fuzzy c-means: kernel methods for implicit feature enhancement, and explicit data transformations like random projection. Combining deep neural networks with unsupervised clustering is an area of active research. Traditional methods often use hard clustering, but this study focuses on improving the performance of fuzzy clustering with deep learning, resulting in a more effective representation for noisy textual data.

The paper discusses a two-step optimization approach iterated until a specified stopping criterion is reached, detailing the fuzzy c-means algorithm. The method starts by initializing cluster centroids with the best centroids from multiple k-means runs, proceeding without dataset-specific tuning for deep autoencoders.

Simulations demonstrate that the deep autoencoder-based fuzzy c-means method achieves better mean coherence scores compared to other approaches, making it more effective for topic detection. The study underscores the potential of combining deep learning with fuzzy clustering to handle complex and noisy text data for topic detection, offering a promising new direction for research in this field.
