In an effort to gain new perspectives, the researchers examined a specific diagram within the framework of concrete categories. This examination yielded several insights:

1. It enabled the definition of functional bisimulation in the concrete category of prefix orders, using partial orders as a foundational category.
2. The subcategory of paths was naturally selected as the subcategory of embeddings.
3. The existence of cospans composed of embedding-open maps matched with branching bisimulation in cases where prefix orders represent runs created by labeled transition systems.
4. This reinterpretation introduced a syntactic and semantic dimension where morphisms in the concrete (base) category represent concrete (theoretical) implementations or observations, respectively.

On a theoretical level, objects in the model category (M) are seen as concrete behavioral models, whereas objects in the semantic category (S) are viewed as semantic models of behavior. A morphism from A to B in M indicates the actual implementation of B's specification by A's behavior. Conversely, a morphism from C to D in S indicates how C's behavior is an observable subset of D's behavior.

The researchers also explored the potential for defining a subcategory of path-extensions using embeddings. This exploration was reinforced when they noticed the resemblance between the definition of P-open maps and P-injective objects. Such objects are absolute retracts if they are injective in any category with sufficient injective objects.

This approach also extended to transfinite executions, incorporating Zeno-points and other limit behaviors, thus generalizing solutions to broader issues in the study of timed and hybrid systems. The paper further points to slight differences from previous definitions that did not consider Zeno-choices, yet acknowledges their alignment with labeled transition systems' execution models.

The paper also highlights the observation that while an order-preserving diagonal could be found for a particular square configuration, the existence of a history-preserving diagonal was not possible. This discrepancy prompted the exploration of a concrete category theory approach to bisimulation.

Subsequently, a categorical approach to defining bisimulation via cospans was devised, using prefix orders as a concrete category elaborated upon partial orders.

Philosophically speaking, using a concrete category to model behavior necessitates distinguishing between implementable and observable behaviors, with an assumption that all implementations are observable. The theorem therein states that x is bisimilar to y if any extension of x that incorporates additional behavior of y is already observable in x, albeit potentially implemented differently.

The next step includes examining split faithful functors over the prefix order category to discern relevant embeddings. This may unveil a more general theory, such as identifying how executions in a category of syntactic computational models form a prefix order. Here, implementations map to history-preserving maps in the prefix order category and to order-preserving maps in the partial order category. Observations come from the order-preserving maps, while bisimulation definitions for the models derive from open maps in the concrete category over partial orders. The anticipation of a forgetful functor splitting over the prefix order category allows for insights into bisimilarity of models.

Lastly, the paper suggests that bisimilarity in the syntactic computational model category is weaker than in the prefix order category due to fewer embeddings, meaning that two models are bisimilar if they are so in the prefix order category. However, this is not always reciprocated, for instance, because open maps in the prefix order category account for Zeno behavior, which might not be represented in the model category.
