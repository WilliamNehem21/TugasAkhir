The study aimed to explore the production of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) by bacterial strains isolated from sediment near mangroves in Ras Mohamed, Red Sea Coast, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. Out of 29 isolated strains, only two produced EPSs, with the highest yield coming from isolate no. 12, resembling Bacillus altitudinis. This EPS was a heteropolysaccharide consisting of mannuronic acid, glucose, and sulphate. Its molecular weight was determined through gel permeation chromatography.

EPSs are high molecular weight polymers secreted by various microorganisms and exhibit a broad structural diversity with unique biological properties. These naturally occurring polymers are highly valued for their biotechnological potential. In marine environments, where stresses like temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability vary, EPSs play essential protective roles for microbial communities.

Given the resistance of human pathogens to commercial antimicrobials due to misuse and undesirable side effects of some antibiotics, the pursuit of new antimicrobial alternatives is necessary.

The marine sediment sampling for this study involved serial dilution in sterile water and plating on a specific growth medium. To quantify periodate consumption, absorbance changes were measured, and formic acid products were monitored using phenol-sulphuric acid. The solutions underwent dialysis, reduction with NaBH4, and reaction cessation with acetic acid. The purified polyalcohol product was hydrolyzed to analyze sugars and sugar alcohols via HPLC.

Results showed that the EPS did not contain protein as indicated by a negative Bradford test. HPLC analysis of monosaccharides in the EPS found it to be composed of mannuronic acid and glucose in a 1:2.2 molar ratio. Chemical analysis showed that the EPS contained 14.26% uronic acid and 15.47% sulphate.

The study refers to work by Hasui et al. (1996), which detailed the structure of a lactate-associated galactan sulfate produced by Gymnodinium sp.A3, as reported in a conference publication on harmful and toxic algal blooms.
