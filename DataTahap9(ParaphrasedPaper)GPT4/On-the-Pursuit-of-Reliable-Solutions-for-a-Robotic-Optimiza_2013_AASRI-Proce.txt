In the academic paper by Berger et al., the authors address the importance of accuracy in robotic manipulators, which are highly valued in industrial settings for their precision. They recognize that achieving high accuracy necessitates the control or measurement of every potential source of error that could impact the robot's end effector positioning. One of the most significant error sources identified is joint clearance, which introduces additional, unwanted movement between connected components and can significantly affect the mechanismâ€™s performance.

The paper critiques existing methods for calculating and assessing errors caused by joint clearances, noting that while several approaches have been put forward, they often lack focus on the reliability of their predictions, which is critical for accurate pose error estimation. To address this gap, the authors propose a novel method that combines constraint programming with interval analysis, using a branch-and-bound algorithm to firmly bound the pose errors within the potential range of clearance values.

The authors claim their approach provides more reliable solutions compared to well-known solvers like GAMS/BARON and ECLiPSe, citing experimental results that indicate their implementation is typically more rapid and outperforms these counterparts. This improved performance is particularly pronounced for problems with just two or three joints, where their algorithm can solve the problems faster, as high precision is not necessary, making the search process less demanding.

It's emphasized that speed is not the primary measure of success; instead, the reliability of the solution is paramount. The authors have discovered through real-world testing with RealPaver that solutions generated by BARON can sometimes be infeasible. They provide an example where BARON incorrectly calculates a solution, revealing the potential for such solvers to produce unreliable results.

Looking forward, the paper suggests that future work could explore more effective filtering strategies, which could quicken solution convergence and better manage the exponential increase in solution space. Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate the reliability issues with BARON in greater detail, as this problem might also affect other solvers.
