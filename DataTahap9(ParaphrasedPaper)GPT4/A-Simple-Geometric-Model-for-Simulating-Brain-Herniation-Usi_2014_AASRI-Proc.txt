The human brain resides in the skull and is made up of two main parts: the larger cerebral hemispheres and the smaller cerebellum, which are partially divided by the falx cerebri and the tentorium cerebelli, respectively. The space within the skull, the intracranial space (ICS), is split into upper (supratentorial space, STS) and lower (infratentorial space, ITS) sections by the tentorium. The brain is largely symmetrical, and the falx cerebri is often used as a reference for the intact mid-sagittal plane (IMSP). The cerebral hemispheres are joined at the subfalcine space (SFS), and there's a tentorial notch (TI), an opening in the center of the tentorium, with anterior, middle, and posterior sections; the middle section houses the midbrain.

Previous research has introduced methods for measuring midline shift (MLS) in the brain, a shift that can occur due to conditions like herniation, but no biomechanical models have been made to simulate brain herniation. This study aims to develop a simple three-dimensional model to simulate such brain deformations, using CT images from patients without intracranial issues as a base.

The study used CT scans of 512x512 pixels, with each pixel representing a 0.49 mm area. CT images' density was adjusted to study brain tissue while excluding the possibility of intracranial hematoma. The brain's intracranial region was separated from the extracranial one using a special algorithm, and the boundary between STS and ITS had to be manually labeled due to the thinness and similar density of the cerebellar tentorium to brain tissue.

The volume of brain regions was calculated using the Cavalieri principle and planimetry, which involves multiplying the area of a slice by its thickness and then adding the volumes of all slices. Measurements of the STS included its volume, length, width, and height, as well as the sizes of the SFS and TI. The midbrain was manually identified by experts and its dimensions were recorded.

A simplified model of the STS was created based on the obtained measurements, resembling the upper half of a sphere with a 160 mm diameter. This model's volume was slightly smaller than the average STS volume recorded, especially in women. The dimensions differed from real measurements, with length and width being larger and height being smaller in the model.

The ratio of ITS volume to the overall intracranial volume (ICV) is particularly significant in cases like Chiari malformation type I. However, in this simplified model, variations in shape and sex differences were not accounted for. Since CT scans are supposed to be parallel to the orbitomeatal (OM) line, gantry tilt from patient positioning was considered, but no relationship was found between the tilt and the measurements.

The volume of the STS and ITS correlates with the overall ICV, with males typically having larger brains. The simplified model presented in this study generally fits the average measurements but may not apply to patients with very large ICVs.
