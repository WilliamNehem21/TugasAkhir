Our focus on prefixes does not dispute the inherent non-monotonic nature of fairmerge with regard to the ordering of traces based on their prefixes. Our findings challenge the traditional view that clinging to non-monotonicity means fairness is unmanageable within denotational semantics. Our methodology shows that the non-monotonicity concern is actually not imperative for our purposes.

The concept of fair interleaving has been widely studied and categorized in various contexts, with earlier research predominantly using automata and oracles, as well as considerable investigations involving trace-based methods. Many of these studies aimed to expand the Kahn principle for dataflow networks that incorporate non-deterministic elements. These investigations led to some unexpected and innovative outcomes regarding the comparative power of different forms of fair merge employed within dataflow networks. Given the significance of fairness in the execution of concurrent programs, it is foreseeable that our approach may share commonalities with earlier research, either implicitly or explicitly.

Nonetheless, we have managed to delineate these particulars in a broad context without resorting to complex administrative tools like oracles or the typical process of labeling and delabeling actions in dataflow semantics. Furthermore, our framework brings forth naturally derived algebraic characteristics such as associativity, something that prior studies have not typically accommodated as seamlessly.
