The referenced academic paper discusses a method for analyzing the behavior of hybrid automata, which are systems with both discrete and continuous components. The paper points out that certain flows, such as those involving trigonometric functions, cannot be captured exactly through symbolic computation but can be approximated using techniques like interval arithmetic. This allows the authors to extend their method to handle more complex hybrid automata than previously possible.

The paper describes a two-loop process for verifying the safety of an abstract representation of a dynamical system. Using Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.3, the second loop identifies critical states within the automata that are necessary for confirming the system's safety. If these states are not part of a bad set (denoted as B), then the algorithm can affirm safety.

The authors also introduce a framework for three-valued safety analysis of hybrid automata in Section 4.1, and in a later section, they delve into stronger properties described by Computation Tree Logic (CTL). They exclude the "next" operator from their discussion due to the continuous nature of time in the underlying framework.

The paper proposes a novel approach for reachability analysis in hybrid automata that does not depend on exactly representing the predecessor or successor regions. Rather, the authors' abstractions preserve sufficient information to establish or refute safety properties and more complex CTL formulas. They also provide efficient (linear time) algorithms for conducting three-valued safety analysis on these abstractions.
