Minlog is an interactive system for generating proofs and extracting programs, devised by H. Schwichtenberg and collaborators from the Logic Group at the University of Munich. This system adopts a minimal logic framework, a more fundamental type of logic compared to classical or intuitionistic logic, within a first-order natural deduction calculus. For comprehensive information on this, refer to the specified sources [9,25].

The method for obtaining the generic modulus of uniform continuity T, when starting with a specific Minlog term t, is distinct from what is proposed in Proposition 2.5. In essence, our strategy entails the creation of a novel version of MD-interpretation. This new interpretation fuses beneficial characteristics from the pre-existing interpretations by Kohlenbach [16], optimized for implementation on computational systems.
