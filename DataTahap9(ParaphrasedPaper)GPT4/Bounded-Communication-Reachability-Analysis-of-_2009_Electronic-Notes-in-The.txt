The academic paper discusses the reachability problem within Ordered Process Rewrite Systems (O-PRS), a computational model where the order of operations matters and which can describe concurrent processes. While the ability to determine if one term can reach another is decidable in Process Rewrite Systems (PRS), the paper points out the complexity introduced by associativity in Ordered PRS makes reachability undecidable.

To address this issue, the study explores the reachability problem between two infinite sets of process terms. Process terms are conceptualized as trees, and the researchers use tree automata—specifically, bottom-up tree automata—as representations for these sets of terms.

To navigate around the undecidability problem, the authors present a strategy of generating better underapproximations of the reachability set. An underapproximation is an estimate that is guaranteed to be equal to or smaller than the exact set. They propose an iterative approach where they compute underapproximations for increasing parameters (denoted as k), and if the underapproximation does not change from k to k+1, they conclude that they've found an exact characterization of the reachability set.

The paper also notes that these underapproximations will be exact in cases where ordered processes are confined to performing a limited number of communications. The study includes a real-world case study where this condition is met, and thus, it is possible to determine the exact reachability set within that context.
