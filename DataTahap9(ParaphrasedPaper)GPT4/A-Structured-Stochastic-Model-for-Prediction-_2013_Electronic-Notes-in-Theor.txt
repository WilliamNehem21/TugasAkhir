This study introduces a groundbreaking approach that utilizes Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN) to simulate a particular type of geological process. The complexity of natural phenomena, which are influenced by numerous variables, requires careful selection and categorization of the key factors contributing to the phenomenon in question.

Using SAN as a tool begins with recognizing patterns within the geological process. Each pattern corresponds to an automaton within the network, defined by its states and transitions. Transitions are driven by events, which are categorized as either local, affecting only one automaton, or synchronizing, affecting multiple automatons simultaneously.

One example cited is the coin toss in the Heads or Tails game, illustrating the role of SAN in predicting outcomes based on a player's guess about which side of the coin will land face up.

The study further discusses four different types of geological deposits in the context of the Pelotas Basin, related to sea level changes and sediment supply. These deposits include forced regression (FR), lowstand normal regression (LNR), highstand normal regression (HNR), and transgression (T), which can be distinguished based on the rate of sea level rise and sediment supply. Vertical movement plays a role here, and in the case study examined, subsidence is the only vertical movement considered.

By exploring a set X = {1, 2, 3, 4}, dependent solely on the current state of the 'Chronos' automaton, various tests were conducted to determine appropriate rates for 'up' and 'down' events, with a rate of about 1000 found to fit expected results. The transition processes between automatons come to a halt once a predefined condition is met, after which synchronizing events can again occur, including a 'reset' event that realigns all automatons to their initial states.

The paper argues that this novel modeling technique could forecast general stacking patterns of strata within the Pelotas Basin, suggesting a new, valuable prediction tool for natural phenomena. The interdisciplinary nature of this research poses its own challenges, emphasizing the need for effective communication among researchers from various fields. Future work should aim to refine this model by incorporating data from additional sources and the insights gained from this initial investigation.
