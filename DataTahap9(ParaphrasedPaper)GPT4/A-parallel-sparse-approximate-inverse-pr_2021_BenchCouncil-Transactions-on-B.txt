In this study, the researchers introduce HybridSPAI, a high-performance parallel algorithm designed for computing sparse approximate inverse preconditioners using a combination of MPI (Message Passing Interface) and CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) technologies. The algorithm extends the capabilities of an existing static SPAI algorithm to leverage multiple GPUs, enabling the handling of large-scale matrices. The research showcases major contributions in two areas: first, the development of a general-purpose parallel framework that optimizes static SPAI preconditioners with MPI and CUDA; and second, the creation of a decision tree methodology that helps select the most effective computational kernel for each part of the preconditioner. The experiments conducted as part of the study indicate that HybridSPAI outperforms several well-established preconditioning algorithms that are part of two widely-used public libraries, as well as another recent parallel SPAI algorithm. Furthermore, the study explores parallelism by creating subsets of indices and employing parallel operations within thread groups, thereby enhancing the efficiency and speed of the preconditioning process.
