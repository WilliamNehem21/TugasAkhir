This paper emphasizes the importance of test execution and conformance checking over test case generation in verifying the proper functioning of hybrid systems. The authors provide a case study in which they illustrate the ability to identify discrepancies in Simulink model mutants using automatically created test cases, a process described in referenced literature.

The paper introduces a running hybrid system example and qualitative reasoning (QR) techniques used for modeling. It formalizes the conformance relation between QR models and hybrid implementations. In the modeling phase, real-valued variables are abstracted to a simplified domain of points and intervals, known as a quantity space.

The Garp3 tool is mentioned as a supportive instrument for constructing and examining QR models based on qualitative process theory. The paper outlines an initial version of a conformance relation tailored to QR models, acknowledging that because of their highly responsive nature, QR models do not require additional handling of states with no observable outputs.

Issues of input controllability during test case construction are discussed, with the authors advocating adaptive input selection. They describe envisionment simulation as a method that simulates all potential futures from an initial scenario and explore options for managing state space explosion, such as imposing constraints to limit the number of potential futures.

Additionally, the researchers highlight that QR behavioral traces require linked inputs and outputs to maintain the consistency of states during transitions. They propose a filtering system to resolve conflicts and refine viable successor states.

The paper acknowledges the non-deterministic nature of the systems tested and describes how test cases are configured as transition systems with possible loops. Test cases conclude in either accept or inconclusive states, with failure implied rather than explicitly defined.

A procedure using a repeat-until loop is illustrated to show test execution, where inputs are sent to the system, outputs are observed, and consistency checks are carried out to navigate through the test case until a verdict is reached.

Tools such as Reactis are referenced for generating test cases for Simulink models based on coverage criteria. The paper cites other works addressing the selection of test cases for hybrid systems, indicating that minor changes in parameters typically do not affect qualitative behavior.

Finally, the authors present their approach as a novel application of QR methods for testing hybrid systems, using abstract models to validate concrete implementations. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through an example, successfully identifying faults in the system, showcasing the potential for validating the accuracy of environmental simulations.
