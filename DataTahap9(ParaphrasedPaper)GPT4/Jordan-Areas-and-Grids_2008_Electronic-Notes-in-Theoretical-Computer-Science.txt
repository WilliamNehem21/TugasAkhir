This academic paper discusses certain mathematical concepts and their applications to the study of sets and their closures, specifically focusing on compact sets which are both bounded and closed. The paper notes that various definitions of sets simultaneously apply to a set "S" and its closure, so the discussion will be limited to these compact sets. The authors are interested in expressing sets with a grid of points that closely approximates them, becoming more precise as the Hausdorff distance decreases.

Berg et al. explored a constructive approach to the Jordan Curve Theorem, which stipulates that any simple closed curve in the plane divides the plane into an "inside" and an "outside." However, this is not fully sufficient for the authors' needs, because they require the ability to construct specific points outside and inside a curve, as well as to find polygonal paths connecting these points to any other point that is not on the curve, without intersecting the curve.

The paper then refers to three types of representations of Jordan domains, all of which are derived from established definitions found in other sources. Additionally, it references another section (143ff) that restricts the representation to grids of points for compact sets. The authors highlight computational complexity considerations of this approach in their own paper and suggest that other works offer comparative studies of different representations of compact sets.
