The academic paper introduces and explores the concept of cartesian integral categories. The authors aim to define and understand the structure required for an integral category to have its coKleisli category form a cartesian integral category. Despite the initial assumption that a tensor product of an integral category might naturally lead to a cartesian integral category, it turns out that typical integral categories lack sufficient structure for such a result.

To overcome this, the paper focuses on finding the right kind of integral structure on a coalgebra modality that indeed yields a cartesian integral category when considering its coKleisli category. The critical finding of the research is that any contextual integral category equipped with a pseudo-linearizing transformation will have a cartesian integral category as its coKleisli category. This result is broadly applicable and includes instances where the linear maps are associated with a differential process.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the notion of a left additive category, which is defined as a type of category with hom-sets that form commutative monoids, allowing for the addition of morphisms and the existence of a zero morphism. This structure must be preserved under the composition of morphisms from the left. A map in such a category is considered additive if it preserves this additive structure when it is composed from the right.

It is also noted that cartesian differential categories inherently possess a system of linear maps. These linear maps fit the definition used within the context of cartesian differential categories. The authors go on to discuss the relationship between these concepts and their goal of creating cartesian integral categories from coKleisli categories by examining slices of coKleisli categories and establishing a system of linear maps in coKleisli categories of coalgebra modalities.
