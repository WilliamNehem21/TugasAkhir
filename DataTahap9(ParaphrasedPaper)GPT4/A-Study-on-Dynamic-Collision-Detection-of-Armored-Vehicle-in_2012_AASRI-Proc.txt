This study addresses the complexity of motion patterns in moving objects by focusing on the motions of rigid bodies. The research simplifies the movement of these objects into two basic types for analytical purposes: translational movement on a horizontal surface and rotational movement around a fixed axis. By breaking down complex motions into these fundamental components, the study aims to more effectively explore the dynamics of motion.

The paper emphasizes that translation, whether in a straight line or along a curve, is the most prevalent type of movement experienced in both engineering and daily life. In virtual environments, translation is represented by updating the location of the object from one frame to the next. The position of the object in the subsequent frame is determined by its current location and velocity, allowing for the assumption that the object moves in a straight line between frames.

The authors of the paper propose a novel method for dynamic collision detection, designed to address the issue of armored vehicles appearing to penetrate ground objects in visual simulations. They present a model for dynamic collision detection that, after being tested through simulations and comparative experiments, has been found to effectively identify collisions. One limitation acknowledged in the paper is the model's lack of detailed consideration for the specific shape of the armored vehicles involved. The researchers plan to address this limitation in future work.
