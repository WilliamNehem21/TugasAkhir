Our research proposes a framework that allows for a clear definition of type system rules through the use of constraints. We enhance these type rules with specific combinators, which direct the order in which constraints should be addressed. This selective ordering provides a pathway for choosing an appropriate constraint-solving strategy, bridging the gap between a type system's theoretical specification and its practical, deterministic application.

Using our approach, the complexity of creating a constraint solver is reduced, promoting reuse. The well-researched topic of providing user feedback on programming errors is addressed by tailoring error messages associated with constraint inconsistencies to the source program. The extensive efforts in the constraint programming field to explain such inconsistencies serve as a contrasting background to our application-focused solutions.

An ideal feedback mechanism would be generic enough to be adaptable across various analyses or programming languages, with the option to add heuristics for refinement at a later stage.

In this paper, we present a versatile framework that compiler developers can use to efficiently construct type inferencing systems without prematurely committing to a specific constraint-solving strategy. Our examples derive from the application of this framework to type inferencing in the polymorphic lambda calculus and in the design of the Helium compiler for Haskell.

We offer a detailed examination of the Hindley-Milner type system expressed in the form of constraints and introduce novel combinators that specify the constraint-solving order. These combinators allow for a variety of strategies, enhancing error detection and troubleshooting.

The framework's effectiveness has been validated through its implementation in the Helium compiler, where constraint generation and reordering processes have minimal impact on the overall compilation speed.

Lastly, we discuss a two-part soundness proof for program analyses developed using our framework and explore how the introduced combinators facilitate simpler solvers and potentially clearer correctness proofs. Our framework's approach, while innovative, also acknowledges prior research on flexibility in constraint solving. We conclude that our constraint ordering phase and the combinators we introduce represent a first step, inferring that the domain could benefit from further exploration of ordering combinators and possibly parallel execution models.
