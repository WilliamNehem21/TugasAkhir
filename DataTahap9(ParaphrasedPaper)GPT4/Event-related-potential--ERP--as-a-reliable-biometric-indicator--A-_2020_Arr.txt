Biometric systems are extensively utilized in sensitive and financial sectors, including the military, banking, airports, security firms, and prestigious corporations. These systems authenticate users based on unique physiological characteristics such as fingerprints, palm prints, facial recognition, ear shape, iris patterns, speech characteristics, ECG fiducial points, EEG energy distribution, and DNA structure. Despite their widespread use, these systems have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by impostors. For example, speech systems might be tricked with recorded audio; iris systems with cloaking lenses; and facial or ear-based systems with images or videos. DNA-based systems are the most secure but are costly and slow to process.

The paper also highlights that EEG-based verification yields higher accuracy over the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes with eyes closed, and the anterior region with eyes open. Some research has explored the use of fewer EEG channels, such as Riera et al.'s system with two electrodes, achieving a 98.10% verification accuracy over a sample of subjects and intruders.

Moreover, Das et al. sourced visual evoked potential patterns, while Palaniappan analyzed EEG signals during a specific mental task to authenticate individuals. They looked at AR coefficients, PSD differences, linear complexity, and approximate entropy.

The study uses features like Local Binary Pattern, AR coefficients, wavelet coefficients, PCA eigenvectors, correlation, spectral coherence, and phase difference. It describes the dataset in Section 2, feature extraction in Section 3, and the classifiers—K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest—in Section 4. It then discusses results.

The AR coefficients are calculated using forward and backward prediction errors, with the best order determined by balancing residual variance against prediction errors. An order of 8 was chosen for the AR model in this study.

Regarding classifiers, while KNN is known for its simplicity, interpretability, and strong performance, it is also a lazy learner, requiring no training phase but relying on neighbors for classifying new samples. The paper reflects on the uniqueness of resting-EEG information per individual due to unique brain system connections, suggesting EEG signals contain subject-specific information despite appearing noisy. The analysis focuses on the power spectrum of the EEG signals.
