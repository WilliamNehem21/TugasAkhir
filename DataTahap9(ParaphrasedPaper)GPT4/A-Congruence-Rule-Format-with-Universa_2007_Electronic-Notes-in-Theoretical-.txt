Structural operational semantics (SOS) has been a fundamental approach used to specify the operational semantics of programming languages and systems, which has been formalized through transition system specifications (TSS). TSS offers a detailed syntactical and semantical method for defining the behavior of systems within SOS, allowing for the development of related theoretical frameworks, such as those concerning rules for establishing congruence.

Traditionally, SOS has implicitly relied on existential quantification in rule premises, but theoretical justification exists for also incorporating universal quantification. In practice, there are instances where universal quantification has been applied within operational semantics.

Some believe that universal quantification can be bypassed by expanding universally quantified terms into a possibly infinite set of existentially quantified premises or rules. Yet in practice, especially when adhering to specific congruence formats like ntyft, such expansions might not be feasible without altering the structure beyond the format's intended limitations.

In this paper, we enrich the meta-theory of SOS by integrating a single level of universal quantification into the syntax of SOS rules, a novelty in our theoretical framework. We also incorporate disjunction within rule premises, defining the semantics accordingly. We contribute a new congruence rule format compatible with strong bisimilarity that accommodates these additions, an area not previously explored to our knowledge.

While considering the implications of introducing explicit existential quantification along with universal quantification, we examine the impacts on rule clauses and their proofs in the least well-supported model. Specifically, we investigate variable binding order in relation to universal quantifiers and the repercussions on positive and negative premises.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that removing syntactic constraints from the untyft rule format compromises the congruence property. Our extension requires unique variables across different rule disjuncts, an essential addition to the traditional ntyft format constraints to maintain congruence.

The paper extends the syntax and semantics of SOS by adding universal quantification, clarifying existential quantification, and employing both conjunction and disjunction. We argue that our proposed rule format ensures bisimilarity remains a congruence under these extensions.

Looking ahead, our theoretical objectives include exploring a framework that accommodates full first-order logic, as well as considering the removal of the well-foundedness assumption in congruence results. Additional studies will compare the expressiveness of the untyft format against ntyft and tyft formats. Our research into ordered SOS indicates that introducing universal quantification may be necessary to convert general tyft rules into the ntyft format without additional operators, hinting at the potentially needed expressive capacity that universal quantification provides. Thus, our goal is to prove that the untyft format has the expressiveness required to eliminate the need for ordering in tyft rules.
