The academic paper discusses the limitations of traditional queueing network models in capturing the individual states and behaviors of customers as they navigate through a system, and introduces the PEPA Queues formalism. PEPA Queues integrates the process algebra PEPA to model the specific state and actions of both customers and servers within a queueing network. It provides formal semantics for PEPA Queues and a method to translate them into PEPA, giving access to tools for PEPA model analysis.

Traditional queueing networks excel at depicting customer flow but fail to detail the customer's evolution within the system. Customers are often treated as uniform entities without distinctive behaviors and are sometimes categorized into a few fixed classes if differentiation is needed.

The paper also describes the concept of choice in PEPA, where a system with components "p" and "q" may act as either, with the first completed activity determining the path forward. Tokens represent the state of a PEPA component, which may change independently or through interactions with its environment. The paper explains that places in the network are defined by component names and can only hold appropriate component types. Transitions in the network are associated with action types and rates, enabling components to move within the network.

PEPA Nets, a high-level formalism, can be compiled into PEPA and analyzed with existing PEPA tools, which influences the approach for PEPA Queues. PEPA Queues maintain the specific state of each queue component, making them akin to multi-class queueing networks where class does not impact queue discipline.

The network considered in the paper contains a finite number of customers with blocked services when destination queues are full to avoid loss. Handling open networks and other complex features in PEPA translation is mentioned as a more difficult task left for future research.

It is warned that cooperation at the network level in routing actions can complicate the system and is not recommended. This separation maintains the distinction between local behavior and spatial movement. PEPA Queues can concisely represent queueing mechanisms such as server breakdown, repair, and global resets.

PEPA Queue models can be mechanically translated to PEPA without behavioral change, although direct work with PEPA Queues is preferred. The paper describes renaming protocols to ensure global uniqueness in routing actions and avoid cooperation between queues for those actions.

The paper also highlights a modification to server components in PEPA Queues to suit the naming conventions and ensure local cooperation actions are unique. The cooperation between queues and the actions of servers such as spage and simages are detailed, showing client routing through the network.

PEPA Queues is presented as a formalism that synergizes behavioral and spatial descriptions, tailored for situations where queueing is central, unlike PEPA Nets. The potential for modeling inter-customer cooperation is briefly discussed, indicating a possible way to represent negative customers and their interactions within the queue.
