The study conducts experiments on the SVC Task 2 benchmark dataset from the first signature verification competition in 2004, which comprises 20 valid signatures from 40 individuals and 20 fraudulent signatures created by five skilled forgers who are not part of the original 40 signature providers. Three training and testing data configurations were utilized: DS1 includes 5 genuine signatures for training and tests on a set of 35 signatures (15 authentic and 20 forged), DS2 uses 10 authentic signatures for training and tests on 30 signatures (10 authentic not used in training and 20 forgeries), and DS3 employs 15 genuine signatures for training and tests on 25 signatures (5 genuine not used in training and 20 forgeries).

The findings demonstrate that combining different features provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the verification system's performance than analyzing a single feature in isolation. By using sub-trajectory analysis, the Equal Error Rate (EER) has been effectively reduced. This technique can be integrated with advanced verification methods in signature verification, suggesting that the use of feature categorization and sub-trajectories can significantly enhance the system's accuracy and reduce error rates.
