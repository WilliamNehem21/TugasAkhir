The scientific paper describes how plasma may inadvertently move to the wall of a vacuum vessel and become unmanageable, resulting in the cessation of its containment and potential damage due to high thermal stress and the generation of runaway electrons. To prevent this, a feedback control system is essential for maintaining the plasma's vertical position.

Two strategies exist for managing plasma vertical movement: passive and active feedback. Passive feedback functions rapidly, in milliseconds, and is initiated when the plasma moves vertically; conductors near the plasma, such as the vacuum vessel's metallic wall, generate an eddy current. This current then produces a magnetic field whose radial component, in conjunction with the current in the plasma, creates a counteracting Lorentz force that suppresses vertical shift. The EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) device utilizes a passive feedback loop fashion by double-layer stainless steel of the vacuum vessel and two sets of passive conductive plates. The effectiveness of passive feedback diminishes over time as the eddy currents wane due to conductor resistance, necessitating the deployment of active feedback for prolonged disturbances.

Active feedback works by detecting the vertical movement of the plasma and relaying this information to a control power supply. This results in an excitation current within the feedback coils, generating a magnetic field intended to restrict further vertical displacement of the plasma.

The power supply system consists of two controllers. The main system controller modulates the coil current to meet plasma control requirements and provides protection. Its output is proportionately distributed among individual inverter units connected to the controller using a current feedback mechanism.
