In this paper, the authors introduce a novel approach to representing quantum data through classical interactions, manipulating quantum states, and extracting information using measurements. They model a quantum state as a strategic choice of actions that adhere to quantum mechanics principles. This model is inspired by game semantics and incorporates a new game to describe the behavior of quantum memory components.

The quantum equivalent of dereferencing, which in classical systems retrieves the stored value, is represented by quantum measurement in this model. Similarly, the act of assignment in classical systems corresponds to state preparation in the quantum realm. However, unlike classical stores that allow multiple value assignments, quantum stores cannot be overwritten, as quantum states are inherently unalterable. Instead, state preparation appends a new known quantum state to an existing one.

The core of the paper's proof is delivered through inductive reasoning based upon the construction of a theoretical model, M. The authors focus on explaining the most crucial and novel aspects of the proof, omitting the standard classical scenarios.

Finally, the paper touches upon the categorical properties of the quantum store arenas without delving into full detail. The authors suggest that one could investigate a subcategory comprising quantum store arenas and quantum strategies within it. Such a category would be distinct from other categories previously examined to understand quantum information flow because quantum store arenas do not have a fixed dimension, while objects in other categories correspond to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
