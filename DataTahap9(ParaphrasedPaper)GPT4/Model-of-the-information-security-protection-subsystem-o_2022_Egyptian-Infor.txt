This academic paper discusses a set of methodologies that serve as a toolkit for assessing the performance of information systems over a limited, censored period of time. Specifically, the paper focuses on the following key aspects:

1. Identifying the duration between failures in the system under study.
2. Examining the interactions between the Information Security Protection Subsystem (ISPS) and Artificial Threats to Information Security (ATIS).

The core object of the study is the process by which the ISPS mitigates the impact of ATIS. The theoretical basis for the study is the application of Markov random processes for analytic descriptions of this interaction, as well as the use of mathematical programming to formulate and resolve relevant optimization problems. The goal is to achieve an analytical formalization of the optimal Information Security Scheme (SIS) within the target information system.

The specific objectives of the research are:

1. To formalize, through Markov chain analysis, the relationship between ATIS and the structured ISPS, using appropriate quality metrics.
2. To develop a mathematical framework that can set up an optimization problem for configuring the ISPS, ensuring that the target information system remains operational at a given time with an adequate probability.
3. To apply the proposed operational optimization method of the ISPS to a real-world system and analyze the outcomes.

The study includes examining the probability that a particular protective mechanism in the ISPS will effectively neutralize the impact of a specific ATIS. A set of m vectors characterizes the capability of the ISPS to counteract different combinations of n ATIS threats. It's acknowledged that multiple protective mechanisms might counteract a single ATIS, a fact that can be expressed analytically.

The presented mathematical framework suggests that an optimal SIS will consistently involve certain protective mechanisms, referred to as r2 and r4. However, the importance of another mechanism, r1, becomes apparent for longer censored time intervals, such as t3 and t4. This reflects the information system's critical focus on ensuring reliable user authentication and maintaining the integrity of information resources within a strictly controlled environment of users and services.
