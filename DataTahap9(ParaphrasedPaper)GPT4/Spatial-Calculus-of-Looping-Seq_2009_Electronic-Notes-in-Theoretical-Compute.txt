The goal of spatial chemical language (Spatial CLS) is to provide detailed explanations of biological behaviors that rely on the precise positions of the elements involved. This precision is particularly beneficial for cell biology research, where spatial organization is critical, and molecules are often unevenly distributed across a space. These detailed spatial models can be used to faithfully simulate the biological systems they represent. As case studies, the paper discusses the creation of a cell proliferation model and a model of quorum sensing in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including simulation results for cell proliferation using a specific simulator.

The Spatial CLS can model movements like Brownian motion and can also incorporate deterministic, pseudo-random movements by including an extra parameter that behaves like the seed in a pseudo-random number generator. This parameter enables a mover function to generate different trajectories based on the given seed. Although not demonstrated in the paper due to space constraints, this extension is presumed to exist in the provided examples.

A function named spacecheck is introduced to estimate whether there is sufficient space within a given radius to accommodate all elements of interest. While the simplest version of spacecheck always returns true, indicating that there is enough space, more sophisticated versions can provide better accuracy if necessary.

The paper details an algorithm called "arrange," which attempts to organize elements but might sometimes fail to produce a valid term. If the algorithm fails during the application of a rule or after a movement phase, the system assumes that the elements cannot react or move accordingly, leaving them unchanged for that step.

To understand the dynamics of reactions, the authors define a function appl that identifies possible reactions within a system by examining combinations of reactants and the resulting transformed terms, including any rearrangements.

The paper also explores alternatives to handling spatial conflicts, such as representing elements as points with no space or only applying rules that do not cause conflicts. However, these alternatives could diminish the model's accuracy by oversimplifying real-world complexities, such as the physical expansion of a membrane impacting neighboring elements.

In the context of quorum sensing, the authors explain that autoinducer molecules are produced at low levels when cell density is low and at high levels when density is high, eventually leading to autocatalytic production at a threshold concentration, causing a rapid increase in autoinducer levels. The paper illustrates this process with a series of rules (r1 through r9) that describe autoinducer behaviors, including basal production, complex formation, DNA binding, and degradation. Unique to this model is that it can simulate the diffusion of the autoinducer in a more realistic way than stochastic models that assume homogeneous distribution, emphasizing the importance of considering spatial distribution in reactions with fast kinetics relative to diffusion rates.
