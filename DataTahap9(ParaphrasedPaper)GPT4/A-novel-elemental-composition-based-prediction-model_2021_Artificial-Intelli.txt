This paper explores the use of mathematical modeling, specifically genetic programming (GP), as an alternative to the costly and complex solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for measuring the aromaticity of biochars. The researchers utilized an experimental dataset comprising 98 biochar samples to develop new prediction models that assess aromaticity based on more readily obtainable parameters such as elemental composition.

Through intelligent iteration and learning, the GP algorithm revealed a clear underlying exponential relationship between the elemental compositions and the aromaticity of biochars. This relationship was found to be simpler and clearer than polynomial mapping relationships suggested by previously established models, such as those by Maroto-Valer, Mazumdar, and Mazumdar-Wang.

The study confirmed the significance of quantifying biochar aromaticity. For instance, Han et al. (2014) demonstrated a positive correlation between biochar aromaticity and the adsorption capacity for organic pollutants. Similarly, Singh et al. (2012) found a link between the amount of CO2 generated during long-term biochar incubation and the initial aromatic C fraction, underlining the importance of aromaticity in biochar utilization and its potential in business models.

To create an aromaticity prediction model, the researchers split the data into training and testing sets. Sixty percent of the samples comprised the training set, used for identifying model parameters, while the remaining samples were used for testing the models' performance. The sets were selected at random to ensure the model's effectiveness.

Among the developed models, the GP-II and GP-III models demonstrated superior performance with smaller median error values compared to the GP-I and Mazumdar-Wang models. The GP-II and GP-III models, which use exponential functions of elemental atom ratios, had considerably better prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities in predicting biochar aromaticity when compared to the polynomial models.

The results indicated that the influence of the N/C ratio on biochar aromaticity prediction was minimal, suggesting that the GP-II model, known for its excellent predictive capacity and simple model structure, is the more accurate option among the studied models.

In alignment with reported research findings, which suggested the formation of similar molecular structures at high pyrolysis temperatures, the GP-II model's predictive characteristics are significantly consistent.
