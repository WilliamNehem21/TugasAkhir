This study focuses on improving the interpretation of the subsurface architecture of carbonate reefs from high-resolution 3D seismic data in the northwest shelf of Australia. Researchers used machine learning techniques to develop a reef cube meta-attribute (RC meta-attribute), which successfully characterizes the structure of a buried carbonate reef about 450 meters below the seafloor. A supervised neural network was trained with seismic attributes to automate the identification process, resulting in a significantly high accuracy, with a misclassification rate of around 1% for both training and test datasets.

The inception of the RC meta-attribute and its application showcases a modern approach to geological analysis. It efficiently pinpoints and delineates the subsurface structure of carbonate reefs, thereby reducing the need for intensive human input and expediting the entire interpretive process.

The authors point out how the shift from siliciclastic to carbonate sediments in the Cenozoic era influenced the current geological formations, highlighting the evolution of carbonate platforms during the Early-Middle Miocene period. To prepare the data, the study employed structural filtering to enhance the seismic data by distinguishing seismic reflectors from noise.

Approximately 870 "reef-yes" and 880 "reef-no" locations were labeled for training and testing purposes within the seismic data, taking into account geological properties and seismic signatures. Ambiguous areas were excluded from consideration.

However, they also acknowledge the potential for decreased neural network performance due to the use of noisy or poor-quality data, which underscores the importance of data quality in obtaining accurate machine learning results.

Finally, the normalized root mean square (NRMS) error curve was used as a benchmark for performance, indicating that a lower NRMS error corresponds to a more precise neural outcome. The use of this curve allows for easy visualization of error performance across both the train and test datasets, facilitating the assessment of the neural network's accuracy in identifying the structure of the carbonate reef.
