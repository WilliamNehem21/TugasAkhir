This study explores the protective effects of thymoquinone (TQ), an antioxidant from Nigella sativa seeds, against arsenic-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Arsenic, a harmful environmental contaminant, can affect the brain by making it more vulnerable to oxidative stress, leading to cell damage through the creation of free radicals. The research involved administering sodium arsenate to rats, causing a reduction in neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine, and the activity of enzymes like acetylcholine esterase and Na+-K+-ATPase in the brain. In addition, levels of antioxidants, including glutathione and enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, reductase, and catalase, were decreased by arsenic exposure, while serotonin levels increased.

The rats treated with TQ after arsenate exposure showed a recovery in the levels of neurotransmitters and antioxidant enzymes and reduced serotonin. Histological analysis revealed that arsenic exposure led to a decline in cerebellar neuron number and damage to Purkinje cells. However, TQ treatment appeared to mitigate neuronal cell damage and enhance enzyme activity related to energy metabolism and neural function.

The study concludes TQ has a restorative effect against arsenic-induced neurotoxicity in rats, likely due to its antioxidant properties which combat oxidative stress. The paper suggests that TQ could have therapeutic potential for neurotoxicity caused by exposure to arsenic and possibly other environmental neurotoxins.
