Lagrangean Relaxation (LR) has been used in devising an exact algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) as outlined in references [14,15] and proved effective in addressing a variety of other challenges. It is recognized as a robust instrument as indicated by [7,12,9]. For a detailed understanding of LR and additional literature, one may refer to [13,23,28].

LR is a method built upon duality theory concepts as mentioned in [18,27], which uniquely handles certain problem constraints. It moves complex constraints into the objective function with the imposition of Lagrangean multipliers as special penalty parameters. This transformation turns the original problem into a "relaxed" version, producing sub-problems that are typically easier to solve.

The feasible solution space is determined by constraints (2),(3), along with other integral and non-negativity constraints, encapsulated in the set X. Without constraint (2), it is presumed the problem would be simpler to resolve.

The overall problem size is influenced by the planning and discretization horizons; the greater their scope, the more data required, and thus, the larger the problem. Parallel computing environments are tapped to manage these large-scale problems, as was the motivation for parallelizing the heuristic method described in this paper. Unlike the referenced work, this paper implements the parallelization of LR through sub-problem column generation (CG), using a master-slave architecture within a network-connected cluster of workstations.
