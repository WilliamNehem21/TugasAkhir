In membrane systems research, which aims to model biological membranes, brackets "[]" are used to represent a membrane. Each membrane is associated with two sets of elements called multisets, symbolized by "u" and "v," which stand for the internal and external markers of the membrane respectively. The term "proteins" or "objects" refers to elements within the given alphabet "V," and when objects are not attached to a membrane, they are termed "free."

Rules affecting membranes are triggered under specific conditions: a rule can act on membrane "i" if it's associated with the correct internal "u" and external "v" multisets and an object "a" is present in the surrounding region. Execution of such a rule entails moving object "a" from the external region into membrane "i."

Evolution rules also exist that impact objects without involving membranes. These replicate biochemical reactions within cell compartments but don't affect membrane complexity. The current study doesn't cover the computational implications of adding membrane evolution rules. Previous research incorporated simpler protein rules and stochastic simulations involving object rewritings.

Cyclins, a group of proteins, are essential for the cell cycle, with their concentration fluctuating cyclically to facilitate cell progression through its phases. Estrogens, primary female sex hormones, play a role in cell cycle progression and are linked to certain cancers, influenced by estrogen receptors, which vary across body tissues. These receptors, found on the cell membrane or within cells, initiate cellular responses upon binding with specific molecules. The receptor's effects are shaped by ligand structure, receptor subtype, gene regulatory elements, and cell-type specific proteins.

Modeling biological processes must consider pathways cross-talk, which reflects various chemicals' involvement in multiple functions. Chemicals are interconnected across different pathways, hence isolated pathway analysis is incomplete and lacks realism without thorough understanding of the surrounding processes. This interconnectedness challenges quantitative analysis of individual pathways due to the lack of comprehensive knowledge about all implicated biological functions.
