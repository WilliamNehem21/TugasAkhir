For addressing the second research question, the study relied on a feasibility analysis to aid the investment decision-making process. The focus was on investing in HPS projects specifically within the Zilupe and Vecogre locations because they demonstrated positive financial indicators; whereas, the Mezrozite HPS was excluded from consideration due to its negative Net Present Value (NPV) and Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA). Similarly, the wind turbine project was ruled out as a viable investment option because it too showed negative NPV and EAA values. On the contrary, investment in the selected HPS projects indicated positive NPV and EAA, suggesting their profitability and financial viability.
