The academic paper discusses the challenges of correlating specific activities with individual construction workers using computer vision-based methods. Previous studies have typically relied on analyzing static images from video frames without linking workers' actions between frames, which limits the evaluation of each worker's productivity. Non-vision-based systems can sometimes overcome these limitations, but they are not the focus of this particular study.

In the paper, a new framework for recognizing worker activities through vision-based techniques is presented. The approach involves using ordinary video recordings as inputs and applying a lightweight network to estimate human pose key points from the footage. On top of that, a multi-person tracking algorithm tracks continuous movement and manages situations where workers may be occluded or leave the camera's field of vision.

For action recognition, multilayer fully connected neural networks and stacked LSTM models analyze key point data to classify worker activities, which aids in assessing construction efficiency. The approach developed in this paper has been tested on videos from real-world construction sites.

A multi-target tracking algorithm is employed to maintain a continuous association between the identified workers and their key point data. A SORT (Simple Online and Real-time Tracking) tracker is used alongside a Kalman filter to predict trajectories and match detections to their predicted locations in subsequent frames.

In terms of evaluating performance, the paper uses accuracy rates and confusion matrices to assess the system's ability to correctly predict activities.

The paper's key contributions include a novel framework for analyzing construction worker activities using video data that is less computationally costly than traditional image-based systems. The framework efficiently processes a large amount of video data involving multiple workers by integrating modules for key point extraction, tracking, activity recognition, and efficiency analysis. It suggests that this approach can yield effective monitoring and analysis of construction worker efficiency, with experimental results from actual site videos supporting the usefulness of 2D pose information in activity and efficiency analysis.
