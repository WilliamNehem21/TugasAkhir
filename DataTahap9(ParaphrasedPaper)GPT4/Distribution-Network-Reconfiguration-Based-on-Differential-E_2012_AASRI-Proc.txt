This paper presents a methodology that creates all possible solutions by applying the reconstruction approach, which entails conducting a breadth-first search on the network prior to performing load flow analysis. The technique effectively addresses the recoding issue and organizes the network into layers during the search, resulting in the creation of two matrices: branch-level matrix B and node-level matrix N. With these matrices and the layered network structure, calculating load flow is simplified, allowing for straightforward application of the forward and backward substitution method.
