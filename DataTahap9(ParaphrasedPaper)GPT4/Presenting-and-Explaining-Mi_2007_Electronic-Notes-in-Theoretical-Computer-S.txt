The Mizar proof language offers a blend of user-friendly features that present information in a way that resembles textbook styles, alongside robust semantic foundations that enable precise proof verification. These two aspects — readability and semantic depth — are vital for users who seek an optimal Mizar experience, which demands educational clarity as well as the facility to delve into elaborate semantic details and comprehensive proof justifications. Crafting representations of original Mizar texts, responses to semantic inquiries within the Mizar library, or content generated at the semantic level by automated reasoning systems, raises a series of challenges and necessitates complex decision-making. This paper explores potential solutions and introduces a preliminary framework for conveying thorough breakdowns of basic Mizar inferences by integrating Mizar XML presentation tools, the MML query system, and automated theorem provers that utilize the MPTP semantic translation of Mizar.

Yet, the fundamental aim of formal proof languages like Mizar is their capacity for automated proof verification. This requires that all user-friendly presentation features must ultimately be converted into a format that can be semantically checked for accuracy. In Mizar, this conversion is accomplished through a sequence of compiler-like stages that methodically translate the syntactic elements into their semantic equivalents, identifying potential syntactic errors in the process, and culminating in a final proof verification on the semantic level.

The semantic layer is multifunctional: Mizar uses it for proof checking and maintaining its internal database, while it is also applied in the MML query search and presentation system, as well as in the MOMM system, the Mizar proof advisor, the MPTP systems, and the format for semantic browsing in the Mizarmode.

It's crucial to understand that the semantic layer still embodies Mizar logic instead of the untyped first-order predicate logic utilized by current automated theorem provers such as E, Vampire, SPASS, Otter, or Prover9. A conversion process is necessary to encode Mizar-specific concepts, like type hierarchies, into standard predicate logic. The MPTP system manages this by representing types as predicates, but there are numerous approaches to this translation. Similarly, converting predicate logic into Mizar logic can be done in various ways.

The Mizar semantic layer has now been entirely converted into XML, with XSLT tools being developed that generate a linked HTML representation of Mizar. The XML format is crafted to facilitate HTML linking of symbols and other Mizar elements and has undergone iterations to include more metadata based on feedback from its HTML presentation capabilities. This allows for a high-fidelity reproduction of the original Mizar format while revealing extensive system-computed information not typically available to Mizar authors. With modern browsers supporting XSLT, Mizar authors can load XML files from the verification process into their browsers for immediate access to this detailed information.

At the Mizar website, a notable feature is the linking of the keyword "by," which connects to ATP proof objects rendered by the MML query system. An example illustrates that our system renames constants for uniqueness within the MPTP framework, as shown where the constant 'c1' becomes 'c11001' with the subscript denoting the current Mizar proof level.
