The Freemed FM040(BP) device is equipped with passive sensor plates made of resistive, conductive rubber with a gold coating. The apparatus has the capability to record data at rates as high as 500 samples per second and features a usable surface area of 40 by 40 centimeters. It is managed via the dedicated Freestep software, which allows for a variety of assessments including static, dynamic, postural, stabilometric, and biomechanical (specifically gait) analyses.

The reason for selecting this particular instrument is grounded in its established dependability and validity for appraising balance control while standing. Additionally, when considering a set duration for the trials in question, the total Center of Pressure (CoP) path length is found to be comparable to the average CoP velocity (which is determined by dividing the path length by the time period).

Our study aimed to determine the accuracy of the Wii Balance Board as a tool for assessing balance, a task typically performed using a baropodometric platform. We examined the outcomes of two balance tests: standing with both eyes open and eyes closed. The focus of our comparison was on the total CoP path length, as this metric is considered both reliable and valid for measuring balance while standing.
