This academic paper discusses the criticality of diagnosing and managing faults in large-scale power systems, with a particular focus on HVDC (high-voltage direct-current) systems. Due to the complexity of these power systems, it is important to anticipate and mitigate faults caused by factors like insulation failures, short circuits, switching operations, and lightning strikes. Lightning, in particular, can induce overvoltages either by direct strikes or by secondary effects such as back flashover. The paper stresses that protective measures must be applied to both the AC and DC components of an HVDC system.

The paper's primary aim is to devise an analytical approach to identify the most critical points for the placement of surge arresters, which are devices used to protect electrical systems from overvoltage transients. By using a simulation-based approach on a model VSC (voltage-source converter)-based HVDC system, the study identifies key locations for surge arrester installation, ensuring an optimized number of these devices. This method significantly reduces costs associated with protection equipment.

The paper then outlines its structure, detailing the prototype system in Section 2, the process for selecting arresters in Section 3, and presenting simulation and lightning impulse test results in Sections 4 and 5. The discussion and conclusion follow in Sections 6 and 7.

The study also touches on the importance of considering the lightning ground flash density in determining the exposure risk to lightning strikes and the suitability of surge arrester characteristics, such as their energy capacity and voltage level compatibility. It considers heavy distribution class arresters for the prototype system in question, based on the voltage level and expected lightning impulse currents.

Focusing on the characteristics of surge arresters, the paper mentions that larger metal-oxide resistors provide better energy transfer potential and therefore offer better protection. Additionally, accounting for the aging of insulation and statistical uncertainties is recommended when choosing a protection factor for device insulation.

The paper concludes that the protection method it proposes is indispensable. It aims to ensure that the thermal charge generated by a lightning strike remains within safe limits, thereby protecting the integrity of surge arresters. This optimization contributes to both system protection and economic efficiency by minimizing the expenditure on protective devices.
