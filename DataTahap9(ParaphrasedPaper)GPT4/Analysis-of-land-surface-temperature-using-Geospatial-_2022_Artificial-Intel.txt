The prevailing loss of vegetation across the globe is predominantly due to human activities. This reduction in vegetation cover is linked to an increase in land surface temperature (LST), which is a vital sign of the ecological health of the environment. It reflects the "skin temperature" of the Earth and plays a crucial role in the study of regional and global land surface processes. LST has been observed to rise universally as a result of changes in land use and cover, with studies in various regions of Ethiopia demonstrating a marked upward trend. This trend of increasing LST parallels a significant rise in atmospheric temperature as well, exacerbated by changes in land use and cover.

To quantify land degradation, indices like the Normalized Difference Barren Index (NDBAI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) are applied. These indices, alongside the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), offer insights into the environmental conditions affecting living organisms by indicating the presence and abundance of vegetation cover.

Spatial analysis of NDVI, LST, NDBAI, and MNDWI is critical for decision-making and natural resource monitoring in environmental research. NDVI, in particular, is recognized as an effective tool for representing the distribution of green spaces. Although there has been precedent for utilizing these remote sensing indices to model LST, there have been limited studies comparing index data from different years to monitor surface temperatures.

Agricultural expansion is a primary factor driving climate change, notably LST changes, in the western regions of Ethiopia. However, no research has been conducted specifically in the districts of Gida Kiremu, Limu, and Amuru. It is clear that in these areas, LST has increased over time due to vegetation loss driven by agricultural expansion, wetland degradation, and the rise of barren lands. The present study seeks to analyze LST with the aid of remote sensing indices such as NDVI, NDBAI, and MNDWI in western Ethiopia.

This paper is structured as follows: the introduction outlines the general context of LST and its relationships with various indices; the second section details the methods and materials, including descriptions of the study area, data types and sources, and the analytical methods; the third section presents the results and discussion; and the final section offers conclusions drawn from the study's findings.

The research area experiences an average monthly rainfall ranging from 14.32 to 338 mm/year, with heavy rainfall during the summer months of June to September, and a shorter rainy season in spring, spanning March to May.
