In the realm of concurrent programming on general-purpose operating systems for PCs, threads are crucial, whereas interrupts are key for expressing concurrency in simpler embedded systems using microcontrollers (MCUs). Given the extensive deployment of these MCUs, many of which function in critical applications like vehicle control and medical devices, ensuring their software is free from race conditions is vital. This was exemplified by the severe failures in the Therac-25 medical device, partially caused by such race conditions.

Unfortunately, current methods to verify interrupt-driven software for race condition issues are underdeveloped. The paper seeks to understand interrupts to improve the application of thread verification tools to interrupt-driven environments, proposing minimal extensions to these verifiers to enhance their efficacy. The paper also aims to leverage the nature of interrupts to produce quicker, more precise checks.

When discussing threads, the paper assumes the familiar POSIX-model, known for preemptive and potentially blocking behavior. Unlike threads adhering to symmetric preemption, interrupts can preempt typical code but not vice versa and often prioritize interrupts for scheduling.

On some devices, prioritized scheduling of interrupts is hardware-enforced, such as on PCs, while on others, like the Atmel ATmega128 MCU, it's software-managed, leading to complexities when implementing preemptive priority-based scheduling.

Interrupt-driven concurrency control differs from threads; to manage it, systems either globally disable interrupts or selectively disable those that could conflict with current computations.

The AVR X system's interrupt handlers are reentrant to ensure responsiveness, though this has drawbacks, like potential increases in average latency for later portions of the handler. Recursive lock handling, which permits multiple safe acquisitions, isn't covered in the discussion since it aligns closely between threaded and interrupt-driven codes.

The authors created a plugin to convert programs from the TinyOS operating system into POSIX thread programs, which are then checked for race conditions using a tool called Locksmith. This was made possible by a transformation tool that took an author about five hours to implement, highlighting the feasibility of their approach.

Operating systems often combine interrupts, threads, and other deferred call mechanisms like DPCs in Windows and tasklets in Linux. Though various lock types are available to handle different concurrent constructs, the complexity in large codebases challenges the creation of error-free software. The paper underscores the need for structured reasoning to approach diverse concurrency models and references prior work: TSL as an initial step toward this goal.

The authors acknowledge that interrupts are susceptible to bugs beyond race conditions, but they explain that no straightforward method exists to detect such errors through a straightforward translation to threaded models.
