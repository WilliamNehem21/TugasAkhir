The prevailing methodology for modeling applications built from components is to use the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with additional customizations, known as a profile. While this common and adaptable method can capture specific details of a given component model, it has drawbacks due to UML's own limitations, such as poor scalability and a lack of intrinsic semantics.

In this research, we present an alternative approach that addresses these limitations via a purpose-built meta-model designed specifically for component descriptions and component-based software. This meta-model stands out for its application of a faceted classification system, which adds deeper semantics and structure to the models created with it.

We explore the capabilities and benefits of this novel meta-model, using an example of a basic OSGi (Open Services Gateway initiative) application to demonstrate its practicality. The paper also suggests using this meta-model to visualize component-based applications more effectively.

One challenge with component model-specific descriptions is that they are not easily comprehensible to experts outside the domain of that particular component model. This can be exacerbated by model-specific graphic notations, which might be unfamiliar to others.

Conversely, a general application description, such as that provided by UML 2.0, enables cross-domain information exchange but doesn't delve into the intricacies of specific component models. This can lead to a superficial understanding of the application's architecture. Moreover, certain component constructs, like events, can be challenging to model in UML, despite their importance.

We acknowledge previous work in the field that focuses on creating generic tools to manage various component models used for software composition. These approaches share similarities with our proposal but differ in their implementation and goals.

UML, with its universal design backed by a meta-model, allows for customization through profiles, stereotypes, tagged values, and constraints to add specific details. Our proposed meta-model goes beyond this by providing constructs for defining concrete components and applications composed of these components. This specificity ensures that each component trait within an application is meaningful and relevant.

However, some traits and information might be unnecessary or even confusing, depending on the user's role, such as software architects or programmers. To avoid information overload, our meta-model allows for the categorization and filtering of traits, enabling users to see only the relevant data for their needs.

The proposed meta-model's advantage lies in its close alignment with actual components. It organizes component elements into traits based on a user-defined classification system that captures their perceived characteristics, facilitating both human understanding and machine interpretation of component representations. This meta-model also delineates the relationships between components and supports their hierarchical decomposition.

In summary, this paper suggests a meta-model with a unique classification approach to improve the modeling, interpretation, and visualization of component-based applications, aiming to address the scalability and semantic limitations present in the standard UML profile-based method.
