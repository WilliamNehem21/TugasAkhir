Cellular biology greatly depends on the understanding of compartments and membrane functions. Thus, representing these elements in computational biology languages is highly beneficial. Bio-PEPA, a language for modeling biochemical networks, currently supports compartments mainly as categorical labels indicating the location of molecular species. 

Compartments are crucial for biological processes, wherein compartmental membranes are critical for controlling the internal and external exchange of molecules through both passive and active transport mechanisms. The functional importance of membrane proteins in processes like signaling cannot be overstated.

Bio-PEPA, introduced for computational analysis and representation of biochemical systems, reflects the basic structures and reactions of molecular species within static compartments, which are not dynamic in terms of size or structure. This language typically assumes either uniform compartment size or singular compartment models within these biochemical systems. However, there's a need for this language to model multiple compartments with varying sizes more effectively.

The present work proposes enhancements to Bio-PEPA to better represent complex multi-compartment models by introducing a generalized concept of location which includes both compartments and membranes. In doing so, a new notation allows for concise representation of species in multiple locations, offering a clearer understanding of how reactions vary by location.

Further analysis of these systems is possible through various methods including Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). For CTMC analysis, a fixed compartment size is assumed, highlighting a current limitation in modeling variable-size locations.

Ultimately, these Bio-PEPA extensions aim to reconcile high-level abstraction commonly found in literature with the capacity for a detailed representation of systems incorporating differential compartment sizes, as derived from experimental data. This revised language supports different types of system analyses, which can provide insights into the system's behavior and verify system properties, potentially uncovering modeling errors or unobservable outcomes from simulations alone.

The paper concludes by emphasizing that Bio-PEPA is now better equipped to model biological compartments, allowing for the explicit representation of membranes and facilitating the modeling of transports among and reactions within various compartments.
