In this section, the paper discusses the use of graph transformation systems (GTS) incorporating a temporal dimension to model optimization problems. An example given is a variation of the job-shop scheduling problem called the personalization machine, which was analyzed in the AMETIST project.

Graph transformation with time introduces a time attribute to graph nodes, which behaves like a logical clock with non-negative integers, allowing the tracking of time passage in discrete increments. This temporal aspect is crucial in ensuring the evolution of the graph is time-consistent.

When applying graph transformations, the paper describes a 'guard' which checks for the presence of specific nodes, edges, and attributes in the graph (such as a node "convcell[cc1]" and an edge "mycell[p1][cc1]"). This also includes conditions on node attributes (like checking if "personalized[c1]" is true). Upon a successful match, state variables are updated: the paper mentions the removal of an edge labeled "pers hold" and the creation of a new edge labeled "conv hold". Additionally, the time variable is modified accordingly, in line with the rules specified by graph transformation systems that consider time.
