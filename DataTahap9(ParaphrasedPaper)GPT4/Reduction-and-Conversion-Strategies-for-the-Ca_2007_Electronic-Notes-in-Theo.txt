The academic paper discusses various approaches to optimizing the conversion and reduction processes in the Calculus of (Co)Inductive Constructions (CIC), an important framework in the field of type theory and proof assistants. The paper aims to improve performance by analyzing different combinations of conversion strategies, which determine when and how terms are compared for equivalence, and reduction strategies, which affect the normalization of terms.

The study involves parameterizing both the conversion algorithm and the reduction machine so that their behavior can be adjusted independently of the specific rewriting rules used. By experimenting with different strategies and combinations thereof, the authors intend to identify methods that reduce computation without sacrificing correctness or efficiency.

In particular, they explore strategies suitable for both typical cases and more complex situations involving two-level reasoning. Although further research could yield strategies tailored to specific types of terms, this direction has not been extensively studied for CIC at the time of the paper's writing.

The paper details a fundamental conversion algorithm adaptable to cumulativity and employs a judgment that, when viewed as a rewriting system, introduces critical pairs that must be addressed with strategic choices. The authors use benchmarks to examine the impact of different strategies on type-checking time within Matita, an interactive theorem prover, using a subset of the Coq proof assistant's library.

The paper reveals that certain strategies can particularly improve performance in cases involving identical terms or where one term is likely to reduce to another. Moreover, they highlight that performance can be somewhat independent of the conversion algorithm chosen, meaning that the efficiency of strategies doesn't necessarily depend on the details of term representation or rewriting rules. The potential independence is something the authors plan to evaluate in future work.

Lastly, the paper includes findings that certain convertibility strategies tend to be more effective than others, with call-by-name (and its call-by-need variant) generally outperforming call-by-value under most conditions. However, for some complex theorems, such as those involving two-level reasoning, call-by-value has proved more efficient. The authors note that this is not consistently the case across all theorems tested.

Overall, the paper contributes to the ongoing effort to refine the performance of proof assistants like Coq and Matita by offering insights into the interplay between conversion and reduction strategies within the CIC framework.
