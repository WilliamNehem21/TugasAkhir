Numerous studies have examined the relationship between stock market trading volume and returns. Some research has found connections, both correlational and causal (Chen & Song, 2000; Wang & Wu, 2002; Zada, 2021), while others argue the link is weak (Karpoff, 1987) and that volume doesn't drive returns directly (Alhussayen, 2022; Lee & Rui, 2002). Clark's mixed distribution hypothesis (1973) and subsequent work provide one theoretical framework for these relationships.

Certain researchers also investigated whether trading volume can forecast market volatility. While Brooks (1998) identified minor improvements in volatility prediction when including lagged trading volume, similar studies by Liu (2007) and Yang (2005) reported limited evidence supporting a connection between volume and market variability. Sun et al. (2019) found trading volume data to be predictive for stock volatility but had only an indirect impact on prices in the foreign exchange market, suggesting that while market maturity affects this relationship, trading volume still has relevance regarding market swings.

This paper is structured to first provide an overview of econometric models like the linear VAR and MS-VAR models, followed by an empirical analysis of China's stock market using the MS-VAR model. After a robustness analysis, the paper concludes with potential policy implications.

The VAR model, developed by Sims (1980), analyzes multiple time series variables that are endogenous and includes lagged values. A linear VAR model presumes linear relationships among these variables. However, Hamilton (1989) expanded the VAR to account for different states or regimes where relationships might shift due to policy, environmental changes, economic conditions, or external shocks, resulting in the MS-VAR model that can adjust for these nonlinearities and reveal hidden market states.

Findings for China's stock market indicate that in a high volatility regime, trading volume and volatility had significantly higher intercepts compared to lower volatility states, but returns were not significant. Increases in trading volume and market volatility occurred with herd behavior among investors. Conversely, during the initial dip in a bear market, high trading volume and market volatility arose from rapid selling while the market's information seemed chaotic, leading to negligible returns.

Furthermore, the study observed that while trading volume does not have a strong impact on returns and volatility, the reverse effects are significant. This asymmetrical relationship poses a challenge for predicting changes in the Chinese stock market based on trading volume. Gebka and Wohar (2013) suggest that these dynamics may be due to private information and uninformed trading.
