We present a new graphical approach to developing calculi for multi-modal logics that are both sound and complete. These techniques provide a standard set of tools for articulating and processing modal expressions. We demonstrate our methodology by generating accurate graphical calculi for various multi-modal logics, which can include global and difference modalities as well as certain unique characteristics.

We propose a method that uses visual diagrams to define error-free and comprehensive calculi for multi-modal logics, which can lead to decision-making processes when feasible. These calculi are represented by diagrams, and transformations from one diagram to another are done through rules that visually embody the semantic attributes of modal operators. This approach allows for a unified and intuitive way to depict and operate with modal formulas, offering simple and refined alternative representations compared to traditional unorthodox rules.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces our graphical method for addressing modalities. In Section 3, we recapitulate some graph-related concepts and findings. Section 4 unveils a core graph calculus for modalities from which we demonstrate extensions to specific instances in Section 5. We express our methodological approach and scrutinize it in detail in Section 6. Lastly, we provide reflections on our graphical strategy in Section 7.

A graph consists of a finite collection of alternate slices; each slice includes an underlying draft and a special node. A draft, in turn, is an intricate sketch made up of nodes and arcs. These slices and graphs symbolize sets of conditions, whereas sketches place limitations on these sets.

A sketch is deemed as zero if it has an aesthetically pleasing expression witness. For any aesthetically pleasing sketch that is not zero, its natural model will be satisfied by the identity assignment. Consequently, a slice is deemed null if and only if it is zero.

We then observe these slices across two scenarios and note that an arc generated in this process will always have a shorter label than its origin, and that a particular slice, s2, is finished; no new arcs will emerge from shifting. Our analysis is framed by these slices.

Although the use of graphs in proofs is not entirely new, and systems that integrate Kripke semantics are gaining popularity, our work differs by introducing graphical calculi for certain modal logics and for propositional dynamic logic (PDL). The rationale behind the graphical rules corresponds directly to the semantic properties of the modal operators, which leads to straightforward formulations and intuitive applications, emphasizing that our rules successfully encapsulate the modalities' intended meanings.
