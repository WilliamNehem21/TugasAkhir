Agricultural crop production is currently challenged by a rapidly growing global population, diminishing resources, and the impacts of climate change. These issues have exacerbated food insecurity, with an increase of 85 million more people facing severe hunger in 2021 compared to 2016, as reported by the FAO. The situation worsened due to various factors, including inflation, conflicts, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The key to addressing this crisis lies in developing enhanced crop varieties that can thrive under diverse conditions, even as resources dwindle.

When breeding new crop varieties, researchers focus on the genotype, the genetic makeup that governs plant characteristics. For clarity, the term 'lines' is used to describe these genotypes in this paper. The interaction between a line's genetic makeup and its growing environment is crucial, a phenomenon known as genotype by environment interaction (GxE). This interaction means that a variety's performance can vary across different environments. Future crop breeding tools must simulate this GxE effect by incorporating both genetic and environmental data. The goal of this research is to create such computational tools to predict crop traits before planting.

Deep learning models, underpinned by artificial neural networks, are used to forecast crop yield by processing genetic and environmental variables. The composition of deep learning models includes input layers, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Fully connected neural networks are applied here, creating a learning system where each neuron's activity is based on the activity of all neurons in the previous layer, allowing the machine to predict outcomes based on complex data inputs.

The study uses historical weather data from CIMMYT's dataverse to gather environmental information, focusing on nine-month periods to encompass the pre-sowing and growing season of crops. However, there are gaps in the recorded data, particularly regarding harvest times. The training and testing of the model involve separating locations and genotypes to create different testing scenarios: one where test environments are seen but not the specific lines, and another where neither lines nor locations are observed during training.

Research has identified genetic markers that consistently affect yield regardless of the environment. Others are more influential under specific conditions. Using feature selection methods, the critical markers can be identified for yield predictions in both global and local contexts. Once these markers are established, neural network models learn to predict average yields, either across all lines within a certain environment or within specific lines across environments. These predictions are then combined to estimate the yield for individual lines in specific environments.

The models consider various environmental factors, but soil is a notable omission from the current dataset. Past research has highlighted soil quality as a significant yield determinant, so incorporating soil data could enhance yield predictions. Furthermore, while the models predict climate conditions for the growing season, they do not incorporate actual weather forecasts, which could be a valuable addition in future work.

In comparative tests, the F2 framework, which utilizes a combination approach for predicting line- and environment-specific yields and then merges these representations, showed improved performance over some existing models. The integration of text data from field notes extended the capabilities of this framework.

Ultimately, the F2 framework is effective in both observed and unobserved environmental scenarios, with the observed scenarios yielding more accurate results. This corresponds with findings that environmental variables significantly influence yield predictions. Understanding both genetic and environmental impacts on yield can lead to better crop variety development and help mitigate global food security challenges.
