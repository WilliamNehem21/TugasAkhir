The paper discusses various methods for image upscaling, a process where low-resolution (LR) images are transformed into high-resolution (HR) images. Traditional techniques show limitations in maintaining sharp details, often resulting in blurred or degraded HR images. To address this, a new method that uses an error-based interpolation approach is proposed. This method relies on errors between sampling points along the direction of image edges to interpolate missing pixels. However, this and other existing methods still fail to produce crisp, upscaled images.

To enhance image clarity during upscaling, some approaches have incorporated gradient information from the LR image. These methods utilize gradient features from neighboring pixels to better reconstruct HR images, with one specific method employing the slope of adjacent pixels to enhance texture details. For images with complex textures, a reconstruction-based method was introduced, although it proved time-consuming. Another innovative technique is a graph-based interpolation method designed to retain detailed information, sharp edges, and continuous textures in HR images by propagating information from known to unknown pixels.

Despite these advancements, none of the aforementioned techniques could fully address the high-frequency (HF) degradation during interpolation, which resulted in a loss of sharpness. The academic paper introduces a new method focused on preserving edges and textures to improve image quality during interpolation and maintain a natural appearance in HR images.

The concept of image interpolation involves estimating the values of unknown pixels (depicted as white circles) based on known pixels (shown in black). Typically, a weighted average of neighboring pixels is used, leading to errors like blurring, ringing, and artifacts. These issues underscore the need for a new interpolation technique that captures all edge and texture details without introducing artifacts.

Blur in interpolated images is often caused by inaccurate estimation of pixel values. To minimize blurring, an unsharp mask (USM) concept is applied before upscaling. A gaussian filter (GF) is used to smooth the image, denoted as GLR, and then a gaussian mask is applied over it to enhance the image.

In computer science, each solution can be represented by an egg in a nest, with a cuckoo egg symbolizing a new, potentially better solution. The objective is to replace suboptimal solutions in the nests with these new "cuckoo" solutions. The cuckoo search (CS) algorithm follows three fundamental principles.

Finally, the paper assesses the proposed interpolation method's efficacy using metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), and FSIM (Feature Similarity Index Measure), across different upscaling factors like 2x and 4x. A higher PSNR value suggests successful signal restoration.
