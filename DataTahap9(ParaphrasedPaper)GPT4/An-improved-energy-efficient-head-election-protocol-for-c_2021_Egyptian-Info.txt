Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), while a decade-old technology, are increasingly used in contemporary applications like healthcare monitoring, emergency response, and ecological surveillance. These networks face challenges such as limited battery life and low bandwidth, which can hinder their performance and sustainability. Clustering is an effective technique to manage energy use within WSNs. LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a foundational clustering protocol for WSNs, although it has limitations, such as its random selection of cluster heads (CHs), which can lead to inefficient energy use.

This paper proposes an improvement to the LEACH protocol by introducing a more strategic method for CH selection, prioritizing nodes with lower energy consumption. The refined protocol aims to extend network lifetime and enhance performance by ensuring CHs are chosen based on their communication cost rather than on random chance or indirect factors, which do not adequately address the energy concerns.

LEACH's original approach to CH selection, which can assign CH roles to nodes with low power just as likely as to those with high power, is critiqued. Additionally, LEACH lacks clarity on the constraints around the number of CHs and does not factor in the potential CHs' proximity to base stations or their remaining energy levels.

This research aims to optimize WSN energy consumption by implementing a waking-sleeping scheduling mechanism. This method determines the timing for CHs and their 'vices' or supporting nodes to wake up and carry out tasks such as data aggregation and transmission.

The paper is organized into several sections: a review of related works, presentation of the improved IE2-LEACH protocol, simulation results, and a conclusion with future research directions. The authors discuss other works focusing on energy-efficient clustering by considering node energy levels and distances. Some address balancing WSN energy consumption with scheduling mechanisms that alternate between active and sleeping nodes to optimize power use and coverage.

The key difference from LEACH's method is the setup phase, where this paper's approach avoids random CH selection, favoring a more systematic process that includes estimating the transmission cost impact on potential CHs' residual energy. The goal is to improve CH selection in LEACH to extend the network life, increase data transfer efficiency, and reduce energy waste across WSNs.
