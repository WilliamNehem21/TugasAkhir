In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for understanding two-dimensional linear algebra, which involves extending the principles of linear algebra to categories rather than just sets. This extension involves analyzing and interpreting the structures and processes in terms of categories that can host structures like algebras for a monad and coalgebras for a comonad. We focus on the category of small symmetric monoidal categories, also known as "symmons," to study fundamental notions such as pseudo-closed 2-categories, symmetric monoidal Lawvere theories, and the concept of commutativity within these Lawvere theories. We emphasize the significance of coalgebras in our framework, noting that they have a more foundational role compared to algebras, particularly in the context of these enriched categories.

We also discuss how the notion of algebras and coalgebras can be applied to linear algebra through the example of R-modules, which can be understood as algebras for a monad on the category of abelian groups, as well as coalgebras for a comonad. By considering enrichment in the symmetric monoidal closed category of abelian groups, we interpret R-modules as possessing both algebraic and coalgebraic structures.

Furthermore, we suggest that linear algebra has the potential for applications involving coalgebras, even though it is not immediately apparent that it is relevant to computer science. We speculate on the implications of replacing the structures involved in linear algebra—such as groups, rings, and modules—with their more general counterparts—such as monoids and semirings—recognizing that the essential character of R-modules is retained under these generalizations.

Our paper is organized into several sections, starting with an introduction to our concept of two-dimensional linear algebra, discussing the enhancement of traditional linear algebra with categorical concepts, and explaining the predominance of coalgebra in our framework. Following this, we introduce the notion of symmetric monoidal Lawvere theories and address the requirements for such a theory to be considered commutative.

We explore the challenge of describing a comonad for non-commutative symmetric monoidal Lawvere theories and propose two strategies to overcome this challenge. The first strategy is theoretical development of a certain kind of 2-category structure, with the aim that, within the next few years, we should demonstrate that symmons possesses this structure. The second strategy pertains to the removal of the commutativity condition but still obtaining a different form of comonad.

The remainder of the paper delves into the details of symmetric monoidal Lawvere theories, both commutative and non-commutative, and the construction of coalgebraic structures on symmons that can correspond to these theories. We discuss specific examples of pseudo-commutative monads and explain how these examples confirm or challenge our theoretical framework.

In conclusion, the paper lays out a novel approach to linear algebra through the lens of higher-dimensional category theory, reinterpreting traditional algebraic and coalgebraic structures in a way that has the potential to unlock new insights in the field and potentially in computer science.
