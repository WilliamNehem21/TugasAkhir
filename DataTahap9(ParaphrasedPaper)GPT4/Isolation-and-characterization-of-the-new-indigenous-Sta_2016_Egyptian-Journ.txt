This academic paper suggests that the northeastern region of India, particularly Assam, is a region rich in biodiversity yet largely untapped for its potential in economically important microbes. The local population of Assam utilizes beneficial bacteria to produce traditional fermented foods like yogurt and cheese. However, the specific microorganisms involved in these fermentation processes, particularly in fermented fish and meat which are a staple of the local diet, have not been thoroughly studied. Accordingly, researchers aimed to identify and characterize indigenous probiotic strains within these traditional fermented products. This research prioritized safety and the potential for application of the strains, as well as their ability to survive the gastrointestinal tract to confer health benefits to the host.

The study made use of chemicals and consumables from Merck India Pvt. Ltd., and microbiological media from HiMedia India Pvt. Ltd. Bacterial growth was monitored using a Shimadzu UV-1800 UV-Vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm, while centrifugation was conducted in a Sigma 3-30K centrifuge, made in Germany.
