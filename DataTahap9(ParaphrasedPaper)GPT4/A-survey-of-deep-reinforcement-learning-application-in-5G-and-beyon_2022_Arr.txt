This paper investigates the use of deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) in optimizing 5G network slicing, which doesn't require pre-set traffic profiles and finds solutions for maximizing utility within the network. Although deep RL can struggle with complex state-action spaces, a problem known as the curse of dimensionality, leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) can overcome this issue by improving feature extraction and policy search in multi-domain scenarios.

The paper builds on existing literature, including Bayesian methods in reinforcement learning (RL), the applications of RL in economics, and the extension of RL concepts like inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL). It also touches on cognitive and autonomous solutions in 5G networks, with a comprehensive review of AI and ML applications in the field.

Distinguished from previous works, this research delves into the application of deep RL in essential network slicing functions, like slice topology management, resource allocation, admission control, and forecasting. It reviews RL platforms and introduces recent advancements that can enhance RL agent training. The paper emphasizes the potential of deep RL in wireless communication, providing an extensive list of tutorials, books, and open-source platforms that could help with AI agent development.

Deep Q-learning, experience replay, and network cloning are highlighted as effective techniques for improving off-policy Q-learning in network slicing applications. Recent research on deep RL has demonstrated its efficacy in maximizing network utilities while ensuring quality of service in heterogeneous networks.

The paper also gives a historical perspective on wireless communication, from Marconi's first wireless message to the development of 5G networks, which incorporate technologies like NFV and SDN. It discusses the evolution of network virtualization, including the role of hypervisors, network slicing, containerization, and orchestrators such as ETSI NFV MANO.

With the complexity of 5G networks, AI/ML tools like deep RL offer promising solutions for managing resources more efficiently than traditional statistical models. The authors explore how deep RL can optimize radio and core network slicing, resource management, and slice admission control, outperforming conventional methods.

In conclusion, the paper stresses the importance of deep RL in traffic forecasting and prediction to manage network slices effectively. The research points to a need for further development of algorithms that cater to the dynamic needs of 5G networks and their various stakeholders, recognizing a gap in current research on slice traffic forecasting and prediction.
