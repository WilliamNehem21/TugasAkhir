This paper proposes a plan for organizing river boating schedules to achieve minimal interaction between different groups of boats, maximize the number of visits, and utilize campsites efficiently. Three groups of boats – motorized with varying trip lengths, oar-powered rubber crafts with different durations, and more motorized boats with varied trip lengths – are to be launched daily without overlapping to avoid contact. The river's carrying capacity is 238, implying a need for at least that many campsites, and the total number of visits over six months is 3,163. The scheduling strategy aims to balance the even distribution of boat types and propulsion methods with the highest possible number of river visits.

The key goal is to develop a schedule that minimizes boat-to-boat contact while maximizing visitation rates and campsite use. Adjusting the number of boats launched or the interval time between groups can increase 'x' – a variable denoting usage efficiency of campsites – but also raises the likelihood of boats coming into contact with each other. Conversely, fewer boats or longer intervals can reduce this contact. Thus, there's a trade-off to be optimized.

To simplify, the problem is viewed from two separate angles – minimizing contact and maximizing usage – before combining insights to create an optimized schedule. The launch time begins at 6:40 am, with a six-month period consisting of 180 days. For the initial 161 days, a consistent launch of 19 boats per day is maintained. However, starting from day 162, either the oar-powered crafts or the motorized boats for 19-night trips become unavailable, leading to a decreased launch rate until day 175 when no departures are scheduled.
