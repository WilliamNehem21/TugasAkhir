In this paper, the authors address the importance of timely and early identification of stress factors affecting paddy crops during the booting stage, which is crucial for protecting the quality and quantity of the crop yield. Traditional methods of identifying crop stress, which are primarily based on visual assessments by human experts, tend to be subjective and prone to errors, potentially leading to ineffective stress management decisions.

To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes an automated approach using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) framework to recognize and classify different biotic and abiotic stress factors affecting paddy crops by analyzing field images. Leveraging the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN model, the system shows strong performance, achieving an average accuracy of 92.89% on a separate evaluation dataset. This performance is based on a collection of 30,000 images of five paddy crop varieties across twelve different stress categories, including those that are healthy.

The paper also highlights the significance of paddy crop cultivation in the Indian agricultural economy, where it faces considerable production challenges due to drought, diseases, and pests, amid mounting pressures from population growth and socio-economic changes. It discusses the potential for integrating advanced crop improvement and management practices to address these issues.

While previous research has focused on using deep learning to identify and classify diseases and stresses on individual plant leaves, the authors conduct a comprehensive study focused on paddy crops and different plant parts. The research was conducted at the All India Co-ordinated Rice Improvement Project (AICRIP) and involved sixty experimental fields, along with five certified paddy varieties.

The study showcases the feasibility of using deep learning for automating the recognition and classification of paddy crop stresses, paving the way for the development of decision support systems and mobile applications to automate crop and resource management. The authors propose plans for future work that includes comparing the performance of VGG-16 with other state-of-the-art models and exploring the generality of the proposed approach for other field crops under varying environmental conditions.
