Pig farming plays a significant role in global meat production, particularly in China, with pork representing about 64% of all meat produced in the country and approximately 700 million pigs are slaughtered annually. China is a major pillar in the pork industry, producing 53.4 million tons out of the total 84.31 million tons of meat (which includes pigs, cattle, sheep, and poultry) in 2017.

Traditionally, pig body temperature is measured manually by inserting a mercury thermometer into the pig's anus, an approach that requires calming the pigs beforehand to ensure accurate readings and to prevent stress that could impact their growth.

Research has explored the use of infrared imaging technology in various areas, including the medical field. For instance, Xie et al. used it to study rat breast adenocarcinoma to test for anti-angiogenic drugs and found temperature changes that were not correlated with tumor size, suggesting poor vascularity of rapidly growing tumors rather than heat from angiogenesis caused by tumor growth. Infrared imaging in breast cancer was thought to reflect surrounding chronic inflammatory reactions rather than the tumor itself, implying potential prognostic value for the technology.

In dairy cow health, researchers have used infrared cameras to distinguish between clinical mastitis, subclinical mastitis, and normal conditions, noting variations in breast surface temperatures among these groups.

In the field of swine breeding, Meng et al. successfully used infrared technology to monitor the skin temperature of pregnant sows, helping identify when sows are in estrus based on higher vulva temperatures.

Advances in infrared image processing, such as active shape models and improved algorithms, have made it possible to handle large datasets, like processing 2 million infrared cow images. New methods for image registration and fusion have been developed, improving data collection on animals, such as tracking pig body surface temperature non-invasively.

These technological advances are being leveraged to evaluate pig health more effectively, such as by using infrared cameras to automatically extract temperature from pigletsâ€™ ears, aiding in health assessments.

Despite these innovations, infrared image processing faces challenges such as imaging noise, low contrast, and limited grayscale rendering, impacting resolution and accuracy.

Nevertheless, the integration of infrared temperature measurement with the Internet of Things (IoT) and automation is transforming pig farming towards more efficient, information-driven models. The non-invasive, real-time, and distant monitoring capabilities of infrared technology align well with IoT agriculture, promising bright prospects for the future of farming and breeding processes.
