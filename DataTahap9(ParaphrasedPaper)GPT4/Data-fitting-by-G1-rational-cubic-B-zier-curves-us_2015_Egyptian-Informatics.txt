The paper discusses key parameters of the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm such as the Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR), Pitch Adjusting Rate (PAR), and the Number of Improvisations (NI), which acts as the stopping condition. Harmony Memory (HM) is a storage for solution vectors, akin to the genetic pool in Genetic Algorithms (GA), where data is kept.

Evolutionary algorithms like HS, GA, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are all stochastic and based on populations, thus there's no absolute assurance that they will always find the optimal solution. The study challenges the idea that HS guarantees closer approximations to the optimal solution by statistically comparing its performance on an optimization problem against GA and PSO. This comparison utilized 30 samples measuring total least-squares error across four different scenarios for each method, and was conducted with constant time constraints for all data.
