The concept of higher inductive types (HITs) may be simple in essence, but a detailed explanation of their syntax and semantics remains incomplete. Although there have been discussions on their categorical semantics and on the semantics of specific examples within cubical sets, what exactly constitutes a higher inductive type in general has not been clarified. The "HoTT book" poses questions about what the general introduction rules for points and paths should entail.

In trying to devise a framework for HITs, similar to that created for inductive families, this paper suggests that point constructors for HITs may adopt a structure akin to constructors for traditional inductive types, while path constructors for HITs could parallel constructors for binary inductive families.

However, the authors decide to sidestep more intricate meta-theory, like inductive-inductive definitions, due to their complexity. Instead, they focus on "finitary" HITsâ€”those which represent most examples found in the HoTT book and are less convoluted.

Even if this choice simplifies the presentation, the authors argue that expanding their presented simplified model to capture the full generality necessary for various higher inductive types is both routine and tedious but feasible.

In their approach, HITs are modeled as inductively generated groupoids with point, path, and surface constructors. It is noted that creator types are, by nature, examples of the general form seen in finitary inductive families. This observation leads to the conjecture that the groupoid model for 2-dimensional HITs could fit into a basic extensional type theory topped up with a schema for such finitary inductive families.

This paper represents an incremental advance in developing a full-fledged theory of HITs. Future work could extend the theory to embrace dimensions beyond 2, consider induction in a more complex form, and address HITs that involve a wider range of constructor expressions. Further refinements, like reworking the theory of 1- and 2-dimensional HITs using degeneracies and restriction maps within cubical type theory, could facilitate the development of a more comprehensive understanding of HITs in this context.
