Proof assistants aid mathematicians in validating theorems by automating the granular aspects of logical reasoning. These tools often use textual interfaces to show proof information, which can be tough to interpret as proof complexity increases. Panoptes is a visualization tool developed to interact with the IMPS (Interactive Mathematical Proof System), offering a graphical means to inspect formal proofs. It translates the underlying IMPS deduction graph into an intuitive, interactive visual format, enhancing user comprehension and manipulation through various features such as zooming in on specific graph areas, offering floating details about proof elements, relabelling nodes for clarity, and condensing complex substructures for simpler viewing.

Named after a mythical being with extensive powers of observation, Panoptes serves the purpose of elucidating proof structures formulated by IMPS. These structures take the shape of deduction graphs, and Panoptes renders them as user-adjustable visual elements, beneficial even beyond IMPS's domain. The paper outlines Panoptes's key functionalities and how it is implemented.

One of Panoptes’s notable features is "target zooming," which simplifies user interaction with the proof graph. Users can magnify sections of interest directly, avoiding the typical multi-step process of zooming and scrolling that often leads to confusion. The software keeps a detailed log of user actions, allowing for easy reversal to previous states and preserving individual arrangements made during proof development. This is essential since IMPS typically adds but does not eliminate nodes, ensuring that efforts to manipulate the graph are not lost between proof stages.

Initially, Panoptes generates an organized layout for the graph, scaled to fit the display and minimizing edge crossings. Users can further customize this layout by manually moving graph components while the software maintains the integrity of node connections. Automatic labeling and color-coding enrich the clarity and visual appeal—colors denote different node statuses, such as green for grounded nodes and brown for nodes signifying cycles or converging proof paths.

Panoptes is created using Java and offers an innovative symbolic representation of semi-automatic theorem proving, as seen with formal proofs from the ACL2 theorem prover, which it showcases as three-dimensional, cone-shaped visualizations. Users have the flexibility to rotate these visualizations for a comprehensive examination, with the option to open separate windows displaying detailed node information. The system employs color rather than text labels to distinguish between various types of nodes, facilitating a clear and engaging user experience.
