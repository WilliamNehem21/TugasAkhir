In a social scenario, a trio of friends must decide who among them should be the designated driver for an evening out. Initially, they anticipate that Andrew will assume this role. However, Andrew expresses his reluctance and nominates Barry instead. The group consents to this change, but only if a majority shows a preference for Barry over Andrew. Upon voting, Barry is chosen, but he raises an issue: Charles has not been given any consideration. To address this, they establish that Barry will only drive if he is preferred over Charles by a majority; otherwise, Charles will take the role. Surprisingly, after voting, Charles is designated as the driver, even though Andrew was the favored choice among the majority at the outset.

The paper explores how such decision-making processes can be modeled, underscoring that posing an open question allows for multiple paths forward, each contingent on which "all else being equal" assumptions are disregarded. This contrasts with closed questions, where expanding complex formulas is more straightforward. An alternative angle for examining the decision-making process could involve the evolving consciousness of the decision-maker as they garner responses to their queries. Although there's existing research on logics of awareness, the paper authors are unaware of any technical overlap between those works and their own approach.
