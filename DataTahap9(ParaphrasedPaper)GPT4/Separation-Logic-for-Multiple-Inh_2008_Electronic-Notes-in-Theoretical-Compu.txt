The academic paper discusses the use of object-oriented (OO) programming languages to create modular software, highlighting the benefits of encapsulation and inheritance for code reuse and management. These advantages necessitate new formal methodologies for reasoning about and verifying OO programs.

The paper is organized as follows: an introduction to a C++-like language syntax, including inheritance and method overriding; the presentation of separation logic tailored to this language, encompassing a storage model, assertion language, semantics, and verification rules; a discussion on behavioral subtyping to ensure compatibility between subclass and superclass methods; an example illustrating this model's application to multiple inheritance; and a conclusion summarizing the work and outlining future research.

To simplify the formalism, the authors focus on pointer variables and exclude non-essential C++ features and arithmetic expressions, planning to incrementally include these in future work. They outline conventions used throughout the paper for class names, fields, methods, and variables, and emphasize the necessity of including the heap in their storage model, a key difference from classical Hoare logic.

The model differs from classical separation logic in representing the heap and avoids the standard assertion 'emp' by using 'x = null' to indicate a variable points to no allocated heap, thereby eliminating the issue of dangling pointers. The paper replaces traditional substitution in assignments with an auxiliary variable approach and introduces verification rules.

Behavioral subtyping is proposed to ensure compatibility between overridden methods across the inheritance hierarchy. An example shows how a class (Terminal) can inherit from two unrelated classes (Task and Display), demonstrating the approach for multiple inheritance verification.

The contribution of this paper lies in the extension of separation logic for reasoning in OO programs with multiple inheritance. It simplifies C++ syntax, establishes a storage model based on separation logic, and proposes verification rules that consider behavioral subtyping. Future work includes the extension of this logic for more complex inheritance chains and implementing the extension with additional C++ features, aiming ultimately for (semi-)automatic reasoning tool integration.
