The academic paper discusses the benefits of edge computing, a paradigm descended from distributed computing, which enhances service quality and resource utilization by harnessing nearby device hardware to deliver low-latency services to users. Like cloud computing, edge computing provides network-based services, but in a decentralized manner, bypassing the need for central server management. This client-oriented approach offers higher quality, more reliable, and secure services, making edge computing well-suited for applications such as the Internet of Things, wireless sensor networks, and smart cities.

The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows:
- Section 2 outlines preliminary concepts.
- Section 3 describes the system model and design objectives.
- Section 4 details the proposed edge computing scheme.
- Section 5 evaluates the scheme, including security and performance.
- Section 6 concludes the paper.

The paper also delineates a layered model including:
- Layer 2 (Service Provider), consisting of edge devices within a 5G network that offer rapid service response and quality data transmission. Unlike traditional edge computing, the proposed Software-Defined Edge Computing (SDEC) utilizes software-definition for more flexible resource scheduling.
- Layer 3 (Server/Controller), featuring an Edge Service Controller (ESC) that manages resources and orchestrates collaboration within the edge computing environment. The ESC is also entrusted with auditing data integrity.

The proposed scheme aims to ensure data integrity within edge computing by periodically auditing data blocks in edge devices. The auditing results contribute to assessing the devices' reputational standing in data storage.
