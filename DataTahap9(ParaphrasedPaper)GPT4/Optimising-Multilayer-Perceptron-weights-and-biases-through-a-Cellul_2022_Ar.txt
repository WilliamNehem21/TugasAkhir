Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in current medical advancements due to its capacity to process vast amounts of data from various sources, which far exceeds human capabilities. For example, AI can process the same number of radiographs in an hour that a radiologist technician would analyze over 40 years.

This paper explores the use of the Cooperative Genetic Algorithm (CGA) to optimize the weights and biases in Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for medical data classification. A newly developed crossover operator, the Damped Crossover (DX), is introduced to enhance the CGA's performance in searching the solution space, aiming for a reliable method to improve the MLP's classification quality.

MLP learning involves an iterative process to determine optimal weights and biases to reduce classification error, but this process can get stuck in local optima or be dependent on initial values. The author highlights several studies using bio-inspired algorithms like the Biogeography-Based Optimization Algorithm (BBO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA), among others, to address these issues in training MLPs.

The CGA method proposed in this work utilizes the concept of neighborhoods to focus on local search and exploits the slow spreading of the best solution for both exploration and exploitation of the search space. The DX operator leverages knowledge from the best individual and modifies parent influence throughout the evolutionary process, emphasizing convergence in later iterations.

The paper stresses the importance of evolving new genetic operators to navigate the search space numerically better. Testing of the metaheuristics was executed on the Toko cluster with powerful computational resources, with results indicating that CGA with DX crossover can achieve competitive accuracy across various datasets, despite fitness value not always correlating to accuracy.

The author concludes that while all metaheuristics tested delivered similar outcomes, CGA with DX crossover showed promising classification capabilities. This highlights the importance of appropriate operator design in the optimization process to enhance MLP training performance for more reliable medical data classification.
