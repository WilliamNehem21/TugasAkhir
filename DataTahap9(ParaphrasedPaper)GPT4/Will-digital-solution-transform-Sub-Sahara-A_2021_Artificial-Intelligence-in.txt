Although advancements in agriculture enhance decision-making, they are not straightforward. Digital innovations, however, hold the potential to revolutionize agriculture by addressing significant issues like climate change, food insecurity, and environmental harm. These technologies improve agricultural productivity by enabling rapid exchange of information and access to novel data, benefiting the stakeholders.

Digitalization in agriculture (D4Ag) applies digital breakthroughs across agricultural value chains, assisting in overcoming agricultural challenges and supporting small farmers, food security, climate adaptation, and increasing the involvement of women and youth. By leveraging digital tools, D4Ag accelerates information dissemination to various agricultural actors, offering apps and resources for market prices, financial services, weather forecasts, pest alerts, etc.

The data for this broad review was gathered from a variety of academic and institutional sources, concentrating on recent research and targeting several keywords related to digitalization's impact on agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

In most of SSA, agricultural processing and value addition are minimal, with many countries still reliant on exporting raw agricultural commodities. Access to real-time market and price information remains a major challenge for African farmers.

ICT innovations boost efficiency by reducing the need for physical travel in value chains and allow firms to better monitor resources and employees, leading to stronger inter-firm networks and innovative business models. Research in Kenya suggests that smartphone adoption by farmers enhances their knowledge, options, and access to digital markets.

Despite high population growth, food production in SSA has not kept up due to the region's low productivity rates. The complex challenge of increasing agricultural productivity in SSA requires access to inputs, favorable policies, and efficient value chains, without which production growth is unfeasible.

Information asymmetry has historically limited farmers' market access and new technologies. Extension agents are critical in reducing such asymmetries, but face challenges including insufficient numbers and underdeveloped infrastructure.

ICT platforms can transform traditional extension methods by enabling easier, more personalized access to information for farmers. Studies show how digital advisory services, such as interactive voice response and market information services (MIS), can significantly improve small farmer productivity and income in SSA.

However, access to formal financial services is low in SSA, with mobile money services flourishing in some countries but not others. These services positively influence financial inclusion, aiding in economic advancement and alleviating poverty through improved financial management and savings, particularly for women.

Gender inequalities persist in access to digital technologies and agricultural information, but when women have mobile phone access, there's potential for increased household income and empowerment.

Critics point out that digital connectivity might not benefit all evenly, potentially strengthening larger firms at the expense of smaller ones. Moreover, while D4Ag solutions attract the youth, older farmers remain a significant demographic that is not effectively reached by these solutions.

SSA faces food insecurity challenges that digital agriculture can help address, but broader adoption of these technologies remains an issue. The region's digital infrastructure and policy support are not the sole barriers; rather, strategies that consider local conditions and digital literacy are essential for widespread adoption.

For SSA to harness digital agriculture's full potential, countries need to digitize their systems, replicate successful models, address the digital divide by regulatory means, and ensure affordable access to digital tools, particularly for poor and women farmers, by reducing data costs and implementing tax cuts.
