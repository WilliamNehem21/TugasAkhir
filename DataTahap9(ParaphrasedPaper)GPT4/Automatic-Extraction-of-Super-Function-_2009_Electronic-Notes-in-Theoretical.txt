This paper discusses an approach for enhancing machine translation by automatically extracting a large super-function (SF) from a Japanese-English bilingual corpus. The method involves matching nouns between pairs of sentences in Japanese and English using a bilingual dictionary. The paper presents the effectiveness of this SF extraction method in improving machine translation and discusses issues that arose from an evaluation experiment using the extracted SF.

The paper emphasizes the importance of machine translation in todayâ€™s world as people frequently encounter foreign language content on the internet. Despite the ubiquity of current machine translation systems, satisfaction levels are low due to poor accuracy and quality. The proposed method aims to tackle these shortcomings by focusing on the automatic extraction of SFs based on the nouns present within sentences of a bilingual corpus.

The research comprises several sections: the paper's purpose, an explanation of SFs in the context of machine translation, the methodology for automatic SF extraction, the experimental validation of the method, and finally, conclusions and future work. An experiment comparing automatic to manual SF extraction from 200 selected sentences demonstrated a 92% correspondence rate. Discrepancies were attributed to morphological analysis errors and insufficient noun classification rules.

A test involving 194,689 sentences with extracted SF and all SF from the experiment showed that translations resulting in the original sentences were deemed successful, while any other outcomes were considered failures. The results from a closed test indicated that while automatic SF extraction could facilitate translation, the existence of SFs with multiple translation options highlighted the need to refine the selection of candidate SFs for better translation accuracy.
