Qualitative research, particularly with video data, is time-consuming and resource-intensive, often requiring detailed descriptions and extensive manual analysis. The complexity heightens with 360-degree videos which necessitate further intricate interpretation methods. Nevertheless, advancements in AI, such as deep learning, have introduced potential efficiencies in video analysis, enabling automated feature extraction and pattern recognition. These AI methods can process and learn from large datasets quickly, offering more robust analysis.

Similarly, VR technology, specifically when applied to autism intervention strategies, offers controlled spaces for individuals to hone their real-world skills. These simulations provide predictable and structured environments to practice and build confidence. Technologies like VR enable customizability and immersive experiences, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals on the autism spectrum.

The application of AI in educational settings has garnered interest for its ability to support learning by analyzing educational data through data mining. This enables educators to tailor instruction to individual student needs, identify effective teaching methods, and improve overall student achievement and engagement.

An SVVR experience known as OSO was designed to assist autistic adults in mastering the use of public transportation by incrementally introducing skills through a combination of both low and high-tech tools. The study involved both autistic and neurotypical participants who viewed SVVR videos through an Oculus Rift. The research aimed to understand gaze patterns and behaviors in autistic individuals compared to their neurotypical peers.

However, the study recognized that using generic object detection models for specialized research may not be sufficiently accurate. Custom training of AI models on specific datasets is necessary for more precise predictions. The authors also acknowledged that while the initial findings offer new perspectives, additional exploratory research is essential for confirming the robustness and generalizability of the conclusions. Future studies with a more diverse range of participants and scenarios are needed for a comprehensive understanding of SVVR interactions.

During the preparation of their work, the authors utilized OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 to improve the manuscript's language and readability, asserting their responsibility for the final published content.

The discussions in question are part of an interdisciplinary endeavor to develop a multifaceted VR intervention for adults with autism, focusing on overcoming design challenges and promoting skill acquisition within 3D virtual learning environments.
