This academic paper discusses a study in which a method known as deep docking was implemented to search through an extensive molecular library, consisting of 1.4 billion commercially available compounds, while keeping computational resource usage low. This procedure encompassed initially selecting a subset of the library to train deep learning models, which were then used to identify molecules that are likely to show activity as potential hits. This training enabled the creation of a model adept at recognizing true positives, which was subsequently employed to analyze the remaining library. From there, those compounds predicted to have favorable docking scores were virtually hit-screened (VHS) against the crystal structure of the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR).

For further refinement, these compounds were filtered using pharmacophore models representing the interaction patterns of known A2AR antagonists. Pharmacophore characteristics such as the number of hydrogen bond interactions with Asn253 and a pi-pi stacking interaction with Phe168 were fundamental for all A2AR antagonists and therefore included in all models. Other interactions were considered variably, leading to the formulation of seven distinct pharmacophore models. After applying these models, 13,718 molecules that matched at least three key pharmacophoric features remained, with a significant number also displaying a hydrophobic interaction with Trp246, a common trait observed in most known A2AR antagonists.

The screening process concluded with a visual review of the filtered compounds, from which a final hit list for virtual screening was produced. To empirically verify the effectiveness of the computational technique, several compounds were selected and tested in vitro, resulting in the discovery of a set of novel A2AR antagonists.

The study also employed a cellular assay to measure the production of cAMP, a signaling molecule, in response to A2AR activation. This assay made use of time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) and employed europium-labeled cAMP tracers competing with cAMP from cells to bind with antibodies labeled with an Alexa Fluor 647 dye. The measured fluorescence signal, emitted at 665 nm, inversely correlated with the amount of cellular cAMP. An increase in cAMP production was interpreted as A2AR activation, while a decrease (evident from an increased signal) indicated successful blockage by antagonists. The inhibition rate by these antagonists was quantitatively determined using this assay technique.

The findings from this research illustrate the potential of the deep docking approach not only to expedite the virtual screening process involving very large molecular libraries but also to be integrated into traditional screening methods to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.
