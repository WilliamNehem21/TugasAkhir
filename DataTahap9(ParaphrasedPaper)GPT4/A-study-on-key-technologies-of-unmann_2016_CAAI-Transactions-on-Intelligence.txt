While machine intelligence remains unable to fully replicate the complex cognitive abilities of the human brain, it is nonetheless feasible to extract aspects of the driving task from human cognition and endow machines with the ability to perform certain repetitive, detailed, and enduring cognitive driving functions by mimicking our neurological processes. The overarching aim of autonomous driving technology is to relieve humans from the monotonous task of driving. This paper reviews and discusses the background, significance, current research, and core technologies of autonomous driving, adding insights from studies on brain cognition in driving and the optimal placement of sensors on intelligent vehicles, thus providing valuable references for advancing research in autonomous driving.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive sciences, automatic control, ground mapping, and sensor technology have significantly transformed the automobile industry. These technological advancements have ushered in a new era of wheeled mobile robots, or cars, that have the capability to drive intelligently, freeing human drivers from mundane tasks and fundamentally altering the interaction between cars and drivers, without necessarily changing the dynamic properties of the vehicles themselves. Consequently, cars are now seen as personal, mobile, and shareable resources.

In 2013, McKinsey & Company identified twelve disruptive technologies poised to shape future economies, with advanced robotics and autonomous driving technologies making the list. Autonomous vehicle research capitalizes on cutting-edge findings from multiple disciplines, marking an ideal testing ground for these technologies. Autonomous driving has become a global research focus due to its potential implications for civilian, military, and research applications.

Europe started investigating autonomous vehicles in the mid-1980s, focusing on the vehicles' ability to navigate independently within traffic without necessitating vehicle-to-infrastructure coordination. The PROMETHEUS project exemplified this research direction. By 1994, autonomous vehicles, such as VAMP and VITA-2, were operational on public highways, reaching speeds of up to 130 km/h.

From 2006 onwards, Europe has hosted the European Land-Robot Trial (ELROB) to evaluate the performance of land robots, including autonomous vehicles, in real-world conditions. These trials tackled both military and civilian applications, ranging from reconnaissance and fleet transportation to safety and disaster management. These events have significantly contributed to the progress of autonomous driving technology in Europe.

The National Natural Science Foundation of China initiated a significant research program in 2008 focused on cognitive computing of audio-visual information, which stimulated a wave of research in autonomous driving. Furthermore, the Foundation has organized a series of challenges intended to test intelligent vehicles' basic capabilities and autonomous driving skills.

The authors' research group has conducted experiments on autonomous cars integrating into real traffic flow. Notably, autonomous vehicles from the National University of Defense Technology and the Institute of Military Traffic have completed highway driving tests without human intervention, showcasing autonomous overtaking and lane-changing capabilities.

Despite advancements abroad, China's development of autonomous driving faces several challenges, including a lack of enthusiasm and deep involvement from automotive companies, and limited testing of autonomous vehicles in complex traffic environments.

By modeling the formalization of driving cognition and utilizing the machine's inherent advantages, such as constant vigilance and lack of fatigue, it is hoped that machine-assisted driving can meet, if not surpass, human driving abilities. The division of duties during driving allocates tasks such as sensory perception, memory, thinking, and decision-making—the intellectual aspects—to the human brain, while automation handles the driving coordination skills.

The authors underscore the analogy between human long-term memory, which stores driving-related experience and knowledge, and the driving map and operation models used by autonomous vehicles, constituting the system's prior knowledge. Real-time information from sensors and this prior knowledge combine to form a comprehensive data pool for decision-making.

Additionally, the paper recognizes that human emotional characteristics, which can sometimes interfere with safe driving, are not replicated in autonomous systems, thereby offering a potential safety advantage.

Autonomous driving systems may vary in sensor types, numbers, placements, and information processing capabilities, but establishing a standardized formal language for driving cognition facilitated by a software framework can enable universal compatibility.

The research group has carried out extensive autonomous driving trials, including successful inter-city highway drives without manual intervention, participating and excelling in China's intelligent vehicle challenge matches, and undergoing third-party tests.

In conclusion, autonomous driving research is progressing steadily, with promising results from tests performed under various conditions. The ambition is to perfect this technology, allowing machines to assume the responsibilities of driving and providing human drivers with the freedom to pursue other activities.
