Paraphrase of the academic paper excerpt:

Definition 2.2
Consider an Euler diagram 'C'. We define its corresponding Euler graph 'G(C)' as the edge-labelled, directed plane multigraph consisting of vertices that correspond to the intersection points within 'proj(C)' and edges that are represented by segments of curves in 'proj(C)'. In cases where a curve segment forms a loop, we designate one arbitrary point on the loop as a vertex.

The set {1, 2, ... , n} is established so that all lines radiating from them cross each curve precisely once. Building upon the work of Bultena et al., we connect the concept of the Euler dual with the property of ray monotonicity, which forms the foundation of our algorithm for creating diagrams.

Our method for area specification is effective for Euler diagrams that include a region representing the joint intersection of all curves and is applicable to all weighting functions. This approach also provides heuristic solutions for scenarios where there is no common intersection region.

(Note: The third paragraph seems to be a mix of contexts and may not be clearly related to Definition 2.2 without more content from the paper, hence a more general paraphrasing was provided for that section.)
