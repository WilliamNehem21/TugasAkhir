In 2006, G. Hamrin and V. Stoltenberg-Hansen conducted a study focusing on a category of special continuous domains that each feature a structure called an almost algebraic basis. This concept of an almost algebraic basis draws inspiration from earlier works, which the paper alludes to but does not specify.

The structure of the paper is as follows: After an introductory segment, Section 2 lays out key concepts and terms necessary for understanding the rest of the paper. Section 3 delves into the characteristics of almost algebraic domains. The subsequent Section 4 examines the traits of continuous L-domains that are equipped with countable, almost algebraic, and M-closed bases, as well as the spaces of functions that map between them. Finally, Section 5 proposes that continuous L-domains with almost algebraic bases form a cartesian closed category.

The paper goes on to affirm that the grouping of continuous and, by extension, algebraic L-domains remains invariant under the operation of taking finite cartesian products, meaning they are stable when paired with others in this way. This is supported by a lemma, with the full proof provided in the references [8, 9], that verifies the category of continuous L-domains, along with continuous functions, constitutes a cartesian closed category. Moreover, this category is considered one of the most comprehensive cartesian closed subcategories within the broader category of continuous domains.
