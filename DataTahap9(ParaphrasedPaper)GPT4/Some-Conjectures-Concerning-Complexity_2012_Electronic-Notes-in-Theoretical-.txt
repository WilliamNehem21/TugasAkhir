The computational elements of piecewise-linear (PL) topology play a significant role in various applications. Notably, extensive research has been conducted on whether a given simplicial complex can be geometrically realized in a low-dimensional space (e.g., RD), with further information available in references [6,7]. In contrast, the study of computational aspects of barycentric subdivisions is a more recent area of interest. Consequently, the authors believe it is beneficial to highlight some of the key unresolved questions in this field to the audience. This paper commences with a review of a fundamental theorem in PL topology, referencing standard terminology of PL topology and combinatorial algebraic topology.

The paper underscores the complexities of calculations between only two complexes K and L, noting the challenge in precisely determining associated numbers, even in specific instances. The authors refer to their prior work where they began to investigate cases where the dimension of L equals 0. The intricacy of this situation appeared to exceed initial expectations. Although many questions remain unanswered, the paper outlines several established findings in this domain.
