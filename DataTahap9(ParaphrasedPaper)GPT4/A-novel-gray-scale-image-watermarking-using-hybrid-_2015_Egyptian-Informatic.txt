Multiple research teams aim to refine a universal algorithm suitable for industrial application. Concurrently, digital media, like photos and videos, are at risk of unauthorized tampering, including the removal of watermarks. As a result, the watermarking technique must withstand common attacks on images.

Huang and colleagues introduced a new blind watermarking method using a backpropagation (BP) neural network in the wavelet domain. Using human visual system (HVS) characteristics, they have innovatively embedded a scrambled watermark so that it is robust yet inconspicuous. The neural network is employed to learn the relationship between the watermark and the watermarked image, enabling blind retrieval of the exact watermark later. Experimental studies indicate that this approach provides excellent imperceptibility and resilience against diverse image-processing attacks.

Motwani and colleagues created a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system (FIS), which inputs HVS parameters such as brightness, texture, and edge sensitivity of grayscale images. This inference system successfully inserts watermarks into the host image within the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain. The FIS utilizes 27 rules grounded in the need for extensive and varied training data. While fuzzy logic can manage imprecision and grants more system description flexibility, it has limitations in adaptability. Thus, combining artificial neural networks (ANNs) with fuzzy logic, the resulting neuro-fuzzy systems potentially enhance capabilities beyond what either standalone method could achieve. The watermarked scheme applies a hybrid fuzzy-backpropagation neural network (BPN) mechanism that translates fuzzy inputs to definitive outputs without requiring a vast training dataset. This hybrid approach addresses the adaptability issues inherent in pure fuzzy systems.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the theory behind the proposed hybrid fuzzy expert system based on BPN by Lee and Lu. Section 3 describes experimental procedures involving embedding, extraction, and robustness analysis. Section 4 delves into the discussion of experimental outcomes, leading to final conclusions in Section 5. References are listed at the document's conclusion.

In this context, "p=1, 2, 3,..., n" denotes the 'p-th' pattern out of a total of 'n' input patterns required for training the fuzzy-BPN. The bias value is represented as "i0=(1, 0, 0)", and "ipi" indicates the 'i-th' input.
