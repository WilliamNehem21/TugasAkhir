The academic paper introduces an action compiler that integrates with an action semantics-based compiler generator, producing code that runs faster than other action compilers, though it is still around two times slower than the code produced by the GNU C Compiler. By utilizing Standard ML (SML) for code generation, the implementation is straightforward and maintainable. This compiler has been applied to the core of Standard ML and a subset of the C programming language.

The paper outlines a system where the compiler's frontend connects with an action compiler to create a compiler for a specified language. Previous research established the feasibility of generating compilers with code execution times no more than ten times slower than handwritten compilers' code. By imposing certain restrictions and applying a complex code generation process within the action compiler, these results were achieved.

The compilation process involves several steps, with the action compiler executing type inference and code generation without optimizing the action. Instead, the code produced is easily optimized by the MLton SML compiler. Action semantics is a combination of denotational and operational semantics, where programs map to actions—rather than higher-order functions—modeling their behavior.

The paper also provides a detailed description of its main contribution, translating actions into SML, and evaluates the compiler's performance. It discusses the limitations of the action compiler while suggesting future improvements such as generating code that is more amenable to optimization by the SML compiler and enhancing the type inference algorithm to support a more extensive set of actions.

Key concepts in the paper include "actions," which are the denotations in the semantic descriptions; the action notation (AN), which formalizes actions; and the performance impact of different types of evaluation for actions, including normal termination, abrupt termination, and failure.

The authors reflect on previous works, mentioning systems that compile actions into different languages and discuss the intricacies involved in translating actions into efficient targeted code. They note that compiling actions into SML simplifies the code generation process due to SML's robust type inference capabilities, which in turn ensures generated code efficiency.

Finally, the paper highlights that the action compiler can currently handle user-defined data types to some extent and recognizes the need for further development in this aspect. The authors conclude with the intention to further refine the code generation and consider relaxing action restrictions to widen the applicability of the compiler generator system.
