This paper discusses the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture, emphasizing their role in enhancing the efficiency and automation of farming activities, and the challenges faced in their implementation.

At the onset of the data processing pipeline, data is obtained from databases in various formats, such as CSV or Excel files, and undergoes pre-processing like outlier removal and normalization. For training supervised machine learning models, data are split into training, validation, and test sets.

Communications with farmers have evolved from traditional methods to mobile and web applications, allowing them to manage farm operations through their devices. Performance monitoring systems in tractors measure critical parameters like power, fuel consumption, draught, and wheel slip. These systems utilize strain gauges, flow meters, and magnetic pickups, along with data acquisition systems, to optimize tractor performance. Spatial mapping of these parameters is enabled by Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS), which allows for monitoring relative to position.

Advanced tractors in developed countries are equipped with built-in navigation systems and sensors monitoring various field elements. These systems comprise both hardware (sensors, geo-location, fuel flow meters) and software (web applications and databases), with data communication facilitated by networks like LPWAN.

Drones represent a significant technological advancement in pesticide application, with two main components: the spraying system and the controller. In India, drones are becoming instrumental in precision farming practices due to their efficiency in data-driven decision making and soil and crop monitoring.

AI-based weed control systems utilizing components like Raspberry Pi, sensors, cameras, and sprayers use image classifiers, built on convolutional neural networks, to identify weeds and trigger herbicide application accordingly. This automation reduces herbicide use and associated health risks.

Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) systems automate processes related to livestock health and well-being by utilizing sensor data and AI models to monitor and make decisions. For example, automated systems identify estrus in cattle by analyzing variations in animal movement patterns and physiological sensors.

Greenhouse cultivation benefits from evaluating micro-climate conditions to design energy-efficient environments. IoT and decision support systems enable growers to understand crop growth and optimize climate control methods.

The paper acknowledges the challenges in data handling and processing, security, and communication delays in IoT applications. Despite these issues, IoT and AI have significant potential to automate and improve agriculture, with the advent of 5G expected to alleviate some of these concerns. The paper concludes by asserting that the ongoing growth of AI and IoT technologies presents opportunities to revolutionize agriculture, transform farming activities, and make them more efficient and farmer-friendly.
