The paper discusses how choreographies, which detail interactions and activities among services from a comprehensive perspective, can be used to automatically generate localized implementations or peers. However, the exact replication of choreography specifications in peers is often not feasible, an issue known as realizability. The research introduced an innovative approach of encoding CHOR choreography calculus into the FSP process algebra to support validation and verification through the use of the FSP toolbox (LTSA). Although methods like WS-CDL, collaboration diagrams, BPMN, SRML, and others exist for specifying choreographies, there's a gap in tool support for checking realizability and generating code, which this research aims to fill.

The paper is structured with an introduction to the CHOR and FSP calculi, a detailed method for encoding CHOR into FSP, an extension of this encoding to consider peer generation and analyze realizability problems, a prototype tool that supports the method including Java code generation, a comparison with related works, and concluding remarks.

The CHOR calculus serves to describe services from a global perspective, whereas peers are described locally through emission or reception of interactions. A stock market example involving three peers demonstrates the concepts. The FSP encoding enables using tool support for FSP to compile specifications into LTS and check with LTSA. Also, it aids in peering generation and realizability checking.

Despite successes, most existing approaches focus on theory rather than practical tools. This research provides a tool-supported, formal approach to address choreography realizability. The authors propose future work to extend the method to include asynchronous communication, acknowledging that while it complicates analysis and verification, it is a more realistic assumption for implementation platforms.
