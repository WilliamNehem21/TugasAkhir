Based on the definition of cd+1, the initial two properties are satisfied. Additionally, because the only new color a vertex's chromatic neighborhood receives is color d+2 from the inclusion of edges {e1,..., em}, the third property is also maintained. Consequently, cd+1 qualifies as an AVDTC (Adjacent Vertex Distinguishing Total Coloring) for the graph Hd+1.
