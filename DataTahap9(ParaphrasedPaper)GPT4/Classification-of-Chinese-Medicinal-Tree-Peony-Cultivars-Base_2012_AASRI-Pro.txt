The root bark of the tree peony, a medicinal plant with over 2000 years of historical use in China, has become a principal component in over a thousand traditional Chinese medical formulas and is now extensively used in cosmetics and health foods. Due to its popularity, there is an increasing market demand for high-quality tree peony root bark.

Cultivars of the Chinese medicinal tree peony have been developed through prolonged artificial selection and are now cultivated on a large scale across key production zones. In China, Anhui, Hunan, and Shandong provinces, as well as the Chongqing municipality, are the primary regions where these specialized medicinal tree peony varieties are grown, with each area having its own distinct cultivars.
