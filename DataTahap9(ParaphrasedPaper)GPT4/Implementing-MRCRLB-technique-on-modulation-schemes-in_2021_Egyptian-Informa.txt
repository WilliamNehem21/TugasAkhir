Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are utilized in diverse fields such as healthcare, military operations, industrial monitoring, and security systems. One key challenge they face is the limited lifespan of their battery-powered sensor nodes, especially when these nodes are placed in remote or difficult-to-access environments. As a solution, energy harvesting is proposed to replenish power in these sensors.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews existing strategies to prolong sensor node lifetimes and enhance remote charging capabilities in WSNs. Section 3 describes the design of a drone model based on magnetic resonant coupling (MRC). Section 4 introduces a novel architecture called MRCRLB, including its specifications. Section 5 discusses the results of testing this model with different modulation techniques. The paper concludes in Section 6.

Simulation results indicate that choosing the right modulation scheme is crucial and depends on the specific application and parameters of the WSN. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are suggested to remotely charge sensor nodes using MRC and load balancing to extend their operational life. The proposed MRCRLB model shows promise in boosting WSN longevity. To assess its real-world viability in relation to modulation schemes, BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM were tested. The findings suggest that 64QAM is unsuitable for rechargeable sensor nodes, while QPSK is the best option for smaller networks when considering average distance (AVGD). For larger networks, BPSK and 16QAM perform more effectively. Considering packet drops, BPSK is the most compatible modulation scheme for rechargeable sensor networks of any size. Therefore, the choice of modulation for a wireless rechargeable sensor network must be based on the network's size and the specific performance metric in question.
