This academic paper discusses methods for estimating parameters of finite mixture models (FMM) when dealing with incomplete data. The paper presents a novel algorithm that provides better estimations of FMM parameters from incomplete data compared to a modified version of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, especially when there are moderate to strong correlations between complete and incomplete dimensions.

The modified EM algorithm, referred to as EMH, is designed to work with incomplete data under the assumption that missing values are missing at random (MAR). However, this approach has limitations, as its accuracy in imputing missing values can be heavily influenced by prior information about the density functions of mixture components and the size of the fully observed data subset.

The paper introduces a new data augmentation (DA) computational approach to improve the learning of normal mixture models when faced with MAR data. This is achieved through a supervised classification method called robust mixture discriminant analysis (RMDA), which utilizes only the fully observed data to learn mixture model parameters. Despite its advantages, RMDA's effectiveness can also be affected by prior information and certain assumptions about the data.

To further advance the estimation of missing values, the paper proposes the incremental general regression neural network (IGRNN), which performs well when the data has strong inter-dimensional correlations. Combining the IGRNN with the EM algorithm leads to an approach dubbed IGRNNEM, which estimates missing values with the IGRNN before using the EM algorithm to calculate FMM parameters from the now complete dataset.

Performance comparisons are made using datasets with varying levels of missing values and noise. The paper makes use of well-known datasets such as the Wine and Iris datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, applying particular conditions for missing values and employing misclustering error (MCE) as a metric to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. The IGRNNEM algorithm demonstrates lower MCE, suggesting more accurate missing value estimations compared to the EMH algorithm, particularly in cases with moderate or strong correlations between data dimensions. However, when correlations are weak, the EMH algorithm, which relies on local correlations within clusters, may yield better results.

In summary, the paper proposes several algorithms to estimate missing values and mixture model parameters in FMM from incomplete data, highlighting the circumstances under which these methods are most effective and their dependence on the underlying data correlations.
