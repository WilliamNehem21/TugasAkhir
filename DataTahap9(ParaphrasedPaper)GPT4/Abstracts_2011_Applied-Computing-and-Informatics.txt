This study focuses on improving Arabic speech recognition for speakers with foreign accents using adaptation methods, specifically Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR), Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), and their combination. Utilizing the LDC-WestPoint Modern Standard Arabic Corpus and the HTK toolkit, the research tests these systems at both word and phoneme accuracy. The findings highlight substantial enhancements in recognizing challenging Arabic phonemes like pharyngeal and emphatic consonants when using a combined MLLR and MAP adaptation approach, with an overall performance enhancement of 7.37%.
