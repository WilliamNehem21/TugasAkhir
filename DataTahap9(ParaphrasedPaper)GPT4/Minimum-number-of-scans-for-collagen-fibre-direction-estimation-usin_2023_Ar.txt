This paper discusses the prediction of fiber directions using theoretical models for many potential orientations. Seidel et al. conducted a similar investigation on a sample from the human iliotibial tract, carrying out 35 scans restricted to two planes. They determined the fiber orientations by comparing the peak values of intensity vectors to hypothesized fiber directions.

For image acquisition, the volume images went through an initial alignment using rigid body registration, employing fiducial markers to guide the process, and then through a more flexible registration to correct for any shape distortions. This initial alignment depended on three fiducial markers that were attached to the specimen, which were essentially 10 mm diameter spheres filled with water that resemble paintballs. The described methodology follows that of de Oliveira et al.
