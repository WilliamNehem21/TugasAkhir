In revising an academic paper, it is proposed that the checking phase should be modified so that it does not remove objects that are not currently being used. However, this adjustment can lead to a new problem: an endless loop in the execution of the rule without generating any output, even when the required input objects are available. This is referred to as divergence. To address this, it is necessary to establish a system that prioritizes the processing of certain operations to ensure that if a specific input object is present, the rule will indeed be completed.

The concept of "prioritized choice" is an approach that can be used to create this hierarchy, ensuring that important processes are given precedence and that the system can progress to its output stage given the available inputs.

This approach to system encoding is highly modular and treats all objects the same way, whether they are catalysts or regular objects. This distinction between catalysts and common objects is only relevant during the pre-compilation phase for the purpose of verifying the correctness of P system rules. The significance of setting priorities will be explained further in the subsequent section of the paper.
