The paper presents an advancement in formal verification methodology for a first-order imperative programming language with procedures and local variables using higher-order separation logic (HOSL) in the Isabelle/HOLCF proof assistant. The assertion language of HOSL is constructed such that it supports a wide range of theories available in Isabelle/HOLCF, enabling the use of concepts like primitive recursion and fixed-point calculations.

Unlike previous verification approaches relying on first-order separation logic, which required extensions to the language's semantics, HOSL allows for the verification of complex algorithms within the existing semantics. The paper validates this claim with non-trivial examples and demonstrates that HOSL supports natural and intuitive specification assertions.

The programming language's syntax is described using deep embedding for commands, essentially creating a new inductive type, and shallow embedding for expressions. This dual embedding strategy prioritizes the development of separation logic for commands, while allowing for the incorporation of real programming language expressions into the shallow embedding easily.

Furthermore, the authors define the semantics of the programming language through the basic domain theory available in Isabelle/HOLCF, ensuring that each command adheres to the frame property central to the separation logic's frame rule.

The model focuses on local behavior, relying on the heap invariant that prevents skewed memory sharing, enabling precise formulas for data records combined using the properties of the separating conjunction operator.

They illustrate the application of HOSL through the verification of a garbage collector. This verification ensures that the garbage collector maintains the heap's structure and upholds the heap invariant, employing the concept of heap isomorphism.

The authors provide an example of formal verification, where a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to tree conversion procedure demonstrates the practical application of higher-order quantification within a Hoare triple in HOSL, exhibiting the proof rules for procedures and the essential nature of certain HOSL rules in the verification process.

As for future developments, the paper suggests case studies for formal program verification in more complex language settings, such as those with concurrency, first-class functions, or heaps containing procedures. It also proposes enhancing automation in reasoning within HOSL, potentially through tactics for entailment of HOSL formulas.
