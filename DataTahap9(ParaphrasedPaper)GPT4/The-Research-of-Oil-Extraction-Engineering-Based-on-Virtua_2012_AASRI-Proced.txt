This academic paper focuses on establishing a hierarchical structure model for more efficient and organized handling of complex models. The paper discusses segmenting the model tree and performing separate modeling before integrating these models together. The significant benefit of using this hierarchical approach is that it boosts the model's utilization rate, minimizes redundant effort, and facilitates management. The software 3ds Max supports this kind of hierarchical organization, further aiding in the management of complex models.

The paper also highlights optimization techniques such as instancing, Level of Detail (LOD) technology, and texture mapping when refining models. Instancing allows for the storage of a single instance of a tool or component in memory, which can then be transformed (translated, scaled, rotated) to replicate the tool without unnecessary resource expenditure. LOD technology is used to create models with different levels of detail that can be swapped dynamically based on certain rules, ensuring real-time model simplification without sacrificing visual fidelity. Texture mapping enhances the model's visual appearance without overloading the memory.

The document also explains how various technologies, such as fracturing, hydrodynamic techniques (like stopping water), and acidization, are utilized in production enhancement simulations. These simulations mimic the characteristics and behavior of liquids such as water, oil, and foam. The acidization process, for instance, uses the reaction of acid with rock to enhance permeability by creating or enlarging gaps and fractures.

Lastly, the paper describes a wellbore information processing and display system empowered by virtual reality technology. This system dynamically displays geological strata and operational measures, offering engineering personnel comprehensive tools for inquiry and analysis. It visually presents detailed information about the well's status and production measures. This interactive system aids onsite construction guidance, enabling collaboration among drilling crews and other teams and assisting in complex incident prevention and real-time decision-making.
