The research paper explores the growing complexity of security systems as the Internet of Things (IoT) leads to an increase in devices connected to the internet. A critical aspect of these systems is the process of data encryption and authentication to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is highlighted as a significant method used for data authentication, which verifies the authenticity of a statement without revealing any knowledge of the statement itself.

The paper discusses a proposed security method combining data encryption with the Advanced Encryption System (AES) and data authentication using the Zero Knowledge Proof technique. It builds on previous research by improving the authentication methods of ZKP. The proposed method is assessed through simulations comparing client and server transmission systems.

Experimental studies involve comparing the performance of the proposed method to existing approaches by encrypting and authenticating thirty datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method operates at higher speeds and performs better in terms of application security for data transmission systems, with authentication times around 5 ms.

The research underlines the importance of security systems for protecting different types of transmitted data, such as financial or private data, from interception and unauthorized access. It emphasizes the dangers of transmitting plain text data, which can be manipulated or controlled by hackers.

The paper introduces the proposed algorithm and compares it with previously developed algorithms, asserting that its method can effectively protect data from unauthorized access by incorporating encryption techniques. The method maintains the confidentiality of data, preventing Victor (a hypothetical adversary) from convincing a third party about Peggy's (the prover's) proof of ownership or learning any of her secret information. The paper claims that with repetitive testing, the chance of guessing Peggy's secrets remains extremely low.

For the encryption part, the Rijndael algorithm, developed by John Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, is highly efficient in both hardware and software implementations and is especially useful in wireless security as well as military and mobile communications.

In 1997, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States started a process to replace DES with AES, intending to secure government data across various departments. After reviewing fifteen proposals, NIST narrowed them down to five final candidates in 1999.

The paper also touches upon the complexity of the discrete logarithm problem in cryptography, highlighting its resistance to solutions in polynomial time and the relevance of modular arithmetic in making calculations for cryptography manageable.

Finally, the study proposes a method of enhancing ZKP for data owner recognition using the AES with the Rijndael algorithm. The proposed method, which involves two phases, aims at securing data transmission by ensuring that only authorized recipients can decrypt the encrypted data. The method is tested through simulations, demonstrating better performance with the time required for the authentication process being less than one second and more significant values for calculations, making security breaches more challenging.
