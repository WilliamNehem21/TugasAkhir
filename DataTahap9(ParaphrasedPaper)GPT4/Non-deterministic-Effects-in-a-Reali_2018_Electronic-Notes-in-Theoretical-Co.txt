To develop a model that integrates unpredictability with thoroughness, our focus is directed toward fully-developed power domains within the realm of domain theory. Power domains can be characterized in various ways, each being responsive to specific aspects of domain theory. Our aim is to select the characterization that most appropriately fits our particular theoretical framework.
