The use of cognitive architectures for analyzing the usability of human-computer interfaces (HCIs) has been widely studied. A particularly effective method for this analysis is syndetic modeling, which involves describing both the interface and a cognitive model within a unified specification framework to analyze their joint behavior. The paper proposes the formal description technique LOTOS as a language suitable for syndetic modeling and discusses four challenges associated with syndetic modeling, showcasing how LOTOS can address these issues.

The paper situates its work within the application of formal methods to HCI, specifically focusing on syndetic modelingâ€”a unique approach where the interface and a user's cognitive model are analyzed together in an integrated way using the same notation. The authors argue for the use of LOTOS, asserting it is beneficial for syndetic modeling due to its ability to handle complex interactions expected from the next generation of interfaces, which may include gestural and multi-modal interaction mechanisms.

Concerns about the cognitive demands of interaction tasks have traditionally been assessed through prototype system implementations and user trials, which are costly and time-consuming. The paper suggests cognitive models as a viable alternative for such assessments and describes the concept of syndetic modeling in detail. It emphasizes the challenges of model scalability, the need for hierarchical specification structuring, and the ability to hide complexity using the LOTOS hiding operator.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the interaction paradigm provided by process calculi and the LOTOS interactor model (LIM), which supports a structured description of interactive software components. Tools like LOLA and SMILE can simulate the execution of LOTOS specifications, while testing and model checking tools can be used to verify the specification satisfies certain properties.

The paper introduces goal formulation logic based on interval temporal logic to formulate cognitive properties and presents a case study analyzing the capabilities of human-computer interfaces in performing multimodal tasks, using both simulation and deductive reasoning for analysis.

In conclusion, the authors advocate for LOTOS in syndetic modeling, noting its novel application to modeling cognitive behavior and suggesting that it offers a balance between being too prescriptive and overly abstract.
