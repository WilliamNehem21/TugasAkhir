The paper introduces a new multi-module neural network system (MMNNS) that addresses the issue of imbalanced data in the classification of ECG heartbeat signals. The MMNNS system comprises four submodules: preprocessing, imbalance problem processing, feature extraction, and classification. To tackle the imbalance problem, the system employs three techniques – Borderline-SMOTE (BLSM) for resampling, Context-Feature Module (CTFM) for data features, and Two-Phase Training (2PT) for the algorithmic aspect.

BLSM generates synthetic samples near minority class samples to increase their presence in the data set. CTFM, which has two parts, extracts features using denoising autoencoders and selects features related to the QRS complex to identify heartbeats more accurately. After feature extraction, the data is processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using 2PT, where the network is trained on balanced data and then fine-tuned with the original unbalanced data.

The MMNNS system was trained and tested on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database following the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards, with both intra-patient and, importantly, inter-patient division schemes—where the latter is less commonly used but provides more generalizable results.

Comparative results with several state-of-the-art methods across three datasets prove MMNNS to be superior in dealing with imbalanced ECG heartbeat data classification, as evidenced by several classification metrics and statistical measures.

The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of the MMNNS system, particularly the significance of addressing dataset imbalance by combining resampling, data features, and algorithmic adjustments. It showcases advances in deep learning applications in ECG analysis and stresses the importance of appropriate evaluation metrics for imbalanced learning challenges.
