Electrical Signature Analysis (ESA) techniques, which include both Voltage Signature Analysis (VSA) and Current Signature Analysis (CSA), can be utilized in electric motors and generators. VSA focuses on the analysis of the electrical circuit leading towards the generator, while CSA pertains to the analysis of the circuit extending towards the load.

These methods are valuable for tracking the performance of powered dynamic systems. By interpreting the data collected through ESA, specialists can predict and identify issues related to stator windings, rotor malfunctions, coupling problems on charge-coupled devices, overall system efficiency, and bearing faults among others. ESA effectively transforms the electric machine being monitored into a sensor, enabling the assessment of both electrical and mechanical states directly from the power control panel. This is primarily carried out by monitoring one of the three phases of the machine's current or voltage.
