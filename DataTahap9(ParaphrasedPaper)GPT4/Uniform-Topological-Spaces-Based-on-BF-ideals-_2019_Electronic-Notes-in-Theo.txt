This academic text delves into the properties of mathematical structures known as negative non-involutive residuated lattices and explores their topological aspects. It first establishes that lattice and adjoint operations within such lattices are continuous when considered under the uniform topology. This continuity enables the classification of these structures as topological negative non-involutive residuated lattices. Additionally, the paper identifies conditions under which these uniform topological spaces can be considered compact or discrete. These findings are significant as they help to uncover deeper characteristics of negative non-involutive residuated lattices at the topological level.

The broader context of the research relates to non-classical mathematical logic, which is an essential tool in computer science, particularly in handling fuzzy and uncertain information. Various algebraic structures, including residuated lattices, serve as semantic systems for such logic types. These lattices, introduced by Ward and Dilworth, are fundamental and connect to other important logical algebras, including MTL-algebra, BL-algebra, MV-algebras, and NM-algebrawhich (also known as R0-algebras), all of which are special cases of residuated lattices. Research into these structures often focuses on the concepts of filters and ideals, which are central to understanding logical algebras.

In logical algebras with negative involutive (regular) properties, the correspondence between ideals and filters is usually assumed due to their natural duality. However, when negation in such an algebra is not involutive, this duality is lost. This disruption prompts the paper to explore the nature of ideals and their applications within negative non-involutive logic algebras.

The text also references the pivotal concept of fuzzy sets introduced by Zadeh in 1965 and their extensive application across several fields. The paper notes limitations in traditional fuzzy set theory, particularly in expressing differences between irrelevant and contrary elements within a set, prompting interest in more nuanced representations such as bipolar-valued fuzzy sets (BF-sets) introduced by Lee, which offer an extension to traditional fuzzy sets.

Building on recent research that introduced BF-ideals in negative non-involutive residuated lattices, this paper takes the concept further by considering a collection of BF-ideals and introducing a congruence relation based on BF-ideals to define a uniform topological space. It examines properties of this space, achieving new results that contribute to the field.

To paraphrase the concepts clearly:

1. This work shows that operations within a specific type of lattice known as a negative non-involutive residuated lattice are topologically continuous, and it specifies criteria for determining when spaces defined on these lattices are compact or discrete.

2. The research is within the context of non-classical mathematical logic's role in processing fuzzy and uncertain information, which is of particular importance in the computational sciences.

3. There's a pointed concern with ideals in non-involutive contexts, necessitating new approaches since traditional dualities with filters do not hold.

4. The study also expands on the well-established notion of fuzzy sets by discussing bipolar-valued fuzzy sets (BF-sets), which provide a more refined way of representing fuzzy set elements.

5. The paper contributes to the field by using BF-ideals to create a uniform topological space on these lattices and investigating its properties, thus continuing the exploration of algebraic structures in the context of fuzzy logic.
