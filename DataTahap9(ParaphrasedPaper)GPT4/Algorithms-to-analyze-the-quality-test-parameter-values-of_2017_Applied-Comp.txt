In the seafood processing industry, measures are implemented to maintain product safety and quality. Well-known quality assurance systems like ISO, HACCP, QMP, TQM, and others are employed to ensure these standards. This paper is structured as follows: the second section details the methodology, including designing ontologies, analyzing quality test parameters, and algorithms. Section three presents the results and discussion regarding data sets, algorithm performance, and performance metrics. Section four offers conclusions and is followed by references.

Ontology development varies, and while many are available online, especially in the medical field, the seafood industry lacks relevant ontologies. For this research, ontologies were created based on Noy and McGuinness's methodology.

Two primary classes within the internal-test-seafood class were identified: test-spec-raw-allcountries and test-spec-uncookedfrozen. Specifications for raw seafood categories are independent of the country of export and relate to five subclasses of seafood in the ontology. The test specifications ontology includes microbiological, chemical, and organoleptic test standards (minimum and maximum values), but accessing this data directly from the ontology is inefficient due to scalability issues. Hence, a data store update algorithm was proposed to streamline retrieval of updated test limits.

This algorithm stores updated limit values for each test item in a data store, which are then accessed by a comparison algorithm when a lab technologist inputs a test value. This comparison algorithm verifies if the input value falls within the allowed range by matching it against the stored limits. The performance of this system improves as more data accumulates.

Data sets used in this study were sourced from various seafood companies in Kerala, India, validated by MPEDA, and cover a wide range of seafood export information. The study examined datasets for bony fish, cephalopods, and molluscs, including both valid and invalid data.

In testing the bony fish dataset, the algorithm successfully identified true positive and negative test samples, with some errors misclassifying valid and invalid test samples. The paper concludes with acknowledging the original authors and the conference where this research was presented.
