The academic paper discusses real-time operating systems (RTOS) and the necessary steps for reconfiguration between two different system states, represented by profiles pa and pb. The 'leave' function must be run for each profile in pa, and the 'enter' function for each in pb. The authors also included an additional workload overhead factor (WOS) to account for the extra processing time required by the RTOS during context switching. This leads to the establishment of a definition for the Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) associated with the reconfiguration from profile ca to cb, referred to as WCETreconf(ca, cb).

Moreover, the paper addresses dynamic-priority scheduling, where certain scheduling algorithms permit alteration of task parameters during runtime. Most of these algorithms focus on changing just one resource, specifically the CPU utilization, by modulating task periods. An instance given is elastic scheduling, which models tasks as if they were springs with specific elastic coefficients, allowing for adjustments that better match fluctuating workload conditions. The rate-based earliest execution time method allows for runtime changes to a task's execution schedule.

These scheduling approaches are underpinned by the general real-time scheduling paradigm known as Resource Allocation/Dispatching (RAD). RAD distinguishes the management of resource amounts allotted to tasks from the scheduling of when these resources are provided. The paper describes a flexible resource manager that employs a similar principle of separation, with separate checks for constraints on resource amounts and the timing of their delivery.
