In this research, the authors explored the use of a traditional 2G/3G circuit-switched (CS) call session, finding that the calls were free of echo and exhibited high voice quality. To determine whether the echo cancellation was achieved through in-built hardware or was a function of the phone's chipset, they examined the Android operating system's source code to locate the specific section pertaining to CS call sessions. This segment of code was subsequently used to create a simulation of the echo cancellation feature within the hardware.

The study observes that during a typical phone conversation, the speaker will not hear their own voice through the listener's device, reflecting the natural pattern of human communication where one person talks while the other listens. This one-way communication aspect is the scenario in which the echo suppressor is activated, to prevent the speaker from hearing their voice echoed back.
