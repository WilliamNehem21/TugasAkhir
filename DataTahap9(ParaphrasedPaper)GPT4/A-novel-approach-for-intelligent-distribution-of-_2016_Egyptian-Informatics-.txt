This scholarly paper presents a novel architecture for a distributed data warehouse known as the Intelligent and Distributed Data Warehouse (IDDW). As data volumes have expanded, the evolution of data storage has moved from basic file systems to more intricate models like relational database management systems and data warehouses. The IDDW tackles the challenge of intelligently organizing and distributing data across multiple levels of a data warehouse hierarchy, allowing for adaptive construction of warehouses at varying locations based on the needs of each site.

Employing a top-down design approach, the IDDW doesn't require a warehouse at every node, providing flexibility in deployment. It ensures each user in the system is uniquely identifiable, allows operations to be executed from any location within the network, and facilitates the transfer of data between warehouses at different levels. The heart of the system is the metadata service (MDS), which keeps track of user and data locations.

The authors detail IDDW's modeling, internal architecture, data model, and operation execution through algorithms which guide the hierarchical construction of the warehouses. A case study involving an 8-level hierarchical structure in an educational context in India illustrates the practical application of the IDDW model. Here, locations and warehouses are logically divided into levels such as year, state, university, institute, department, category, position, and identity.

Furthermore, the paper discusses a Java-based experimental setup with SQL at the backend and observations from this experiment, which highlight the system's capacity and performance in managing distributed data. The authors conclude with suggestions for future research directions, including methods for intelligent data placement and mining within the IDDW and the possibility of parallelizing these processes.
