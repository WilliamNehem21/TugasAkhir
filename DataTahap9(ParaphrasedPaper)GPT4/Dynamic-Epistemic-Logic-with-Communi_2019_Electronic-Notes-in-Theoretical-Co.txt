This research introduces a novel dynamic epistemic logic framework for modeling concurrent communication actions using a process calculus approach, akin to CCS and CSP, rather than the true concurrency mechanism used in concurrent epistemic action logic developed by Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, and Kooi. By leveraging action models logic with this process calculus approach, the new framework facilitates proofs of soundness, completeness, and decidabilityâ€”a distinct advantage over previous methods. 

The framework is designed to handle complex interactions, such as multiple agents (e.g., students) concurrently performing actions like sending, receiving, and responding to messages, while ensuring the logical order of these actions. The paper illustrates the limitations of previous models in handling a large number of agents performing concurrent actions and argues for the efficacy of the proposed method. 

This new dynamic epistemic logic with support for concurrency and communication is axiomatized, and the paper offers a reduction method to prove the logic's soundness, completeness, and decidability. The paper provides an introduction to the necessary background concepts (multi-agent epistemic logic, action model logic, and concurrent dynamic epistemic logic) and then details the proposed logic along with its crucial components, such as the expansion law, which is key to the semantic definition and axiomatization process.

In summary, the work presents a scalable and rigorous approach to concurrently model communication actions for multiple agents within the dynamic epistemic logic framework.
