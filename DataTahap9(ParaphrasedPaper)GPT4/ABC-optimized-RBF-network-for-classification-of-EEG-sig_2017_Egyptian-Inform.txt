This academic paper discusses the utilization of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to diagnose epilepsy. Researchers have focused on applying an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm combined with Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs) to categorize EEG signals related to different brain states. Signal features were extracted using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Instead of the conventional roulette wheel selection in ABC, a binary tournament approach was used for selecting onlooker bees in the modified ABC algorithm. Different kernel functions, such as Gaussian, multi-quadric, and inverse-multi-quadric, were employed to test the system's effectiveness on a publicly available EEG dataset. This dataset includes five subsets labeled A to E, derived from both healthy individuals and epileptic patients during seizure and non-seizure periods. The study showed that the modified ABC algorithm, especially with the inverse-multi-quadric kernel, led to significant improvements in the RBFNN's classification performance.

The paper is structured to progress from an introduction of the methods and materials used (Section 2), followed by a detailed description of the proposed work (Section 3). Section 4 is dedicated to the experimental analysis and results, and the paper concludes in Section 5 with future research suggestions. The data used in the research consists of five EEG sets (A-E), with various pairings (A&E, D&E, A&D&E) tested across different experimental scenarios. Initial classification was performed with RBFNNs using gradient descent and was evaluated by adjusting the learning parameter (g). The results indicated that Gaussian and inverse-multi-quadric basis functions performed better than the multi-quadric function, prompting further investigation into optimizing RBFNN performance with the modified ABC algorithm.
