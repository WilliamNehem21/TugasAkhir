In the provided academic excerpt, the author discusses the relationship between refinement—where one side of a specification is independent of a particular process p and the other side is simply p—and satisfiable failures behavioral specifications. These specifications are well-understood to encompass satisfiable predicates that describe how processes can behave under certain failures.

The author points out that if a relation r holds for a set of traces tr1, ..., trn, then it also holds when impossible events are included in the traces, as the relation r accounts for the refusal of these impossible events. Therefore, the nondeterministic choice involves at least the refusal of impossible events.

A key observation is that each failure attributable to a CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) operator in a process is derived from at most one failure of each involved component. As a consequence, the set of failures of a process created by the operator h(p) is defined by a combination of at most n failures of the process p. 

It is noted that many behavioral properties (except for determinism) can be understood as refinement closures of more fundamental properties. Predicates derived from the previously discussed concepts tend to not be refinement-closed, necessitating the consideration of their refinement closures. The issue of whether these predicates are refinement-closed and the refinement-closure calculation for such predicates are points of interest that merit additional research. The paper indicates that developing general techniques to calculate refinement-closures could be beneficial due to the complexity of the task.
