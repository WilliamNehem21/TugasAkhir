Paraphrasing of the academic paper:

Our rewriting logic framework is structured as a collection of Maude theories and customizable functional modules that seamlessly integrate into Maude applications by configuring the theories to match specific application details. We represent the axiomatic theory of constraint semi-rings within a Maude functional theory, with specific instances such as weighted sum and fuzzy natural numbers embodied in Maude functional modules. Additional components of the framework—like the combination of constraint semirings, both implicit and explicit soft constraints, and the constraint-solving algorithms—are adaptable, depending on the chosen constraint domain and semiring. To enhance the constraint-solving process's efficiency, we've implemented all recursive definitions in a tail-recursive manner and ranked domain elements within individual constraints by their significance in the constraint semiring. Additionally, we validate the accuracy of our search algorithm.

Regarding the radio application, we need algorithms to quickly discover one acceptable solution and, when resources permit, to identify either all optimal solutions or all feasible ones. Fortunately, the task is simplified because all variables (or "knobs") are of interest, and the semirings involved are fully ordered. Under these assumptions, we present a Maude implementation designed to find all optimal solutions and outline the implementation for other search strategies.

For the radio application, we conduct a multi-criteria optimization, prioritizing effect goal fulfilment while enhancing the benefits of knob adjustments. We achieve this by constructing a lexicographically ordered cartesian product of the semirings for weighted sums and fuzzy natural numbers (implemented as wsumfuzzypair). By altering the semirings’ order, we could alternatively prioritize knob benefits.

When designing specialized constraint solvers, we recognize that straightforward soft constraints as discussed in this paper will be insufficient. Instead, we must address more intricate tasks like resource allocation and quality of service assurance, which require complex policy considerations and preference-informed solutions comparison. Drawing on the successful c-semiring-based frameworks for preference handling, quality of service, and soft concurrent constraint programming, we are now developing a robust policy modeling language capable of incorporating preferences alongside hard and soft constraints, also grounded in the c-semiring approach.
