The reverse argument can be straightforwardly demonstrated through the application of the weighted subject reduction characteristic. It's important to recognize that analogous outcomes for idempotent intersection type systems are not amenable to proof through combinatorial methods; instead, such results traditionally rely on the use of reducibility arguments found in sources [31,17,25]. It is in this context that adopting a quantitative strategy utilizing non-idempotent types distinguishes itself.
