In the provided academic excerpt, the authors discuss a formal system used for logical reasoning. Below is a paraphrased version:

We use the notation t[u:= v] to represent the expression we get from t by substituting all non-conflicting instances of u with v. We measure the size of an expression t, signified by |t|, through a common method of structural recursion. In our context, any expression of type b is considered a formula.

In this paper, we explain the framework for our upcoming calculus by introducing specific conditions of completeness. The principle underpinning this idea is that a set of formulas, if cohesive and not evidently contradictory, should be inherently consistent. We express this concept through a theorem that ensures the existence of a model.

Significant attention has been paid to the practical aspects of our system. While our refined substitution rule reveals some limitations of the identity predicate within our model MFI1, it's still an open question as to whether we can establish criteria for localized termination in such a calculus. The prevailing view in related studies suggests that introducing identity relationships brings about similar challenges encountered in the system K when applied to transitive frames, where formulas must be transferred down a succession of related points.
