There appears to be no equivalent approach for broadly encompassing iteration, which may be partly due to the absence of a straightforward inductive characterization for the scope of general iteration. In contrast, primitive iteration (as well as functions defined through primitive recursion) can be readily described inductively within the framework of a Peano algebra. Despite this, general iteration has been explored within the context of algebra through the application of closure theory, iteration theories, and coalgebras.
