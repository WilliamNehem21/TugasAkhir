Effective management of Omicron is crucial for the isolation of infected individuals and their contacts across affected nations. As the virus spreads, promptly admitting patients with severe symptoms to specialized hospitals is essential to curb further transmission. Speedy diagnostics for COVID-19 have become more accessible, but there remain economic and budgetary constraints related to testing, which impact both governments and individuals with limited healthcare resources. In March 2020, there was a surge in the availability of public datasets containing chest X-ray and EEG images to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Analyzing these medical images aids researchers in identifying patterns for disease detection. The swift spread of COVID-19 has led to overwhelming patient numbers at hospitals, putting considerable strain on radiologists and contributing to staff shortages. This challenge can be addressed through advanced deep learning techniques, which leverage complex multi-layered neural networks trained on extensive datasets to improve classification and predictive accuracy.

Recent years have seen a rapid evolution in machine learning applications for pandemic response. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, excels in image classification and object detection, which are crucial for automated medical image analysis. As advancements in AI and neural networks continue to develop, they contribute to improvements in computer-assisted diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Machine learning models, particularly deep learning, are increasingly preferred over the traditional RT-PCR testing, which is considered the gold standard, due to advantages in speed and ease of processing. RT-PCR tests, though accurate, are costly, time-consuming, and reliant on laboratory kits that may not be readily accessible during crises.

This study presents a deep learning model that uses EEG and chest X-ray images for the diagnosis of Omicron. Traditional machine learning approaches focusing solely on chest X-rays can yield ambiguous results due to the images' variable quality. Therefore, incorporating EEG readings offers a more sensitive diagnostic tool. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the mortality rate, which can be facilitated by sophisticated technical solutions. The proposed model utilizes transfer learning techniques to distinguish whether a patient is affected by COVID-19 or the Omicron variant.

The paper is structured with a review of existing research in Section 2, followed by the introduction of the proposed detection architecture in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the experimental results, comparing them to existing best practices, while Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

Past studies have highlighted the role of machine learning in screening for COVID-19. However, there is still an urgent need for more precise and efficient models, especially as traditional methods and limited data availability may hinder the detection of new variants like Omicron. Moreover, image quality issues can reduce classifier effectiveness. RT-PCR, despite its reliability, poses challenges due to its cost, scarcity, and the time-intensive nature of manual processing.

The current research utilizes binary classification of X-ray and EEG images for COVID-19 and Omicron detection, employing transfer learning for feature extraction, pre-training, and final classification, achieving promising results. The training utilized a dataset split into an 80-20 ratio for training and testing, respectively, and included ROC curve analysis and cross-validation to attest to the model's effectiveness.

This work also acknowledges contributions to existing data repositories, which have been expanded to include additional cases and are vital for future collaborative efforts in understanding COVID-19 and developing treatments and vaccines. The paper concludes that accurate model testing requires a valid test or validation dataset with known outcomes.

Looking ahead, the approach could be extended to diagnose other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. Future work might involve integrating more advanced machine learning models like reinforcement learning and federated learning, as well as incorporating sophisticated similarity measures to detect other COVID-19 variants.
