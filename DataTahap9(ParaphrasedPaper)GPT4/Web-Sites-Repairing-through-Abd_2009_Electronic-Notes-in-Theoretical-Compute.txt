Our conviction is strong that declarative programming, such as logic programming (LP), will become essential in realizing the Semantic Web vision when merged with the web. This view is echoed in the literature. For instance, we can define specific rules that all websites for entertainment events must adhere to. One rule might dictate that the structure of a "show" tag must include children tags for "showname" and "year." In our example, the absence of a "year" tag in the second show indicates a structural error. Furthermore, we could require that a "showlist" only features shows produced after the year 2000, and a data error would occur if included shows were produced before that year, such as one from 1998.

We provide a brief overview of CIFFWEB's checking abilities here, with detailed discussions available in other sources. We cover the foundational concepts of web rules and abductive logic programming with constraints, outline the translation of web checking rules into programs for checking, and illustrate a CIFFWEB run using a theater example.

Positive rules are translated into abductive logic programs where the rule's head consists of an abducible error predicate with variables from the rule's error section and associated error messages. The rule's body is a conjunction of conditions represented as logic predicates. For example, the rule transformation process would include specifying the structure and data conditions for web elements like a "show" tag.

To run CIFFWEB, users need web rules formatted in Xcerpt syntax and the XML/XHTML pages to check. Despite an empty query, the system compiles rules and source pages to create a program for checking. Executing the system with defined rules and a sample XML page yields an abductive answer that includes both structural and data errors.

When repairing using this program, it is essential to manage the identifiers of the abduced XML elements uniquely. The program for repair includes integrity constraints that ensure unique identifiers for these elements to maintain the original XML tree structure.

The process also encompasses integrity constraints derived from positive rules, with a specific goal: avoiding new errors introduced by abduced elements that satisfy conditions of other web checking rules. This is accomplished by causing the abductive process to fail if any new error arises through abduced atoms.

CIFFWEB currently lacks certain capabilities, like sophisticated function handling observed in other systems, such as GVerdi-R, which uses functions for string manipulations and non-trivial data handling. CIFFWEB manages arithmetic functions through an integrated constraint solver but does not support other function types. However, enhancing CIFFWEB's function handling is an ongoing effort.

The Xcerpt authors also proposed a framework called XChange for updating web data in response to events, which represents a different approach to modifying web data instances. Potential intersections between this framework and our repair approach are under exploration, acknowledging that XChange is geared towards accommodating event-driven data changes on the web rather than verification and repair of web instances.
