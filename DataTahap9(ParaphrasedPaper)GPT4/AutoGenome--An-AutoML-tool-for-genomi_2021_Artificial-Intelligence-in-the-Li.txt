Current neural network models such as RFCN-ResNet and RFCN-DenseNet employ predetermined skip-connection structures which may not be ideally tailored to diverse scientific inquiries. To address this, we present a novel approach: the Randomly-Wired Residual Fully-Connected Neural Network (RRFCN), which employs Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to devise optimal residual fully-connected network designs for specific genomic profiling challenges. RRFCN enables the discovery of innovative network architectures fitted to particular scientific needs.

The configuration options for DenseNet include:

1. A default block structure sequence: [2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5],
2. Growth rate per block: [8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512],
3. First layer dropout ratio with respect to input: [0.6, 0.8, 1.0].

For RFCN, the parameters are:

1. Number of layers: [3, 4, 5],
2. Dropout ratio of the first layer: [0.6, 0.8, 1.0],
3. Neuron count in the first layer: [4096, 2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128],
4. Neuron number decay ratio for subsequent layers: [0.8, 0.6, 0.5].

Additionally, we feed into a fully-connected layer to process genomic data inputs. Outputs from various layers are combined via concatenation. This approach requires a fixed number of layers (default at six) with the initial neuron count set in the JSON file (default at 2048). The search space for neuron counts from the second layer onwards ranges from [16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048], and the NAS determines inter-layer connectivity.

Due to the rapid accumulation of genomic profiling data critical to biomedical research, machine learning is increasingly applied to predict and interpret this data. Yet, existing methods fall short in certain aspects. Just as advances in other domains such as computer vision and natural language processing have benefited from new network structures, genomic data analysis likewise requires fresh architectures. The RFCN framework, and particularly RRFCN, offer advantages including the ability to support deeper network training, facilitate feature propagation and encourage feature reuse. The AutoGenome tool offers easy access for researchers to apply RFCN to their studies.
