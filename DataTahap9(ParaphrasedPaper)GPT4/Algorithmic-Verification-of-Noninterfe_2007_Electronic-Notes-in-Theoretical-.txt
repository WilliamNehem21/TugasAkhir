The paper discusses a scenario concerning agents observing system behavior, noting that an agent may repeatedly see the same observation without taking action, implying activity from another agent. To address potential issues arising from agents deducing information based on the timing of observations—an assumption that doesn't hold in asynchronous systems—the authors use a function called "cond" in their definition to circumvent timing-based logic.

The authors then discuss the theoretical framework of labeled transition systems, referencing a comparison by McCullough of two definitions. The authors choose to follow the definition connected to labeled transition systems, as it aligns more with unwinding relations, a concept useful for proving noninterference (a security property) within deterministic systems.

Finally, the paper shifts focus to the primary interest: exploring verification techniques and analyzing the complexity of validating particular security properties mentioned earlier. These properties cannot be encapsulated within the conventional safety-liveness paradigm because they are not just constraints on individual system executions but rather on the entire set of potential executions. This necessitates the development of innovative verification methods tailored to these unique security properties.
