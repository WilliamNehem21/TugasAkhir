This paper examines type systems in the context of programming languages, including an exploration into quantum computing. It acknowledges the existence of a pre-computational quantum logic but notes that its relationship to quantum programming is unclear.

The paper presents a significant theorem (Theorem 4.12) that proves all terms in the language that can be typed will have a normal form. This finding simplifies the language by negating the need for prior restrictions that were in place due to difficulties in confirming normal form in languages without types.

It describes research that uniquely encodes quantum bits and gates (referenced as in[2, sec. iv]) but points out that this encoding is unsuccessful under a scalar type system. The failure results from the need for conditional functions in the scalar system to maintain uniformity in type across all branches.

Innovatively applying the Curry-Howard isomorphism, the authors develop a novel scalar logic (SL) directly from the type system associated with a quantum-inspired programming language. Unlike ad hoc logics, SL emerges as a legitimate logic through established methods. The authors further discuss the implications and the inherent meaning of this logic, although in an informal and exploratory manner, culminating in a decisive result (Theorem 5.7).

The paper also discusses bounded linear logic (BLL) and its restrictive nature regarding resource additionâ€”a contrast to scalar logic which counts proofs modulo cut-elimination and does not inhibit the usage of additional proofs.

Finally, the paper suggests that the scalar type system discussed is a precursor to a more complex vectorial type system, which will address not only the magnitude and sign of type vectors but also their direction, including aspects like addition and orthogonality of types.
