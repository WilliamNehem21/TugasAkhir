This paper aims to explore how certain characteristics of classical Wadge reducibility, or their less strict forms, are applicable in different spaces. Specifically, it examines conditions under which subsets of the Wadge order exhibit properties close to being well-ordered. The paper also investigates which sets can form an upper bound or a variation of it with respect to Wadge reducibility. Moreover, the connection between Wadge reducibility and established classification systems (referenced as hierarchies) is analyzed, building upon findings in previously published literature.

Another potential area of study put forward in the paper is the examination of effective (computable) versions of Wadge reducibility. This line of inquiry is not new and can be traced back to earlier works that provided computable counterparts to some of the current paperâ€™s results. The suggestion of a general realizability approach for assessing both computable and non-computable aspects of topology could prove beneficial. This approach may facilitate further advancements in the research area under discussion.
