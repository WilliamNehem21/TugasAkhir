This paper discusses the implementation of declarative debugging within the context of the Maude programming language, which has powerful reflective capabilities. Declarative debugging is a technique where the programmer starts with an incorrect computation (the error symptom) and identifies the program fragment responsible for the error.

Before debugging, the user can declare a module with statements believed to be correct, to be used as an "oracle" to verify the correctness of deductions. This helps to reduce the number of questions posed to the user during debugging. Building on Maude's reflection, the paper details how a debugging tree can be generated and navigated within Maude itself, using its predefined meta-level and input/output modules. 

The debugging process involves finding "buggy nodes" in proof trees generated from the program's execution. A buggy node is one where the node itself is invalid, but all its children are valid. Top-down and divide-and-query strategies dictate how the user is prompted for input to guide the debugging process toward identifying the buggy statement.

Users label the statements they are unsure about, and the paper describes the process for responding to queries by the debugger, enabling it to narrow down and identify the erroneous part of the program. The process relies on user interaction, and leveraging Maude's built-in loop-mode module, the paper describes how to conduct this interaction and maintain the persistent state.

The paper also presents an optimization function that assists in efficiently searching for nodes likely to be buggy by considering the sizes of trees and subtrees with an aim to minimize the area of search.

Overall, the paper showcases how Maude's unique reflective features can be used to facilitate an advanced form of debugging, making it easier to find errors in Maude functional modules, given that the user provides accurate responses to the debugger's questions. The authors highlight the complementarity of this approach to other debugging techniques available for Maude, like tracing and term coloring, and anticipate future improvements to accommodate an even broader range of modules.
