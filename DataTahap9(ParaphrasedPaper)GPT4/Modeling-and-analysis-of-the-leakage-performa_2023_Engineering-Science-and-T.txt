This paper investigates the flow characteristics within a piston by using a distinct hydrostatic model. Chen et al. provided calculations on the leakage between the slipper and swashplate in pumps with a Single Vane Pump (SVPP), but their work did not include experimental evidence. Conversely, Zhao et al. applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model submerged cavitation jets in unloading grooves but did not offer a theoretical analysis.

The study defines FP, FSP, and FN as non-inertial forces exerted on the piston. FP is directed along the piston's axis, originating from the piston bottom, and for simplicity in analysis, it is assumed to act at a specific point B. The paper provides a matrix representation of these forces and their associated lever arms.

Under the influence of FP, FSP, and FA, the piston-slipper assembly exerts pressure on the swashplate, which in turn produces a support reaction force, FN. The z-component of FN neutralizes the other three forces, leading to a derivation of FN's specific expression. The reactionary force of FN acts at point A, counterbalanced by the shaft splines.

The z-axis Center of the Control Block (CCB) balance is maintained through a combination of oil pressure in the piston chamber, oil film carrying capacity, and central spring force, all contributing to the oil film's lubrication condition. While the oil pressure and oil film force typically counterbalance each other, the oil film reaction is marginally greater, causing the CCB to move away from the Sun and Planet Gear (SVP). The central spring force adds a separate dynamic to this balance.

A model for calculating SVPP leakage relies on an established oil film lubrication model. The model calculates internal leakage (Qinner) by assessing the longitudinal velocity and flow area of fluid elements, taking into account that oil film thickness varies, affecting the number of fluid elements at different angles.

The paper describes how increases in speed and spring stiffness make the CCB's tilt azimuth approach the Optimal Design Criteria (ODC). The CCB's tilt angle, however, changes in the opposite direction, which is analyzed in detail considering the dynamics of the CCB.

For CCB tilt azimuth, the dominant factor is the load pressure affecting CCB's moment M_CY_Y, which is not influenced by speed or spring stiffness. Conversely, higher spring stiffness and speed raise the swashplate reaction force and radial inertia force, resulting in the CCB tilting towards the ODC.

Central spring stiffness has implications for the SVPP, affecting the z-axis force and the x-axis moment. Reduced stiffness can worsen the CCB's tilt angle, causing increased leakage and potential metal contact. Higher stiffness can improve SVPP performance but with diminishing returns.
