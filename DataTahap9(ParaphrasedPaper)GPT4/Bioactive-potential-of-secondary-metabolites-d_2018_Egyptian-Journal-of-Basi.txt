Throughout human history, humans have drawn upon plants for medicinal purposes, with such plants serving as foundational sources for pharmaceutical development. Research indicates a direct positive relationship between the presence of internal plant microorganisms, or endophytes, and the medicinal plants in which they reside, leading to greater diversity of metabolites through genetic exchanges over time. Endophytic fungi, which live within plant tissues without causing harm, are capable of producing a variety of biologically active compounds.

These endophytes synthesize unique metabolites as a strategy for competition with other microorganisms, for colonization of the host plant, and for obtaining nutrients. They are noteworthy for their production of structurally diverse and active natural substances, including alkaloids, benzopyranones, benzoquinones, flavonoids, phenols, steroids, terpenoids, tetralones, and xanthones. These compounds have significant potential in discovering new medical treatments and are particularly effective in producing antifungal, antiviral, antibacterial, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive agents.

To measure certain activities of these secondary metabolites, various assays are conducted. For instance, one test assesses the ability to scavenge superoxide radicals – highly reactive molecules with oxidizing properties that can damage biological membranes and tissues, and precursor to other reactive species. In the described study, different extracts were evaluated for their capability to neutralize superoxide radicals, with the extract from PDB medium showing the highest activity, followed by the M1D broth.

Hydroxyl radicals, highly reactive and damaging molecules, were also targeted in a scavenging activity experiment, with PDB medium extract again exhibiting the highest activity. This suggests notable protective effects against oxidative stress-induced damage.

Further, focusing on the role of nitric oxide in various pathological conditions like inflammation and cancer, the study measured the extracts' scavenging activity of this compound. Results indicated varied effectiveness across the extracts, with a descending order of activity from PDB to YES broth extract.

Finally, an assay measuring reducing power – an indicator of the antioxidant capacity – revealed that the PDB extract had the highest reducing power. Decreasing order of capability was observed among the different broth extracts tested.

While these in vitro studies highlight the potential of fungal extracts in the suppression of cancer cell growth, the exact mechanism, whether through inhibiting cell proliferation or inducing cell death, remains to be understood. Incorporating in vivo studies alongside in vitro experiments is suggested to elucidate the anti-proliferative effects of the purified metabolites and provide a comprehensive understanding of their therapeutic properties.
