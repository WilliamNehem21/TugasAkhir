This scholarly paper discusses the importance of secure and reliable software systems, categorizing them as critical information infrastructures, which are essential for a digital society. It emphasizes that understanding the interdependencies between events and processes is vital for cybersecurity and software reliability. The paper proposes process mining, a collection of techniques for extracting knowledge from process event data, as a promising solution to address cybersecurity and reliability challenges. Although its potential benefits are recognized, the concrete application of process mining in these fields remains unclear.

To address this, the authors conduct a systematic literature review of existing process mining applications relevant to cybersecurity and software reliability. The review spans 35 research approaches and identifies gaps and promising research directions within the fields. This work extends their previous research on cybersecurity, incorporating similarities between cybersecurity and software reliability where overlaps occur.

The paper details process mining's successful application across various domains, such as fraud detection and healthcare, and presents its capabilities in process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement. The literature review highlights specific domains like healthcare and education, where process mining has been reviewed extensively, but not necessarily in the context of cybersecurity and software reliability.

The authors present their methodology, categorize their findings into various research directions such as industrial control systems security, smartphone security, and software reliability, among others, and discuss the results, identifying trends and areas where process mining can be especially beneficial.

The paper concludes that process mining could be a valuable tool for the analysis and support of critical processes in both cybersecurity and software reliability, despite current gaps. It encourages further research, emphasizing the need to explore the untapped potential of process mining in these areas and in domains where it has not been fully exploited, like critical information infrastructures. The authors also highlight the importance of real-time analysis and the potential benefits of incorporating process mining within the detection and prevention of cyberattacks and incidents.
