The paper discusses the limitations of the traditional ethernet protocol, particularly its lack of scalability and security vulnerabilities due to an increase in network size and technological advancements. One major issue is the weakness in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which lacks an authentication process, making it prone to threats like ARP spoofing and ARP storm attacks.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a secure and efficient method to reduce broadcast traffic and enhance security against ARP-related attacks in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments. The approach employs a novel multi-stage algorithm that scrutinizes ARP packets in three phases: checking the source IP address, the source MAC address, and the destination IP address.

The solution leverages an SDN architecture to manage ARP traffic, with the SDN controller gaining device knowledge through monitoring ARP and DHCP communications or using protocols like LLDP. The proposed algorithm uses three security checks to identify and counter ARP attacks that can happen individually or concurrently.

Furthermore, the paper notes that some Cisco devices utilize Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) to differentiate between trusted and untrusted interface, limiting ARP packets on untrusted interfaces to 15 per second before potentially shutting down the interface to prevent attacks.

The authors detail a simulation of ARP storm attacks, demonstrating the application of their proposal. Attackers in these simulations generate a high volume of ARP packets without concern for the content, and the paper simulates scenarios with varying packet rates to mimic this kind of attack.

For measuring the CPU usage induced by the proposed solution, the authors used the 'top' command on Linux. Furthermore, they chose the RYU SDN controller to orchestrate their setup, and the Scapy Python library to craft and transmit ARP attacks under multiple test conditions. The aim was to reinforce network strength by curtailing ARP broadcast traffic and safeguarding against ARP-based intrusions, though the paper's primary focus is on ethernet networks for the sake of simplicity and to facilitate simulations.
