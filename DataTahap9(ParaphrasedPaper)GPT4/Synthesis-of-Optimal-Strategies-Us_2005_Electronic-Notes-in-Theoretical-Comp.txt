This academic paper explores the extension of timed automata into what is known as priced timed automata, which introduces costs associated with both the locations and transitions within the automaton. The study's central aim is to develop an algorithm that can calculate the optimal cost and formulate an optimal strategy for winning a priced timed game, assuming such a strategy exists. To demonstrate the practicality of this algorithm, the authors describe its implementation using the tool HyTech and provide an example.

The notion that scheduling problems with timing constraints can be considered as reachability issues in timed automata has received attention in the current research paradigm. Tools like Kronos and Uppaal have been successfully employed for real-time model checking in various industrial contexts. Traditional automata have been enhanced to include pricing functionality, allowing for the assignment of a cost to the time spent in each location, a new facet that offers a way to assess the performance of various strategies and define what constitutes an optimal solution.

Within this paper, the authors present a method for establishing a realizable winning strategy for such priced timed games that can be computed without consideration of the cost value; such strategies are termed 'cost-independent strategies'. These strategies ensure uniform optimality, meaning they are effective for all states within the game's winnable region. The authors stipulate a syntactical criterion to ensure compliance with this optimal strategy condition, specifically regarding the strictness of constraints on actions that are either controllable or uncontrollable.

As for future research avenues, the authors have indicated their intention to expand the class of systems where their algorithm can be applied, allowing for termination to be guaranteed. They are also exploring the procurement of sub-optimal strategies in scenarios where it's not feasible to attain an optimal one. Additionally, they aim to generalize their approach to accommodate other types of winning conditions (like safety conditions) and performance metrics, such as cost efficiency over time in unlimited scheduling scenarios.
