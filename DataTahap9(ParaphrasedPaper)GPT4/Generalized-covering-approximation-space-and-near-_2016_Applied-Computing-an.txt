The academic paper asserts that the Lin rough membership function is identical to the R-rough membership function. Furthermore, the study introduces alternative approaches, specifically the L-rough (respectively, I-rough) membership functions, and claims they yield more precise results than both the R-rough and Lin rough membership functions. Additionally, the paper proposes the use of the J-near rough membership function, as demonstrated in Example 5.1 within the document.
