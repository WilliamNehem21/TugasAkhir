The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 reviews existing work on IoT node authentication through blockchain technology. Section 3 delves into the authors' suggested framework in depth. Simulations and discussions make up Section 4, which closes with final thoughts.

The researched literature includes a hypergraph-based blockchain model designed to lower storage demands and enhance security. This model utilizes hyperedges for organizational purposes and changes overall data storage to partial network storage. The model focuses on the security of data storage while omitting device authentication.

The authors' contribution uses established blockchain methodologies to store and disseminate public keys. Elsewhere, a blockchain-based trust system to combat false data from malicious actors is examined. Here, blockchain functions solely as a storage medium. Another study outlines a mechanism to detect and isolate nefarious IoT devices, employing active network devices to enforce security compliance. Again, blockchain acts as a repository detailing the status of IoT devices.

In terms of access control within medical IoT applications, one approach leverages blockchain and smart contracts for data management among medical devices. Another uses smart contracts for authenticating and managing IoT network resources; both approaches regard blockchain as a secure, decentralized database accessible through discrete access points.

Each IoT node has two identifiers: its public key (NodeID) and the public key of its cluster head (CHID), which fosters node anonymity and eliminates dependence on a centralized key-generating service.

The described method involves iterating a process across various nodes and clusters, including cluster heads CHL1 and CHL2, to create a series of authenticating blockchains within the network.

The framework outlined includes a clustering mechanism for organizing IoT devices and a blockchain structure for authentication. Simulation and testing involve a sequence of steps.

For testing, various hardware devices have been used, including Raspberry Pi models with different RAM capacities and CPUs, a computer running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and a laptop equipped with Windows 11.

The proposed system employs a distributed blockchain architecture, where each branch acts independently, and authentication relies on branch consensus, promoting decentralized node management.

Lastly, the authors suggest a fast, lightweight consensus algorithm that relies on direct device verification and blockchain validation at the cluster level, maintaining blockchain immutability.
