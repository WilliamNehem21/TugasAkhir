In the modern era, we are surrounded by an omnipresent and varied computing and telecommunications infrastructure, as well as the software services that operate on it. These services are implemented through distributed architectures made up of interconnected elements, often referred to as components or services themselves. These components are dynamic; they can be published, updated, and removed by different providers.

Considering the dynamic nature of environments, especially in mobile systems, it is not feasible to predict every possible contextual factor that could affect a service at any given time. As a result, rather than services with only predetermined functionalities, it is preferable to have proactive services capable of identifying and offering new, unplanned features to users. Services restricted to predefined components cannot integrate new ones published after their creation.

This paper is structured as follows: the subsequent section discusses various existing adaptive systems; the third section outlines the service-context meta-model, its application, and its integration into adaptive platform architecture; the fourth section describes a basic prototype built to assess our model; and the final section details the evaluation, conclusions, and directions for future research.

Contextual elements are currently represented using various models, including lists of attributes, object-oriented models, ontology-based models, and contextual graphs. To standardize, we suggest using a uniform model for both context and service, treating the context as an architecture made up of interconnected contextual components such as the user, devices, network, and environment.

Components have attributes related to themselves, such as memory, CPU, APIs, and operating systems, commonly associated with their physical and logical resources. Each attribute has a designated name and a domain of acceptable values.

Several contextual components play a role: the user interacts with the service through their Human-Machine Interface (HMI), and the user's terminal might include devices such as a display and keyboard. These devices mediate between the user and the service's software components and can be affected by external factors like ambient light. Networks link the terminal to the internet and may consist of multiple interconnected segments. Network performance, such as bandwidth, can be influenced by conditions like weather. The server hosting the service can be a factor in considerations like load balancing.

An observer module gathers data about both the context and the service. Dedicated observer components monitor the context—discovering elements dynamically, for example, through pattern recognition in a webcam image—and the service by tracking resources like memory or CPU usage.

The service deployment engine utilizes Java reflection APIs to deploy instances of service components and connect them. When deploying a service, the Service-Context (S-C) graph producer sets up the initial service and context graph. This instance only involves the user as a contextual component and considers a single information flow attribute: language.
