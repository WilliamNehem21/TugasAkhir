In Gardner's numerical study, the impact of additive white Gaussian noise on the input signal and its subsequent quantization jitter was analyzed. Although some assessment of the ensuing noise at the output was conducted, the precision of these findings was only moderate and the results were applicable in limited situations without achieving a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.

Within an intermediary zone, the influence of additive noise begins to manifest, yet quantization levels still play a substantial role. This suggests an interaction between additive noise and quantization jitter. This region spans a wide range on the axes representing input and output variance, where instances occur of the output variance increasing significantly above levels without noise, although quantization impacts remain prominent. Therefore, greater insight into this region's behavior could be valuable for phase-locked loop (PLL) designers. During this intermediate region, the probability density function (PDF) of output jitter tends towards a Gaussian distribution.

In the final region assessed, output variance becomes independent of quantization, and the output variance's plot forms a straight line with a slope of 1. This behavior aligns with anticipated outcomes and corroborates the characteristics of a linear, analog PLL where the output's PDF approximates a Gaussian distribution.
