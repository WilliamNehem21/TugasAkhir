The source material for polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) is primarily naphtha, which is derived from refining crude oilâ€”a process that originated from the transformation of ancient organic material. As such, it is noted that no carbon capture is associated with traditional plastics at their first stage of production. In contrast, at the same initial stage for polylactic acid (PLA), carbon dioxide is absorbed by the crops destined for PLA production, which implies that PLA contains biological carbon.

Furthermore, it is recognized that the production and disposal of conventional plastics not only release greenhouse gases but also cause severe environmental issues, such as toxic waste generation, devastation to oceans and terrestrial habitats, and the dispersal of air toxins. Since traditional plastics depend on petroleum as a raw material, their production exhausts non-renewable fossil fuels. Prior life cycle assessments (LCAs) indicate that substituting traditional plastics with biodegradable ones can notably reduce resource depletion by 7% to 70%, depending on the specific circumstances. The pollution of oceans and lands by waste plastic is a significant issue attributed to low global recycling rates, potentially alleviated by the introduction of biodegradable plastics that decompose more readily in nature.

Biodegradable materials offer the advantage of enabling environmentally friendly end-of-life strategies such as composting and anaerobic digestion, which help to mitigate the risk of environmental contamination. These methods are preferred for dealing with waste biodegradable plastic products (WBPPs) because they can produce usable by-products, like fertilizer or methane for energy. However, these disposal techniques face challenges in terms of lengthy processes and suboptimal recovery efficiency of WBPPs.

The referenced academic paper by Peng Z, Wang Z, Shu Y, Lv F, Zhang H, Shao L, et al., entitled "Fate of a biobased polymer via high-solid anaerobic co-digestion with food waste and following aerobic treatment: insights on changes of polymer physicochemical properties and the role of microbial and fungal communities," was published in Bioresource Technology in 2022 (volume 343, article 126079). It offers insights into the changes in the physical and chemical properties of a biobased polymer during the process of co-digestion with food waste and subsequent aerobic treatment, as well as the involvement of microbial and fungal communities in this process.
