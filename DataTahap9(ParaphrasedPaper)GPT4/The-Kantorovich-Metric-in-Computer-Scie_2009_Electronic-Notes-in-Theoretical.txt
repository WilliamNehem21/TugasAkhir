Despite its long-standing prominence in various mathematical fields, the Kantorovich metric has only recently begun to gain attention in computer science. This paper provides a concise overview of the metric's uses in several computer science domains, such as probabilistic concurrency, image retrieval, data mining, and bioinformatics. By illustrating its effectiveness and versatility as a mathematical tool, the paper sheds light on the Kantorovich metric's usefulness for tackling diverse issues across seemingly unrelated fields.

The use of the Kantorovich metric has been explored by several researchers. For instance, van Breugel and colleagues employed it to define behavioral pseudometrics for probabilistic systems, whereas Desharnais and others utilized it for labeled Markov chains and concurrent systems. Ferns and collaborators later used it for Markov decision processes, and Deng and his team applied it to quantitative transition systems with actions. An essential challenge in this context is developing a method to extend a pseudometric on a finite set of states in a way that can measure the behavioral similarities of probabilistic processes accurately.

The paper also notes the breadth of production planning problems across various research areas, all leading to an underlying mathematical issue known as the transportation problem. Due to its potential for solving this problem, the Kantorovich metric is likely to find even more applications in computer science. Future applications may include fields that require effective computation of similarity or dissimilarity between objects, such as knowledge representation, statistical clustering, data mining, information retrieval, and bioinformatics.
