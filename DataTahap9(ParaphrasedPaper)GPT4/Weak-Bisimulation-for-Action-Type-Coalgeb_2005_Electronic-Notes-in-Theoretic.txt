This paper introduces a generalized definition of weak bisimulation for action-type systems, extending the concept commonly applied to labeled transition systems (LTS) and probabilistic systems. The authors adopt a coalgebraic framework, using bifunctors over the category Set to capture the role of actions in these systems.

Several models of weak bisimulation for probabilistic systems have been proposed, such as those by Segala and by Baier and Hermanns, which apply to simple probabilistic automata and generative probabilistic systems, respectively. Others have expanded on these ideas, accounting for both finite and infinite systems, and even offering metric analogues of weak bisimulation.

The paper aims to unify these notions, demonstrating that their concrete and coalgebraic definitions of bisimilarity coincide for both LTSs and generative systems. A procedure is provided that achieves this result, which applies to both action-types comprehensively.

Additionally, the paper examines how certain functors related to these systems preserve weak pullbacks, which is important for their theoretical underpinnings. By employing techniques from graph theory and matrix properties, the authors show that the functor defining generative systems with finite support preserves weak pullbacks.

An overarching goal of this research is to propose a coalgebraic definition of weak bisimulation that aligns with existing definitions for LTSs and generative probabilistic systems. The paper makes several supplementary contributions, such as avoiding restrictions on the cardinality of support sets for probabilistic distributions and covering systems of any size, unlike some prior work that only considered finite systems.

In summary, the paper presents a coalgebraic perspective on weak bisimulation, aligning it with concrete definitions, and applies this framework to both labelled transition and generative probabilistic systems without imposing limitations on the state space or distribution support cardinality.
