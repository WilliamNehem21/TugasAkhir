The concept is to enable the simplification of a 'let' expression when an incomplete value is known within a certain precision 'p'. This method is referred to as 'call-by-partial-value'. The denotational semantics associated with this approach utilize various concepts that are well-known to experts in domain theory. This includes the concept of 'measurement' as outlined by Martin, as well as a monadic approach to differentiating between the actual result and the computational process, akin to the ideas proposed by Moggi. In addition, to facilitate working with relationships, particularly within product types, this paradigm also expands the language to include explicit pairwise combinations of basic types.
