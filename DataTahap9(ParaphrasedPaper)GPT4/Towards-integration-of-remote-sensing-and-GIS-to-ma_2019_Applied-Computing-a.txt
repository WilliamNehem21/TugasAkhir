The objective of this study is to examine the distribution and location of government primary health care centers (PHCCs) within a selected area, as well as to maintain a database containing this information. Additionally, the study aims to track and manage the supply and demand for PHCCs, ensuring that health care (HC) facilities conform to the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) criteria and standards, through the integration of remote sensing data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The El-Salam medical region in Cairo, Egypt, a densely populated urban environment, was chosen for this research.

The methodology employed satellite imagery, GIS, demographic and health data, as well as field data to assess the distribution of PHCCs. The research identified a theoretical rather than practical scarcity of PHC centers in the area, noting the existence of other governmental and private health services which warrant further investigation.

Egypt's HC system is under pressure from a growing population with increasing longevity, which is challenging the health system. Providing optimal health care throughout the life cycle is a primary goal for PHC, which attempts to address significant community health issues by offering a range of services from preventive to rehabilitative.

Information on PHC centers is being gathered to enhance HC services and to develop a sustainable monitoring plan. Traditional methods have failed to keep pace with urban growth when selecting locations for PHC centers, often simply choosing available state land rather than considering sustainability.

The MOHP in Egypt aligns with international guidelines stipulating that a PHC unit should cater to 20,000 people within a 2.5 km radius. The design of PHCCs is also subject to requirements, including land area and ownership regulations.

The initial methodology focused on simplicity and future stages will incorporate advanced remote sensing and computing techniques, along with demographic modeling. Steps of this methodology include data collection, GPS surveys, image pre-processing, registration, accuracy assessment, database design for PHC centers, and evaluation of the distribution and demand for services.

An analysis of collected clinic data revealed a variety of medical services offered at nominal fees. PHCCs are primarily situated along main roads with accessible public transport. Projections of population growth from 2006 to 2015 fed into the planning for new PHCCs. Challenges include the lack of available state-owned land for new constructions, suggesting the need to seek land donations or re-plan state land allocation.

Lastly, the study underlines the importance of electronic medical records for improving HC service delivery, emphasizing that more detailed research is needed to explore this and other potential solutions in future studies.
