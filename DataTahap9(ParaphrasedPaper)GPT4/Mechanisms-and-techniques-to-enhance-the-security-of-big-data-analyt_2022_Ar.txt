The paper addresses the challenges of ensuring security in dynamic, uncertain environments, specifically within the context of a high-performance big data analytic framework. These environments, particularly networked ones, face increased risks to sensitive data. To improve security in such a framework, the paper introduces various mechanisms and techniques, aiming to create a systematic and secure data analytic system that protects users' data and allows authenticated researcher access without compromising performance.

The research is structured in the following way: Initially, it presents the background and related work, then moves on to describe the security mechanisms for authentication, authorization, data privacy, and encryption. The paper discusses the results in detail and concludes with the system's strengths and future improvements, including potential blockchain-based security enhancements and the impact of human behavior on system security.

The paper introduces a security model for data stored on MongoDB database servers within Singularity Linux containers and outlines methods to secure data during transmission and at rest. It emphasizes the importance of implementing access control in MongoDB, a database that doesn't enable access control by default.

The authors touch upon various investigations related to web application vulnerabilities, including a study by Daniel Huluka et al. that identified root causes of session management issues and broken authentication. Another study by Zhiqiang Lin et al. presents Autopag, a tool to automatically generate software patches for out-of-bound vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, the paper describes security models and encryption methods to protect sensitive information within electronic health records stored in cloud storage, as well as in smart home sensor data analysis. It also assesses network security using stochastic modeling techniques.

Additionally, security mechanisms like Mongoose, Express.js, bcrypt, and MongoDB's access control roles are discussed for protecting data and managing user access.

Finally, the paper emphasizes that the overall security of a software system is a shared responsibility between technical experts and users, since vulnerabilities can be exploited by both parties.

The authors of the paper, Akalanka Mailewa Dissanayaka, Susan Mengel, Lisa Gittner, and Hafiz Khan, present their qualifications and the conference at which their research was presented (ICCDA2020).

The described methods and mechanisms are proposed as a general approach to securing container-based virtual applications from various security threats.
