This academic paper discusses how the optimization of reactive power in power systems helps maintain a robust voltage profile, enhancing voltage quality and reducing power losses. The document introduces an advanced genetic algorithm (GA) method aimed at boosting voltage stability. The strategy centers on diminishing the highest values of the L-index among load buses, using generator voltages, switchable reactive power (VAR) sources, and transformer tap changers as adjustable elements. A study evaluates the influence of these optimization variables on the reactive power output from generators. A comparative analysis of two optimization strategies is detailed. Results from implementing the GA on the IEEE 24-bus power system suggest that it not only bolsters voltage stability but also lessens the impact on generator reactive power outputs.

The paper addresses the challenges power engineers face due to discordant growth in generation capacity and transmission infrastructure, which leads to voltage instability. It highlights the complexity of ensuring quality and reliability in the face of overloading, voltage collapse, and voltage stability issues. Engineers are prompted to manage load bus voltages within safe limits. The paper proposes that the reallocation of reactive power and the adjustment of controller parameters, such as transformer taps, generator exciters, and settings for switchable VAR compensators, can optimize the voltage profile.

The paper touches on the gradual decline in voltage magnitude in power systems with increasing load and emphasizes the necessity for astute monitoring and control to avoid reaching voltage stability limits. It provides an overview of various techniques for predicting voltage stability and collapse, focusing on the L-index method. The L-index is used to calculate voltage stability, wherein a value closer to zero implies stronger system security, while values approaching one denote a system near voltage collapse. The stability margin is defined as the deviation of the L-index from unity (1-L), with the goal of maximizing this margin to ensure system stability.
