This academic paper explores the challenges novice programmers face when dealing with abstract concepts in programming and the potential benefit of interactive visualizations in their learning process. Novice programmers often struggle to grasp concepts that don’t have tangible real-world analogues, suggesting the need for teaching materials and approaches that develop higher-level programming skills.

The study was conducted during the fourth and fifth weeks of a programming course, focusing on loop structures and arrays, respectively—two topics known to be difficult for beginners and amenable to visualization. Both student groups had access to printed course materials for review before their exercise sessions. However, students in the target group also received access to a web page with instructional visualization examples to help concretize the subjects.

While homework assignments remained the same for both groups, the reference group worked on their tasks using traditional methods such as pen, paper, code editors, and compilers accessed through the course's website. The target group, however, had a visualization tool integrated into their web page, which allowed them to write, compile, and run code within a visual context.

Participants from both groups completed a survey gathering background information, including prior programming experience and personal assessments of progress in the course. The time spent on subject review and homework completion was also recorded. Additionally, target group students answered a survey about their use of the visualization tools.

The study faced some variability, such as different levels of student attendance and variations in homework and test content between the two weeks, potentially affecting outcomes.

The first week's assignment required active use of visualizations (utilizing visualization), while the second week's focused on in-depth observation (analyzable visualization). Since the first week's preparation closely mirrored the in-class test, which was a surprise, performance may have been better aligned than the second week when students might have anticipated a test and prepared differently.

Results indicated that visualizations particularly helped students with greater learning challenges, such as novices and strugglers, especially when preparing for exercises. More experienced students, who already had mental models of the concepts, found visualizations less beneficial.

However, it's unclear whether the improved outcomes were directly due to the visualizations or if the heightened student engagement and increased study time that came with the more interesting visualization tools were the true catalysts. Either way, the key finding is that visualizations improved learning outcomes.

For future courses, instructors should consider that not all students may prefer or benefit from new learning tools like visualizations. Since visualizations appear to mainly aid novices and those struggling, making their use optional would account for the preferences of more experienced or differently learning-style inclined students.
