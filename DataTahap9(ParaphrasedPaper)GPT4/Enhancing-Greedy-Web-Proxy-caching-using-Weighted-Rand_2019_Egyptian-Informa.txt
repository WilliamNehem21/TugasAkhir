The research aims to enhance the performance of greedy web proxy caching algorithms by integrating user clustering and a novel classifier model leveraging random indexing and a weight assignment policy. The second section of the paper reviews existing greedy caching algorithms and data mining approaches for web caching. The third section outlines the proposed web proxy caching system model. The fourth section discusses the evaluation metrics for clustering and classification.

The Khalid Obaidat Replacement Algorithm (KORA) employs neural networks to distinguish between transient (newly arrived) and shadow (recently replaced) cache lines, reducing cache miss ratios. Another approach uses a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) to predict web objects likely to be re-accessed, thus enhancing cache performance. An optimization model predicts object value through object features and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. The Neural Network Proxy Cache Replacement (NNPCR) algorithm also utilizes backpropagation to adjust weights for cache replacement decisions.

The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier, which bases its operations on distance measures, is noted for its use in various applications. This method requires both data and its classification for training, ensuring that only coherent entries are considered. The dataset consists of 800 web pages, with 600 accessed over ten times, from a total of 24,000 sessions reduced to 12,000 after imposing a session duration threshold of 30 minutes. Additionally, a 10-minute page duration threshold resulted in 12,500 sessions for analysis.

A window-based cache simulator, incorporating the data mining classifier model (k-NN), was utilized for the web proxy cache algorithm's simulation. The classifier results fed into the simulator as input. The experimental configuration is described by parameters including trace file name, cache size, replacement schemes, and content types. Attributes like timestamp, URL-ID, and object size are included in the trace file name. Cache sizes ranged from 5% to 45% of the maximum content volume, and replacement schemes such as GDS, GDSF, and GD* were tested.
