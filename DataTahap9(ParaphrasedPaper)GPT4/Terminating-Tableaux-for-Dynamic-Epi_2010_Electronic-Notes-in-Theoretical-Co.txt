Over the past ten years, a growing interest has emerged in dynamic epistemic logics to understand how information flows and influences knowledge within systems with multiple agents. Yet, this field has predominantly progressed through practical roles and semantic understanding, leaving a notable gap in the development of proof theories for these logics.

Traditionally, epistemic logic has been significant in philosophy and computer science, emphasizing not only static knowledge but also its evolution, namely how agents' knowledge changes as systems evolve. There are two primary strategies for incorporating dynamics into epistemic logic: integrating it with temporal logic or with action-based dynamic logic. The latter has given rise to dynamic epistemic logic (DEL), which incorporates operators for epistemic actions. Interest in DEL has largely been driven by its practical applications, with a focus on semantic aspects, and the complexity involved in verifying DEL propositions may be exponentially high in general cases. Although it is not precisely clear how complex deciding DEL validities is, the addition of a global modality to epistemic logic confirms that complexity is at least exponential.

In addressing the complexity of arbitrary DEL formulas, the challenge lies in how to account for the size of action modalities within the formulas. Simple counts of action modalities as single symbols do not reflect the more detailed structure necessary for validity checks, leading to potentially significant complexities. However, alternate metrics for sizing action modalities might allow for lower complexity in validity determinations.

Moreover, applying these logics to the S5 modal system generally works; however, challenges arise when one attempts to model beliefs with the KD45 logic. The KD45 axioms do not preserve certain properties in submodels, which hampers the ability to achieve completeness in models where beliefs are interpreted strictly as KD45. Particularly, the conventional semantics for public announcement operators may lead to agents holding inconsistent beliefs following a public announcement.

Public announcements represent only a slice of possible epistemic actions. To manage various epistemic actions in a unified framework, the concept of action models was introduced by Baltag, Moss, and Solecki. These action models convey the uncertainty agents may have regarding the specific action occurring and acknowledge that each action is contingent on satisfying certain preconditions. In this model, epistemic actions are depicted through Kripke structures, with each state representing an event/action paired with a precondition formula from the language.
