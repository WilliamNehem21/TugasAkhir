Advanced deep learning and computer vision methods have become increasingly prominent in agriculture because they offer non-destructive and contactless ways to assess crops. These tools are now being applied within advanced farming frameworks like aquaponicsâ€”a technology that synergizes recirculating fish aquaculture with soilless plant hydroponics to address food sustainability challenges. This paper introduces a technique designed to automatically quantify crop morphological characteristics like size and to compute optimal plant spacing in aquaponic systems. Key farming metrics like crop yield and quality can be influenced by plant overcrowding, which is why understanding plant spacing based on crop type and growth habits is crucial.

The novel approach employs Mask R-CNN to analyze crop sizes and uses a mathematical model to calculate plant spacing, which is crucial for designing a responsive, adaptive aquaponics farm layout. The method has shown to predict the size of Little Gem Romaine lettuce with an accuracy within two centimeters for length and width measurements. A cloud-based application features the finalized model and incorporates domain-specific knowledge via an ontology model to support decision-making. This ontology informs on crop parameters and ideal spacing, which are factored into the model's outputs to recommend adjustments in the aquaponics system.

The study outlines the use of Mask R-CNN for precise object segmentation, identifying and delineating lettuce plants down to the pixel level in images, which includes distinguishing foliage from non-foliage elements such as channels or rockwool cubes. This level of detail enables the calculation of foliage area and, combined with a mathematical model, the automatic estimation of plant spacing.

Deployed on the cloud and enriched with an ontology that details various crop and system characteristics, the resulting application functions as a decision aid. It compares model outputs with ontology information and dictates necessary modifications to the aquaponics setup for optimized plant spacing. This development represents an important step towards autonomous aquaponics systems, leveraging smart technologies to continually refine practices based on real-time data. The potential of these methods extends beyond system adaptation, potentially enabling research into optimal growing parameters and early detection of nutrient deficits in crops, further accelerating the widespread adoption of aquaponics in agriculture.
