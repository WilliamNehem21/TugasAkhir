The original paper discusses graph connectivity and biconnectivity through a series of lemmas and claims. Here is a paraphrased summary:

For any given vertex x within a graph, all of its adjacent vertices are connected to each other via paths that do not pass through x. This means that when you remove x from the graph, the remaining graph is still connected, which implies that the original graph is biconnected.

In a scenario where a vertex u is isolated within a particular set k, considering a path l that connects the sets h\k and k\h, it is noted that such a path must pass through a vertex that has edges in both h and k. Since u has no such edges, every path must then pass through some other vertex v. Since there exists a path l that avoids v, the graph without vertex v is not connected, and thus the graph is not biconnected.

Claim 4 states that the vertices u and v share at least one common face. If this wasn't the case, then according to the previous lemma, the neighbors of u would form a connected subgraph avoiding both u and v, which is a contradiction to an earlier claim.

If all vertices on a path j belong to set h, then by definition, all vertices outside of j must also belong to h. This is because the shortest path from any vertex outside j to a vertex in j does not include u or v as internal vertices, and thus all vertices on such a path must be in either h or k. Since the path ends in h, all vertices must be in h.

The claim further explores the cyclic order of vertices and connectivity between vertices u1 and u2 that follow u on paths q1 and q2, respectively. Since these vertices are only incident to the same faces as u and v, they can be connected by a path that avoids both u and v. By the lemma, u1 and u2 must be in the same set, either h or k, and therefore all vertices on path j and outside it adhere to the same connection logic. This leads to the conclusion that h must either equal the entire graph g or be a simple path q, which is a contradiction to another claim.

Lastly, the summaries maintain this logical structure to build up to the conclusion that certain claims must be true for the graph to exhibit specific properties like biconnectivity, with contradictions revealing the absence of these properties.
