The academic paper discusses an approach to connect different types of networks, not just simple ones, by utilizing the concept of free ports as points where the linear combinations can be joined together. This is achieved by applying the principle of multi-linearity, which allows the transformation of a connection of linear combinations of simple networks into a general network.

The paper continues by explaining a two-parameter function, h, which is defined by the formula h(y', z') = f(y' + z', y' + z'). It notes that whether you duplicate the variables y' and z' before or after adding them together in the network, the result remains consistent due to the reduction rule in place.

Furthermore, the paper introduces a version of the resource lambda-calculus where the application is strictly linear, as opposed to merely affine. The syntax for this calculus includes two sorts (simple 12 terms and simple poly-terms) which are interdependently defined, and there is an infinite set of variables available for use.
