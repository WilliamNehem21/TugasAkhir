Makerspaces are rising as interactive learning environments, combining physical making with collaborative learning to foster skills relevant to the 21st century, especially in STEM disciplines. As Augmented Reality (AR) technology evolves, it provides a digital layer to physical creations and is seen as a promising tool for enhancing learning in makerspaces. Yet, there's limited knowledge on effectively integrating AR into these educational spaces. This study employs a co-design approach to investigate AR's educational utility in makerspaces, the effects of AR co-design on students, and practical considerations for AR integration. Conducted over a semester with 18 graduate education students, the research included six AR prototypes designed collaboratively by seven students, targeting areas such as design, electronics, and programming. Findings suggest that AR can play a role in teaching STEM concepts, aid construction tasks, promote contextual learning, and assist in debugging. The co-design experience led to a better grasp of technology design, increased enthusiasm, and enhanced critical thinking regarding AR by the students. The study culminated in guidelines to support the introduction of AR in makerspace activities, emphasizing the necessity of clear communication, acknowledging time constraints, and creating an inclusive and supportive environment. Acknowledging the sensitive nature of student data, all information has been anonymized, the study was ethically approved, and findings are shared with gratitude to those who contributed, including the National Science Foundation which provided funding under grant number 1917716.
