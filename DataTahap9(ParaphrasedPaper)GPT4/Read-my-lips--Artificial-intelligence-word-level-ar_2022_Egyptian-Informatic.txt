Deep learning harnesses neural network optimization to derive meaningful patterns from large datasets, aiding in solving complex problems. Prominent areas like natural language understanding, image recognition, and speech processing have witnessed remarkable achievements using deep learning, often surpassing human expertise. The wealth of data available today, coupled with increased computational capacity from advanced hardware and supercomputers, has been a major driver of this success.

In particular, visual speech recognition (VSR) enhances traditional audio speech recognition (ASR) systems, especially in environments with significant noise, by using visual cues from a speaker's lips. Known as audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR), this approach proves useful in challenging settings such as undersea or space operations, multilingual environments, and aiding in criminal investigations through video analysis.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature. The methodology of the RML (Read My Lips) system is detailed in Section 3, while Section 4 presents experiments and results. Conclusions and potential future research directions close the paper in Section 5.

The authors analyze prior research in automated lip-reading, highlighting advancements in feature extraction and classification. Recent innovations include the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and attention mechanisms for improved VSR accuracy, combined audio-visual processing for speaker identification, and deep learning models that capture nuanced audio and linguistic features for text-based tasks. For visual lipreading, various techniques and models are employed, ranging from convolutional neural networks to 3D CNNs combined with LSTM networks, achieving variegated performance levels.

Specifically, the RML system discussed in the paper analyzes ten Arabic words spoken by 73 participants to develop a lip-reading model. Multiple deep learning architectures are explored, with a conventional CNN using RGB data achieving the highest accuracy of 79.2%. Additionally, a proposed voting system aggregates predictions from various models to enhance accuracy further to 82.84% on an unseen test set. The dataset and system are discussed in terms of design, including data collection, pre-processing, and model implementation.

Future work aims to expand the dataset with more words and sentences, hoping to increase accuracy and extend the system applicability to real-time, sentence-level Arabic lipreading.
