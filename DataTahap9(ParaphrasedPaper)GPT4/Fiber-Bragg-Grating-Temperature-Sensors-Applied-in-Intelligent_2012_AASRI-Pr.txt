This academic paper discusses the importance of cables in electrical systems, emphasizing their roles as connectors for various electrical devices within substations, including the link to the control room. Cables are typically installed along cable bridges, tunnels, interlayers, ditches, and shafts. They are characterized by their large numbers, lengthy routes, complex layouts, and dense arrangements.

A key focus of the paper is on a double-layer tube structure used to mitigate the effects of external stress and temperature on the Bragg wavelength of fiber Bragg grating sensors, which are used for monitoring. The outer tube's primary function is to conduct temperature evenly and shield the inner tube from external stress, minimizing any wavelength offset within an acceptable error margin. The internal tube houses the grating affected by temperature changes, with the consequent wavelength offset measurable through an optical fiber AFC port connected to a spectrometer.

The authors examine the application of this system in the Yunnan Power Network's 220/110/35kV substations, particularly in the cable trenches and pits. Conventional temperature measurement approaches, such as manual inspections or traditional telecommunication-based systems, fall short in such environments. The fiber Bragg grating real-time temperature monitoring system offers a solution with its distributed nature, flexibility in sensor placement and quantity, high precision, rapid response, long transmission distance, ease of installation, minimal maintenance, and resistance to harsh environments and electromagnetic interference. The system boasts safety features that make it explosion-proof and intrinsically safe.

Laboratory tests were carried out to verify the temperature rise in cables during a fault condition. An on-site assessment at a substation was then conducted using a metal armored fiber optic Bragg grating temperature sensor to monitor a 4-core, 30-meter cable. This sensor system offers a positional accuracy of 1 meter, a temperature resolution of 0.1 degrees, and an effective measurement range of up to 4 kilometers. The study indicates that 60 such sensors would be needed, following the principle of having a sensor every 0.5 meters.

The paper describes the use of the metal armored optical fiber Bragg grating temperature sensors in the Zhaotong substation's cable trenches and pits, providing real-time online monitoring of high voltage cable operations. Comparative analysis of 479 days' worth of temperature data from the Zhaotong environment revealed consistent trends between the cable surface temperature and the ambient temperature. The daily average temperature range of the 60 sensors varied, with the lowest being 21.24 degrees Celsius and the highest at 37.43 degrees Celsius, with the absolute peak reaching 43.41 degrees on July 3, 2010, and the lowest point at 4.37 degrees on January 17, 2011. Seasonal changes influenced the temperature readings of the metal armored fiber Bragg grating temperature sensors, but no abnormal or sudden changes were detected. The temperature variations within the cable trenches and pits were within normal operation limits.
