In this paper, we focus on undirected, unweighted graphs with no self-loops or parallel edges. We examine d-regular graphs, where every vertex has exactly d incident edges and v(G) denotes the set of vertices in graph G. The quantity n represents the number of vertices, and we assume that dn is even to avoid issues with parity. For basic graph theory terms, we refer readers to Diestel's work.

Our algorithm is described in section 2, its analysis method in section 3, and our results are summarized in a key theorem with proof provided in section 4. The approach presented leads to an edge dominating set, F, once no edges are left in graph G. This set F is also an independent edge dominating set, commonly known as a maximal matching.

The algorithm initiates each step by randomly selecting a vertex, w, with the smallest nonzero degree. It then proceeds through several sub-steps, each involving the random selection of a neighbor, u, of w. If both w and u have a degree of 1, the uw edge becomes isolated and is added to F, then removed from G.

Section 2 discusses a degree-greedy algorithm for obtaining minimal edge dominating sets. It involves the selection of a random vertex, w, with a specific degree, r, followed by a series of random choices of its neighbors.

Expression (11) in the paper represents the expected changes in the vertex degrees when performing the algorithm operations. The first term deals with the degree change of w from v to 0, and the second term accounts for the shift in the degrees of w's v neighbors from i to 0. Additional terms predict the changes resulting from identifying and removing edges associated with the dominating set. The expected alteration in the size of set F per operation equates to v.
