The Pagoda project introduces a flexible architectural framework aimed at developing and testing autonomous systems. Within this framework, a Pagoda node, analogous to an intelligent agent, senses and influences its environment while adhering to its objectives and complying with specific policies. A network of these nodes collaborates to attain a common goal by working together.

The project's long-term goal is to create tools for specifying and analyzing autonomous systems, leveraging the innate modularity and declarative nature inherent to policy and goal-driven designs. These designs draw from the Reflective Russian Dolls (RRD) model, which itself is built upon the rewriting logic formal modeling framework. This approach allows for the exploration of policy-based coordination within a distributed setting. The paper presents an in-depth case study showcasing how policy-driven coordination significantly enhances modular design and analytical capabilities.

Policies in Pagoda serve as rules that restrict an agent's behavioral options and interactions, shaping decisions and trade-offsâ€”for instance, balancing speed against energy consumption or managing informational abstraction and aggregation levels. Such policies can govern how information is processed internally or shared with other nodes.

The architecture efficiently allows for the introduction, replacement, and configuration of various components, like knowledge bases and learning systems, without depending on the identity of the component instances. Nodes can integrate various logical reasoners suitable for different tasks or store knowledge in disparate databases that might hold information at varying levels of abstraction, suitable for particular circumstances.

The coordinator within a Pagoda system is responsible for managing communication through policies that dictate when and how messages are processed and acknowledged. Coordination extends to handling messages related to goals, settings, and sensing. A system of placeholders called "wait4s" specifies expected message patterns, controlling the processing of incoming messages based on whether they are replies or acknowledgments anticipated by the coordinator.

The Pagoda concept is being applied to ad hoc wireless network projects, where coordinators are tailored to oversee the distribution of information and manage resources effectively, taking into account network constraints like bandwidth and power.

In conclusion, the Mobile Unity language aids in specifying and implementing coordination, transitioning from high-level logical specifications to practical coordination protocols. The Pagoda architecture thus lays the groundwork for intricate systems where distributed coordination is conducted based on system states instead of purely interactive events.
