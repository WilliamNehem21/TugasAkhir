This academic paper focuses on enhancing the performance of LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), an energy-efficient clustering protocol for wireless sensor networks. The paper introduces a modified protocol designed to improve network performance in terms of latency, packet loss, and throughput.

The modification, referred to as Low Loss Energy-Aware Routing Protocol (LLEAP), addresses issues with the original protocol, namely EAP (Energy Aware Protocol). In simulations, LLEAP demonstrated a significant reduction in packet loss by an average of 93.4%, outperforming EAP, and also showed improvements in throughput and delay.

Also discussed is the PEACH protocol, another alternative that extends the network lifespan by appointing a proxy node to take over the role of a weak-powered cluster head for a duration. PEACH's approach involves a consensus among robust nodes to manage cluster head failure, enhancing the overall network lifetime by minimizing the need for frequent re-clustering.

The Energy-Efficient Clustering Scheme (EECS) is introduced as a means of selecting a fixed number of cluster head candidates based on a probability 't'. These candidates compete for the cluster head role based on their residual energy within a specific competition range, with the role going to the candidate with the highest energy unless they encounter another candidate with more energy.

However, the process of selecting random candidates can lead to suboptimal cluster head selection. One common issue with such schemes is the uneven load distribution across cluster heads.

To address these challenges, LLEAP employs two primary techniques. Firstly, it increases the overall network lifetime by scheduling when nodes should sleep or wake, thus conserving energy. Secondly, it reduces the likelihood of common causes for loss in EAP, thereby decreasing both packet loss and energy expenditure in recovery efforts.

The paper evaluates the performance of each protocol using specific metrics, with results averaged over multiple independent simulation runs to achieve a 95% confidence interval, each utilizing a unique, randomly generated topology of sensor nodes.
