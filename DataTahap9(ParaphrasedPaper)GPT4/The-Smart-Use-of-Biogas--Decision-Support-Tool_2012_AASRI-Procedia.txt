The paper discusses the unsustainable nature of current fossil fuel consumption, which is rapidly using up Earth's reserves of coal and oil, resources that take a very long time to naturally form. In response to this, researchers are exploring renewable energy sources as alternatives to fossil fuels due to their more environmentally-friendly nature and reduced contribution to the greenhouse effect.

Biogas, a sustainable fuel option produced through the anaerobic digestion of biomass by bacteria over several days, is highlighted as a promising renewable energy source. This process naturally takes place in oxygen-poor environments like swamps. Human-generated biogas mainly comes from landfills, manure, and sewage treatment, with the advantage of significantly reducing waste volume when processed anaerobically rather than aerobically, making it a preferred method in the industry.

The paper then outlines an integrated approach to biogas utilization, starting with assessing the raw gas's quality based on its methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide content. The subsequent step involves using standard benchmarks to calculate potential biogas treatment improvements, the utilization of treated biogas, the energy produced, and ultimately its distribution. While the immediate outputs often include both heat and power, a fourth element, bio-methane, can also be incorporated into the natural gas grid. The final part of the process includes the presentation of data and graphical representations of results.
