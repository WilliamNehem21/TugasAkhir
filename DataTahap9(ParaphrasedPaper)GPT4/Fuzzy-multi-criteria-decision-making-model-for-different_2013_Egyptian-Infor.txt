In this study, we introduce an effective Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) model that aids decision-makers in evaluating different options for Egypt's electricity power generation. The model incorporates FANP to manipulate uncertain and imprecise information, common in decision-making processes, by using fuzzy set theory, linguistic variables, and Gaussian fuzzy numbers for pairwise comparisons. By determining priority weights for the various attributes and alternatives, the model identifies the most suitable power generation alternative.

Despite the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)'s usefulness in evaluating alternatives, AHP doesn't consider potential dependencies among factors, assuming they are independent. Our proposed Gaussian Fuzzy ANP (GFANP) model overcomes this limitation and provides added flexibility by allowing the use of interval values in preference assessments. Through the application of Gaussian fuzzy numbers rather than triangular ones, the issue of assigning zero weights is eliminated. The paper suggests that the Egyptian government should focus on increasing nuclear power to 25% and solar power to 5% of the countryâ€™s electricity generation. The paper is structured into sections covering fuzzy sets and AHP, the ANP, our proposed FANP approach, detailed methodology, results discussion, and finally, concluding observations.
