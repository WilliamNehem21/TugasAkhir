This paper presents a novel approach to summarizing Arabic text using a combination of graph theory and noun frequency. Summarization techniques are of two types: extractive, which pulls sentences directly from the text without altering their structure, and abstractive, which rephrases to capture the original meaning. Summaries can also be general, ignoring specific queries, or query-based, responsive to specific questions or titles.

The study emphasizes the significance of noun frequency in determining sentence importance in Arabic, a language with complex morphology. The Al-Khalil morphological analyzer is utilized to extract nouns from sentences. The proposed method starts with preprocessing—normalization, tokenization, stemming, removing stop words, and morphological analysis—followed by feature extraction and graph construction. A modified PageRank algorithm (MPR) then ranks sentences, extracts the summary, and eliminates redundancies.

Experimental results show that the system's performance, measured by the F-measure, peaks at 67.98 after 10,000 iterations. The paper is structured into sections, with related work, problem statements, and other components each discussed in separate sections.

The approach described builds on previous machine learning and graph theory methodologies, such as particle swarm optimization and various graph representations of texts, and compares favorably to other algorithms like LexRank and TextRank when evaluated against manual summaries.

In summary extraction, redundant sentences are removed by detecting overlapping content. The modified PageRank algorithm used to extract summaries assigns initial rank based on noun count, and edge weights are determined by cosine similarity. Despite Arabic's morphological challenges and absence of case differentiation, the Al-Khalil analyzer's accurate analysis of nouns contributes to the effectiveness of the approach, with performance plateauing after a certain number of iterations.
