This paper presents a detailed analysis of the performance of three widely-used ad hoc routing protocols: AODV, DSR, and LAR. These protocols are compared using GloMoSim simulator version 2.03, taking into consideration all available performance metrics provided by the simulation tool. Due to the inherent differences in protocol design, not all performance comparisons are straightforward.

To structure the research, the following layout is provided:

1. Section 2: Overview of previous research in the field.
2. Section 3: Description of the simulation environment.
3. Section 4: Presentation of simulation results and performance analysis.
4. Section 5: Summary of the findings.
5. Section 6: Conclusive remarks on the research.

The research incorporates the random waypoint mobility model for node movement, where nodes choose random destinations and speed, followed by pause intervals, in a simulated environment running on a PC with a 2 GHz Pentium IV processor and 3 GB RAM.

In the performance evaluation, it is observed that AODV manifests higher average end-to-end delay compared to LAR due to AODV's reliance on a single path and its inefficient route failure management. LAR displays lower delays by forwarding data packets through alternative paths rather than waiting for new route discovery. Furthermore, ACK packet rates are compared, noting increases with LAR and DSR during certain pause times, and the particular use of RREP-ACKs to ascertain link stability in DSR.

This study aims not to determine the absolute best performance of the protocols but to compare them against each other for a thorough understanding of their performance variability based on different metrics and network sizes. The findings underline that the mobility model influences the performance of MANET routing protocols, a conclusion that aligns with previous studies. Unlike other studies, this research does not declare a definitive best protocol, as performance appears to vary with the different metrics and network scales.
