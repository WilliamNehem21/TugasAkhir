Creating expansive systems through gradual refinement of a simple initial design is a recognized approach in software engineering, but it has not been extensively applied to systems biology. This technique involves beginning with a high-level abstract model of a biological system and adding details about its components or reactions in successive steps. These additions should maintain the accuracy of the model, ensuring that key numerical attributes, such as experimental match and validation, stay intact.

In this research, we focus on the refinement of individual reactants in a model. Specifically, we look at how to replace a single species with various subtypes. We demonstrate a systematic method for transforming the original model into a more detailed one using this approach. Our case study applies this methodology to a model of the eukaryotic heat shock response by incorporating the effects of acetylation on heat shock factors (HSFs). With our approach, we can extend the model to include significantly more variables and kinetic parameters while keeping the experimental fit and validation effort minimal.

To accurately refine the model, any unknown kinetic parameters either come from existing literature, are measured experimentally, or are computed if no direct measurement is available. The computational procedure aims to calculate these values without prior knowledge.

We highlight the importance of acetylation in HSFs, the proteins that regulate heat shock protein (HSP) encoding genes. This modification involves replacing a hydrogen atom with an acetyl group or removing an acetyl group. The acetylation of lysine residues, which reduces the DNA binding affinity of histones by neutralizing their positive charge, is particularly crucial for gene regulation.

Our paper emphasizes quantitative model refinement in systems biology, replacing a single species with several subspecies in the model. By transferring the numerical settings from the original to the refined model, we ensure the preservation of important numerical properties such as model fit and validation.

Our methodology for determining the kinetic parameters of the refined model is not the only solution, and due to the complexity of solving the systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) analytically, we adopt a symbolic approach to ensure the original and the refined models correspond through variable renaming. This solution is based solely on this symbolic method when biological knowledge about the kinetics of the refined model is unavailable.

In this paper, we only addressed the quantitative refinement of the basic heat shock response model to include details about HSF acetylation. We did not discuss how acetylation fine-tunes the heat shock response due to space constraints, but we plan to explore this in future research.
