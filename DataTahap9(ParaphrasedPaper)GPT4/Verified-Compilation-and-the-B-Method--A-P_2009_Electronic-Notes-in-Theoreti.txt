This academic paper outlines the B method for software development, which encompasses the full process from initial modeling to creating an algorithmic model. However, the paper acknowledges a challenge in the final stages - translating the algorithmic models into a programming language and compiling them to the target platform's assembly language. These steps present verification issues due to semantic differences and code transformation during compilation, potentially introducing bugs that could undermine the entire development effort.

To mitigate these risks, some industry practitioners use redundant tool chains with different code synthesis and compilation methods. While this increases confidence in the final code, it does not offer a theoretical guarantee of correctness and results in the execution of redundant programs.

The paper's structure begins with an introduction to the B method and outlines a novel approach compared to the traditional B method application. It includes the modeling of a micro-controller's instruction set (Section 3), the translation of B0 constructs to assembly (Section 4), and the presentation of experimental results. Finally, the paper concludes with preliminary insights and an agenda for future research.

The B method is based on the B Abstract Machine Notation (AMN) and uses formal proof refinements to create concrete models from which programming code can be generated. Its mathematical foundation is rooted in logic, arithmetic, and set theory, and its constructs resemble the Z notation, with a structure akin to imperative modular programming.

A B module typically consists of a state space definition and operations, along with auxiliary clauses for modularity and reuse. The paper narrows its focus to the core elements, detailing how state components and operations are specified using the variables and invariant clauses.

The proposed approach refines algorithmic models into assembly code by mapping state variables to memory addresses and translating operations to corresponding assembly instructions. By doing so, a formally refined software artifact at the assembly level that maintains the integrity of the initial functional model is obtained.

The paper also explains the use of a loop construct in the assembly model to ensure program termination and defines the fetch loop with a program counter and end marker variant.

Examples are given to illustrate the methodology, noting that only simple data types are used, with the intention of extending this work to more complex structures in the future. Additionally, future research aims to fully develop the B method-based tool chain for assembly-level platforms, improve model translation and proofing, and incorporate necessary elements for designing safety-critical systems such as interrupts and timers.
