Simonton (1991) created a device designed to precisely control positioning, speed, and force to limit damage to geranium cuttings. Kim et al. (1995) reported an end-effector utilizing a rack and pinion mechanism driven by a stepping motor for the cutting motion. Machine vision systems have been used for detecting unsuccessful transplanting attempts, with Tai et al. (1994) applying them to identify and fill empty tray cells with healthy seedlings. Ryu et al. (2001) developed a pneumatically operated end-effector capable of grasping and releasing seedling plugs, tested on cucumber seedlings to identify empty tray cells.

The developed system incorporates a DC motor to drive the metering shaft and pro-tray forward based on programmed instructions. Through a microcontroller, stepper motor, and DC motor, the feed roller systematically delivers one tray of seedlings to the metering system. Gear ratios in the system are designed to ensure appropriate speeds and timing for seedling ejection and planned plant-to-plant spacing.

The controller responds to limit switches attached to the metering shaft that are triggered by the rotating shaft, leading to directional changes of the stepper motor and a timed activation of the DC motor. A 12 V battery powers the motors and microcontroller, with the former also providing 5 V power to motor drivers. Motor actuation and speed are regulated by PWM and directional signals from the controller.

The system comprises a feed roller unit for pro-trays, a metering unit, a delivery unit, and an embedded system for control, designed to optimally space plants and handle seedlings both longitudinally and transversely for successful transplanting.

Efficiency tests showed that a speed exceeding 2.0 km/h led to reduced transplanting effectiveness, with the highest efficiency observed at 90.3%. The experiments suggest that operational speed and the angle of the pro-tray feed roller are key for efficient system performance.

A system that ensures seedling singulation and optimal spacing was developed and assessed. The integration of custom software with the transplanter hardware was successful. Performance measures closely aligned with target values, indicating that the system maintains transplanting rates and higher operational speeds effectively. Achieving optimum spacing and depth, transplanting efficiency, furrow closure, and minimizing missed plantings were identified as crucial for system effectiveness, highlighting the significance of operational speed and pro-tray feed roller angle for future enhancements.
