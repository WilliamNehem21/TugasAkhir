This academic paper highlights the importance of considering quasi-functions along with functions when assessing the validity of logical rules within a knowledge base, stating that common confidence measures like standard confidence and PCA confidence fail to account for this, thus underestimating the actual strength of such rules. 

The paper is structured into six sections, commencing with related work and preliminaries, followed by the introduction of new measures for evaluating the truthfulness of all possible combinations of functions and quasi-functions in rule bodies. It then presents performance evaluation results and discusses these, finally summarizing conclusions and outlining future research avenues.

The authors challenge the conventional methods used for rule strength assessments, which typically look at transactional confidence (e.g., 80% confidence in the rule that if someone buys a computer, they will also buy a mouse). They suggest that these methods are incomplete because they fail to consider the distinct roles that functions and quasi-functions play in horn rules. Knowledge bases and RDF knowledge bases (knowledge graphs) are referenced for the context of semantic knowledge representation, highlighting the need for inference algorithms or graph-based methods to infer knowledge.

The paper then distinguishes between functions (single object per subject) and quasi-functions (multiple possible objects per subject) and proposes a new measure, the COR confidence, which incorporates categories of relations present in horn rule bodies and heads. The COR confidence evaluation algorithm is detailed, emphasizing how it groups facts for calculation purposes and handles quasi-functions to gauge the strength of a rule more accurately than traditional methods.

Through examples, the paper demonstrates the superiority of the COR confidence measure in evaluating horn rules, particularly when there are quasi-functions involved. It outlines an experimental setup that includes a confidence weighting method and characteristics of the knowledge base used for testing, validating the improved assessment of rule strength when applying the COR confidence over standard and PCA confidence measures.

Ultimately, the paper argues that COR confidence is a meaningful advancement in evaluating horn rules within knowledge bases, as it properly takes into account the various relationships between entities, something overlooked in previous methodologies.
