This study explores the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) in enhancing the museum experience by facilitating visitor engagement with exhibits. Utilizing Unreal Engine, three VR scenarios were created to evaluate learning, interaction, and immersion aspects of the virtual experience, with the effectiveness of each scenario being statistically assessed via one-way ANOVA. The study demonstrated the importance of interaction for guidance in navigation; scenarios lacking interactive components resulted in lower mean scores, while gamified and narrated scenarios significantly improved engagement.

The paper discusses the potential of VR in museum settings to present heritage collections in innovative ways, enhancing visitor interpretation and engagement. The enhanced interaction and immersive storytelling are shown to be effective in improving visitor experiences, especially highlighted by the increased interest in the Lanchester petrol-electric car, used as a case study for engineering heritage. The study involved both expert and public participants across two phases, with phase two focusing on public user experiences in museum environments.

Results indicated that total immersion in VR—detaching from physical reality—enriched the narrative experience from a first-person perspective. The absence of interactive instructions in the immersive scenario resulted in reduced engagement and learning, whereas the gamified and narrated scenarios proved beneficial. The gamified scenario used scores and achievements to motivate users, adhering to the Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA) framework.

Significant differences were observed regarding immersion across the scenarios, with the narrated and immersive scenarios providing varying levels of immersion. The gamified and narrated scenarios showed no significant difference in immersion, while interaction levels significantly influenced the immersive experience. Learning was found to be higher in the highly interactive scenario. The study concluded that a thoughtful implementation of VR in museum contexts could offer valuable educational experiences by providing interactive and immersive narratives that connect visitors to heritage objects.

The review by Zhou, Chen, & Wang (2022) also highlights the methodological considerations for incorporating VR and augmented reality into museum learning and underscores the importance of virtual technology in creating engaging educational environments.
