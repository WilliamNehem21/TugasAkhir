This section reviews recent methods for forecasting customer churn. Coussement and colleagues have introduced a risk prediction approach utilizing Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to identify customers likely to churn. These models allow for complex, non-linear patterns in the data, providing better marketing insights through visualizations of these non-linear connections.

The problem of class imbalance significantly influences classifier accuracy, mainly when the minority class is underrepresented, resulting in poor model performance on these classes. Zhu and colleagues suggest using transfer learning to address this issue, particularly in the banking sector, to enhance classifier performance by leveraging behavior data from similar fields. Xiao and colleagues have also explored methods for dealing with data imbalance in churn prediction. Amin and colleagues have compared various sampling approaches for handling churn data effectively. Additionally, game theory has been applied to predictive models.

The complexity of data has prompted the increased use of heuristic-driven prediction rules. Huang and colleagues have developed a rule-generation heuristic specifically for predicting customer churn in telecommunications. Faris and colleagues have proposed combining Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to cluster customers, remove outliers, and then use GP to create an advanced classification tree.

The classification process starts with defining the search space, where an initial population of fireflies is randomly distributed, and their positions and initial luminosity are determined based on proximity to the test data. The algorithm continues until a pre-determined stopping condition is met, such as a maximum number of generations or no improvement in a set number of iterations, to assess time complexity during development or for practical reasons in a production setting. The process is repeated for each data point and concluded with cross-validation to gauge classifier accuracy.

The performance of the algorithm can be concluded from the observation of high true positive rates (TPR), indicating precise classification of actual positives, and low false positive rates (FPR) in the beginning, although FPR considerably increases over time.
