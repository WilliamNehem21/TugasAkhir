Relation algebras extend the concept of Boolean algebras by modeling binary relations instead of merely modeling subsets of a set. These algebras include operations for composing relations and taking their inverses, as well as the familiar Boolean operations like intersection and complement. Because of their rich structure, relation algebras underpin the architecture of relational databases and contribute to program specification and verification, especially utilizing approaches akin to those proposed by Mili.

Within the context of such algebraic structures, certain queries might inadvertently lead to non-terminating searches. For instance, in logical frameworks like Twelf, which facilitate variable substitutions in queries, an incorrectly scoped search can run indefinitely along a path that does not yield a solution.

This issue is further illustrated in function composition, denoted as 'oo'. Tactics have been developed to help identify the type of a term, essentially determining the logical rule gained from combining other rules. The goal might be phrased as 'sa oo ss:?t', with '?t' standing for the unknown type. Furthermore, these tactics extend to finding a term that fits a specific type or proving a particular term, as highlighted by goals like 'sa oo ss:?p' that include term variables such as '?p'.
