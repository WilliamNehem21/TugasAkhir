Abstract Paraphrase:

This paper introduces an innovative framework for retrieving color images using a Full Range Autoregressive Model (FRAR) combined with a Bayesian Approach (BA) for parameter estimation. Within this framework, we derive color features, an updated version of the Edge Histogram Descriptor (EHD), and Micro-Texture (MT) characteristics. These features form a normalized vector that populates an image feature vector database. The database is organized through a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and the K-means clustering algorithm based on the image type.

The system utilizes Manhattan distance (L1 norm) for comparing the similarity between query and database images, which have been sorted and indexed. A relevance feedback mechanism further refines search results, bridging the semantic gap and enhancing retrieval accuracy. The experimental validation using precision and recall demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving EHD and overall retrieval performance.

Despite the variety of available Color-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems, their accuracy remains suboptimal. Our approach seeks to extract and balance visual image features more efficiently, avoiding the complex blend of traditional methods.

In our system, color features are extracted from the hue and saturation components after uniform quantization. Autocorrelation coefficients are obtained from the FRAR model to generate a color autocorrelogram. This gives a spatial correlation representation for identical colors in an image at a specific distance. Fine edge details contribute to an enhanced EHD, obtained from the value component of the image.

When a new query image is introduced, the system automatically categorizes it using RBFNN and locates similar images within the feature database using Manhattan distance. Retrieved images are ordered by similarity, and users can interact to refine results in the final retrieval stage. The paper proceeds to systematically describe the model, feature extraction, similarity measurement, system design, experiments, and results, concluding with the significant findings of our research.
