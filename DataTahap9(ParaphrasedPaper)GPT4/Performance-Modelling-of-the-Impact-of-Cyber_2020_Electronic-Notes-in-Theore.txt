The increasing reliance on online sales systems has necessitated the creation of numerous internet-based transaction protocols. However, these systems are highly susceptible to security threats due to the inherently open nature of the online space. One such threat is the Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which overwhelms a target with excessive traffic, disrupting service for legitimate users.

Evaluating system performance is crucial, particularly in understanding the detrimental effects and associated costs of cyber attacks on system functionality. By simulating system performance, we can anticipate how a system will respond in a variety of situations, with or without the presence of cyber attacks, and ensure it maintains efficient operation.

This paper utilizes Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA) to model the system being studied. PEPA, a stochastic process algebra, depicts a system as a collection of components that perform activities, either alone or with others, to analyze system performance. Each component's behavior is characterized by its activities.

Previous researchers have examined the performance of systems under attack. Meng and colleagues explored the impact of security measures on mobile offloading systems under timing attacks, employing a hybrid model pairing a continuous-time Markov chain with queueing theory to identify security-performance trade-offs. Wang and colleagues evaluated an email system under three distinct attack types using a queueing network-based model. They considered system availability, information leakage probability for security, and average queue length for performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of their analytical approach for email security under attack.

Gelenbe and Wang focused on a warehouse selling perishable items and assessed the financial repercussions of a DoS attack against its web server, suggesting the use of their queuing theory-based model as an optimization strategy. Zhu and Martinez investigated the effects of replay attacks on the stability and performance of linear control systems using a predictive control methodology.

Within the model, the timer component is integral as it monitors the shelf-life of warehouse products. This component can transition through several states (timer0, timer1, timer2), each allowing for different actions depending on whether a product expires or is sent to a customer before its expiration.

The study's goal is to compute the throughput of key actions performed by customers, attackers, webservers, and warehouses through ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It also examines the population levels of various component states. The simulation assumes all perishable products start fresh, with the timer component tracking their remaining shelf-life.
