To resolve large-scale optimization problems efficiently, exact algorithms fall short when dealing with high-dimensional spaces. Instead, inventive optimization techniques inspired by natural or artificial phenomena have been developed to find solutions that are satisfactory and near-optimal, if not entirely optimal.

Nonetheless, these methods can often get stuck in local optima, failing to reach the best overall solution. To address this, newer techniques like the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) have emerged.

The structure of the discussed paper is as follows: Section 2 presents a concise overview of hurricane meteorology, detailing the underlying concepts of the Hurricane Optimization Algorithm (HOA). Section 3 exhibits the experimental results. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 4.

In the HOA, simulation of wind movements spiraling out from the center represents the search process, repeatedly adjusting to identify areas of lower pressure, or better solutions. The algorithm's performance is validated using benchmark functions of varying dimensions and complexity. The statistical outcomes highlight the HOA's capability in solving nonlinear optimization problems. Future research should compare HOA against other metaheuristic optimization methods to validate its efficacy further.
