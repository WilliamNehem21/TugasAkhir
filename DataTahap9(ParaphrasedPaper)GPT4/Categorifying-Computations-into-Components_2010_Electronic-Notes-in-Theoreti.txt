This paper introduces a less complex version of a preceding scenario, although in the prior instance, the final lifting component was complicated by direct calculations. The novelty of this paper lies in its use of the bicategory of profunctors, referred to as Prof, for the demonstrations. One of the paper's aims is to showcase the practicality of performing calculations within Prof.

In this context, the paper identifies that a 2-cell operates as a strength in an internal context. As such, an arrow, complete with its full complement of operations (arr, >>>, and first), is recognized as a strong monad in the setting of Prof. This insight aligns nicely with the informal perception that arrows are an extension of strong monads.

The paper also examines the opposition of arguments of a function f as presented in a previous section. By looking at this specific functor, the authors define an end construction, which is assured to exist for a small category C, taking into account that the category of sets (Set) upholds small limits, thus ensuring the existence of small ends.

A challenge identified by the authors is that horizontal composition of 1-cells, namely profunctors, does not exhibit strict associativity due to the way composition is defined using coends and products. Consequently, associativity is guaranteed only up to coherent isomorphisms, just as with unitality. As such, profunctors are organized into a bicategory rather than a 2-category.

Proposition 3.3 in the paper presents a fresh mathematical insight into the concept of an arrow. The new axiomatization not only seems to have stronger foundations than the original definition, but it also appears simpler when compared to the elaborate approach of handling the 'first' operation in Freyd categories, which involves intricate concepts like premonoidal categories and central morphisms. The paper leverages this simplicity for the subsequent discussions and arguments.
