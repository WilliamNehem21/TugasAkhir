The paper discusses two main methods for retrieving information: one involves querying for entities based on their properties, and the other involves requesting overall information on a specified entity. While the former is well-studied, the latter, which offers many practical applications, has not been explored extensively due to complex issues such as defining when information is "about" an entity. The paper recalls formal definitions and highlights the need to adapt automated deduction methods such as deduction and abduction for this kind of retrieval.

With information on the internet being unstructured and mostly in natural language forms, the paper notes the importance of extending automated deduction methods to handle natural language keywords. These methods would help retrieve comprehensive information about entities.

The paper attempts to lay the theoretical groundwork and present practical methods for creating tools to retrieve extensive information about entities. The research draws from previous works by philosophers, logicians, and automated deduction experts with the aim to bridge the gap between theoretical definitions and efficient automated resolution strategies.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 categorizes different approaches to storing and retrieving information with examples. Section 3 delves into the theoretical foundations for characterizing information about specific entities. Section 4 is about presenting automated deduction methods to retrieve such information. The last section introduces open research questions that warrant further investigation.

Additionally, the paper provides a proof schema for resolving literals in clauses and developing a method to generate a minimal set of relevant clauses as answers. It also points out the challenge of decidability regarding the classification of formulas about entities and the potential need for a complete syntactical characterization.

Issues relating to the context-dependence of information about an entity and extending language to function symbols for more robust definitions are also highlighted. Lastly, the paper suggests that sometimes filtering information based on a specific topic, such as the toxicity of a drug, could be more effective than retrieving all information about an entity. This approach, along with combining it with the definition of "aboutness," presents another area for future research.
