In this study, we introduce the concept of an F-context, which is a structure defining a family of finite subsets related to the attributes within a formal context. We explore the systems of implication rules that arise from F-contexts that are consistent, unveiling that the conceptual hierarchy within a consistent F-context aligns directly with a particular kind of subset family found in these systems of implication rules. Building on this discovery, we establish the notion of a formal system of implication rules.

Additionally, we present the concept of information states for information systems that are finitely derived. Our analysis delves into the order-theoretic characteristics of partially ordered sets (posets) of these information states under the framework of set inclusion, revealing that every such poset forms an algebraic domain. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between approximable mappings, which relate the aforementioned finitely derived information systems, and the Scott-continuous functions that correspond to the resultant algebraic domains.
