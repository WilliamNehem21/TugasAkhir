This academic paper analyzes stability issues within consistency systems, focusing on systems that either retain memory of past consensus decisions or those that do not. The study emphasizes the role of symmetry in decision-making processes, where decisions are made based on the input distribution rather than the origin of the inputs. The stability characteristics of these systems are investigated, and precise bounds of stability are established based on their memory retention capabilities and symmetry.

The paper's structure is laid out so that system settings and problem definitions are introduced in Section 2. Section 3 delves into systems with memory, exploring the instability factors for systems with varying numbers of processors. If the number of processors is sufficiently large, the paper demonstrates that instability can be minimized to one decision change. In contrast, for memoryless systems, examined in Section 4, the paper explores a scenario with the minimal possible number of processors required for system operation. It is shown that in such systems, decision changes can occur with every new input; however, with a larger number of processors, it is possible to design a system where decision changes are significantly reduced.

In conclusion, the paper discusses how the stability of a consensus system is affected by its design, namely whether it retains memory and how symmetric its decision-making process is, while providing concrete examples and proofs based on system size and memory capabilities.
