The paper discusses a method, called expansion, that was introduced by Coppo, Dezani, and Venneri in the late 1970s to explore the range of possible types that can be assigned to a term in programming languages using intersection types. Until recently, expansion was not widely understood or used, despite its importance for compositional type inference, which is the process of deducing the types in a program in a modular fashion.

The core concept of expansion allows for the calculation of how a typing judgement would be affected by inserting the intersection-introduction typing rule into a typing derivation at any point without needing to reconstruct the derivation from scratch.

The authors have advanced the operational aspect of expansion by introducing expansion variables (often abbreviated as e-variables), which simplify the process and make the underlying calculation straightforward and comprehensible. E-variables are placeholders that allow for the deferral of decision-making regarding which typing rules to apply, until enough information is available from later constraint-solving processes to make an informed choice.

Importantly, the use of expansion is not limited to intersection types. It can also be applied to other type constructors such as those from linear logic. The introduction of e-variables aids in expanding this methodology beyond traditional intersection types.

The paper also discusses an approach to types known as the rank-k restriction, suggesting that while intersection types offer a robust framework for precision in typing, understanding the full type system is critical as it can be simpler and more instructive. Furthermore, it notes that the type environments used in this system are relevant, meaning they contain only necessary assumptions, and that the type system is also linear.

The paper is not about presenting new technical results but rather serves as an explanation of the expansion method, based on a quarter century of research.

Type variables, represented as lowercase Roman letters such as 'a', 'b', and 'c', are placeholders for types in this system. Distinct metavariables symbolize different variables within an example.

Substitution is a key process in working with e-variables, where placeholders are replaced with specific expansion terms. The authors clarify how substitutions are applied, even providing insights into how these concepts can translate into programming languages like SML and Haskell.

They argue that the historical difficulty in understanding and implementing expansion, especially when dealing with higher-rank intersections, has led researchers to focus on simpler rank-2 intersection types. However, with the advent of e-variables, they believe there are now better opportunities to work with full-powered intersection types without being limited to rank 2.

Looking ahead, the authors anticipate expanding the method to handle more complex type constructs, such as non-uniform typing rules and union types, with the aid of e-variables. They also suggest potential connections between e-variables, expansion, and various forms of unification problems in computer science, such as 2nd-order unification or semi-unification.

The authors conclude by acknowledging discussions and feedback from several individuals who have contributed to the historical and technical development of expansion.
