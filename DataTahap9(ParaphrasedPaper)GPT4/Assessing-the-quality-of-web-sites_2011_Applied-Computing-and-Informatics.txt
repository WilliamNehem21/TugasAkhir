This paper conducts a review of the latest methods for assessing e-business service quality across various websites, aiming to establish a universal framework applicable to any website, irrespective of its service type. The proposed evaluation framework centers on four quality dimensions: content quality, design quality, organization quality, and user-friendly quality, with detailed indicators and checklists for each. This comprehensive set of criteria is intended to serve as a guide for web designers and developers in crafting high-quality websites that enhance electronic services and bolster the online presence of organizations.

As e-commerce continues to evolve, it precipitates shifts in global business practices and ushers in an era characterized by information and communication technology-driven improvements in service quality, cost reductions for consumers, and increased business profitability. In this new business milieu, e-business—encompassing B2B, B2C, C2B, and C2C transactions—assumes a pivotal role, albeit with some terminological confusion between e-business and e-commerce potentially leading to policy incoherence.

Historically, research into website design for information retrieval and e-commerce has been exploratory, lacking a standardized framework for measuring website effectiveness. By synthesizing literature reviews, site analysis, identification of success factors, and personal expertise, this study proposes a theoretically sound, comprehensive, and measurable framework for website quality assessment. This framework, informed by studies across various sectors—education, government, e-commerce—identifies common dimensions of website quality, such as ease of use, security, and design, with an overarching goal of fostering improvements in website design and function. Ultimately, the framework may be operationalized into a survey tool to evaluate and refine these quality dimensions across different web domains.
