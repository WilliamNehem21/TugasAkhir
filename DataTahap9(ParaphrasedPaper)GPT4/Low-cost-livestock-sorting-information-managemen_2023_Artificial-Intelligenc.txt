The paper discusses the development of a low-cost, automated livestock sorting system that leverages deep learning and the industrial internet of things. The system aims to enhance identification and sorting of livestock, detect diseases, and track and predict data. Ideal health characteristics in animals include smooth, elastic skin with normal hair distribution and sebum levels, clear eyes without secretions, proper oral mucosa color and saliva, a moist nose free of discharge, and strong limbs with joints devoid of redness, swelling, or inflammation.

A modular device was created for a short-distance star communication network, with a central module controlling independent submodules capable of forming a sorting device consisting of inlets, detection, and several outlets. For pig sorting, the system combines soft and hard materials and uses sound and light to guide animals, thus minimizing human intervention.

Health checks rely on photographs of pigs to detect abnormalities. Decision-level fusion techniques and pre-trained binary classification models, combined with weight and visual data, sort out potentially sick pigs into isolation. Furthermore, ResNet-50, a deep learning model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is used for pig identification, with fine-tuned parameters in the fully connected layer for accurate identification. The system also incorporates weight measurements and integrates historical data to assess each pig's growth and health status.

Simulation tests evaluated the system, using state matrices and Kalman filtering to manage fluctuations in real-time weight data. The paper addresses the challenges of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as the gradient vanishing and exploding problems, and presents solutions like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and normalization in the VGG model. The introduction of the ResNet model also enables the network to be deeper by incorporating direct connections from input to output, retaining original data.

The system uses kappa values to validate the consistency of predictions. Despite a low kappa value indicating only a modest agreement, it was considered informative and acceptable in this study.

The paper concludes that while the model shows promise in livestock sorting and disease detection, there is a need for broader data collection, improved model robustness, and generalizability. Future work should focus on gathering more extensive datasets, exploring heavy recognition and 3D recognition technologies, and investigating multisystem disease detection. Collaboration with the veterinary field and agricultural organizations is expected to further research and develop sophisticated sorting information management systems for various livestock types.
