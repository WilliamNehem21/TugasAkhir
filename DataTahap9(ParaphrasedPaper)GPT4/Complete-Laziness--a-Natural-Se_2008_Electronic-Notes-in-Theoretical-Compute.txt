This paper discusses the efficiency and sharing in functional programming languages and their underlying semantics. It argues that certain implementations, regardless of their quality, can outperform state-of-the-art lazy interpreters for specific terms because the amount of overhead required for fully lazy reduction is disproportionate to the benefits derived from improved sharing. This is in contrast to optimal reduction, where the overhead costs negate the benefits of optimality.

A crucial aspect the authors examine is the soundness of the semantics, ensuring that the semantics are well-defined for the intended terms, which are generated by the normalization process outlined in section 3.1. Specifically, they confirm that the semantics preserve two properties: arguments of applications and abstraction bodies remain as variables or metavariables, and a proper naming convention is maintained throughout evaluation.

Despite concerns about the declining popularity of laziness in programming language implementations over the years, the authors stress that laziness still holds value. They suggest that combining strictness and laziness through techniques like static analysis and optimistic evaluation is a viable approach that can be adapted to their theoretical framework.

Moreover, the authors highlight the relevance of their work in the context of proof assistants like Coq, which are part of an emerging category of functional languages where programs (or proof terms) are constructed interactively. The unique and complex nature of these terms could benefit from highly lazy strategies. Therefore, the emergence of such paradigms presents a perfect opportunity to revisit the theory and practice of implementing programming languages, with fresh insights and approaches to addressing their specific challenges.
