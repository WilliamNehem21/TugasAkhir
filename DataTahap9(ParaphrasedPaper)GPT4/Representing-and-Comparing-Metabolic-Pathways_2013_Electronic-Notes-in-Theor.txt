We introduce two software tools, mpath2pn and cometa, as a part of a project focused on the depiction and analysis of metabolic pathways utilizing Petri nets. mpath2pn facilitates the automated conversion of metabolic pathways from major biological databases into Petri nets that are compatible with various Petri net tools, whereas cometa allows for the comparison of pathways from different species by using the Petri net format generated by mpath2pn. It leverages the KEGG database and compares pathways by considering reactions' homology and pathways' behavior from the perspective of t-invariants in the Petri net models.

Metabolic pathways are crucial biochemical networks within organisms responsible for producing essential molecules and energy. Comparing these pathways across species can reveal evolutionary insights and assist in the study of diseases, drug development, and industrial uses. We've developed tools for representing these pathways as Petri nets, which are a formal mathematical method suitable for visualizing, simulating, and analyzing complex systems. In Petri nets, places represent chemical species, transitions depict chemical reactions, and the model can reflect biochemical network properties like flux modes and conservations.

mpath2pn is programmed in Java, designed to interface with various databases for input like KEGG and BioModels, and supports various outputs for different Petri net tools. cometa automatically fetches data from KEGG and compares different organisms' pathways using a similarity measure that considers both reaction homology and pathway functionality in terms of steady-state potential fluxes, as indicated by t-invariants in Petri nets.

Several existing software tools already transit metabolic pathways to Petri net models using specific features, such as Snoopy for technical system verification and Cell Illustrator for biological system modeling and simulation. These tools often support formats like SBML and BioPAX and convert them to their proprietary XML-based Petri net representations. mpath2pn allows customization in the input and output phases, handling details like stoichiometric values which might be missing from the original KEGG data but can be supplemented using web services.

mpath2pn offers options for reaction-based or enzyme-based representation, as well as for modeling metabolic pathways in isolation or as open systems interacting with a wider metabolic network. Reversible reactions are represented by two transitions, forward and backward, which can also be managed in analysis when necessary.

We have presented mpath2pn for converting database pathway information into Petri nets and cometa for comparing pathways across species. Preliminary work suggests that our methods can produce valid phylogenetic classifications and may perform comparably to more sophisticated analytical measures. Research to further validate cometa and new mpath2pn translations is ongoing, as are explorations into the implications of different modeling approaches with both isolated and open Petri net models.

This work is part of an ongoing effort, and future developments include creating new translations for mpath2pn for more complex Petri net types and extending the functionality of cometa to more thoroughly assess the KEGG database and examine the impact of various modeling choices.
