This paper discusses the challenges of executing seamless handovers in heterogeneous networks where variable traffic from real-time and general applications can cause fluctuations. It suggests a machine learning (ML)-based approach to select the optimal network among several available options in a given location.

The study also explores the benefits of edge-based data storage in 5G handover management, which can reduce latency by processing data closer to users. Integrating this with handover processes ensures better connectivity and less impact on latency-sensitive applications.

To improve 5G handover management, the paper proposes proactive decision-making, optimization of handover control parameters, and the use of edge-based data storage. The effectiveness of the proposed handoff technique is confirmed through simulations, showing better transmission performance than standard methods.

Machine learning is highlighted as a key technology for future generations such as 5G and 6G. The paper reviews various ML approaches for handover management, emphasizing the trend towards ML-dominated methods.

Ant colony optimization (ACO) with adaptive pheromone evaporation is discussed as a novel approach for network selection challenges in the handover management process.

The paper examines the misconceptions around fuzzy-based approaches for cell selection, which could lead to incorrect predictions and suboptimal cell choices due to certain biases.

It suggests using reinforcement learning with Markov decision processes to manage handovers in slice-based mobile networks, utilizing techniques like experience replay to enhance training outcomes.

There's a focus on the integration of drones in heterogeneous networks and their impact on handover processes, reviewing current research and proposing future directions.

The simulation model incorporates a HetNet environment with macro, micro, pico, and femtocells, analyzing the mobility and handover decision process of randomly generated end users (EUs).

The importance of signal strength and thresholds for triggering handovers is emphasized to maintain efficient data transfer as devices move within the network.

Network selection algorithms can also consider edge server resources, giving preference to networks that facilitate lower latency data offloading.

Polynomial regression is used to analyze handover control settings and network performance to predict network efficiency based on available signal strength.

Proactive cell reselection is described, with EUs selecting the best service provider as the target cell for handover management.

Simulation details are given where EUs move randomly across cells, and the handover process is explained, with emphasis on selection based on the handover decision policy's score.

The paper also addresses handover failures due to target resource unavailability or EUs leaving network coverage, highlighting the impact on network performance.

Handover delay is analyzed, stressing the importance of timely cell selection to prevent significant latencies.

Finally, the future of transfer management is discussed, suggesting that automation, AI, and ML will play larger roles in identifying and rectifying network issues autonomously, with a nod towards advanced ML models and privacy and security concerns in ML applications.
