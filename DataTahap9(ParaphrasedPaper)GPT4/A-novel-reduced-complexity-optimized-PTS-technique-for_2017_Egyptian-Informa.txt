This paper addresses the challenge of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in wireless orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and the associated complexity of existing reduction techniques. Although previous schemes, such as those using cross-entropy methods or non-linear optimization for peak reduction tone selection, have aimed to decrease PAPR, they often do not reduce both PAPR and computational complexity concurrently.

The article is structured as follows: Section 3 characterizes the wireless OFDM system, highlighting the PAPR issue and presenting the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Section 4 is dedicated to discussing a proposed Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) technique. Then, Section 5 offers a theoretical analysis, including expressions for CDF, the number of subcarriers and subblocks, and the total computational complexity for the new scheme. The results and discussions are shared in Section 6, and the paper concludes with Section 7.

The new approach diverges from traditional methods by adapting the phase factors used in the PTS technique. It's suggested that decreasing the number of subcarriers and increasing the number of subblocks can lead to effective PAPR reduction. Analytical outcomes closely align with simulation results, indicating that this proposed method outperforms conventional PTS in both PAPR and computational complexity reduction.

The paper introduces a measure called the Computational Complexity Reduction Ratio (CCRR) to evaluate system performance, with higher CCRR values indicating better performance. The proposed technique achieves lower complexity, as demonstrated by CCRR values, which improve at lower trade-off factor values.

The novel contribution of this work is a low-complexity optimized PTS technique using a Random Phase Sequence Matrix (RPSM), which significantly reduces both PAPR and computational complexity in wireless OFDM systems. Optimal trade-offs between PAPR reduction and complexity are achievable by selecting an appropriate trade-off factor. The proposed method offers substantial improvements over traditional PTS, enhancing power amplifier efficiency and being applicable to contemporary wireless systems such as WiMAX and LTE.
