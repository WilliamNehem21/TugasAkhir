The paper discusses the prevalence and classification of leukemia, particularly focusing on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It mentions that in 2022, the US saw over 60,000 new leukemia cases and about 24,000 deaths due to the disease. The incidence of leukemia varies globally with over 20,000 pediatric cases noted annually in India. A review of records from 1990 to 2018 showed an increase in diagnosed leukemia cases, with a slight decrease in the annualized survival insusceptibility rate (ASIR).

Leukemia is categorized into acute leukemia (AL) and chronic leukemia (CL), with AL having a more aggressive progression. AL can be further subtyped into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on the French-American-British (FAB) system. Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly improve life expectancy for AL patients.

The paper is divided into five sections, covering a literature review, proposed methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. It introduces a novel Bayesian-optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying ALL in blood smear images and reports a maximum accuracy of 100% for an optimized CNN model. Various other studies are mentioned, each proposing different methods like SVM and CNN, ensemble models, and attention-based CNNs for identifying ALL, with accuracies ranging from 91.1% to 99.03%.

One method focuses on improving image contrast for white blood cell microscopy, achieving 83.72% accuracy. The paper also discusses three systems of leukemia detection based on neural networks, transfer learning in CNN architectures, and a combination of CNN and SVM with reported accuracies above 98%.

Additional articles focus on using CNN for ALL detection in blood smears and customized deep learning models for classifying acute leukemia with accuracy reaching up to 99%. An EfficientNet-B3 CNN framework demonstrates a high accuracy of 98.31%. The paper even delves into a classifier for facial expression recognition, accurate colon cancer survival models, and multiclass classification of blood cells using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods.

The research proposes feature extraction methods, including the use of ResNet50 architecture for leveraging deep features. It employs feature selectors like PCA, LDA, and SVC, as well as nature-inspired optimization algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO) and cat swarm optimization (CSO), to enhance classification accuracy.

The paper concludes with the potential improvements, suggesting the incorporation of the proposed methods into real-time applications, such as smartphone apps and IoT devices, to aid hematologists in leukemia diagnosis. The proposed model successfully categorizes ALL with up to 99.84% accuracy using feature fusion and optimization methods, demonstrating a significant advancement in leukemia classification.
