To augment the capability of smart city informatization and safeguard against coordinated malevolent assaults from communication participants, research has delved into incorporating functional encryption, blockchain, and differential privacy to tackle challenges like weight disclosure, collusion, and single-point failures encountered during federated learning. By integrating edge computing and asynchronous communication into the traditional federated learning framework, we could enhance model communication efficiency while preserving accuracy. Our findings indicate the FE-BDP algorithm sustains an accuracy above 95% consistently, demonstrating strong stability with negligible variance as the user count grows. The FE-LDP model exhibits a notably smaller loss value compared to others, maintaining it below 0.05. Blockchain encryption shortens data aggregation times to under 1 second, and the edge-asynchronous framework caters to diverse urban applications, enhancing data communication with up to 93.87% accuracy and reducing communication costs to as low as 1315.29 seconds. Our results underscore that security encryption technology effectively shields user data privacy and that edge-asynchronous frameworks substantially boost communication efficiency, thus offering substantial value for smart city development.

Current data encryption and communication methods prove daunting for managing large-scale urban data securely, as data breaches remain likely. Therefore, a federated learning (FL) framework has been proposed that preserves privacy by establishing a FL pattern, leveraging multi-party data without disclosing user information. However, as urban data dimensions grow, encryption complexity increases, and traditional FL struggles to protect user data effectively. Thus, the study integrates differential privacy under FL to encrypt smart city data further and incorporates blockchain to tackle privacy breaches due to system failures. Additionally, an edge asynchronous framework is employed for efficient data transmission, enhancing data communication productivity and laying the theoretical groundwork for smart city progress.

To reduce costs associated with parameter transmission and encryption, the study modifies the traditional FL algorithm into a sparse differential gradient. After the initial gradient parameter upload, only subsequent increments surpassing a set threshold are sent to the server. This selective approach curtails unnecessary communication.

When privacy loss crosses a specified threshold, signifying a high risk of data exposure, training is halted immediately. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables subscribers to determine their privacy budget (pb), but they often opt for higher pb values, compromising prediction accuracy. The study introduces an incentive mechanism where the lower limit of subscriber privacy preservation acceptance, pri, must meet conditionpri(eps; sigma) â‰¥ pri, with eps as the pb and sigma as the noise parameter. During iterations, the server circulates public test data and the initial model to subscribers who then competitively submit local model updates. High-accuracy participants are incorporated into the federated learning process and rewarded, fostering a balance between accuracy and privacy, thereby identifying adequate preservation strategies.

Edge servers establish thresholds for participant uploads; excess participants are excluded from aggregation to prevent outdated gradients from affecting the results. Post-aggregation, updated parameters are broadcast to indicate the end of a training iteration.

Communication between cloud center servers and edge servers is often hampered by delays and overhead, complicated by the variable number of clients and computing resources across edge servers. Synchronous communication, while eliminating gradient delay issues, binds the productivity of the cloud server to the slowest edge server, leading to resource wastage. Introducing asynchronous communication enhances model convergence and productivity, with gradient delay compensation ensuring minimal impact from delayed updates.

In different scenarios, the edge asynchronous framework displays consistent communication costs under 1350 seconds, indicating strong stability and high accuracy with low loss rates, suitable for various urban applications.

To enhance smart city development rates, a data encryption method employing formulaic encryption and differential privacy has been proposed within the FL framework. Model validation reveals the FE-BDP encryption model's superior accuracy, maintaining above 90% accuracy for extended periods, and shows precise improvements after introducing differential privacy. The FE-LDP model's loss values are significantly lower than competing models, consistently below 0.05, with blockchain-based data aggregation under 1 second. Evaluating the edge asynchronous framework indicates a remarkable enhancement in communication productivity, with potential for reducing communication overhead to 1315.29 seconds at best.

In summary, within FL, the mix of formulaic encryption and differential privacy effectively preserves data privacy and, along with edge asynchronous communication, improves productivity. Future research should consider updating data encryption and productivity enhancement techniques to account for the ever-growing dimensions of urban data.
