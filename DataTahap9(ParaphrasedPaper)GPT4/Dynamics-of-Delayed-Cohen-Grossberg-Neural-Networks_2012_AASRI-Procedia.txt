In this academic paper, the authors explore the behavior of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks when subject to various time delays. To assess the stability and dynamics of these networks, they introduce innovative Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, which lead to establishing criteria for three key properties: uniform ultimate boundedness, existence of an attractor, and global exponential stability. These criteria are formulated as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), which provide a more flexible approach compared to traditional algebraic methods and can be verified efficiently using MATLAB's LMI toolbox in real-world applications.
