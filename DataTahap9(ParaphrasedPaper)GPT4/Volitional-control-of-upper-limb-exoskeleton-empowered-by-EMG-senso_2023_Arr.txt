This study focuses on implementing AI-driven computational methods into a robotic exoskeleton for the upper limb. The research introduces a new EMG-based system for recognizing and controlling shoulder movements in real-time. The connection between the EMG signal recognition and the robot motion control system is facilitated by LabVIEW software via a graphical programming approach. Previous research primarily dealt with EMG signal processing for single Degree of Freedom (DOF) movements, but this work advances a computer system that can decipher multiple-channel EMG signals for an upper limb exoskeleton, aiding in daily activities.

The paper presents detailed methodologies for online data acquisition, signal processing, and system integration and reports both offline and online accuracy comparisons. Challenges in EMG-controlled prostheses include electrode positioning and changing EMG patterns over time, which typically require extensive training. The research discussed here aims to refine wearable robotic exoskeletons through multi-sensor data and intelligent algorithm training, focusing especially on intuitive shoulder and upper limb movement for daily tasks.

Using various machine learning models, EMG signals from multiple muscles were processed to control the exoskeleton. The models included SVM and NN, which showed promising accuracy during trials with healthy subjects. A LabVIEW-based machine learning system was developed to train and generate these models offline, which were then employed in real-time control setups.

The real-time system distinguished different upper limb movements by applying trained machine learning models to live EMG signal processing and classification. This system exhibited higher accuracy for some movements over others in tests with subjects. Among the tested ML algorithms, SVM delivered the best performance, probably due to the smaller dataset size used in this study.

While the study showed potential, it also highlighted limitations, such as the systemâ€™s ability to recognize only a limited number of motion patterns and that it only performed trajectory, not adaptive, motion control. Further clinical and industrial testing is required to understand system performance in patients with weaker EMG signals or in a work setting.

Future research will focus on refining the computing system for better discrimination of similar movements and determining an optimal array of EMG sensors. This work also implies future studies on ML-driven EMG data for adaptive control in upper limb exoskeletons. The study validates the application of ML in processing multiple channels of EMG signals for efficient real-time shoulder movement recognition and exoskeleton control.
