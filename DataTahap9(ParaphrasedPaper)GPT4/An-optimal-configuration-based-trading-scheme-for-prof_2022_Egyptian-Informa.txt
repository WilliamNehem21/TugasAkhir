The organization of the paper is constructed as follows: Section 2 presents prior studies. Section 3 outlines the framework of the system in question, while Section 4 introduces the problem and proposed solution. Performance evaluation of the approach is reported in Section 5, followed by a concluding summary and recommendations for future inquiries.

In the context of the alternating renewal process, a '1' indicates channel occupation (rendering it unavailable for trading), whereas a '0' indicates a free channel. This paper presumes the detection of channel state transitions via spectrum sensing, although this is not its central focus. The protocol to define channel state includes:

Maximizing profits for a primary user (PU) presents unique challenges, principally due to the fluctuating nature of spectrum availability and the dynamic traits of the spectrum market. Various market parameters, including demand, cost, and supply, evolve with time. Consequently, a PU must strategically manage both the admission and removal of secondary users (SUs).
