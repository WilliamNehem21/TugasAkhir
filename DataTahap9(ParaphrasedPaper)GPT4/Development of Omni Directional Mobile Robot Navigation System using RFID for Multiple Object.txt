The paper discusses the integration of an omni-directional robot with an RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) system to control the system effectively. The omni robot, known for its mechanical agility and ability to operate either tethered or autonomously, works in conjunction with the RFID system that utilizes custom features of RFID technology for navigation. The RFID set-up includes tags, a reader equipped with an antenna, and software. When the reader interrogates a tag, it emits a radio pulse, which prompts the tag to respond with its inventory control number.

The described mobile robot navigates by adjusting its orientation, turning left or right as necessary, to align with a pre-calculated compass heading. It continues to adjust its angle until it matches the target compass bearing. Once aligned, the robot moves forward and locates additional RFID tags. It identifies each tag it encounters, determining whether it is the intended destination. When the robot reaches its goal, it stops; if the tag is not the goal, the robot calculates the angle between its current position and the destination, initiating a continuous feedback loop to correct its course and eventually reach the target.
