An academic paper detailed an approximation algorithm with a 1.75-approximation ratio, which was later refined to a 1.5 ratio by Christie, and further improved to a 1.375 ratio by Berman, Hannenhalli, and Karpinski, despite their approaches being complex and challenging for practical implementation.

The study proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) that capitalizes on the polynomial solvability of signed permutations and the fact that finding an optimal solution for any signed permutation also solves the original unsigned permutation. This insight steered the development of the GA described in the paper.

Using the standard GA methodology, the process begins by generating a random initial population of signed permutations based on the input permutation. The population then evolves through generations, with each generation undergoing reproduction by selecting two individuals (parents), performing crossover and mutation to create offspring, and reintroducing these offspring into the population. The GA runs until a predetermined number of generations have passed.

This paper's improvement on the standard GA approach involves only applying 2-reversals, or reversals that eliminate two breakpoints at once, to the initial unsigned permutation. This action continues randomly until no more beneficial 2-reversals are found. The technique of prioritizing the elimination of breakpoints has been utilized in other approximation algorithms since optimal solutions often include many 2-reversals.

Fitness is quantified by the minimum number of reversals needed to sort a signed permutation, and the authors make use of an exact algorithm they provided for calculating this fitness efficiently in linear time.

The initial population size is set to n log n, where n is the length of the input permutation. Population individuals are generated in linear time, leading to an overall O(n^2 log n) time complexity for creating the initial population. The crossover process involves linearly producing offspring from the best members of the population, also taking O(n^2 log n) time. During mutation, each offspring's elements are individually examined to determine if mutation occurs; the mutation time is not specified but is implied to be efficient.

Experiments confirming the GA's effectiveness included tests on permutations with known reversal distances and on randomly generated permutations. Certain constants were used in the tests: a 0.9 crossover rate, a 0.02 mutation rate, parent selection from the top 60% of the population, and replacing the worst 60% of the population with the offspring.
