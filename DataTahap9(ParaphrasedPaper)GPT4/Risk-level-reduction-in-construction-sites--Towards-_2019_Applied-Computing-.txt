This academic paper underscores the growing concern regarding risk evaluation within the construction sector and highlights the limitations of conventional risk assessment models that often overlook site-specific variables. Notably, spatial and temporal factors significantly affect risk levels, which standard approaches tend to disregard. To address these shortcomings, a case study was conducted on the construction of a hostel for elderly people in Braga, Portugal. The study resulted in a novel method that rearranged tasks over time and space to successfully decrease peak risk levels.

The paper provides historical context, noting that risk evaluation emerged half a century after the industrial revolution in England due to concerns about worker safety and accident risk. The U.S. paved the way with early initiatives for risk prevention. The direct and indirect costs associated with workplace accidents and their prevention were recognized as early as 1928, and in 1931 H.W. Heinrich publicized his "domino theory" illustrating accident causation.

Falls at work represent a significant issue, both in terms of care and economic impact, with innovations being developed to detect falls using sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. Organizations tend to utilize safety management systems or behavior-based approaches to mitigate such risks.

The paper references various authors who have attempted to integrate task scheduling with risk management in construction. Different models and automatic applications have been proposed to optimize risk distribution in project planning. This study adds to these efforts by introducing physical and temporal dimensions to risk assessment, which has not been extensively validated previously.

The article outlines the methodological approach, compares traditional risk analysis with the new spatiotemporal method, and evaluates the benefits of the approach after its application to the case study. Organizational measures were examined and implemented to minimize risk throughout the project's timeline without disrupting critical activities.

The construction project in question exhibited two primary stages of risk: an initial phase with high-risk accumulation from similar tasks and a subsequent phase with numerous concurrent activities that, despite lower individual risk levels, cumulated to significant overall risk.

The findings emphasize the importance of integrating risk maps into project planning due to their substantial influence on construction site management. The complexities of construction work, including workforce changes and environmental exposures, challenge risk identification and management.

This research not only proposes new computer-aided risk management tools and methodologies but also demonstrates that organizational measures can effectively manage dynamic risk control during project execution. The next research step suggested in the paper is to explore the use of genetic algorithms for optimizing task redistribution to further reduce risk peaks.
