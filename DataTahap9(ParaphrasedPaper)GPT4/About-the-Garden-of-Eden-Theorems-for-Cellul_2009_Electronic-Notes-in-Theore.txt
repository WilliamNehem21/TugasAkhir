Cellular automata have been recognized for over fifty years as a powerful computational model, enabling simulations of various phenomena ranging from gas fluid dynamics to the movement patterns of pedestrian crowds in public spaces, as well as other physical, chemical, or social phenomena encountered in daily life. Despite their simplicity as dynamical systems, cellular automata pose numerous unresolved theoretical challenges. They represent a computational model subject to computability theory, and extensive research has been done on their computational complexity and Turing-complete capabilities.

In the 1990s and more recently, studies have examined the relationship between the existence of Garden of Eden configurations—unique patterns that cannot be preceded by other patterns in cellular automata—and the growth function of groups associated with Cayley graphs. This function, denoted for "n," measures the number of group elements representable by a product of no more than "n" group generators or their inverses. Various Cayley groups have been considered in different contexts, and it has been noted that in groups with exponential growth, it is possible to find injective (one-to-one) global functions that are not surjective (onto) and surjective global functions that are not injective.

However, Cayley graph techniques do not apply to many tessellations of the hyperbolic plane, except for specific cases where generating polygons have an even number of sides and an even number of polygons meet at vertices. In other cases, particularly when polygons have an odd number of sides, these methods are not suitable. Nonetheless, the tools developed in the referenced material can be utilized for tessellations of all mentioned parities to facilitate the implementation of cellular automata in hyperbolic planes.

Cellular automata are based on regular grids, and in the context of the hyperbolic plane, specific simple grids such as the pentagrid and the ternary heptagrid are used. In the absence of a privileged point or inherent orientation in the hyperbolic plane, a central cell is defined to establish sectors and a directional sense analogous to the Euclidean case. Neighbors of the central cell are mapped to roots of a Fibonacci tree, determining directions through rotations that associate sectors.

When proving a particular theorem, the states of cells are considered as either 0 or 1. The transition function between states depends on the neighboring cells' states. The results suggest that new arguments are required to establish the undecidability of surjectivity or reversibility of cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane. While injectivity has been shown to be undecidable by adapting Jarkko Kari's methods to the hyperbolic context, proving the undecidability of surjectivity and reversibility remains conjectural. This conjecture is supported by the independent findings of Maurice Margenstern and Jarkko Kari, who demonstrated that the tiling problem for the hyperbolic plane is undecidable using markedly different methods.
