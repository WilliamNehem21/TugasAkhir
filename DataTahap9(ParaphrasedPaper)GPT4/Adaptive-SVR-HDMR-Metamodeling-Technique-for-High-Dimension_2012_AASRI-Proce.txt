The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the foundational theories of HDMR (High-Dimensional Model Representation) and SVR (Support Vector Regression). Section 3 presents the new method which combines adaptive SVR with HDMR. In Section 4, this combined SVR-HDMR method is tested on two complex nonlinear problems. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 5.

High-dimensional model representation offers a structured expansion of response functions in hierarchical terms, with the option to evaluate each term independently. It is fundamental to HDMR that the relevance of the inter-variable functional correlations decreases quickly when viewed from the perspective of the output, mainly because in well-behaved physical systems, the influence of higher-order correlations among input variables on the response is typically modest.

The computational demand for cut-HDMR is affected by its highest expansion order. While numerous metamodeling methods have been developed within the cut-HDMR framework, a suitable sampling approach is yet to be devised. This study utilizes SVR to construct the HDMR component functions.

Traditional metamodeling methods often fall short in terms of efficiency when chasing acceptable accuracy for problems with unknown underlying functions. The proposed SVR-HDMR method leverages HDMR's hierarchical structure and enhances it with SVR to construct these component functions effectively.

The paper introduces a novel metamodel construction technique, SVR-HDMR, which combines HDMR's hierarchical approach with the explicit nature of SVR. This technique can autonomously deduce an explicit representation of the underlying function and its variable correlations without needing prior knowledge. The cut-point selection does not impact the constructed model's accuracy. Benefiting from HDMR's structure and the reutilization of sampled values, the proposed method significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining result accuracy. The SVR-HDMR method has been successfully applied to optimize the design of the ZK5540 machine tool structure for the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Group. Future research will focus on the development of an appropriate sampling method and further practical engineering applications.
