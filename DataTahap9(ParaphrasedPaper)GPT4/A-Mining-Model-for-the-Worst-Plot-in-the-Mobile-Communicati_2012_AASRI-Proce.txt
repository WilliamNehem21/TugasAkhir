This paper discusses the importance of maintaining high-quality network services in wireless networks, emphasizing the need to identify and improve cells with the poorest performance, known as "worst cells," which have a significant impact on overall network performance. It introduces a data mining model to effectively detect the worst cells using a clustering algorithm informed by weights determined through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

As mobile communication systems have achieved widespread coverage and capacity, the focus has shifted toward service quality and cost-effectiveness. The performance of network cells is critical, yet identifying the cells requiring optimization presents challenges. In the past, identifying worst cells relied on arbitrary definitions, resulting in a simple listing without an adequate understanding of the severity of their deficiencies or optimization priorities.

This research suggests that different performance indices have varying degrees of importance, and the paper employs AHP to calculate the weight of each index. The proposed model treats the worst cells as outliers and utilizes a distance-based clustering algorithm, specifically the k-means algorithm, which assumes that cells with similar performance measures are close in distance and should be grouped together.

The new model consists of four modules: index selection and weight determination, data collection and processing, mining (integrating index weights with the data mining algorithm), and optimization, which involves analyzing performance indexes and implementing targeted measures for improvement based on the findings.

The clustering outcome differentiates cells into distinct groups. Cells in the best-performing cluster require no immediate action, whereas those in the worst-performing cluster must be investigated and corrected swiftly. Cells in intermediate clusters require varying degrees of attention.

While the proposed model presents a novel approach for identifying the worst cells, it is acknowledged to have limitations. For example, it currently focuses on congestion and interference while there are many other performance indicators that should be considered. Additionally, the k-means algorithm has inherent flaws, and the subjectivity of the AHP method must be addressed.

In conclusion, the paper presents a valuable technique for the identification and optimization of the worst-performing cells in wireless networks, contributing to the improvement of network services. Nonetheless, further research is necessary to refine the model and address the identified drawbacks.
