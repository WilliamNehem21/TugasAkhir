In the development of a new system from pre-existing modules, mismatches between the behavioral interfaces of these modules can occur. These discrepancies can arise from inconsistencies such as varying message terminologies or messages lacking corresponding responses in other modules, potentially leading to deadlock conditions where components cease to function effectively together.

The research paper introduces an approach for formulating an 'adaptation contract' (AC) to coordinate interactions between components. This is done through the use of vectors that represent actions taken by individual components. The cumulative effect of these actions leads to the synchronization of all involved components, allowing for coordination without the prerequisite of identical action names.

Furthermore, these vectors are adaptable to complex system interactions, as they can include any number of components and accommodate a hierarchical structure within sub-processes. This allows for flexible and coherent interactions between components, irrespective of the varying behavioral interfaces.
