This academic paper discusses an enhancement to r-automata, a type of finite state machine equipped with counters that can be increased or reset. The key question examined is the universality problem: whether there is a constant bound such that all words are accepted by a run of the automaton without any counter exceeding this bound.

In the paper, the authors introduce a new feature to r-automataâ€”value copying, which allows the value of one counter to be copied to another. They demonstrate that the universality problem for r-automata with value copying can be reduced to the universality problem for standard r-automata. This implies that the modified problem remains decidable, as the original problem was previously proven to be.

The approach to achieving this involves substituting copy operations with a combination of resets and a special swapping mechanism. The paper outlines a method that ensures only a bounded number of these substitutions occur between each pair of resets for a counter value.

The authors relate their work to other research in the field, including studies on the decidability of similar problems for distance automata and extensions of automata with counters. An essential part of the advancement presented is showing how b-automata, which involve counting mechanisms for infinite words, can be complemented.

Additionally, the paper outlines the concept of value evolution and the associated runs within the automaton, providing a formal framework for understanding how values change over time as the automaton processes words. They also present a proof that demonstrates how this framework ensures the correctness of the simulation.

While the paper focuses on r-automata with a single copy operation, the authors discuss how their results can be extended to the more general case. This indicates a broader applicability of their findings within the realm of automata theory.
