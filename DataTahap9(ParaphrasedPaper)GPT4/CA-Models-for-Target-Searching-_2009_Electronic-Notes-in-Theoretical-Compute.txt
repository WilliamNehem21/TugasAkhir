In the presented academic paper, the researchers address the challenge of moving multiple agents from their starting locations to distinct targets on a cellular grid as efficiently as possible. They propose four distinct models which align with cellular automata (CA) principles, dealing with both directed and undirected agents, which behave in deterministic or non-deterministic manners.

In these models, agents are either assigned a specific moving direction (directed) or not (undirected). Directed agents have a preferred orientation, while undirected agents have no inherent directionality. The agents operate deterministically, following preset rules determined by a control automaton, with the essential rule being that only one agent can occupy a cell at any given time. Additionally, each agent is programmed to move toward its unique, stationary target without overlapping with others, thus avoiding shared goals.

Model descriptions:
1. Agents move on the shortest path towards their targets without a control automaton. The shortest path is defined as the one which reduces distance in either of two directions at every step. Agents randomly choose between equally viable directions, but if a conflict is anticipated, they randomly pick another direction or halt if all directions predict conflict.
   
2. Directed agents without a control automaton actively turn towards their targets to follow the shortest path. They randomly choose between two possible next directions. An arbiter in a crossing cell resolves anticipated conflicts, allowing one agent to proceed, and in cases where two agents face each other, they switch places.

3. Directed agents follow movements and turns dictated by a Mealy finite state machine (control algorithm) which is integrated within the overall cell automaton. These control algorithms evolve based on the number of agents present, ranging from 1 to 256, to handle the diverse scenarios that may arise during pathfinding.

The research at hand is unique in that unlike previous works where agents shared a common target, in this scenario, each agent has an individual target to reach. This specificity in goals forms the core difference from related studies that have examined various target-search scenarios, including those with moving targets and those with single agents. In this paper, the focus is on scenarios with multiple agents and stationary targets.
