The academic paper discusses the limitations of traditional model checkers in verifying anonymity within security protocols as anonymity is not a property that can be traced. Instead, the authors propose using epistemic logic, which deals with knowledge, to express and verify anonymity as an epistemic formula. They suggest using dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) for modeling security protocols and their anonymity properties.

The authors developed a tool that supports DEL verification by repurposing existing tools for automata-based verification. They showcase this method by analyzing an anonymous broadcast protocol and an electronic voting protocol, known as the "Foo" protocol, developed by Fujioka, Okamoto, and Ohta, which ensures anonymity for voters even against a coalition of various parties such as administrators and external entities.

The paper highlights the novel use of action models and the update product operation in DEL to represent communication actions and perform epistemic updates, bringing epistemic specifications closer to a behavioral specification. The authors argue that this allows a traditional verification toolkit to verify complex properties such as anonymity. They also compare the benefits and disadvantages of using epistemic-based verification methods against process-based analysis.

Overall, the study presents a new approach to verifying security protocols, particularly for properties that are difficult to express with traditional model checkers, by employing a tool-supported epistemic verification framework which utilizes dynamic epistemic logic.
