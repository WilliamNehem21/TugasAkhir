Guanlin Li and Wang (2011) highlighted that grape crops around the world are significantly affected by two serious diseases: downy mildew, caused by Plasmopara viticola, and powdery mildew, caused by Uncinula necator. Downy mildew thrives under conditions of heavy rainfall, high humidity, and prolonged leaf wetness while powdery mildew is favored by high humidity and damp weather. To mitigate these diseases, farmers rely on costly fungicides, which, according to Zhao and Pei (2012), can also lead to environmental harm. These chemicals are typically used only when clear signs of disease are observed.

In contrast to the variety of systems in the U.S. and Australia that predict crop diseases using meteorological data, there's a lack of models for grape disease prediction. Disease models that calculate average daily temperature and moisture duration are applied to manage ascospore infections, but their relevance to Californian climate has yet to be fully understood. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has facilitated real-time climate monitoring, pointing to the need for developing grape disease predictive models that utilize IoT data.

The paper continues with a structure that includes a background section, an explanation of methodology for detecting grape diseases in vineyards, and a presentation of experimental results, concluding with a summary and suggestions for future work.

The system utilizes a temperature sensor, a rain sensor, and a NodeMCU, an inexpensive development board targeted at IoT applications, to monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. NodeMCU manages each sensor and algorithms analyze the data to detect occurrences of downy and powdery mildew. The experimental results showcase that the proposed system outperforms existing ones, offering valuable early detection of these diseases.

The innovation of the system lies in integrating a rain sensor with temperature and humidity sensors, which significantly boosts the accuracy of disease predictions compared to using just a rain gauge. The performance gains from this device are evidenced by its high rates of correct disease identification: 94.4% for downy mildew and 96% for powdery mildew. This accuracy helps farmers reduce fungicide use, enhancing grape quality.

The essence of the paper is that a novel IoT-based early detection system for monitoring and predicting downy and powdery mildew in grape crops can lead to more timely and efficient disease management while reducing reliance on fungicides and improving grape quality.
