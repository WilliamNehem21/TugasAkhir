This paper discusses preference for algorithms that utilize posteriori preferences for independent treatment of objective functions in the pursuit of optimization. Through either maximization or minimization of each function, these algorithms produce a collection of potential solutions known as the Pareto set. With the available options, the decision-maker selects a feasible solution based on a compromise between these objective functions. MOPSO-CLAHE is cited as an example of such an algorithm within this context.

The paper also mentions Speed-Constrained Multi-Objective PSO (SMPSO), a method enabling Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address multiobjective optimization issues. Coello et al. describe a multi-objective optimization problem as seeking a vector of decision variables that both fulfill certain constraints and optimize a vector of objective functions.

To assess the efficacy of the Pareto set, the study employs the hypervolume metric, which gauges the volume of space dominated by the Pareto front in the objective space, using a reference point. This hypervolume indicator is crucial for comparing the dominance of one Pareto front against another.

Moreover, the paper provides a compendium of contemporary advancements in image enhancement algorithms focusing on histogram transformation, noting the infrequent application of multiobjective Pareto optimization. Furthermore, a novel multi-objective Pareto algorithm named MOPHE, including its mathematical framework, is proposed. MOPHE is crafted to enhance image contrast without causing undue distortion, yielding a set of solutions that balance contrast, entropy, and similarity.
