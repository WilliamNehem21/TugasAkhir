The paper serves as an introductory primer into a particular field of theoretical research. It starts with foundational terms and notable discoveries from nearly a century of study. Despite numerous important findings, a wealth of unanswered questions persists, particularly regarding the lattice structure of clones when dealing with sets of more than two elements.

The structure of the paper is laid out as follows: After the introduction, the second section outlines basic concepts and introduces key examples. The third section discusses exemplary research topics, notable outcomes, and unsolved issues. The fourth section delves into the Galois connection between polynomials and invariants (pol-inv), and the final section connects clone theory to Lawvere theories.

The research aims to explore specific aspects or characteristics of the lattices, summarizing decades of findings in several prominent works. The authors select and detail typical questions within the field, noting which have been answered and which remain open.

There's an emphasis on how much remains unknown about the clone lattice structure. The paper moves past the aim of exact descriptions, speculating on the quantities within certain lattice intervals. For example, the paper refers to recent solutions to questions about the number of clones above each minimal clone on a three-element set.

The paper highlights the significance of near-unanimity operations since clones containing them exhibit particular properties, are finitely generated, and are related to a finite number of other clones. These operations are also pivotal in duality theory, underpinning dualities like Stone and Priestley duality.

Regarding pol-inv, the paper states that it is a critical Galois connection for finitary operations and relations on a set, with the concept of preservation being essential to clone theory. The history of the concept in clone theory is traced, with initial investigations on unary operations on finite sets, leading to more comprehensive studies. 

For Galois closed classes within pol-inv, these are exactly the locally closed clones of operations and relations. However, when assuming a finite base set, local closure operators can be disregarded. In this finite context, Galois closed classes align precisely with operation and relation clones. The paper asserts that on a finite set, every clone is realized as the set of polymorphisms of some relations. The most renowned result in the survey, obtained by Ivo Rosenberg, did not directly find the maximal clones of operations but rather the minimal clones of relations. Using the Galois connection, this provided not only the desired results but also an elegant characterization of the maximal clones, categorizing relations such that a clone is maximal if it is the set of polymorphisms for some relation within this categorization.
