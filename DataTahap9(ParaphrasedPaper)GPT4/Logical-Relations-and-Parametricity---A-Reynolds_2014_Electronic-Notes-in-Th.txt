Before delving into the specifics of parametricity, it's important to recognize the general framework from which logical relations arise. This requires an approach analogous to how categories are defined, though we maintain only the identity elements and forsake the property of composition. This gives rise to what is known as a reflexive graph, which represents an advancement over prior research on structures like scones.

When it comes to logical relations, we face two primary challenges. The first is that the function type constructor does not maintain the composition of relations. The second issue involves the reintroduction of the variance problems typically associated with functors, which logical relations aim to circumvent. However, it is still observed that homomorphisms can function in conjunction with logical relations, either being composed before or after them, but the specifics of these bimodule constructions need further examination. Moreover, the idea of forming composite logical relations that involve higher arity is fascinating and might provide additional insights. 

Conversely, evaluating the characteristics of relations when composed might prompt an analysis within the framework of bicategories of relations, which could be more fitting in some scenarios. The exploration of relational modalities from a categorical perspective goes into this area. Furthermore, how endofunctors can be adapted in these contexts, and their potential applications to coalgebraic bisimulation, is an ongoing conversation, as referenced in related works.
