To enhance the intelligence of computer-based training (CBT) systems, this paper introduces a method for retrieving knowledge forms using information entropy. By examining the connections between different knowledge forms, a knowledge base can be constructed. This base enables the identification of specific knowledge forms responsible for training failures via the calculation of information entropy. By leveraging formulas for information entropy and combination entropy, the problematic knowledge chains are identified, reconstructed, and integrated into a training knowledge base catered to the learner. The paper proposes an algorithm for the reorganization of knowledge bases, allowing for the automatic exclusion of content already mastered by the learner, thus enhancing the CBT system's efficiency through focused training.

The development of an intelligent knowledge base aligns with research on human cognition. Academician Chen Qing-quan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, summarizes our era with the acronym BINC, representing biotechnology, information technology, nanotechnology, and cognitive technology â€“ all areas significantly influenced by cognitive science, an interdisciplinary field involving philosophy, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and computer science. Yu Sheng-quan suggests that digital learning has evolved from transmission and behavioral paradigms to constructivist cognitive paradigms and, more recently, to situational cognitive paradigms.

Historically, various mathematical methods have been proposed to handle uncertainty and imprecision in information processing. In the 1960s, L.A. Zadeh from the United States introduced fuzzy mathematics; in the 1980s, Polish mathematician Z.P. Pawlak developed rough set theory; and there are others like grey system theory. While successful in intelligent information processing, these methods face challenges when applied to CBT systems, particularly in linking them to knowledge element retrieval due to the complexity of knowledge networks.

Claude Elwood Shannon's introduction of information entropy in 1948 laid a foundation for information theory that extends beyond communication systems, intersecting with fields such as physics, mathematics, electronic engineering, and computer science. The concept of self-information relates to the uncertainty measurement of a signal, and in the context of knowledge elements affecting training outcomes, the more probable a knowledge element's impact, the less uncertainty it carries.

This paper's primary goal is to facilitate the identification of knowledge elements leading to training failures. From a cognitive science standpoint, it categorizes knowledge base information entropy and establishes a search algorithm for knowledge elements, consequently increasing the CBT system's utility and efficiency. A practical implementation of this approach is the intelligent computer-based aircraft maintenance training system, which confirms the algorithm's viability. Future work aims to refine system details, including the segmentation of knowledge elements and the weighting of their interrelations.
