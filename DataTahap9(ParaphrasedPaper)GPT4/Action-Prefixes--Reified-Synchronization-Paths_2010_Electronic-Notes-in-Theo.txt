Partition refinement is an effective method to simplify and lessen the complexity of the interaction automata of composite components. However, it can lead to unintended results, like the emergence of non-deterministic transitions in the reduced automata that weren't present in the original model. Such transitions need to be appropriately managed because their removal is crucial for the correct system functionality.

Initially, component interaction automata rely on external specifications to define available ('provided') and needed ('required') actions. Integrating these external requirements directly into the automata specifications clarifies their connection to the automata and simplifies the composition process. When an automaton interacts with all actions, this specification can be omitted as it is implicitly understood.

Component interaction automata can represent different entities, such as a customer, store, and bank. These are considered primitive components, which means they lack a detailed internal structure. 

To compose these automata, their state spaces are combined in a cross-product manner. The 'provided' and 'required' action sets dictate the available interactions in the composed automaton, which captures the system's behavior through its reachable states. States that become inaccessible are promptly removed to keep the automaton representation as compact as possible.

In this context, 'action prefix generator' defines the sets of prefix strings accepted by a given state, characterizing the language of acceptable action sequences for that state.

Enhancing the results of partition refinement can be achieved by initially disregarding the composition hierarchy and treating the components as primitive. When composite automata embody multiple instances of a single component, replicated sub-structures arise. Unique identifiers usually prevent the refinement process from consolidating these duplicates into a unified structure. A potential solution is to create a new version of the automaton with uniform component names, although this implies the loss of certain synchronization details that are to be regulated.

Finally, refinement simplifies component interaction automata by eliminating synchronization cliques, yet the paper presents a viable approach to reintegrate preconditions into the reduced automata if necessary.
