This paper discusses the challenge of mitigating dephasing in superconducting quantum computing systems, specifically focusing on the dephasing effects on a transmon qubit during dispersive readout. The readout relies on a Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (TWPA) as the preamplifier, which has advantages in terms of bandwidth and dynamical range but can introduce severe dephasing due to pump leakage. This leakage can cause measurement-induced dephasing, the AC Stark effect, and heating.

The study utilizes high-coherence tantalum-based transmon qubits and custom-made TWPAs to analyze the impact of pump leakage on qubit dephasing. The researchers evaluate different aspects that could contribute to dephasing, including backward amplification, leakage, and noise, and they propose a metric to compare readout modes.

An experimental section looks at the various dephasing factors and introduces pulse-mode readout as a potential solution, confirming its effectiveness through the proposed metric. The TWPA is described as a device that amplifies signals using an array of Josephson junctions or other non-linear elements through three- or four-wave mixing.

TWPAs are preferred for qubit readout for their low noise, having the capability to reach near the quantum-limited noise floor and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), surpassing commercial amplifiers. However, TWPAs can also experience challenges from mixed waves, leading to suboptimal backward amplification if there's a significant impedance mismatch.

Finally, the paper suggests that using pulse-mode readout may offer a more effective way of reading qubits with less dephasing, approaching the theoretical optimum for measurement efficiency â€“ a balance of measurement sensitivity against the rate of decoherence. Experimentally, it was shown that removing a circulator (a device typically used to isolate signals) and using a second directional coupler to measure backward gain still resulted in significant dephasing when the pump was active, highlighting the need for proper isolation techniques or strategies to cope with pump leakage and its effects on qubit dephasing. The study's findings are crucial for the development of scalable quantum computing systems, especially in designing quantum error correction protocols and circuits that can leverage the full power of quantum algorithms.
