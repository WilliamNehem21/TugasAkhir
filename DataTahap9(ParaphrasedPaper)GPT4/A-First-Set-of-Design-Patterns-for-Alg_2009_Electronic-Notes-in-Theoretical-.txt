This academic paper explores the concept of design patterns, which are solutions to frequently occurring problems in various contexts. The paper is organized into several sections:

Section 2 provides an overview of the fundamental components of design patterns, emphasizing that while the specifics of implementation may change, the underlying principal solution remains applicable across different situations.

In Section 3, the authors introduce a navigation pattern that allows users to move forwards and backwards without relying on an undo stack. This is achieved by reverting to a known state and progressing forward quickly, a technique similar to reverse debugging and checkpointing.

Section 4 presents a pattern that facilitates the extension of audiovisual (AV) systems without affecting other segments of the system. This modular approach allows for adding new functionalities with minimal changes to existing code.

Finally, Section 5 reviews the patterns discussed in the paper and suggests directions for future research on patterns relating to AV systems.

The paper acknowledges the usefulness of design patterns in solving recurring problems by applying a core solution. It also recognizes that while traditional elements of a pattern like motivation and sample code are important, the paper focuses on pattern names and relevant subsections for clarity and brevity.

Key points to note are the challenges of undo stacks, the proposed pattern to navigate without them, and the pattern for expanding the capabilities of AV systems in a way that minimizes interference with established code.
