The paper discusses the integration of advanced technologies in agriculture, known as smart agriculture, which aims to enhance farming practices through technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, cloud, and edge computing. These technologies are used to manage the vast amount of data generated by agricultural components. Despite its potential, smart agriculture is still in its infancy and lacks robust security features. Proper security is essential for reliable and efficient systems, as the field involves a diverse array of resources, compatibility challenges, and data management issues.

Smart agriculture faces unique security challenges because its devices are installed in open areas prone to weather conditions, human activity, and other external factors. Unprotected sensors, for example, could be damaged by animals or agricultural machinery. The risks associated with smart agriculture also extend to the threat of cyberagroterrorism, where attackers may target agricultural systems to cause economic damage or social unrest.

The paper reviews the architecture of smart agriculture systems, identifying security threats at various layers, from devices (sensors and actuators) to data transmission and cloud processing. It emphasizes that the heterogeneous nature of devices and software from different manufacturers can introduce vulnerabilities and interoperability issues.

Security incidents can result from both accidental and deliberate actions, such as tampering by animals or attacks on network communication. The paper points out that standard security mechanisms designed for the traditional internet may not be appropriate for agricultural contexts.

Key security concerns highlighted in the paper include data integrity, data accuracy, availability, and the protection of resources like sensors and actuaries from external threats. It also discusses challenges at the network and application layers, such as data transit and routing attacks, phishing, and malicious scripts.

The paper concludes by acknowledging that smart agriculture has significant room for improvement in terms of security, and future systems must focus on ensuring data privacy, reliability, and accuracy while being robust against multifaceted threats. Consideration of security measures needs to be integrated from the onset to protect against a wide spectrum of possible cyberattacks.

Several case studies of smart agriculture applications are analyzed, highlighting their lack of detailed security features, which makes them potential targets for various forms of cyberattacks that could compromise system integrity and reliability.

In summary, as smart agriculture continues to develop, addressing the security challenges will be crucial. Future smart farming solutions should not only focus on automating and optimizing agricultural processes but also on building secure systems that can withstand a variety of security threats.
