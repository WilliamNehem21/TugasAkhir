The paper discusses the challenge of efficiently accessing accurate information due to the surplus of data, emphasizing the role of automated text summarization technologies in addressing this issue. Despite extensive research in the field, there is still a need for improvement. Document summarization, a subset of natural language processing, aims to condense large documents while retaining essential information.

The paper is structured to cover the proposed summarization method's stages, tools for text preprocessing, and strategies for determining key textual elements. It also includes comparative analyses with state-of-the-art methods and a discussion of experimental results based on established evaluation metrics.

While prior studies have often concentrated on extractive summarization, the paper acknowledges contributions to abstractive summarization, referencing works that have utilized RNN structures for this purpose.

A novel graph-based, extractive, multi-document summarization method is introduced, using three primary stages involving text preprocessing, graph representation of word commonalities, and sentence weighting via eigenvector node centrality to create condensed summaries. The study presents a developed preprocessing tool named KUSH, designed to handle semantic nuances in word representation.

The paper identifies the issue of finding maximum independent sets as an NP-hard problem and highlights this as a limitation in previous summarization work. A unique aspect of the proposed method is leveraging the concept of independent sets to isolate and remove non-essential sentences, leading to the generation of more efficient summaries.

Comparative performance analysis of the proposed method is conducted using various ROUGE metrics on specific datasets (DUC-2002 and DUC-2004), showing promising results in producing concise and relevant summaries. The paper ultimately illustrates that the proposed approach outperforms several existing methods based on ROUGE scores, showcasing the method's novelty and effectiveness.
