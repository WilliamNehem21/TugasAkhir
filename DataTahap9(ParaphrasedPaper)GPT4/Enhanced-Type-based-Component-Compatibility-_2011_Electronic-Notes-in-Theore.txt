Academic research in software engineering aims to establish methods for safely swapping one software component for another without causing system failures. These academic methods usually involve rigorous theoretical frameworks but tend to be so complex that they are not practical for everyday use by software developers. Additionally, they may require computational resources that exceed what is feasible (e.g., cited works [15,16]).

In practical industry settings, compatibility between components is often managed with simple metadata like version numbers, which are manually assigned. The downside here is that accuracy depends on correct human judgment, which can be error-prone.

One example of higher-level abstraction is the work by Georgas et al., who propose using runtime architectural models to oversee application evolution. Their approach involves setting constraints to ensure certain architecture qualities are maintained through changes, although they do not delve into specifics about their model or the constraints.

Holistic research methods have been devised for ensuring system integrity when substituting components (cited works [21,11]). For instance, Chaki et al. utilize component-based reasoning combined with dynamic checks to ensure compatibility. However, like others, these methods are based on advanced formal tools, like model checking or behavioral subtyping, and often involve complex notations that are not user-friendly for most developers, posing issues with complexity and usability ([16,9]).

Few research initiatives focus on the practicalities of industrial component frameworks. An example is the work of Polakovic et al., who introduced consistency checks within a resource-constrained component model. They combined compile-time type checks with error handling. Our approach might be too resource-intensive for such contexts.

An effective approach for evaluating component substitutability includes understanding the deployment environment of the component, acknowledging surrounding components and architectural links. We focus on a simplified aspect of this broader challenge, justified by the practical difficulties present in industry, such as the unavailability or unreconstructability of advanced specifications; therefore, verifying semantic compatibility is challenging.

Our implementation of contextual substitutability must address several key issues. It should embody runtime subtype relations and determine how to represent these types. It must also extract component types and their context from various sources. For the OSGi framework, component types and related information are dispersed across the manifest file, XML files, and the bytecode, complicating data gathering.

Our approach's underlying philosophy is to remain open to all types of component interface elements, allowing for the incorporation of any semantic or behavioural specifications compatible with our component type model.

Future research should expand formal methodologies to handle component clusters for broader application substitution and focus on the dynamics of inter-component relations. As for practical implementations, particularly in OSGi environments, there will need to be provisions for the currently absent elements of the component model and solutions to integrate closely with existing frameworks.
