The research paper focuses on analyzing the reliability of networks, a pivotal concern within numerous scientific studies. The task at hand is to assess the all-terminal reliability of networks through two recognized approaches: exact and approximate methods. The paper's contribution is to propose an effective exact technique to enumerate minimal cuts (MCs) in R-networks, leveraging the preliminary step of determining the minimal paths set (MPS). From the MPS, the MCs are derived utilizing binary decision diagrams (BDDs), through a process that involves a series of transformations, reductions, and filtering operations. This innovative approach is promising in terms of reducing both the computational time and the necessary memory space. It has been applied in a case study to assess the reliability of a national radio communication network.

In the domain of reliability engineering, networks are crucial in representing the interrelations among system components, picturing these through a graph where the edges correspond to components such as various devices, and the nodes to the interconnections.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces preliminary concepts related to the study. Section 3 explains the intricacies of manipulating BDDs. Section 4 and Section 5 present the algorithm for generating MCs from reduced ordered BDDs (ROBDDs) and offer evidence of its computational efficiency through tests on benchmark networks. Section 6 elaborates on how an ordered BDD (OBDD) can be converted to a ROBDD by repeatedly removing duplicate and redundant nodes in a bottom-up manner. In cases where nodes are found to be duplicates, one is eliminated and all incoming pointers are redirected to the other. Similarly, a redundant node is removed with all its incoming pointers being redirected to its only child.
