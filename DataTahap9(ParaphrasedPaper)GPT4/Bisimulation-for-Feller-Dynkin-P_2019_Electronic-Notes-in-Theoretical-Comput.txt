In this study, the authors attempt to develop a comprehensive theory of bisimulation, which is a concept used to describe the equivalence of different stochastic systems that evolve in true continuous time. The focus is placed on a type of system known as Feller-Dynkin processes, which are well-understood within mathematics. Feller-Dynkin processes are a very general form of Markov processes that operate in continuous state spaces and evolve over continuous time. Examples of such systems include Brownian motion and its variants.

Within the context of the systems being examined, there are two basic statements referred to as atomic propositions (labeled p and q in the diagrams) that are fulfilled by the end state of certain branches of the process. The process itself is characterized by continual movement to the right at a constant pace. Upon encountering a fork, the process has a 50% chance of proceeding along either branch and will terminate if it encounters one of the atomic propositions.

The authors then argue that the form of bisimulation they are discussing is the most extensive possible. They consider two distinct states, x and y, and as with their analysis of standard Brownian motion, they dispel the case where either x or y is zero (and the other is not) by examining a particular function they refer to as obs.

Finally, they mention the possibility of describing bisimulation as the fixed-point of certain operators acting on metrics. This concept was previously defined for jump processes in other literature, specifically in references [19,20]. However, the authors of the current paper suggest that there may be mistakes in those previous works. Their goal is to correct these errors and extend the approach to fit within their theoretical framework for Feller-Dynkin processes.
