The paper discusses the understanding of analogies and how they can be combined or concatenated when they share no common symbols, which aligns with intuition. The paper identifies three intuitive methods of concatenation but rules out the possibility of mixing symbols.

According to the paper, the defined process aligns with traditional presentations of formal languages and their generation. Using standard structural induction, the paper describes a system for generating a language of analogical strings by applying analogies between elements of a set A using models from a set M.

The opposing issue to generation is recognition: determining whether a given string belongs to a language by comparing it to known strings within the language, reducing the new string by analogy using models. Recognition uses models in reverse compared to generation, made possible by inverting ratios as per a theorem referenced in the paper.

The paper also addresses the concept of consistency within an analogical system, providing a proof and a proposition that for any given string of the form a^n b^n, one can inductively prove its membership in the language of analogical strings by considering both the elements of A and the relations within M.

This proof relies on determining the maximum lengths of strings in A (k_a) and the maximum differences in lengths of related string pairs in M (k_m), proving the conclusion based on the assumption that both A and M are finite sets.

Overall, the paper delves into the formal linguistic generation and recognition of analogical strings based on the application of analogies and the ruling out of symbol mixing, adhering to formal language theory principles.
