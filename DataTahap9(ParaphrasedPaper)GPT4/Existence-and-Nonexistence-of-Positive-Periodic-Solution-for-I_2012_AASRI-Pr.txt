This paper focuses on examining an impulsive version of the Nicholson's blowflies model. By deploying the Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem, the study derives certain conditions that must be met for positive periodic solutions to exist. The research also delves into situations where these positive periodic solutions do not exist. These new findings build upon and enhance the understandings presented in previous research studies related to the dynamic behaviors, such as oscillation and global attractivity, in Nicholsonâ€™s blowflies model, particularly in regards to establishing the presence or absence of positive periodic solutions for the given system.
