Attribute grammar specification languages, like Silver, possess advantages due to their high-level, domain-specific nature. Yet their adoption is hindered by perceived feature limitations. Silver addresses this by incorporating both general-purpose features, such as pattern matching, and domain-specific features for tasks like data-flow analysis. It achieves flexibility through an attribute grammar defined in Silver itself, using forwarding for cost-effective extensions.

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are often concise and declarative, offering problem-specific notations and optimizations. However, challenges described by van Deursen et al. include providing sufficient expressiveness without complexity, achieving performance, and ensuring maintainability.

Attribute grammars, despite their four-decade history and applicability to various language analysis tasks, remain underutilized. The authors' implementation of Silver demonstrates the integration of modern features for extensibility.

Silver was designed to be Turing complete with higher-order attributes and features like forwarding and a module system. This design enables extensions for general purposes or specific domains, such as creating optimized program structures or type representations.

Illustrative examples rather than formal definitions clarify features like pattern matching, collection attributes, and attribute extensions for creating data-flow analyses.

The paper discusses how Silver enables the combination of local and global transformations without interference, ensuring composable language evolution. Silver's innovative framework allows domain-specific and general-purpose features to be added as modular extensions, speaking to the language's evolving nature and potential for widespread adoption.
