The study examines a layer of incompressible Oldroydian viscoelastic fluid that contains suspended dust particles and is influenced by a uniform vertical magnetic field. The researchers aim to understand how Hall currents affect this system within a porous medium when it is heated and soluted from below. By applying linear stability theory and normal mode analysis, a dispersion relation is derived. 

Results show that in situations where convection remains stationary, Oldroydian viscoelastic fluid exhibits characteristics similar to a Newtonian fluid. Dust particles and Hall currents generally tend to destabilize thermal and solutal (thermosolutal) convection. Conversely, the application of a magnetic field tends to stabilize the flow. The permeability of the porous medium can either stabilize or destabilize the convection depending on specific conditions. Numerical values are assigned to various parameters within graphs to illustrate the stability characteristics of the system. Additionally, scenarios of overstability are explored.

Previous experiments and theoretical models (such as those by Toms and Strawbridge) confirm Oldroydian fluid behavior, and various studies (by Sharma, Bhatia, Steiner, Sharma, and Bhardwaj) investigate thermal instability and hydromagnetic effects in related systems. The Boussinesq approximation is commonly used in such studies and typically shows that magnetic fields stabilize fluid behavior. 

The Hall effect, which is significant in both geophysical contexts and laboratory plasmas, drives increasing interest in the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids across several industries and scientific disciplines. Previous literature (by Kumar and Kumar, Singh and Dixit, Wang and Tan, Bishnoi and Goyal, and Kumar and Mohan) explores various aspects of fluid stability under different conditions, including the presence of magnetic fields and suspended particles.

However, past research has overlooked the impact of Hall currents on the stability of Oldroydian viscoelastic dusty fluids within a porous medium. To fill this gap, the current study incorporates these currents into the analysis. The findings demonstrate the complex dual role played by both magnetic fields and medium permeability on thermosolutal convection, offering a more comprehensive understanding of fluid behavior under the considered conditions.
