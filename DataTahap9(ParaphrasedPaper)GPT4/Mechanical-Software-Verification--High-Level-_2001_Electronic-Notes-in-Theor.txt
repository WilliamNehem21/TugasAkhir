The authors aim to exhibit a proposed modularization at the source level and affirm compiler reliability through two interconnected examples. An industrial project involving the confirmation of a safety-critical expert system is outlined in Section 2 and is verified utilizing the ACL2 theorem prover. Safety is established through what the authors term "verrequirements", vital for trustworthy compilation, discussed in Section 3. A mathematical structure is proposed in Section 4 to rigorously define compiler correctness through the maintenance of source program correctness, and a mechanical proof demonstrating the preservation of partial correctness for a simplified compiler using ACL2 is sketched in Section 5. The significance of toy examples for successful verification is underscored in Section 6, followed by insights gained and suggestions for future theorem provers within software verification.

In this context, relay groups containing only terminals, connectors, and relay contacts are examined. Diodes, resistors, and capacitors are excluded. The test plan includes conduction and insulation tests, taking into account the interdependence of relay contacts and measurement constraints of a testing robot. The reliability of the resulting test plan, known as the "relais master," is critical due to its role in automated certification.

Regarding program correctness, the authors extend classical notions of correctness to the relative correctness, taking into account a program's predefined semantics and analyzing its adherence to preconditions and postconditions. The paper elaborates on the challenges in proving not just the accuracy of source code semantics but also the expected outcomes when executed on machines, with special attention to the nuances of conditional statements.

The paper acknowledges that while the examples presented are simple compared to real-world compilers, they contribute significantly to the field by offering insights into the verification of complex compilers. In a related work, PVS (Prototype Verification System) is used with operational semantics and inductive relations to provide a similar proof structure to that in the ACL2 mechanical proof.

The success of software verification, although challenging especially for intricate systems, is reinforced by mechanical proofs that facilitate finding errors and validating correctness. However, the authors stress the reliance on theorem provers and urge that proofs should be comprehensible or verifiable by trusted checking programs to avoid gaps in the verification process.

The authors express a technical desire for improved handling of programming language semantics, remarking on the difficulties of modeling partial functions and inductive relations in ACL2 and PVS. They suggest a more supportive theorem prover well-equipped to work with partial functions.

Finally, the paper concludes with a reference list of works that contribute to the discussion and support the topics covered throughout the paper.
