This academic paper focuses on the study of the metric dimension of digraphs, primarily using the foundational definitions proposed by Chartrand, Rains, and Zhang. Initially, a characterization for digraphs with a metric dimension of 1 was provided, followed by research into the computational complexity, revealing that determining the metric dimension of a strong digraph is an NP-complete problem.

The text clarifies the difference between an oriented graph and a digraph. To form an oriented graph (a special type of digraph), one assigns a direction to each edge of an undirected graph, converting it into an arc. In contrast, general digraphs may have pairs of vertices connected by arcs in both directions, unlike oriented graphs, which result from the orientation of simple graphs.

The paper discusses properties of shortest paths in graphs, noting the first vertex where they differ, and introducing the concept of a grid and a torus, both of which are Cartesian products of paths and cycles, respectively. In undirected graphs, the metric dimensions of a grid and torus are relatively straightforward, with standard values of 2 and 3.

The authors then present a key result of the paper: calculating the maximum metric dimension of a strong Eulerian oriented torus. They define WEOMD(G) as the maximum metric dimension over all strong Eulerian orientations of a connected graph G, and extend this to a family of graphs.

The paper also examines the maximum metric dimension of strong oriented grids and establishes a result for that configuration, applying terminology introduced earlier for tori.

In conclusion, the paper surveys several graph families regarding their worst strong orientations concerning metric dimension. The researchers have identified the worst orientations in some cases, like strong Eulerian orientations of tori, and have presented lower and upper bounds on the worst oriented metric dimension (WOMD) for other graph types. The paper suggests that future work should aim to narrow these bounds and investigate strong orientations of other graph families.
