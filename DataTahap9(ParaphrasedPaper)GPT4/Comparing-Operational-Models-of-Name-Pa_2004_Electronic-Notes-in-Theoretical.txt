The requirements specified by H3 and H4 guarantee that a single history-dependent automaton can generate the transition relation at most. The inherent characteristics of the source, target, and label functions confirm that the transition relation adheres to the stipulation B3. Furthermore, the criteria outlined in H1 and H2 make certain that the transition relation complies with the prerequisites B1 and B2.
