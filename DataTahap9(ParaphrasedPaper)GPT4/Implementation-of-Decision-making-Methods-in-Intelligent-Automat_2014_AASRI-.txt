The paper discusses how to enhance individualization in learning through intelligent automated educational systems (IAES), which requires the development of specialized decision-making methods. The authors suggest fully individualizing various aspects of learning such as assessment, managing individual learning paths, curriculum adaptation, test sampling, and man-machine dialogue by simulating the afference process. This involves finding a balance between the goals of student, teacher, and tutor models within the learning environment.

To address this, the authors introduce a four-stage IAES-based decision-making framework and a mechanism for creating and using cognitive maps of knowledge diagnostics (CMKD) to aid in decision-making. The paper also addresses the challenges involved in creating and visualizing CMKDs.

In conclusion, the authors present the results of applying their proposed technologies in a learning context, demonstrating their efficacy. They suggest that the integration of individualized learning into IAES will enhance educational systems, shifting the focus towards learner-oriented teaching materials and instruction, and resolving conflicts between the different objectives of students, educators, and IAES.
