The academic paper can be paraphrased as follows:

In the evaluation of our study, we categorized the outcomes into four distinct groups. 'True positive' refers to accurately identified positive cases, and we had 25 of these. 'False positive' refers to incorrectly marked positive cases; we observed 40 in our study. 'True negative' indicates the correctly recognized negative cases, amounting to 179. Lastly, 'false negative' signifies the missed positive cases, with a count of 39. As a result, our study's accuracy is calculated to be approximately 72.08%, the sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify true positives) stands at 39.06%, and the specificity (the ability to correctly identify true negatives) is found to be 81.73%.

Supported by the Earthquake Monitoring Center of Shaanxi Earthquake Bureau, we positioned earthquake precursor wave sensors based on the principle of liquid suspension at three locations: Ziwu, Qianling, and Louguan. These devices collected continuous signals for more than a year. However, the proximity of these stations to one another had some limitations in terms of accurately pinpointing earthquake epicenters due to the speed of precursor wave travel. To address this issue, we have relocated our recording devices to Gansu, Henan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, which are situated at greater distances from each other. This repositioning aims to improve epicenter location accuracy, and we commenced this enhanced data collection methodology on July 21, 2011.
