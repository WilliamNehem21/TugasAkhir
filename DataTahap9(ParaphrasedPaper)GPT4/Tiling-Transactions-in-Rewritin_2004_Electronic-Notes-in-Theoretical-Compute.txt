This paper discusses how the concept of Tile Logic (TL) can be refined by adjusting the algebraic structure of elements both spatially and temporally, which allows for the selection of various types of TL simply through fine-tuning. TL has been recently applied to interactive logic programming and to develop a meta-theory focused on the causal and spatial aspects of concurrent semantics. The authors propose a new potential use for TL in the domain of distributed transactions semantics.

Proposition 4.4 introduces an adjunction between two types of computation—denoted as ZComp and HCatZComp—that is used to construct horizontal computations within a tiled system. The paper uses the notation 'd' for the free functor of this adjunction, and similarly, 'd c' for the free functor of an adjunction between ZCompC and HCatZCompC. The authors argue that any morphism between 2-computads is also a refinement morphism in a computad, thanks to the rewriting rules represented by 'd.'

The researchers have expanded upon the zero-safe net approach by integrating it within a broader tile and rewrite theories framework. The interaction between abstract and specification views is characterized by a coreflection, which relates operational models based on labeled transition systems (LTS) and reductions. This coreflection offers a systematic approach to defining transactions. The universal property of coreflection ensures that the given abstract system is the optimal representation among rewrite theories for modeling concurrent transactions in a corresponding tile theory. They note that results previously exclusive to zero-safe nets are now attainable through this more general approach. The paper suggests similarities between the horizontal composition of D-computads and conditional rewriting logic but leaves a detailed examination of their precise relationship for future research.

The paper further explains that reflection and coreflection are types of adjunctions that provide ideal conditions from a semantics perspective. In situations where the unit defines a natural isomorphism, it implies that the category A can be seen as a subcategory of category B, with the left adjoint 'f' acting as an inclusive functor. A coreflection, in particular, implies that there is a natural isomorphism between any concrete model B in the larger category and its abstract counterpart G(B) in the subcategory A, meaning B can be effectively seen as equal to G(B) when viewed from the abstract level defined by A.
