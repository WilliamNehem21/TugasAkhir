The following is a paraphrased version of the academic paper abstract:

E-government initiatives in developing nations often encounter difficulties, contributing to a high rate of failure, which is particularly costly for these countries. Investigating the reasons for successes and failures of e-government projects remains a compelling field of inquiry. While multiple models and potential success and failure factors have been proposed, factors specific to public administration require further exploration and analysis. This study extends previous research by examining factors that influence the varying performances across different locations within a particular project, including why one site initially succeeded but later backslid. It evaluates factors proposed by prior studies and uniquely combines findings from three distinct research methodologies. The study ascertains causal relationships among factors previously believed to affect e-government implementation outcomes, distinguishing between primary and less significant causes of failure. By doing so, it highlights the most significant success and failure factors and proposes corrective actions.

Public service delivery through multiple channels is increasingly recognized as a rational approach. Citizens might use a website for initial information, call for further clarification, and ultimately submit forms via mail or in person. Thus, e-government constitutes one of several steps in public service delivery.

The Egyptian e-government program, launched in 2001, undertook numerous pilot projects with mixed outcomes: some were successful and expanded nationwide, while others were less successful and either ceased or were redesigned for re-implementation. Disparities in success were evident across different implementation sites, with some initially successful but later failing, underscoring the importance of understanding these varying outcomes for future projects.

The author, involved in the Egyptian e-government project since its inception and with extensive project management experience, aims to leverage field expertise and scientific research to pinpoint critical failure factors and guide the community in avoiding them.

Past research has identified various reasons for the success and failure of e-government initiatives. In a rare case, one Egyptian e-government project was analyzed at different stages using assorted research methods, yielding a comprehensive dataset.

Initial assessment of the system in Matrouh shortly after its implementation declared success owing to streamlined processes. However, a subsequent evaluation revealed that while the project thrived in Al-Tor, it had regressed in Matrouh, with human resources issues contributing to the downturn in Matrouh.

In pursuit of a more definitive understanding of the causes behind e-government project failures and how to evade them, this paper scrutinizes previous findings. It evaluates the interactions and significance of factors presented in different studies, eventually pinning down the primary determinants of project success or failure.

The project's main goal is to support local authorities in managing investment projects by employing an integrated information system facilitating service procedures and superseding paper-based operations. This system encompasses MIS, GIS, and workflow capabilities, networking relevant departments to aid decision-making within the governorates.

Originally successful in Matrouh in 2006, planning ensued to replicate the system elsewhere. Yet by 2008, issues had caused Matrouh's system to be abandoned, though it continued in other locations like South Sinai (Al-Tor) and Port Said and was revitalized in Matrouh under new management in 2010.

Literature acknowledges three types of failure: system, project, and user. The Matrouh case experienced system and project success before declining, posing an intriguing situation for further analysis in this paper. Subsequent sections compare methodologies and results from various studies to isolate critical failure factors and administrative influences, enhancing understanding of the project lifecycle differences between sites like Matrouh and Al-Tor.

Built on previous surveys and analysis, this work revisits and synthesizes conclusions from past research, suggesting further dedicated surveys for validation of these insights.
