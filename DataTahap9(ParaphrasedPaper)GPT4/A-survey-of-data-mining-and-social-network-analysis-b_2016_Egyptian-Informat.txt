The recent surge in online social networking across various domains has placed social network analysis at the forefront of research. Online Social Networks (OSNs) have sparked interest among researchers due to their potential for analyzing usage patterns and identifying unusual or illicit activities. Such atypical activities in social networks stand out for their distinctive behaviors compared to their peers within the same environment. This paper scrutinizes different types of anomalies, presenting a fresh categorization framework based on multiple attributes. It reviews numerous techniques aimed at preventing and detecting anomalies, discusses the foundational assumptions, and explores the rationale behind such anomalous occurrences. 

The work further examines a variety of data mining methods for spotting anomalies and pays particular attention to analyzing anomaly detection techniques specific to social networksâ€”these are categorized into behavior-based, structure-based, and spectral-based approaches. Each category encompasses multiple techniques, which are thoroughly discussed. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions in this domain.

The increasing prevalence of OSNs affects numerous areas including entertainment, education, business, and communication, with many companies leveraging these platforms for brand promotion. Understanding and averting abnormal activities on these networks is crucial, as they can otherwise lead to significant damage or losses, such as the dissemination of sensitive data by a compromised computer within a network.

The paper is organized into various sections. It begins with a novel classification of anomalies based on numerous parameters, then details the major data mining and social network techniques used for anomaly detection. The conclusion gives insight into prospective research directions worth exploring. The paper advocates that it's not only the detection of anomalies that matters but also uncovering the reasons behind their occurrence and devising preventive strategies.
