Poultry farming is a crucial source of dietary protein but faces various global challenges, including concerns about bird welfare in intensive management systems. Monitoring large numbers of chickens is essential for maintaining their health and welfare but is often a manual, labor-intensive, and error-prone process. An automated broiler monitoring system could collect data on individual birds within a flock, providing valuable information for digital management.

Deep learning technology, recognized for its excellent ability to represent features, quick processing, and resilience to external interferences, is a suitable candidate for creating intelligent tools for animal farming. It has already been applied successfully to the study of large farm animals like pigs, sheep, and cattle.

In this study, researchers have enhanced the YOLOv5 algorithm by integrating a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), aiming to improve feature extraction from images, including those of broilers at various ages, with different types of litter, and from multiple pens. The improved model, named YOLOv5-CBAM, showed increased accuracy in detecting small bird features.

The original YOLOv5 algorithm, developed by Jocher et al. (2020), consists of three main components: a backbone for feature extraction, a neck for integrating these features, and a prediction component for establishing bounding boxes and categorizing objects. Details can be found in supplementary material.

Detecting broiler chickens at various stages and in diverse environments can be challenging, particularly when birds are partially obscured or small. The CBAM module successfully focuses the network's attention on these hard-to-detect features, improving overall detection rates.

The study demonstrated that the YOLOv5-CBAM model enhances detection, particularly for small or partly obscured birds, and can distinguish broilers of different ages, offering a promising tool for real-time, intelligent poultry management.
