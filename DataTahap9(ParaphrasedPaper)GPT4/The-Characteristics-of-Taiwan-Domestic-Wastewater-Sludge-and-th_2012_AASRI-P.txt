The widespread adoption of municipal sewage systems has led to the generation of a substantial amount of domestic wastewater sludge. Managing and disposing of this sludge poses environmental challenges. Sludge, which is nutrient-rich, is commonly applied to soil as a fertilizer or soil conditioner in various countries. However, there are significant concerns regarding the impact of heavy metals found in the sludge on the growth and quality of crops when it is used for agriculture.

This study aims to analyze heavy metal concentrations and their bonded states in municipal sewage sludge and to assess the effects of sludge application on crop growth and quality. The sludge samples were taken from the Taichung Fu-tien wastewater treatment plant and were found to contain levels of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), and cadmium (Cd) that exceeded the regulated limits for Taiwan's farmland soil. Cu was primarily found in organic bond fraction, Zn in iron-manganese (Fe-Mn) oxides bond fraction, Ni in organic bond fraction, and Cd in Fe-Mn oxides bond fraction.

Three separate plant growth experiments were conducted. The results indicated that the growth of plants in the second round of planting was significantly hindered, with the degree of negative impact escalating with an increase in the proportion of sludge added to the soil.

Municipal wastewater treatment systems play a crucial role in domestic sewage management but result in a significant amount of biological sludge that must be treated and disposed of to avoid environmental contamination. A common method of disposing of sludge includes its use as a fertilizer or soil conditioner, which is considered economical and resource-efficient. Nevertheless, the presence of heavy metals, such as concentrations found in Hong Kong Tai Po's sewage sludge, exceeds the allowable limits for agricultural land, posing a substantial risk to the environment and the food chain.

Among the metals present in the sludge, Cd is the most readily absorbed by plants, despite having the lowest concentration, and is stringently regulated in Taiwan, with a maximum permissible limit of 5 mg/kg for agricultural soil. Zn has the highest concentration, more than double the maximum allowed concentration for agricultural soil (600 mg/kg), with exchangeable and carbonate bonded Zn making up 12% of the total Zn in sludge, and Fe-Mn oxides and organic bonded Zn making up 72%. Although plant uptake of Zn in Fe-Mn oxide and organic bonds is weak, the long-term accumulation and complex soil chemical and biochemical reactions cannot be disregarded. The same caution applies to Cu, as the soil contains 74% of Cu in an organic bond form; the associated risks to soil health and plant growth are also considered significant.
