The metaverse is increasingly becoming a key platform for innovative educational opportunities, offering immersive and interactive learning experiences to students and teachers. Despite its potential, there is a need for comprehensive tools that researchers can use to evaluate the various aspects influencing educational experiences within the metaverse. This paper outlines the creation and validation of the Metaverse Learning Experience Scale (MLES), which aims to address this need.

Using input from 462 university students, the study has verified the scale's effectiveness in assessing a user's perception in a number of domains, spread across forty-three items which are grouped into ten categories. These include the quality of virtual graphics, cognitive load, user-friendliness, immersion, feedback and content quality, interaction, motivational aspects, perceived educational value, negative physical effects like simulator sickness, and positive emotions.

The concept of the metaverse in the study is defined as aggregating three-dimensional virtual spaces that offer high engagement and immersion through extended reality (XR) devices. The significance of the metaverse extends beyond education to socializing, work, health care, and shopping, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize how we access services and information.

Developing the MLES involved a rigorous and holistic process, including reviewing existing literature, identifying relevant factors from past studies, and refining items through student feedback. Importantly, the scale's design allowed for modular use, meaning researchers can tailor it to their specific study needs by focusing on particular affordances.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the MLES as a reliable and valid tool that can significantly contribute to the assessment of educational applications within the metaverse. It is a flexible instrument that can cater to different learning levels, allowing for detailed evaluation to improve educational experiences. As the metaverse continues to evolve, the scale can be expanded with additional factors and used alongside tests measuring learning outcomes to further understand its educational impact.
