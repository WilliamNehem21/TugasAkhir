The National Tractor Testing Laboratory (NTTL) has been at the forefront of tractor performance testing, providing accurate data on fuel consumption, wheel slip, engine speed, forward speed, drawbar pull, drawbar power, and hydraulic oil temperature of tested tractors. The monitoring of hydraulic oil temperature helps ensure that tractors reach stable operating conditions during data collection.

Since 1986, the NTTL has followed the protocol outlined by the OECD Standard Code 2, which mandates tractor performance testing on a flat concrete surface to mitigate the impact of soil properties. A Caterpillar articulated dump truck modified with load cell transducers serves as the loading vehicle to simulate varying demands on the tractor.

Advanced intelligent fuzzy systems have been designed to estimate drawbar pull for MFWD (mechanical front wheel drive) tractors utilizing three variables: wheel slip, tractor weight, and driving mode. This system consists of five stages—fuzzification, normalization, fuzzy rule application, defuzzification, and output generation—where data passes through each layer for effective drawbar pull estimation.

The testing procedures were detailed by Howard et al. (2013), with a concrete track of approximately 61 meters in length and involved checking consistency between repeated tests; if consistent results were not observed, more data were collected until consistency was achieved. The study examined 288 data sets from various New Holland MFWD tractor models tested at NTTL between 2000 and 2004.

The study noted that as net traction force increases, so does the drawbar pull of the tractor, in line with previous research. Wheel slip is influenced by factors including tire pressure, dynamic load, and tire type, with radial ply tires outperforming bias ply tires in terms of traction and experiencing lower slip and rolling resistance.

However, limitations exist: the fuzzy system calculator has been trained using data from NTTL which conducts tests on concrete surfaces, meaning its current utility is confined to similar settings and not adaptable to different soil conditions. It also relies on MATLAB's fuzzy logic toolbox, restricting widespread use and indicating a need for a more universally accessible interface, as seen in other research.

The paper encourages future work to expand the system's applicability by training it with diverse data sets and developing a more user-friendly interface that does not require MATLAB for broader application.
