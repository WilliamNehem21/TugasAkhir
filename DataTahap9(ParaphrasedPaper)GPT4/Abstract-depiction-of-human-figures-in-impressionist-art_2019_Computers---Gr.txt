Numerous experts have contributed to the field of portraiture, with Rosin and colleagues recently introducing a collection of benchmark portraits for evaluating non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) algorithms. These modern algorithms they presented are proficient at producing stylized renditions of portraits. Yet, they do not achieve the degree of abstraction displayed in this work.

In the context of character size variability within picture books, the character Lola from the book "I Will Be Especially Very Careful" exhibits the greatest range between the smallest and tallest depictions. This variation is not due to the physical resizing of the images, as they remain consistent in dimension when using collage techniques; rather, it is a result of how the images vary in their photographic reproduction. This highlights a fundamental challenge in our analysis: the assurance that the artwork isn't resized across different pages. The consistency in minute details—such as texture quality, brush stroke size, and line thickness—is used as evidence that the illustrations created with pens or brushes within a specific book are likely produced at one consistent size and then uniformly shrunk during the photographic reproduction process.
