The Qarara Formation is characterized by basal shales and topped with limestone, dated to the Middle Eocene (Lutetian) epoch. Investigations were conducted at three different sites along the eastern Nile River bank in Egypt's El-Minya province, namely Gebel Qarara, El-Sheikh Fadl, and Gebel El-Ahmar. The identifiable microfacies at these locations include silty claystone, silty shale, fossil-bearing glauconitic components, green-colored glauconitic sand, and varieties of glauconitic ironstone and bioclastic limestones.

Glauconite, a mineral found within the formation, forms solely in marine environments and its abundant presence suggests slow sedimentation rates under normal marine salinity and mild reducing conditions. This is indicative of sea level transgression events, which align with the presence of fractured glauconite grains and various fossils cemented by hematite in the samples.

The different sections imply variable marine conditions during deposition, with Gebel Qarara displaying deeper marine conditions compared to El-Sheikh Fadl and Gebel El-Ahmar, attributable to the relative sea level rise during the Eocene. The lower-energy environments resulted in shales and claystones, while carbonate microfacies containing large foraminifera and bivalves indicate deposition in an inner ramp marine setting. The excellent preservation of nummulitic foraminifera and the presence of geopetal structures and bryozoans further reflect the deposition environments and sedimentological dynamics of the Qarara Formation.
