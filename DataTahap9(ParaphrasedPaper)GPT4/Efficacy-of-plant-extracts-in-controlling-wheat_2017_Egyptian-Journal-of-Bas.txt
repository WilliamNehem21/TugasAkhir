The study utilized a split-plot design with three replications. Main plots consisted of one or two spray treatments using various plant extracts, with the initial application occurring after disease symptoms emerged and a subsequent application 15 days later. The sub-plots included the plant extracts under investigation.

The paper discusses the use of plant extracts as an eco-friendly and safe method to control wheat rusts, a group of diseases affecting wheat crops. These extracts can suppress pathogen growth or stimulate the plant's own resistance mechanisms. The study highlighted that several plant extracts could inhibit the germination of Puccinia triticina spores, responsible for wheat leaf rust, by over 93%. Neem extract, in particular, matched the efficacy of a synthetic fungicide, both achieving nearly 100% inhibition of spore germination in vitro.

When wheat seeds or seedlings were either soaked in or sprayed with these extracts, a notable reduction in rust pustules was observed, with foliar spraying proving more effective than seed soaking. Neem extract stood out, providing complete control when applied within one to four days following inoculation. Even 22 days post-inoculation, plants treated with neem extract and several others remained pustule-free, whereas those treated with the fungicide began showing disease signs.

The study also delved into the active components of these plant extracts, such as various biologically active principles found in neem from the Meliaceae familyâ€”including nimbin and azadirachtin. These substances are known for their antimicrobial and insecticidal activities and are abundant in neem seeds, leaves, and other parts of the tree.

In conclusion, the research suggests that the tested plant extracts, particularly neem, are promising as organic, environmentally friendly options for managing leaf rust in wheat. These extracts, due to their effectiveness in controlling fungal pathogens, could provide a foundation for alternative biocontrol methods against wheat leaf rust.
