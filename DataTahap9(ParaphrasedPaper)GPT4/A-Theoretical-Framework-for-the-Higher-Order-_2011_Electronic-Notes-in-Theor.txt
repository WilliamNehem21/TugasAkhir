The second key contribution of this study is the introduction of a structured approach that facilitates the collaborative use of the algebraic constraint domains FD (Finite Domain) and R (Real) within an enhanced CFLP(D) (Constraint Functional Logic Programming) framework. This improvement allows for more sophisticated functional and logic programming, particularly with higher-order functions and lambda expressions. The framework supports higher-order constraint functional logic programming that includes lambda abstractions and incorporates decidable higher-order unification under a newly developed higher-order constraint domain. This augmentation significantly enhances the system's expressivity.

In order to demonstrate the practical utility of this framework, the paper provides examples that leverage the combined strength of the FD and R constraint domains within the context of higher-order functional logic programming. These examples showcase the various cooperative mechanisms supported by the theoretical foundation and highlight the advantages gained from such collaborative approaches.

Additionally, the paper outlines a cooperative computation model that maintains a store 'C' through the execution of algebraic constraints, akin to the 'setof' predicate found in Prolog programming.

The paper also discusses related research, notably highlighting Mircea Marin's CFLP scheme from his PhD thesis. Marin's work introduces a parameterized language family called CFLP(D, S, L), determined by a constraint domain 'D,' a strategy 'S' for integrating multiple constraint solvers, and a constraint lazy narrowing calculus 'L' that solves constraints involving user-defined functions with constrained rewrite rules. This study contrasts with our approach in two major aspects: the absence of explicit declarative semantics, which our CFLP(C) instance does benefit from, and the intended scope of application, with Marin's instance of CFLP focusing on solvers for algebraic symbolic computation within the constraint domain.
