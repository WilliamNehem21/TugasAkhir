The academic paper discusses the challenges and solutions to designing and implementing domain-specific languages (DSLs) through modularization and component reuse. While these approaches facilitate faster DSL development by allowing language components to be developed separately and reused, they also introduce potential coordination problems. When components are developed in isolation, attributes that these components rely on might be used inconsistently or remain undefined, leading to potential runtime errors.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a type system that can trace attributes within language components and statically validate the composition of these components against their semantic requirements. The paper describes a formal framework based on the innovation within the Neverlang development framework. The type system ensures that if the composition of components is well-typed according to specified rules, then no runtime errors will occur due to misuse of attributes.

The paper outlines an operational semantics for Neverlang and introduces a type system for decorating language components with types. It also discusses a type inference algorithm that analyzes the code of semantic actions and deduces the definition/use of attributes for nonterminals, ensuring type correctness. This inference is designed to be compositional, meaning that it can operate on each slice (module) individually.

After detailing its formalizations and algorithms, the paper also compares the proposed type system with other development frameworks and highlights its relevance in the context of safety and correctness in DSL development. The results indicate that the use of the proposed type system would prevent certain categories of runtime errors related to attribute misuse, thus making DSL implementations more robust.
