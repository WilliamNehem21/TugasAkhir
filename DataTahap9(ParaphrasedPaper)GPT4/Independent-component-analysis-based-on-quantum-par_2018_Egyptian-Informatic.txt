This paper introduces and evaluates a novel method that is purported to outperform previous techniques in the realm of signal separation, as assessed by two key metrics: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). This new method is deemed superior to those reliant on individual measures such as SNR and SDR. Its efficacy is tested against these performance indicators.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is identified as the predominant method for deciphering underlying data within mixed signals. As a statistical tool, ICA disentangles a complex, multivariate signal into its constituent sources, assuming these sources are mutually independent and non-Gaussian. ICA operates on either non-Gaussianity or sample dependence.

The paper posits that the assumption of independence usually holds true, thus the blind use of ICA for separating mixtures yields impressive results. By employing the statistical characteristics of signals, ICA identifies the independent components by lessening the statistical dependencies among the estimated signal elements. It measures the independence of components through their non-Gaussianity, using kurtosis or negentropy approximation.

The structure of the paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 delves into the theoretical underpinnings, discussing the basics of ICA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO); Section 3 details the introduced technique; Section 4 presents the experimental outcomes along with their evaluations based on certain benchmarks; and Section 5 concludes the findings. References are listed in Section 6.

Li et al. offer a novel approach aimed at overcoming certain limitations encountered in blind source separation (BSS) through an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm. This improvement entails a dynamic update to the inertia weight in PSO and incorporating a fitness function in the PSO that is specifically adapted for BSS applications.
