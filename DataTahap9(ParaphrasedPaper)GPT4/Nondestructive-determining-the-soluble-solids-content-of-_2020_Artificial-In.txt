This academic paper explores the importance of both external (color, size, and shape) and internal (soluble solids, titratable acid, and firmness) quality characteristics of fruits on consumer purchasing decisions. It focuses on citrus fruits, which are widely cultivated due to their nutritional value and unique flavor. The paper highlights the significance of internal attributes like soluble solids content (SSC) for both consumer choice and orchard management. The study addresses the challenges in predicting internal quality in citrus due to their thick skin and complex structure, which complicates the light's ability to penetrate and obtain internal tissue information. Specifically, it investigates the use of full transmittance mode for SSC prediction.

The research objectives include assessing the feasibility of full transmittance mode for predicting SSC in citrus, comparing different spectral preprocessing methods, analyzing the variable selection by various algorithms, and comparing the accuracy of prediction models using different preprocessing and selection methods. 

Competitive Adaptive Reweighting Sampling (CARS) is a novel algorithm designed to select important wavelength variables in the Partial Least Squares (PLS) model. The paper describes how PLS models are robust even in the face of multicollinearity and can correlate spectra to target properties using latent variables.

The paper evaluates PLS models developed from full wavelength spectra and variables selected using different algorithms like Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), CARS, and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Evaluation parameters include the root mean square error of calibration and prediction sets (RMSEC and RMSEP), correlation coefficients of these sets (RCal and RPre), and the residual predictive deviation (RPD).

The results show MSC and SNV pre-processing methods to be effective for noise reduction and spectral feature enhancement. SPA selected fewer, less correlated variables than CARS and GA, due in part to its design focus on decreasing collinearity. The study finds SPA to be the best variable selection method, attributing the conclusion to factors like spectral acquisition mode and fruit variety.

The paper suggests that spectral preprocessing, combined with variable selection algorithms, remains critical in VIS/NIR spectroscopy analysis for improving predictions on fruit quality characteristics like SSC.
