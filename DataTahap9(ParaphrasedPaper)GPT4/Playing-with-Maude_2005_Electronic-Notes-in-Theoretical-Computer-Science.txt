The paper emphasizes the flexibility of user-definable syntax, which enables the selection of suitable operators for different problems. Particularly, user-defined operators can possess attributes such as associativity and commutativity, simplifying multiset rewriting, a crucial feature utilized in the paper's specifications.

This section's purpose isn't to deliver an intensive tutorial on rewriting logic and Maude. Rather, it aims to convey a sense of the theoretical framework and deliver sufficient details for readers to grasp the example specifications in subsequent sections. For an in-depth study, the reader is directed to the original literature on rewriting logic, the Maude manual, and further related papers.

An example demonstrates Maude's syntax and these concepts: Natural numbers on a blackboard can be replaced with their arithmetic mean. The representation includes natural number types and basic Peano constructors, with comments introduced by "---."

The "subsort" feature informs Maude that a single natural number can depict the entire blackboard, and an operator with attributes "assoc" and "comm" represents multiset union, considering terms of type "blackboard" regardless of order (associatively and commutatively).

The paper references historical events, such as Flavius Josephus's clever survival strategy during a suicide pact among soldiers he was trapped with, and the water jug problem featured in the movie "Die Hard: with a Vengeance," wherein characters must combine basin capacities to defuse a bomb.

In illustrated puzzles, actions like emptying, filling, and transferring water between basins are governed by rewrite rules, including conditional rules denoted by "crl" and "if" keywords. For example, the subtraction operation over numbers is handled by the predefined module "nat."

Bridge-crossing puzzles are modeled using rules where individuals and their positions relative to a flashlight are considered, and the correct crossing strategy is determined.

The states of boards in puzzles are represented by multisets of pieces, each piece classified by a constructor with coordinates for its position. The rules for moving the pieces on the board are straightforward and based on their type and possible directions of movement.

A classic problem of a shepherd crossing a river with a wolf, goat, and cabbage is also tackled. Representations include the river sides, the items involved, using constants and attributes to emulate the situation and crossings adhering to the boat's capacity.

Lastly, positioning dominoes on a board is explored, highlighting that representing the board as a list without the commutative attribute would complicate the rule presentation for positioning the dominoes. An auxiliary operator and a specific strategy are employed to prevent state explosion and achieve a solution.

The paper also discusses the potential of using membership axioms to refine state representations, ensuring uniqueness and adherence to constraints, emphasizing their necessity in certain puzzle scenarios, even though not utilized in the earlier examples.
