This paper presents a novel approach to simulating the drape of various fabrics in a 3D textile simulation system. To capture the complex behavior of cloth materials, a backpropagation (BP) neural network was developed to learn the nonlinear mapping between mechanical properties of fabrics and control parameters within the simulation environment. Experiments conducted on fifteen common fabric types demonstrated that incorporating material information into the simulation improves its accuracy and enhances the realism of virtual garments.

The computational study of fabric drape began in the 1980s with notable contributions from Weil, who employed geometric methods, and Feynman, who applied physical modeling in his MIT master's thesis. While aesthetic visuals are often prioritized in games and films, accurate mechanical properties are vital for garment CAD applications.

The paper introduces a method that employs neural networks in 3D draping simulation for the first time, successfully linking fabric mechanical properties to simulation control parameters. The foundational layer of the system consists of modules for testing mechanical characteristics, analyzing draping qualities, and simulating fabric deformation. Sixteen mechanical values obtained from the Kawabata Evaluation System (KES) represent each fabric sample, from which seven crucial parameters are selected to define draping performance, serving as inputs to the neural network.

A three-layer BP neural network with a 7-15-6 structure (7 inputs, 15 hidden nodes, 6 outputs) was used, with inputs including tensile work, tensile ratio, bending stiffness, and other key fabric properties. The network outputs control parameters such as mesh sizes, thickness, and restraint coefficients for the simulation. Thirteen fabrics were used for training, with two reserved for testing. The data were normalized to mitigate the influence of varying units on the training results and to achieve greater network accuracy. Parameters were statistically chosen to reduce the dimensionality of the input data, thereby improving system performance.

Challenges like the occasional large prediction error, which indicates limited generalization capability, were noted. Solutions proposed include increasing sample diversity, conducting multiple measurements for higher input accuracy, and refining the learning precision of the network.

The goal of the system is to bridge traditional structural analysis and computer simulation, with simulated textiles incorporating actual material information to produce more realistic virtual clothing. The successful application of parameters derived from KES in simulating various textiles confirms the proposed method's potential to elevate the level of realism within the entire simulation system.
