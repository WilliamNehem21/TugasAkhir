This paper discusses an automatic text classification system designed to improve the process of screening citations for systematic literature reviews, which is often laborious and time-consuming. The proposed system uses a novel neural network-based feature extraction method to prioritize eligible citations over ineligible ones, thereby reducing the manual effort required in the screening process. The authors contrast their supervised feature extraction technique, which leverages class-membership information from manually screened citations, with common unsupervised techniques that are less efficient for this task.

The method involves training a multi-layer feedforward neural network on annotated citations to learn a latent representation of documents. This representation is then used to rank citations according to their relevance to the review. The authors use a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel for final categorization of citations.

The study evaluates the performance of this method using 23 medical systematic review datasets and shows a substantial reduction in manual screening effort without compromising sensitivity. The results indicate that this new feature extraction technique outperforms multiple baseline methods, such as bag-of-words models and other unsupervised learning methods. The proposed system promises significant workload savings and demonstrates improved performance across several datasets.
