The academic paper describes a type system with variables that can generate types. For any given finite set containing elements {l1,..., ln}, there is a corresponding n-ary constructor that constructs a composite record type with labels l1 through ln, using types a1 through an. The paper further outlines two distinct typing judgments, each aligning with one of the two syntactic categories presented.
