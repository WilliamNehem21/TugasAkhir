The paper discusses the development of a computational pipeline to identify dual inhibitors for DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) using computational approaches. The Oxford Protein Informatics Group provided a set of decoys for HDAC inhibitors, while for DNMT1 inhibitors, corresponding decoys were generated on-the-fly with DeepCoy, using an active compounds dataset for reference. These decoys were designed to correspond with DUD-E descriptors at a ratio of 150 decoys for each reference molecule. The best decoys were selected using DeepCoy's provided scripts. Relevant molecular descriptors were then calculated using DataWarrior, including molecular weight, topological properties, and substructure match, with the specific focus being on a compound, N-(p-methylphenethyl)-benzamide, known for selectively inhibiting HDAC2 through mechanisms that may extend beyond just zinc interactions.

Four different classification algorithms—logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)—were assessed for performance using ten-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization through grid search. The logistic regression model was ultimately chosen for its compatibility with a swarm optimizer architecture and comparative performance.

To enhance molecular diversity and potential efficacy of dual inhibitors, ten decoys per generated structure were added using DeepCoy, from which one was selected at random, maintaining a balanced data set. The final classifier for dual inhibitors was trained using XGBoost due to its robustness against overfitting and computational efficiency.

The work emphasizes the importance of natural products in drug discovery, noting that many FDA-approved drugs are derived from natural sources. The authors used the COCONUT database, which contains over 406,000 flat natural product structures, as the chemical space for virtual screening, underlining that the workflow can be adapted for use with any small molecule database.

To address overfitting, the authors recommend best practices such as the use of validation sets, early stopping, and appropriate hyperparameter tuning. For the XGBoost model, slow learning rates and early stopping were mentioned as particularly effective measures.

The paper illustrates that integrating ligand-based drug design (LBDD) and structure-based drug design (SBDD) can facilitate the discovery of compounds that act on multiple targets. A classifier developed for DNMT1/HDAC2 inhibitors using public datasets and open-access software identified two promising compounds within the COCONUT database that showed strong interaction potential with both target proteins.

The paper concludes that the versatility and adaptability of the proposed computational pipeline can be used for the discovery of small molecules targeting a variety of therapeutically relevant proteins, highlighting its efficacy in identifying reversible dual small molecule inhibitors against G9a and DNMTs in hematological malignancies.
