This perspective results in a coherent, albeit partially complete, game-based framework for linear logic with exponentials. The framework is characterized as having finite interactions, meaning each game session ends after a finite number of moves. It comprises a compilation of inference guidelines that, unfortunately, lack the property of cut elimination. However, the cut rule remains a valid part of the framework despite this.

In terms of validity relations between two concepts, there is an implication that one concept serves as a model for the other when a positive link exists. Conversely, a negative connection suggests that the model may be incomplete with respect to the other concept. It's hypothesized that some deficiencies indicated by negative vertical links may be overcome by adopting local strategies. Nevertheless, this fix is not applicable to issues represented by the negative horizontal link.

For cases that avoid using contraction or cut, the method demonstrates that beginning a sequence of new hypotheses with a question mark doesn't excessively interfere with the derivation process. This adjustment only necessitates the inclusion of weakening and exchanging rules, without the need for cuts or contractions.

The diagram depicts an interrupted line or formula which bifurcates into two subsections, illustrated as triangles and labeled to draw parallels with inference rules. At the outset of the tensor move (shown in the third line), multiple triangles are connected to the left-side vertex, denoted as 'v'. These triangles represent subsections sharing 'v' as their common vertex.
