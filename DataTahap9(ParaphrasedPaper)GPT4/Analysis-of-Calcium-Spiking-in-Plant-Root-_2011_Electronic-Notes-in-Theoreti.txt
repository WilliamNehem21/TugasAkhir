The objective of the research was to investigate whether it was feasible to replicate biological experiments using computer simulations. The study involved constructing a biological model with a formal calculus and then performing stochastic simulations to statistically match the qualitative behavior of the experimental data. This comparison aimed to assess how well computational simulations could complement actual lab experiments. The biological focus was on calcium signaling, specifically its role as a second messenger in transmitting external signals to intracellular targets through oscillations of nuclear calcium levels.

Experimental data from the interaction between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and plant root epidermis were compared with simulations. This mutualistic relationship between plants and fungi is critical for the nutrient exchange vital to both parties and significantly contributes to plant productivity and biodiversity. The experimental findings demonstrated that nuclear calcium spurts in the root epidermal cells of the plant Medicago truncatula occur at intervals that follow an exponential distribution.

A computational model was developed using the Calculus of Wrapped Compartments (CWC), a formal tool integrating rewrite systems' straightforward annotation with compositional benefits, enabling the simulation of intranuclear calcium dynamics within the plant cells.

One interpretation of the spiking pattern is its relation to information transmission and its associated energy and metabolic costs. Optimization of information transfer involves regulating the number of spikes over time, considering the energy-consuming nature of maintaining calcium homeostasis through ATPase pumps. The experimental data showed that calcium spiking conformed to the principle of maximum entropy, implying efficient information transmission within cellular constraints.

The paper concludes by demonstrating that the CWC model captures the essential dynamics observed in the experiment, confirming the significance of calcium spiking in cellular signaling and highlighting the potential of formalisms and computational tools to deepen our understanding of cellular communication mechanisms. The model was premised on the concept that nuclear calcium levels are governed by the interplay between calcium channels and transporters within the nuclear envelope.
