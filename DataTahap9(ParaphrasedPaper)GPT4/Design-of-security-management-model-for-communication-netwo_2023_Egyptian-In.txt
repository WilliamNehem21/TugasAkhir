The key challenges of this research encompass three primary areas: (1) The attempt to identify human factors influencing mobile game communication networks has been hindered by the inherent complexity and continual change in human behavior, making it difficult to pinpoint consistent and universal human factors. (2) The emergence of the metaverse is anticipated to add complexity to mobile game communication networks, necessitating adaptations to the current security management model. (3) The expert-based security evaluation process utilized in the study might be influenced by personal biases, although efforts were made to minimize such bias.

Previous studies have extensively examined network protocols, architectures, geographic, and vulnerability aspects of communication networks, providing valuable insights for security management within mobile game environments and digital cultural consumption. However, there has been little focus on security management within these networks from the perspective of the players. In the context of the metaverse, where players are increasingly central to mobile gaming and digital cultural consumption, it is critical to center security management around the player perspective.

To better comprehend the underlying factors affecting behavior, this research aggregates data from player interviews and literature reviews across six dimensions: physiological, physical, pathological, pharmacological, psychological, and psychosocial.

Evaluation indicators are crafted for two reasons: (1) to identify human factors (errors) that impact the security management of communication networks across various dimensions, and (2) to enable a structured and scientific security evaluation backed by robust indicators.

The research introduces the 3E rule to manage human motivation, which is considered crucial in preventing human errors. The 3E rule addresses post-evaluation risk management by identifying indicators failing to meet the security threshold and devising measures for improvement, followed by a verification of these measures' implementation.

Indicator weights were determined using an entropy weight method (EWM), which is favored for its objective approach as opposed to methods like the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

According to system security theory, a security state implies risks are controlled within an acceptable range, as indicated by meeting or exceeding a defined security threshold. The study proposes a second security evaluation following the 3E rule execution to confirm whether the security threshold is met.

Various countermeasures are proposed under the 3E rule framework, considering engineering, education, and enforcement strategies that align with public order, customs, and legal systems, aiming to manage risks without compromising player's digital cultural experiences.

The research ultimately concludes that under the metaverse, players significantly influence the security management of communication networks and emphasizes the importance of physiological, physical, pathological, pharmacological, psychological, and psychosocial factors. The study supports the effectiveness of the proposed security management model by demonstrating the exceedance of the security threshold after a second evaluation.
