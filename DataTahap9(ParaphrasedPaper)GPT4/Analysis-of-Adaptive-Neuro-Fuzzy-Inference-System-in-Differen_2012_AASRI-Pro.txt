The establishment of a fuzzy control system comprises various parameters including scaling factors, membership functions, and rules, with the development of membership functions proving particularly complex. Fuzzy controller efficacy is greatly influenced by these functions, prompting numerous proposals for optimizing them. However, control engineers face certain challenges in evaluating fuzzy controllers due to inherent limitations.

A lab model of a temperature controller is dissected into five parts for study, using a 0.5-liter chamber outfitted with a heater coil at the water inlet and a temperature sensor near the outlet. Signal conditioning facilitates signal transfer to the computer, with a PCL-207 used for analog-digital interaction.

The analyzed graphical output from the controller indicates quick response times, both in terms of its initial reaction and stabilization period. Initially, the outlet temperature starts around 25°C and reaches the set point in seconds, with no significant overshoot after the initial convergence. The mean error value is derived from data collected after the set point is first met.

Contrastingly, another case sees the outlet water temperature start at 21°C and increase slowly without consistently reaching or maintaining the set point. This results in the water temperature persistently lingering about 1.5°C below the desired level and more pronounced fluctuations, leading to a higher average error value.

The paper explores the utilization of artificial intelligence techniques in controlling the temperature of flowing water, especially the effectiveness of an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) across a spectrum of practical scenarios. Several case studies are introduced, showing clear performance metrics in real-world applications.

Furthermore, the paper includes a comparative analysis under varying weather conditions using an ANFIS controller designed for an industrial lab setup. This controller, devised at the beginning of summer, is evaluated throughout an entire year. Through graphical and analytical examination, the controller's performance is assessed. The findings suggest that the ANFIS controller is capable of functioning well in the intended conditions but may require tuning or redesign to address other potential practical disturbances.
