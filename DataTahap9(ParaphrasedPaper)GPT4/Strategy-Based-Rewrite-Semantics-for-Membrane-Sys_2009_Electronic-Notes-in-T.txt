This paper explores membrane computing, a field inspired by biological cells, focusing on parallel and distributed computing models that use symbol-object multisets processed within compartments or membranes. It addresses the challenge of controlling the behavior of these systems by applying evolution rules and proposes a novel method using rewrite strategies and strategy controllers to enhance the control mechanisms.

The authors provide a rewriting logic (RWL) based semantics that describe the parallel rewriting of membrane computing systems, but with limitations to concurrency due to interleaving semantics. However, their new strategy-based rewrite semantics, described in the paper, manages to preserve the full extent of concurrency inherent in these systems. To compare the concurrency levels in both formalisms, the paper employs a modal logic as a common framework.

The structure of the paper is as follows: it introduces membrane systems and rewriting logic, outlines a Hennessy-Milner-like modal logic tailored for membrane systems, revisits the strategy-based rewrite semantics, and presents an algorithm that computes strategies for maximum concurrency. The main results illustrate how modal logic can express concurrency levels in strategic rewrites and compare this with the concurrency within the original membrane systems.

The paper also discusses the control of evolution rules and proposes an extension to handle cooperation rules. It shows that strategies can be designed to enable concurrent rule applications. The results affirm that while true concurrency in communication actions is only partially preserved by the strategy-based rewrite semantics, a mix of true concurrency and interleaving is achieved.

In conclusion, the paper partially answers whether a rewrite semantics that maintains maximal concurrency for membrane systems is possible. Prior RWL-based semantics failed to do so due to the localized nature of evolution rules. The paper focuses on transition P systems and suggests that the strategy-based rewrite semantics could represent various control mechanisms within these systems. Future research should consider how this approach applies to more complex systems, such as tissue or neural structures.
