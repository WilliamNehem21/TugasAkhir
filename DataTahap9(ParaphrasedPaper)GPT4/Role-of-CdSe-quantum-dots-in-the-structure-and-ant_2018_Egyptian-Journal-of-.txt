A semi-natural polymeric mixture of chitosan/polycaprolactone (Ch/PCL) was developed with varying amounts of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) using the hot injection technique. Samples containing different CdSe QD concentrations underwent X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for characterization. The FTIR analysis showed that the fundamental vibrational bands of the samples persisted with slight changes in intensity and shift due to increased QD concentration. The XRD analysis indicated that both the pristine blend and those with lower QD content were largely amorphous, while samples with higher QD concentrations (0.008 and 0.016 wt%) exhibited crystalline peaks corresponding to the (111) plane, consistent with standard JCPDS card no. 19-0191. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the morphology of the biocomposites was significantly influenced by the inclusion of the CdSe QDs.

These quantum dots have gained attention as alternatives to fluorescent biological probes and have applications in various fields such as biological imaging, bio-sensing, intracellular detection and targeting, solar cells, quantum computing, transistors, LED technology, and laser diodes. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a computational method used to study the electronic structures of molecules and atoms, and it is widely used in physics and materials science.

This study focused on characterizing the novel semi-natural polymeric blend with gradient concentrations of CdSe QDs using FTIR, DFT, and XRD to understand the interaction mechanisms between the organic matrix components and the inorganic dopant. Antimicrobial tests were conducted to assess the effect of the CdSe QDs on a variety of microorganisms.

The antimicrobial effectiveness of the synthesized CdSe QD-doped polymer blends was evaluated against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis), two Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli), and the fungus Candida albicans. The results showed that at a 0.008 wt% concentration of CdSe QDs, only moderate activity was observed against S. aureus and C. albicans. B. subtilis was the most sensitive to the QDs, whereas P. aeruginosa was the least affected. Higher concentrations of CdSe QDs resulted in a decrease in antibacterial activity, possibly due to an increase in QD particle size, which in turn could affect the nanoparticles' diffusion and the generation of reactive oxygen species within the cells.

In conclusion, the study provided detailed characterization of Ch/PCL blends with CdSe QDs and demonstrated variation in antibacterial activity based on QD concentration and type of bacteria. The XRD and FTIR analyses confirmed the preservation of important vibrational bands and revealed the change from amorphous to crystalline structure with higher QD concentration. SEM analysis showed altered morphology due to the QDs, and the study also discussed the effects of different CdSe QD concentrations on the inhibition zones in antibacterial tests against selected microorganisms.
