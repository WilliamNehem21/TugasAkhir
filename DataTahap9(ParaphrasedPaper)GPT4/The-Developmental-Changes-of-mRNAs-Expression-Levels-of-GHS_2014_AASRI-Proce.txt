This scientific paper investigates the role of growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) mRNA in sheep growth and development. Using in situ hybridization or an RNase protection assay, researchers have primarily detected GHSR mRNA in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. GHSR's main role is to enhance the secretion and release of growth hormone (GH) in concert with growth hormone secretagogues (GHS), a relationship that importantly affects animal growth.

The study uses a letter-coding system to denote significant differences in the expression levels of GHSR mRNA. Capital letters indicate data from Xinjiang sheep, while lowercase letters indicate data from Kazak sheep. Means that do not share letters signify statistically significant differences (p<0.05) within the same breed across various ages. Extreme differences between breeds at the same age are marked with double asterisks (p<0.01).

The researchers also highlight the sensitivity of arcuate nucleus (ARC) GHSR expression to GH modulation, suggesting GHSRs may participate in GH feedback regulation. Investigations by Shuto et al. (2002) involved creating transgenic rats with antisense GHSR mRNA, leading to lower body weights and reduced adiposity compared to controls. These rats also exhibited diminished feeding responses to GHS treatment and overall decreased food consumption. The GHSR gene is located on human chromosome 3q26, an area associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome traits. Baessler et al. (2005) discovered that common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the GHSR gene region contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity in humans.

The paper indicates that hypothalamic GHSR mRNA levels in both sheep breeds peak before declining as they age, with Kazak sheep exhibiting significantly lower levels than Xinjiang fine wool sheep from day 60 to 90. Conversely, Kazak sheep show markedly higher pituitary GHSR mRNA expression levels than their Xinjiang counterparts from day 2 to 90. This difference parallels the early growth-related body weight variations between the breeds. The pituitary GHSR mRNA levels increase with age in both breeds, strongly correlating with growth patterns, suggesting GHSR's involvement in sheep growth.

Furthermore, the discovery of the endogenous GHSR ligand, ghrelin, in rat stomach tissue is mentioned. Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone release upon GHSR binding and also influences weight regulation by increasing food intake and promoting fat and weight gain in rodents. Huang Zhi Guo et al. (2006) studied ghrelin mRNA expression in sheep, finding it predominantly in the abomasum and steadily increasing during early growth. The current research shows a strong positive correlation between sheep pituitary GHSR mRNA and abomasum ghrelin mRNA levels, suggesting that pituitary GHSR (rather than hypothalamic GHSR) mediates the influence of ghrelin on sheep growth.
