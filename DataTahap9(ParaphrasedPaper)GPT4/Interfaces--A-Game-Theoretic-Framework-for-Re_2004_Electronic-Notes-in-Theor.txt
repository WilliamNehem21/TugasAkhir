This paper serves as an introductory guide to interface concepts, focusing specifically on automaton-based and timed interfaces. Interface refinement is not covered due to space constraints, but further information can be found in the referenced works.

The widespread approach in software and system engineering is component-based design, where systems are built by assembling various components. This methodology reduces complexity by breaking down intricate problems into smaller, more manageable tasks that can be tackled in parallel. Additionally, it promotes the reuse of components, which defines the boundaries for packaging and documenting functionalities that can be repurposed.

When two interfaces are combined, they create a new interface for the resulting system. This new interface incorporates the input assumptions of each individual interface and amalgamates their output guarantees. The paper also promises to later detail the concepts of compatibility and composition of interface automata.

Interfaces can be conceptualized as games involving two players: "output" representing the component and "input" representing the environment. The component generates outputs within certain guarantees, while the environment provides acceptable inputs based on assumptions.

The objective in component composition is to find an environment for the composite interfaces that fulfills the input assumptions of both separate interfaces. This involves forming the most generous input strategy that steers clear of any incompatible states, achievable through conventional game-theoretic algorithms.

The paper compares its game-based model to other models that treat compatibility differently. Unlike graph models where the focus is on deadlock avoidance, the game-based approach sees input and output as separate entities, determining compatibility by the existence of a suitable input behavior that avoids incompatibilities with all possible output behaviors, which aligns with programming language types, trace theory, and game semantics.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces interface automata and describes the concepts of well-formedness, compatibility, and composition. Section 3 expands on interface automata by incorporating real-time considerations, leading to timed interface automata, and revisits well-formedness, compatibility, and composition in this context, including how timed interfaces handle time advancement.

An example given in the paper presents interfaces B and R as compatible based on their initial state and error conditions. The compatibility of timed interface automata is achieved by preventing error states through the strengthening of input invariants.

Lastly, the paper concludes that combining two well-formed and compatible interfaces results in another well-formed interface. In other words, merging two practical and cooperative interfaces leads to the creation of an additional practical interface, with this principle naturally extending to the untimed case as well.
