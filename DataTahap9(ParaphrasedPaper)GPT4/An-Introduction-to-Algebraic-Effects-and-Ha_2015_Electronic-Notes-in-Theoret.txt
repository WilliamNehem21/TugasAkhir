This academic paper discusses a computational model involving operations and handlers that manage side effects in programming, such as state changes or exception handling. Here's a paraphrased summary:

The "call op(v; y. c)" operation allows a parameter value (like a memory address) to be passed to an operation (op). After the operation executes, its result is bound to a variable (y), and then the program continues with the computation (c). However, handlers that wrap around this operation can change its default behavior.

When a computation finishes and returns a value (x), there’s no more output, so the result along with an accumulator (acc) is returned. If a "print" operation is called instead, the computation proceeds with the continuation, receiving a unit type value. This continuation, transformed into a function, will receive an updated accumulator that includes the new output string (s). To get a computation's output, this function is applied to an empty accumulator.

Exception handling is a specific use case for handlers. Exceptions are represented with an "raise" operation that takes an argument (like an error message) but does not pass anything onto the continuation.

The paper also discusses a "backtrack handle" that can manage operations trying to find Pythagorean triples. The results depend on the handler’s implementation. For instance, with certain input values (m, n), the operation might succeed or fail to find a Pythagorean triple. By using a "pickall" handler, it's possible to acquire a list of all possible triples.

State management is portrayed with "set" and "get" operations designed for a single memory location. "set" stores an integer without returning any result, while "get" retrieves the stored integer.

Handlers can also be used to modify or log the stored state value, or to emulate stateful behavior without relying on built-in state mechanisms.

The paper provides an operational semantics to clarify how computations should be understood: Operation calls act as signals caught by matching handler clauses instead of producing actual effects. Operations that escape all handlers terminate the computation. Actual side effects are presumably managed by an outermost handler.

Comparisons are made between "call-by-push-value" and "fine-grain call-by-value" approaches, noting that call-by-push-value is becoming popular in recent studies on algebraic effects, although the paper used the latter for familiarity.

Lastly, the paper acknowledges that the examples provided are not exhaustive and references additional works on advanced topics and implementations of handlers in both independent languages and libraries in established languages. It also mentions that the OCaml language is integrating handlers to manage concurrency primitives.
