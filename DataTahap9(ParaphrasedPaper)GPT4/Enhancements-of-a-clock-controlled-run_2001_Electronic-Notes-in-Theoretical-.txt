In our work, we introduce improvements to the stream cipher generator previously examined. Our updated generators are equipped with a higher number of Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs), incorporate various clocking strategies, and employ distinct output functions. We evaluate the cryptographic features of these generators and assess their resilience against a range of established attacks targeting stream ciphers.
