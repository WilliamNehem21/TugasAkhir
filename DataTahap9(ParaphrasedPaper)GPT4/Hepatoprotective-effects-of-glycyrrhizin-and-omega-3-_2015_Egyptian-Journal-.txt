Our research examined the impact of Glycyrrhizin (GL) and Omega-3 fatty acids (U-3) on liver inflammation and fibrosis in the Thioacetamide (TAA) rat model, focusing on Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kB) levels. Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: a control group and four TAA-induced fibrosis groups, with one group untreated, one treated with GL (25 mg/kg orally), and one treated with U-3 (150 mg/kg orally).

Chronic liver diseases lead to fibrosis, a pivotal complication that involves collagen accumulation and inflammatory cytokine production, contributing to irreversible cirrhosis and associated morbidity. Omega-3 fatty acids, like Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have anti-inflammatory properties by producing less inflammatory mediators. NF-kB is central in regulating immune responses and stress; in unstimulated cells, it's inhibited from entering the nucleus by I-kB. Upon activation, NF-kB translocates to the nucleus to promote pro-inflammatory genes.

Experimental liver fibrosis was induced using TAA, causing oxidative stress, evident through increased levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation indicator. TAA is metabolized into toxic compounds that cause oxidative damage.

Our study found that GL and U-3 treatments decreased MDA levels and prevented the NF-kB increase, thus inhibiting fibrosis and necro-inflammatory development. This suggests antioxidants play a critical role in managing liver inflammation and fibrosis induced by TAA. The results indicate the potential of GL and U-3 as anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and antioxidant agents. Further clinical studies are recommended to evaluate the use of these substances as nutritional support to protect against liver fibrosis.
