The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of blackberry juice (BBJ) in protecting against neurological damage and oxidative stress caused by concurrent exposure to aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and sodium fluoride (NaF) in male albino rats. The experiment found that exposure to AlCl3, NaF, or both, led to increased levels of serum and brain lipids (total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides), and bad cholesterol (LDL and VLDL), while good cholesterol (HDL) decreased. Neurotransmitter levels (dopamine and serotonin), acetylcholinesterase, Na-K ATPase activity, and ATP decreased, except for norepinephrine which increased. There were also signs of strong oxidative stress due to higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and free radical enzymes like xanthine oxidase (XO). Moreover, key antioxidants (total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione) were depleted, and essential minerals were imbalanced.

Conversely, rats that received BBJ showed significant protection against these harmful effects. BBJ improved most of the perturbed biomarkers, contributed antioxidants, and possibly activated important cellular defense mechanisms. Blackberries are high in polyphenols which offer great neuroprotection by preventing oxidative damage. It is proposed that BBJ's protective properties come from its rich content of antioxidants such as flavonoids, vitamins, minerals, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins. These work alone or together to fight against various oxidants, protecting cellular components and promoting recovery.

In summary, the intake of blackberry juice during exposure to fluoride and aluminum might be beneficial for countering brain oxidative stress, neurological issues, and bolstering antioxidant defenses. The results suggest a synergistic antioxidant effect provided by the nutritional contents of BBJ. Future research should explore identifying and understanding the bioavailability of the specific blackberry components that contribute to its antioxidant activity.
