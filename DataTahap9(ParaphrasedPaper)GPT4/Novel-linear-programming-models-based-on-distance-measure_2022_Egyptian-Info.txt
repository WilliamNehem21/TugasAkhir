The academic paper discusses the effectiveness of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) theory in handling uncertainties, particularly in the context of portfolio selection in unpredictable environments. Zadeh initially proposed fuzzy set theory in 1965, and it has since been expanded upon by numerous research efforts. One significant advancement in this theory is the development of IFS by Atanassov, which improves the representation of uncertainty by incorporating degrees of membership and non-membership. These advancements are important for applications in areas such as pattern recognition, decision-making, and medical diagnosis.

The paper also reviews a specific distance measure known as the H-max distance measure to evaluate differences between investments. To rank investments, the authors discuss using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), introduced by Hwang and Yoon in 1981. Although TOPSIS has been widely applied and extended to fuzzy environments, it has limitations, such as failing to account for the weights of distances to ideal solutions.

The paper is structured to first introduce basic concepts of IFS and TOPSIS, then propose modifications to the conventional TOPSIS method to better address its limitations, especially for selecting investment portfolios where risk distribution is critical. The authors propose using entropy to assign weights to criteria in the TOPSIS method, aligning with the objective of maximizing returns and minimizing risk.

Moreover, the paper offers a comparison with another multi-criteria decision-making method, ELECTRE, proposed by Benayoun et al., noting that while ELECTRE is also applicable to uncertainty problems, the modified TOPSIS method presented in the paper may be simpler and more time-efficient.

The findings indicate that even though some models like ELECTRE may produce similar results, they may not be as effective or practical as the modified TOPSIS method. The paper concludes with an assertion of the importance of an effective evaluation method like modified TOPSIS in estimating returns and risks when historical data is lacking, which is essential for constructing rational portfolio strategies.
