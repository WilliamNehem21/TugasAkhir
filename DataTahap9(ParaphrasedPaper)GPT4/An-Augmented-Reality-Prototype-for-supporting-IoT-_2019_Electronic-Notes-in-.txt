In the realm of education, there's an increasing focus on integrating knowledge about sustainability and energy into science curricula to shape the energy use behaviors of young people. The European Union views environmental education as a crucial tool for promoting sustainable behavior. Given that educational facilities make up a significant portion of the EU's non-residential buildings, the educational sector is poised to play a key role in reducing energy consumption by imparting sustainable practices and responsible consumption habits to students.

One important goal of energy efficiency initiatives in schools is to teach students about the collective impact of individual actions on energy usage. It's believed that Internet of Things (IoT) technology can aid these efforts by providing immediate feedback on the consequences of our behavior and by automating energy-saving policies. By collecting and analyzing real-time data on various environmental parameters, such as energy consumption and classroom conditions, educators can illustrate scientific phenomena during lessons.

The Green Awareness in Action (GAIA) project, funded by the Horizon 2020 EU program, has developed an IoT platform that utilizes sensors, web tools, and gaming elements. The platform's objective is to raise awareness about energy and sustainability within educational communities, leading to changes in energy efficiency behavior based on actual sensor data from school buildings.

This paper discusses how augmented reality (AR) can complement IoT-based laboratory activities within the GAIA project. The combination of IoT devices and AR aims to enhance students' understanding of energy consumption and efficiency in their schools. AR serves not only as a part of classroom experiments but also as a tool for accessing sensor data easily and maintaining devices.

Although many initiatives concentrate on energy efficiency, few have successfully linked IoT data with educational content to achieve long-lasting behavioral changes, as GAIA intends to do. Previous work on GAIA has been presented, including an educational lab kit, its cloud-based software ecosystem, and a 3D visualization of sensor data using Google Earth. The current study aims to merge real IoT data with AR to promote sustainability awareness within STEM education.

The functionality described in this paper is part of a prototype, indicating this is an initial stage of development. Future enhancements are planned to provide a broader range of features, subjected to more systematic testing and applied in real educational settings.

Proposed future work includes exploring 3D visualizations of data such as energy consumption and offering interactive features to switch between visual modes for different parameters. The application can access data from GAIA cloud services and interact with IoT devices, like Raspberry Pi, within the same Wi-Fi network, allowing students to control sensor inputs and visualization aspects on these devices using MQTT protocols.

As the first iteration of the application, the developers anticipate numerous improvements to enhance its usability and functionality, with the overarching goal of showcasing the benefits of combining real-world IoT data with AR in an educational context.
