In summary, this academic paper addresses the problem of ambiguity in mathematical tools and the development of user interfaces for disambiguation within the context of the Matita interactive theorem prover. Developers of mathematical software face a choice: use an artificial, unambiguous grammar or create heuristics to manage ambiguity. While the former has clear benefits (e.g., errors being meaningful when they occur), this paper focuses on the latter â€” specifically, ambiguities in mathematical formulae as opposed to more complex command ambiguities.

The paper acknowledges that the main risk with heuristics is the incorrect assignment of meaning to formula components. The Matita user interface is designed to manage this risk and has evolved over two years to mitigate issues that users encountered in earlier versions. Despite improvements, comprehensive user evaluations of the interface are challenging due to the difficulty of setting up controlled experiments without user learning biasing the results.

The paper outlines the advantages of handling mathematical ambiguity and details several sources of such ambiguities. It then explains the disambiguation techniques employed in Matita and Whelp and discusses three problematic scenarios for user interface design. The authors suggest that hyperlinks and status lines are essential for providing users with feedback on how the system interprets mathematical symbols. Alternative forms of displaying information, such as using non-traditional notation or decorations to indicate the meaning of symbols, are also considered. 

Additionally, the paper describes how the system ranks multiple correct interpretations of a formula and engages the user in a tree-structured dialogue to discern the most likely intended interpretation. The new user interfaces implemented in Matita and potentially Whelp are discussed, emphasizing how the interface has been tailored to the needs of interactive theorem proving versus query-answering in a search engine.

Ultimately, the paper suggests future work to validate and improve the user interface through usability frameworks, given the lack of uniform user groups for testing and the dynamic nature of user interaction with mathematical libraries. The authors conclude that while formal user validation is complex and yet to be conducted, preliminary feedback suggests that the current interfaces have succeeded in reducing the disambiguation issues that once hindered users.
