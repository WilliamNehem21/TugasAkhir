The paper discusses the importance of using syntactic structures for representing atom patterns within transformation rules to ensure precise rule applicability and results. To achieve this, the concept of meta-atoms is introduced, which are similar to regular atoms but include two types of meta-variables: &-variables and #-variables, each with distinct instantiation characteristics enabling accurate specifications for rewriting rules. These distinctions facilitate a thorough examination of essential properties of various transformation steps, like the expansion correctness of a transformation.

The main goals of the paper are:

1. To define an appropriate syntax for a broad class of rewriting rules that allows for the precise specification of rule applicability and the clear depiction of the rule application results.

2. To introduce the concept of reverse transformation within the Rule-Based Extensible Transformation (RBET) framework. It argues that a rewriting rule can be reversed simply by syntactically inverting another rule, with the correctness of the reverse rule dependent solely on the correctness of the original rule.

There are specific instantiation constraints for the meta-variables &-variables and #-variables to prevent incorrect transformations. These constraints are essential for ensuring regularity and generality across all rewriting rules and are detailed in a later section of the paper.

The paper employs standard Prolog notation and focuses on usual first-order terms, defining atoms and meta-atoms within this context. It limits this discussion to usual terms for simplicity, although the framework is capable of handling other data structures like multisets and strings.

Definite clauses and declarative descriptions are explained as well, with emphasis on the structure of these clauses and the sets of rewriting rules that can be applied to them. The paper also demonstrates the use of these rewriting rules through examples, highlighting the unfolding-based general rewriting rules, which are applicable to initial and append atoms of any pattern and are essential for the unfolding operation, as well as rules tailored to specific atom patterns.
