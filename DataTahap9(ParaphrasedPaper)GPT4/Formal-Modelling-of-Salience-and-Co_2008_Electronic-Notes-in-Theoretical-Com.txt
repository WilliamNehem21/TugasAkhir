This academic paper discusses the integration of procedural and sensory cues into user interface design, emphasizing their importance in guiding users to appropriate actions. However, user cognition and choice can be affected by cognitive load—the mental effort involved in performing a task—which can diminish the effectiveness of these cues. The paper formalizes the relationship between action salience and cognitive load, using empirical data as a foundation, and incorporates these principles into an existing cognitive architecture designed to verify usability features of interfaces.

The study uses the example of a fire engine dispatch task, which was used in prior empirical research, to evaluate the veracity of salience and cognitive load rules through formal verification methods. The authors assess if systematic errors seen in human subjects during experiments can be replicated by their augmented cognitive model, thereby suggesting its predictive validity.

The discussion highlights limited existing research on the interplay of salience and cognitive load. Existing theories propose that high extraneous load impairs sensory cue detection unless cognitive control is invoked to maintain the task's primary goal. Previous work in human error reveals that visual cues can bolster procedural cues if they successfully capture attention.

In this paper, abstract cognitive principles, which account for a user's internal goals and knowledge, are outlined and then formalized. According to these principles, people select actions aligned with their task objectives and are influenced by how noticeable or salient these options are. Cognitive load can also impact salience, which can be a combination of visual impression, learned task procedures, and task complexity.

The authors formulate the user model's state space and describe how it reacts to input and output variables, including the environment's state. The introduction of a salience hierarchy integrates both procedural and sensory salience with cognitive load to refine goal selection.

Formal verification of the user model against empirical data reveals generally consistent patterns, except under certain cognitive load conditions, suggesting potential refinements in judging the salience of cues.

The paper concludes by indicating enhancements to the cognitive architecture that consider both procedural and sensory salience and cognitive load. It also acknowledges that the accuracy of these refinements may necessitate further empirical tests, pointing to the dynamic nature of cognitive modelling in interface design.
