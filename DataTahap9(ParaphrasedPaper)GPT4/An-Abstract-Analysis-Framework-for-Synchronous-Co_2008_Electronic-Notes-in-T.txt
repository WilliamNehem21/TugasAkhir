The paper discusses the variety of concurrent programming languages that have been developed, which, despite their differences, all aim to expose parallelism to programmers. Basic concurrency primitives are typically combined in these languages to provide support for multi-process programming, but they can make different assumptions.

The focus of the paper is on synchronous concurrent programming languages, characterized by global synchronization mechanisms. The authors analyze common primitives and their semantics within this synchronous context, then propose a unifying framework that can approximate the semantics of primary language constructs. This framework applies to both declarative and imperative concurrent languages and identifies conditions for ensuring the validity of the approximation to support reliable program analysis and verification.

When attempting to approximate a language's semantics using abstract interpretation, certain decisions must be carefully made in relation to the specific language in question, although these are not explored further in the paper. In particular, decisions concerning the abstraction of the domain and basic actions need to be addressed to ensure the effectiveness of the interpretation.

The paper zeroes in on the abstraction of actions that can suspend execution, including the global choice action. It also pays special attention to the conditional operator, pointing out that it can only be abstractly without altering the temporal notion of the original language if the source language includes an instantaneous choice operator. The details of this point are clarified later in the paper.
