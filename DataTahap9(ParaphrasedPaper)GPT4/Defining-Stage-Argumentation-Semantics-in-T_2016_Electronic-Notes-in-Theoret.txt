The paper introduces a new way of understanding logic programming by using "abducible atoms," which are assumptions we can make when no evidence is directly available. The authors propose this new semantics as a method to describe "stage extensions" of an argumentation framework, using an associated normal logic program. 

The authors review existing theories on both logic programming semantics and argumentation semantics. They establish connections between a specific type of semantics within argumentation frameworks and a corresponding semantics for the normal logic program related to that framework. The discussion begins with necessary definitions and facts about both fields.

They further illustrate with an example that the set {d(a), d(c)} is the sole "stage model" of a normal program associated with the argumentation framework, denoted as PAF. They show that this set is minimal with respect to set inclusion, meaning there's no smaller set of assumptions that could work as a model. As a consequence, and in accordance with a theorem referred to as theorem 2.10 in the paper, {b, d} emerges as the sole "stage extension" of the framework AF. The result is consistent with an earlier example (example 2.6) provided in the paper.

So, in summary, the paper describes a new logic programming semantics through the lens of abducible atoms, with the goal of characterizing stage extensions in argumentation frameworks using corresponding normal logic programs, and walks through theory and examples to support this approach.
