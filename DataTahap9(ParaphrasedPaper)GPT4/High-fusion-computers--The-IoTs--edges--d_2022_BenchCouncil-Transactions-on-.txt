In this paper, the authors discuss a novel approach to designing open-source computer systems through the use of "funclets," which are abstracted reusable functions that span across IoT devices, edge computing, and data centers. They demonstrate how to restructure these components, along with human-in-the-loop interactions, into a comprehensive computer system capable of autonomously managing resources, programming, workload scheduling, and facilitating seamless collaboration between software, hardware, and human elements.

The authors outline a tripartite plan for advancing this concept:

1. They highlight the necessity for benchmarks and funclet-based standards to effectively evaluate and construct systems.
2. They focus on methods and tools that enable workload-driven exploration for system and architectural design space.
3. They commit to developing the first open-source implementation of the funclet architecture within these heterogeneous federated computing (HFC) systems.

The paper's structure is described as follows: motivation for the study is presented in Section 2, challenges in HFC are detailed in Section 3, the design space for HFC software and hardware is explored in Section 4, their plan is outlined in Section 5, related work is summarized in Section 6, and the paper concludes in Section 7.

The paper addresses specific use cases, such as the medical system's ability to allocate resources for rapid response, where medical professionals are key, and autonomous driving, which requires highly automated, safety-critical systems that operate with minimal human intervention.

Challenges in organizing and managing dispersed systems across different geographies are discussed, as well as the difficulties in evaluating and simulating such complex systems. Specific aspects such as simulation accuracy, CPU benchmarks, and the ideal chiplet architecture for each layer are considered, followed by validation and optimization strategies.

The authors discuss innovative processor designs, including datapath processors that can handle complex state information efficiently, accentuating the evolution of storage devices and the increasing speed and lower latency.

The paper acknowledges the complexities of finding performance bottlenecks and co-optimizing across diverse optimization dimensions, suggesting that reinforcement learning could be a powerful tool for identifying optimal policies within the vast optimization space.

In conclusion, the paper emphasizes using funclets as a design and evaluation guide for HFC systems, the definition of benchmarks and funclet-based standards, the development of tools for workload-driven exploration, and the open-source implementation. The co-design process is addressed both vertically, considering various system components, and horizontally, examining the interactivity among different layers and human participants.
