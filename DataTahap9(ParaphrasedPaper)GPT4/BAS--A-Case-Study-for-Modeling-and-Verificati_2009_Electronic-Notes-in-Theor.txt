The paper discusses a framework that models contracts using Object Constraint Language (OCL) expressions at the model level. This allows the specification of preconditions and postconditions for certain methods, as well as the incorporation of OCL constraints into the transitions of a statechart. Utilizing the SPIN model checker's assertion verification capabilities, these OCL constraints can be verified.

Here's a paraphrased version of the provided excerpt:

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a general overview of the TMDA framework along with the definition of several crucial concepts for verifying consistency. Section 3 illustrates the steps for constructing and verifying a model, simulating the model, and generating code within a model-driven development process through a basic case study. This demonstrates how to employ rigorous modeling techniques in practical software development. Section 4 concludes by summarizing the work and discussing potential avenues for future research.

The TMDA framework is designed to be adaptable and extensible, capable of incorporating various model checkers like SPIN, FDR, and SMV to fulfill distinct verification needs. Due to its wide use and well-established reputation, SPIN has been selected as the model checking engine within TMDA.

In the paper, a specialized function 'att' maps classes and attributes to types. An attribute 'a' of a class 'c' with type 't' is expressed as c.a: t, and 'attv(c)' represents the set of all attributes of 'c'.

The paper details how the number of messages handled by a class and those exchanged between two successive points in time can be quantified, noting the source, target, and guards of these messages.

Lastly, the authors extend their gratitude to the reviewers whose feedback helped refine the paper. The study received partial funding from several prominent research programs and foundations in China.

Given the excerpt provided, this paraphrase focuses on succinctly summarizing the main points rather than the specific technical details which would require the full context of the paper to interpret accurately.
