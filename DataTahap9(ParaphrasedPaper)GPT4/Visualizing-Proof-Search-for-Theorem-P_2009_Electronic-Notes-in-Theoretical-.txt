We introduce an interactive visualization tool designed for managing extensive searches in natural deduction proofs. This tool enables the monitoring of the search process and the visualization of the proof tree. We detail the tool's features, design, and how it can be extended and interact with additional user-provided analysis and visualization programs.

The work is part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Collaboration and Analyst System Effectiveness (CASE) program, under a contract managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), with HNC Software participating as a subcontractor of the University of South Carolina.

Visualization is particularly useful for automated theorem proving in natural deduction for two reasons. Firstly, natural deduction proofs tend to be more readable compared to other logic systems. Secondly, as the field is relatively new, visualization assists in understanding the behavior of experimental algorithms. By visualizing these proofs, tools can present both human-readable proofs and maintain fidelity to the data structures employed by the underlying theorem proving algorithms.

We have incorporated various visualization techniques into our tool to facilitate understanding of automatically generated proofs. Some of these techniques include graphical displays while others, such as converting proofs to natural language, are omitted to avoid obscuring the theorem prover’s operations. Our tool, VIPRS, was designed for the SILK theorem proving project and is detailed in terms of its user interface, implementation, and architecture.

Automated theorem provers are more commonly applied to mathematical domains, and applying them to broader areas of human knowledge poses significant challenges due to massive knowledge bases that cause search space explosion. The intercalation theory that is the foundation for our natural deduction search is sound, yet practical complexities still need to be explored.

VIPRS visualizes proof searches, which are like proof trees but may contain unverified formulas. The tool's interface allows users to interact with the proof search via mouse and command-line interfaces, providing a way to query and manipulate properties of the proof search without pre-coded interactions.

The visualization infrastructure is based on an abstract graph model, which then translates into a concrete visual representation using the Prefuse visualization toolkit. This toolkit underpins the visual aspect of VIPRS, rendering graphs in an interactive Java Swing component.

One critical goal of VIPRS is not just to detect coding errors but to understand the search space structure to enhance search efficiency. Efforts in VIPRS also focus on addressing redundancies that aren’t exact duplicates but are equivalent up to variable renaming.

VIPRS was designed with extensibility in mind, enabling users to add their own Python functions to be called from the CLI and to incorporate further structural highlights into the visualization. Future work includes automatic collapsing of certain parts of the visualization to reflect the structure of normal derivations and interoperation with the Bayesian network software system Bruce, with VIPRS expanding to visualize resulting Bayesian networks.
