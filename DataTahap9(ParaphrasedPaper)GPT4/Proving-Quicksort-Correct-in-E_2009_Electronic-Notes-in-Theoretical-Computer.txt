The authors of the article present their observations from utilizing Event-B, particularly in verifying an iterative version of the Quicksort algorithm. They describe their experiences with Event-B and provide critiques along with recommendations for its future development, suggesting that some of its minimalism may need to be sacrificed for clearer formal models.

Although focused on Event-B, the authors believe the issues and techniques they discuss have broader relevance across other formal methods like VDM or Circus. They point out similarities like the decomposition of proof obligations using witnesses, which is also applicable to methods such as Circus.

The article outlines the structure of Event-B models, which are comprised of static 'contexts' and dynamic 'machines'. Contexts include sets, constants, and axioms, while machines are detailed in later sections of the article, along with the proof obligations.

The authors describe the syntax and semantics of Event-B, explaining how before-after predicates represent the state transition due to assignments, and how variables that are not assigned remain unchanged. They also detail the refinement process where a 'concrete' machine refines an 'abstract' machine, maintaining a simulation relationship expressed through a gluing invariant.

They illustrate how proof obligations guide refinement, including the definition of witnesses that link abstract and concrete models. The authors discuss varying event types like convergent and anticipated events and their role in proving termination or delaying proof obligations.

Throughout the article, the authors reflect on the iterative verification of Quicksort using Event-B. In particular, they note how separating invariant preservation from termination proofs in different machines has proven to be beneficial. They also address the challenges of verifying an iterative algorithm compared to its recursive counterpart, which often seems simpler.

Finally, the authors comment on the lack of local variables in Event-B, which leads to global variables showing up in all proof obligations. They argue that incorporating more structure into the models and allowing for local variables would reduce proof obligations and enhance clarity. They apply these ideas in the fourth refinement of their model by implementing array partitioning with the Dutch National Flag algorithm.

In summary, the article shares valuable insights into the authors' experience of using Event-B for verifying an iterative algorithm, evaluating its strengths and weaknesses, and suggesting ways in which the formal method can be improved for greater efficacy and clarity.
