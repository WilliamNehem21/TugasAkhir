In the paper, the authors refer to a specialized mathematical structure known as a symmetric monoidal m-category. This is defined as an m-category—a type of category with additional structure, indicated by the letter 'm'—which also carries a symmetric monoidal structure. Importantly, the symmetric monoidal structure is applied to the basic underlying category without the requirement that it must interact in a particular way with the 'm' components or enrichment.

Furthermore, for two symmetric monoidal m-categories named C and D, a symmetric monoidal m-functor is described as a mapping from C to D that not only preserves the structures of an m-functor but also the properties of the symmetric monoidal structure. This means the functor respects both the m-categorical structure and the symmetric monoidal aspects.
