This new research model offers a promising direction for investigation in areas that have recently garnered significant interest, as evidenced by studies by Lai et al. 2016, Letchford et al. 2014, Huang et al. 2017, and Ben Ticha et al. 2017, among others. The model raises the challenging question of the feasibility of computing the multigraph, where simple shortest path solutions are insufficient for determining the necessary arc multisets and their associated weights. To provide such data, the Steiner multi-objective shortest path problem must be considered.

The paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature. Section 3 defines the Steiner multi-objective shortest path problem (Steiner BSPP), establishes important notation, and outlines basic properties that will be utilized later. Section 4 explains the proposed solution methodology. Section 5 suggests improvements for when the problem is addressed within the context of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). Section 6 presents the numerical results of the study.

For the one-to-all BSPP, the study mainly focuses on two label selection heuristics prevalent in the literature. One is the node-selection strategy, exemplified by Brumbaugh-Smith and Shier (1989), in which all labels representing paths concluding at the same node are chosen and expanded to that node's successors.

This research is driven by the necessity for multigraph data in vehicle routing problems, specifically when dealing with multiple attributes like time and distance that add additional constraints. In the case of VRPTW, tight visiting schedules for customers further complicate routes. These constraints offer opportunities for optimizing computation, which is demonstrated in the context of VRPTW.

The proposed enhancements accelerate the labeling process by increasing label keys more swiftly and by employing a more stringent stopping condition that, in combination with the first enhancement, restricts the number of labels generated. Additionally, a preprocessing step aimed at reducing graph size proves beneficial for solving the VRPTW more efficiently.

The paper uses four road networks extracted from U.S. Census data by Schultes (2005) representing Washington D.C., Delaware, Rhode Island, and Alaska, indicating distances and travel times for every road segment. Originally undirected, these networks were converted into directed ones for the study.

Finally, the paper describes a scenario typical of urban delivery where most terminals are selected within a central network area and one is positioned near the network's southwest corner to simulate a distant depot situation.
