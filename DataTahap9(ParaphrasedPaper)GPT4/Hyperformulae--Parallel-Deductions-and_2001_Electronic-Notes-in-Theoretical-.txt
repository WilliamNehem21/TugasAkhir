This paper discusses a logical framework where the intersection of types is defined in an unusual way that is dependent on specific proofs, rather than general properties of the types themselves. The introduction rule for the intersection type stipulates that a term 'm' achieves such a type if the term can be shown to have both component types simultaneously through the same proof. The intersection type is seen as an intensional proof-functional connective, a more restrictive version of classical conjunction.

In the paper's system, the structure of proofs is important, with a focus on hyperformulae, which are composed of formulas in a particular order. These can include a special marker signifying a "hole" or lack of information, which doesn't affect the logic of the system but helps build hyperformulae. Some global rules of the system involve entire hyperformulae, allowing assumptions to be discharged uniformly across all components of a hyperformula.

When deducing an intersection formula, all assumptions must be combined into a single formula, then used in parallel deductions to eventually combine conclusions. The parallel nature of these deductions distinguishes intersection from other types of deductions.

The paper also describes a method to label proofs with terms from lambda calculus to establish a correspondence between terms and proof structures, where each rule application corresponds to a specific operation on the labels. This labeling helps capture the deductive process within the structure of the associated term.

An objective mentioned is to use the logic outlined to define an explicitly typed lambda calculus with intersection types. This calculus would be powerful, with the property that only strongly normalizing terms would have well-typed representations.

Finally, the authors express gratitude to several individuals, particularly PhD students and professors who contributed discussions and suggestions that shaped the concept of parallel deductions featured in the paper.
