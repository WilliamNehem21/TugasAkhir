This study investigates the impact of S. afzelii, a herbal extract, and finasteride, a medication, on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland often seen in aging men. In the research, male Wistar rats with BPH induced by hormones exhibited weight loss yet had significantly heavier prostates, a key indicator of BPH progression. The untreated control group showed an increase in prostatic size and cellular proliferation in the stroma and glandular tissue. In contrast, prostate examination after the treatment with S. afzelii and finasteride for thirty days revealed considerable shrinkage of glandular tissue, suggesting a reduction in hyperplasia and a denser fibro-muscular matrix. Treatment was also found to stimulate appetite, which is usually reduced during BPH induction.

The study further reports that the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which typically rise with prostate enlargement, significantly dropped in the treated groups compared to the negative control. Additionally, treatment led to a significant reduction in testosterone levels, aligning them with the levels found in normal conditions. Antioxidant enzymes, which are normally decreased in BPH, showed substantial recovery in the treated groups, with the S. afzelii treated rats displaying dose-dependent increases in antioxidant enzyme levels.

In conclusion, S. afzelii not only reduced prostate enlargement but also demonstrated strong antioxidant effects. These findings endorse its historical use by herbalists for managing BPH and suggest it could serve as an effective prophylactic treatment.
