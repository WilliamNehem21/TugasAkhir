In the context of big data, network science, also known as complex network analysis, is gaining significant attention as a method for examining real-world and theoretical networks through the lens of graph theory. Node centrality is a key metric in this field, representing a quantifiable measure of a node's topological significance within a network. Node centrality can be useful in a variety of applications, such as identifying influential individuals on social media, critical points of infrastructure on the internet, or major disease spreaders in an epidemic.

Centrality measures can be generally split into two types: neighbor-based and shortest path-based. Familiar neighbor-based centralities include degree centrality (DegC) and eigenvector centrality (EVC), while betweenness centrality (BWC) and closeness centrality (CLC) are common examples of shortest path-based centralities.

While network research often focuses on determining the maximum clique size (the size of the largest complete subgraph), the study adapts an exact algorithm by Pattabiraman et al. to find the maximal clique size (the size of the largest complete subgraph that includes a given vertex) for each vertex in the graph. When computing the maximal clique for a vertex, if the degree of a neighbor is smaller than the current known maximal clique size, exploration of that neighbor and its subsequent neighbors can be pruned, avoiding unnecessary computations.

The study also evaluates the correlation between various centrality measures and the maximal clique size in different network types. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 imply a strong positive correlation, values near -1 suggest a strong negative relationship, and values around 0 indicate no correlation. The correlation analysis revealed that, while degree centrality and closeness centrality generally show a strong positive correlation with maximal clique size, this does not hold for random network graphs, which only exhibit a moderately positive correlation.

The paper presented a framework for analyzing correlations between centrality measures and maximal clique size in network graphs and concluded that simpler, neighbor-based centralities like DegC and EVC may serve as effective alternatives for ranking nodes, replacing the computationally intensive maximal clique size. This assertion is valid for real-world and scale-free networks derived from the Barabási-Albert model based on preferential attachment but is not supported by random networks, which display weaker correlations.

The research also considers specific networks such as the US politics book network, the neural network of C. elegans, Erdős collaboration network, and US airports network, each with a unique degree of connectivity based on different network formation models, which affects the observed correlation between the centrality measures and clique size. In these various networks, the relationship between centralities and clique size may vary, providing insight into how network structure influences metric correlations.
