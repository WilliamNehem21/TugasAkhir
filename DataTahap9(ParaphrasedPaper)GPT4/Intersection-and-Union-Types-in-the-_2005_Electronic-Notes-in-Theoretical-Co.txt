Barbanera and colleagues incorporated union types into intersection type systems based on the realization that union types naturally emerge in denotational semantics and can result in more descriptive types for certain terms. Despite this addition, the ability to type terms remains the same—the extended system with both union and intersection types still precisely encapsulates all terms that are strongly normalizing.

A crucial aspect highlighted by this work is the orthogonality of type inferences involving the introduction of intersections to the concept of the stoup, which refers to the active formula in type derivations. This orthogonality allows the establishment of a coherent typing system.

Nonetheless, Barbanera and co-authors pointed out the technical complexities associated with union types, especially the tendency for subject reduction—the property that typing is preserved after term reduction—to fail. In the proposed system, these difficulties notably manifest in proving the substitution lemma, which is pivotal for maintaining subject reduction.
