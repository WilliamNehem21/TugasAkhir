The paper discusses the use of proof-graphs as an alternative to traditional tree or list representations of proofs in propositional logic, highlighting their growing popularity for analyzing proof complexity and improving theorem proving efficiency. The main focus of the paper seems to be on a specific type of proof-graph known as the 'FPL-graph,' which combines elements of formula graphs and R-nodes. The paper suggests that FPL-graphs can visually differentiate between F-nodes and R-nodes by using solid lines for connections between F-nodes and dashed lines for R-nodes and their adjacent premises or conclusions, with delimiter nodes shaded for clarity.

Lemma 2.5 in the paper provides a means to confirm whether a graph G qualifies as an FPL-graph by checking if every node in G adheres to the types defined in the construction cases of Definition 2.2. Furthermore, the paper describes a process for normalizing FPL-graphs, including the elimination of 'maximal formulas'â€”a concept now expanded to include conjunction, disjunction, and implication, beyond the previously considered implication in MIMP-graphs. When these maximal formulas are removed, the paper explains a reordering of nodes occurs within the graph.

The proof included tackles the property of such normalized FPL-graphs to maintain the original premises and conclusions of the derivation. During the step of eliminating maximal formulas (as defined in Definition 3.4), the paper claims that such a reduction does not alter the premises and conclusions linked by D-nodes H and C within the derivation under reduction. This inspection of each elimination step demonstrates the preservation of these critical components of the logic derivation.
