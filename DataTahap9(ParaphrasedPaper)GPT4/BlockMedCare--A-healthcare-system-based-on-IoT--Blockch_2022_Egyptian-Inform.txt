This academic paper discusses the pressing public health challenges of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, with CVD causing approximately 17.5 million deaths in 2012 and diabetes resulting in 1.5 million deaths the same year. It anticipates that CVD-related deaths will rise to 22.2 million by 2030. The remainder of the paper is structured into sections covering preliminary definitions on Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare systems, blockchain technology, and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), with later sections detailing a proposed approach, use cases, practical scenarios, implementation, security analysis, and related work. The paper concludes by summarizing findings and suggesting future extensions of the research.

It introduces public, private, and consortium blockchains, differentiating them by their data access levels and consensus mechanisms. The paper further discusses Ethereum transactions and their validation through digital signatures, using decentralized technology like blockchain and IoT to secure Electronic Medical Record (EMR) integrity, and highlights various proposals for blockchain-based healthcare systems and the storage of vast amounts of data using IPFS.

The paper discusses a system involving multiple healthcare stakeholders, such as physicians and hospitals, connected via a blockchain network that enables access to patient health data. IoT devices communicate with light and full nodes in the blockchain to manage data without storing the entire blockchain. Health data is stored off-chain via IPFS while the blockchain manages access control and protects data integrity.

The security of the system is underpinned by cryptographic measures, immutability of records, decentralization, and consensus algorithms. Smart contracts are used for device registration and data access management, and proxy re-encryption safeguards the privacy of data in the system.

The paper describes a scenario involving a diabetic patient named Alex, who uses the system to manage his condition remotely, and explains how encryption and re-encryption processes facilitate secure data access between healthcare providers.

Algorithms are detailed to illustrate how devices are registered on the blockchain and how access permissions are granted to healthcare providers. The paper contends that its system architecture ensures data availability, privacy through encryption, and secure, controlled access to health information.

Finally, the paper outlines future objectives, including the implementation of the solution using Hyperledger blockchain, comparing it to Ethereum-based systems, and the incorporation of artificial intelligence to enhance the system's capabilities in data analysis and clinical decision-making.
