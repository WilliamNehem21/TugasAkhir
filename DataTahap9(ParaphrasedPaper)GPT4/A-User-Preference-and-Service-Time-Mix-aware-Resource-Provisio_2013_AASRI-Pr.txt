Paraphrased Summary:

Lama, P., and Zhou, X. investigated effective server provisioning techniques for multi-tier clusters that maintain end-to-end response time guarantees. They developed a control approach to dynamically adapt resources allocated to each tier based on current demands, ensuring that the performance parameters meet the specified requirements. Their research was published in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems in 2012, volume 23, on pages 78-86.

Lloyd, W., Pallickara, S., David, O., and colleagues examined the performance effects of deploying multi-tier applications on Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. The study aimed towards developing a performance model, providing insights into how such deployments impact application efficiency across various IaaS platforms. This research contributes to the Future Generation Computer Systems field by highlighting key considerations for optimizing and predicting the behavior of applications within cloud environments.
