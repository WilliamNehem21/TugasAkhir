The rapid growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market has led to emerging technologies to tackle the challenge of driving range anxiety, such as dynamic wireless charging systems that allow EVs to charge while in motion. This has resulted in studies on intelligent routing which are greatly dependent on inter-vehicle communications (IVC). However, IVC is susceptible to cyber threats like spoofing attacks. This paper presents a machine learning-based, probabilistic cross-layer intrusion detection system (IDS) with high accuracy over 90% in detecting spoofing. Emphasizing a novel metric called Position Verification Using Relative Speed (PVRS), this system leverages both onboard observational data and estimated distances calculated from signal exchanges in the physical layer (PHY) to enhance detection effectiveness.

Intelligent routing of EVs benefits from IVC when approaching static charging stations or dynamic charging routes. The proposed IDS system utilizes beacon messages called Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) that share a vehicleâ€™s presence and relevant data, transmitted using DSRC and WAVE technologies compliant with the IEEE 802.11p standard. Despite the advantages, such communications are at risk of cyberattacks.

The motivation of this study is to explore the effect of spoofing attackers within the system on total travel time optimization. Although detailed coordinated attack analyses are beyond this paper's scope, it shows that a probabilistic IDS is effective in mitigating at least one intruder's impact.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on spoofing detection, Section 3 outlines attack methodologies, and Section 4 details the proposed IDS and PVRS. Section 5 presents experimental evaluations of the IDS within the context of dynamic wireless charging and V2V communication. Section 6 discusses current authentication and key-distribution techniques for secure VANET communications, while Section 7 concludes by summarizing the findings.

Additionally, the paper discusses previous works on spoofing detection, mentioning techniques utilizing non-GNSS sensor data to complement GNSS information. It also compares different charging systems, both static and mobile, and demonstrates how the presented method effectively reduces waiting and charging times for EVs.

The paper highlights the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms for detecting spoofing, explaining their suitability for large datasets and high dimensionality. It also suggests the potential of ensemble learning to enhance performance using techniques like bagging and majority voting, coupled with Bayesian rule-based data fusions for probabilistic IDS outputs.

Furthermore, the paper introduces an algorithm for the PVRS metric, focusing on subnetwork partitioning to localize spoofing attacks. It also discusses the challenges of communication delays, especially given the traffic densities and the implications of mac layer delays on overall system performance.

Lastly, the research indicates that spoofing attacks substantially increase average travel time, particularly when both a static charging station and a mobile energy disseminator (MED) are present in the system, underlining the need for effective IDS solutions to maintain system efficiency. The paper uses evaluation metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC) to measure the discriminative power of the system and accuracy metrics to assess the overall correct predictions.
