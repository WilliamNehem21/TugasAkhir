The academic paper describes a workflow model named 'm' within a framework referred to as 'CWML' (Contextual Workflow Modeling Language). This model is essentially a task that has one input and one output condition. Its behavior is characterized using the framework of Petri nets, which defines the possible states and transitions within the task. The state of the workflow model at any point can be determined by the marking of its corresponding Petri net. A path within model 'm' is also defined, based on the presence and assignment of variables.

The paper discusses the algorithmic complexity of a method called 'slicing' used for analyzing the workflow. This technique has a complexity ranging from 'best case' O(n) to 'worst case' O(n^2log n), where n represents the number of atomic tasks. In the best-case scenario, all tasks are 'invisible' (not affecting properties of interest), and the algorithm quickly concludes its analysis. In contrast, the worst case occurs when each iteration finds a new 'visible' element that impacts the property being verified.

The authors applied their workflow modeling approach to hospice palliative care, creating a workflow that adheres to the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association's guidelines, known as 'norms of care', following its 2002 national model. This model strives to ease suffering and enhance the quality of life for patients. They created and verified a hospice palliative care workflow in partnership with the Guysborough Antigonish Strait Health Authority (GASHA), using the 'NOVA Workflow' system and developing LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formulae.

Looking ahead, the authors anticipate that the translation of CWML to other model checking tools will be uncomplicated, and expect to develop automated methods for such translations, allowing for the verification of large workflow models with different checkers. They plan to incorporate time-sensitive aspects into the slicing algorithm to better handle safety-critical systems, such as healthcare, which often have time-dependent specifications. Moreover, they intend to refine their methods to manage unstructured workflow models with potentially infinite states, possibly employing a concept called 'control dependence' to identify and handle infinite loops within models.
