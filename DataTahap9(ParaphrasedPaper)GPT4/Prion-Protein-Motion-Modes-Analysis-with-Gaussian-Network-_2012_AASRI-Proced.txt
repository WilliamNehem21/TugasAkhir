The leisurely movements within a protein are indicative of motions significant to its function. In contrast, the swift movements are associated with structural irregularities and local deviations. These rapid fluctuations bring about a reduction in entropy, surpassing that observed in the slower motions. Consequently, the amino acids involved in these quick movements are considered kinetically active hotspots, vital for maintaining the protein's three-dimensional structure's integrity.
