The selection of an accurate estimation method is critical for various educational contexts. This paper introduces an integrated assessment model utilizing fuzzy logic to effectively manage the evaluation process involving multiple factors. It outlines the detailed design steps of building this fuzzy logic-based model. When applied to real data, the model yielded pleasing estimation outcomes, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex, multi-factor situations.

Fuzzy logic was originally created by Professor L.A. Zadeh at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1965. Following its inception, the first practical use of a fuzzy logic controller by Mamdani occurred in 1974 on a steam engine. Since then, fuzzy logic has been widely applied in numerous successful ventures, achieving remarkable results.

Specifically, assessing teaching quality, which often involves multiple variables, is essential for educators. Many existing methods are available, but this paper proposes a fuzzy integrated estimation model designed to provide a more accurate evaluation by overcoming flaws in traditional methods. The model calculates eigenvectors for each index through the sum-product approach, and standardizes these according to real-world data, proving to be effective for multi-variable evaluation processes.
