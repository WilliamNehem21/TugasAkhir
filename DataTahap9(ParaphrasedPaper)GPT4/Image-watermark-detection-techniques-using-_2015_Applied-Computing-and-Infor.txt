The recent decade has seen a growing interest among researchers in digital image watermarking, driven by objectives such as securing information, concealing data, authenticating origins, and creating unique identifiers for digital content. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has emerged as a preferred method for watermarking because it can analyze an image's different frequency components, allowing watermarks to be embedded effectively. The literature includes numerous studies on DWT, often exploring its integration with other techniques like quadtrees, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) strategies. A semi-blind watermarking algorithm is also introduced.

This research employs quadtree decomposition to partition images into more uniform blocks, unveiling their structural composition. This approach helps assess how various watermarking methods (DWT, DCT, Least Significant Bit (LSB), CDMA) perform with respect to watermark insertion.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant theories, Section 3 looks into subjective and objective performance metrics, Section 4 describes the proposed system, Section 5 discusses experimental outcomes and analyses the system, and Section 6 summarizes the findings.

The modulation index 'a' is crucial for balancing allowable image distortion against the energy needed for watermark detection. The modulation index may depend on or remain unaffected by image coefficients, leading to categorization of Spread Spectrum (SS) watermarking schemes into adaptive or non-adaptive.

Gray-scale images can be broken down into various segments with distinct detail levels, aiding efficient image data coding. Quadtree decomposition is an effective method for segmenting an image into homogenous two-dimensional areas.

A picture's quadtree is developed by recursive subdivision of the image matrix into quadrants until a single color remains. Each node in the tree reflects a quadrant of its parent node. The quadtree structure has either leaf nodes with uniform pixel blocks or nodes with four child nodes arranged in a specific order.

The region quadtree serves here as a variable resolution representation of image data, with each leaf node indicating an all-zero or all-one pixel block. The point quadtree is described as a structure for two-dimensional point data representation, optimized for efficient comparison and typically with O(log n) performance.

The SSIM index involves calculating measures of luminance, contrast, and structure, incorporating stabilizing variables to account for weak denominators, with 'l' denoting the pixel value's dynamic range. The matrix generated offers an accurate measure of classification accuracy or errors for various classifiers.

In this paper, quadtree decomposition serves as a subjective metric, and objective metrics include SSIM, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Pearson correlation, and false positives and negatives. These metrics are applied to assess the performance of four watermarking techniques (CDMA, DWT, DCT, LSB). Employing quadtree decomposition facilitates the differentiation of watermark methods in images. The study confirms the efficiency of quadtrees in detecting watermarks and highlights performance variations across different techniques.
