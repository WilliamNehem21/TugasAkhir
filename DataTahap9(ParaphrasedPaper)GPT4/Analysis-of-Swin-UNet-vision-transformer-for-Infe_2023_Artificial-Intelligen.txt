Materials and Methods: 
This retrospective study analyzed 84 CT scans with 54,618 slices to develop and test a segmentation algorithm that automatically detects inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in abdominal CT scans, regardless of the original scanning purpose. The research employed various 3D-patch-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the SWIN U-Net Transformer (SWIN UNETR) to identify IVC filter signatures. Dice score was the primary performance metric used to evaluate the segmentation models.

Conclusion:
The study found that the vision-based transformer, SWIN UNETR, provided segmentation with low bias and variance, addressing a real-world problem in healthcare for the advanced AI processing and recognition of medical images. Implementing SWIN UNETR can centralize IVC filter tracking within the electronic health record, potentially reducing the manual effort required.

U-Net is a CNN framework designed for biomedical image segmentation, featuring an encoder (contraction path) with convolution and pooling layers, and a decoder (expansion path) with transposed convolution layers that integrate feature maps from the encoder. The 3D U-Net extends this design for 3D volumetric data, processing data cubes rather than 2D images.

The SWIN UNETR innovatively combines the SWIN transformer with the U-Net architecture by substituting the original U-Net's convolutional encoder with the hierarchical SWIN transformer. Data from the SWIN transformer feeds into the U-Net decoder via residual connections. This approach was initially meant for segmenting brain tumors in MRI images, and was proven effective in the 2021 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, outperforming other models for various tumor types, as well as in segmenting head and neck tumors from CT images in the HECKTOR 2022 challenge. SWIN UNETR was pretrained on large datasets.

The study also incorporated data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, resizing, flipping, and rotation to prevent model overfitting by introducing variability into the training data, which included both IVC and non-IVC patches.

Future research aims to validate the IVC filter detection algorithm and develop a reporting pipeline for an estimated 1,500 clinical CT scans, with the SWIN UNETR predicting 3D masks of IVC filters. These predictions will be refined using the scikit-image library in Python to eliminate any false segmentations. The algorithm will be evaluated on clinical CT scans, with manual review for performance assessment. Further testing will refine the SWIN UNETR for better accuracy and rapid re-deployment.
