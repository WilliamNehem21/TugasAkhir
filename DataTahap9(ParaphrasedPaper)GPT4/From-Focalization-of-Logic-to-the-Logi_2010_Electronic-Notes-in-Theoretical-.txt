This paper discusses a concept in ludics—a branch of logic that focuses on the interaction between players in a game-like framework—for analyzing the behavior of logical connections. It tackles the synthesis of behaviors and the notion that focalization (the process of concentrating on positive connections) is fundamentally the opposite of invertibility (the ability to reverse negative connections).

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 revisits the foundational elements of ludics, which include designs, and introduces the concept of functionals, which act like morphisms in facilitating interaction between behaviors. Section 3 presents synthetic signatures and connectives, which lay the groundwork for examining functionals that either focus or invert, initially without type considerations.

In section 4, the focus is on these functionals in an untyped context, before the paper shifts to a typed framework in section 5, where functionals are studied as actual functions between behaviors, now considered as types. Section 6 characterizes logical behaviors and internal completeness within this framework. The study concludes in section 7 with a ludic perspective on focalization.

Overall, the paper explores how behaviors can be synthesized to better understand the process of focalization. Furthermore, it asserts that every design that focalizes can be drawn back (or retracted) from a design that inverts, illustrating the duality between the focalization of positive and the invertibility of negative logical connectives.
