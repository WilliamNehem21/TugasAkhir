The academic paper discusses the prevalent reliance on fuel and oil as primary energy sources worldwide, with many of these fuels being obtained from natural sources or produced by refining crude oil. Fuel plays an essential role in the global economy, but some nefarious practices have arisen, including the deliberate adulteration of the fuel supply chain by unscrupulous business operators. A particular concern is the illegal mixing of kerosene into petrol and diesel at gas stations, which can significantly reduce fuel lubricity and have far-reaching negative impacts on various industries, including automotive, chemical, pharmaceutical, and food production. This adulteration can also damage machinery and potentially harm diverse organisms and ecosystems.

The paper also describes the development of a microwave sensor using mu-negative metamaterials, designed to characterise liquids and detect kerosene adulteration in fuels with a high level of sensitivity and a compact form. Special attention is given to achieving miniaturization and enhancing the sensor's sensitivity. The research models its measurements based on the assumption of an ideal conductor with no electrical resistance, which allows electromagnetic waves to fully reflect off the boundary, while the z-axis remains an open boundary with no constraints, permitting free propagation of electromagnetic waves in that direction.

The final results from the sensor measurements are found to be consistent with the simulated results, but some discrepancies are noted. These may stem from mutual coupling effects of the waveguide port, manufacturing tolerances, and measurement errors. Additionally, resonance effects between the transmitting and receiving elements of the waveguide ports can cause slight variances between the simulated and actual measurement data.
