The paper introduces an algorithm for coloring planar graphs by creating a maximal independent set, S, with specific properties. For instance, S includes a vertex that is part of the highest number of odd cycles within the input graph, G. The selection process for vertices that form S involves analyzing the internal-face graph derived from G, focusing on vertices that are part of a maximum quantity of odd faces in G.

The study only deals with planar graphs, referencing the well-known Four Color Theorem, which asserts that all planar graphs can be colored with four colors. This theorem is notable for its proof, which, while historically verified computationally, remains complex and extensive.

Within the discussion, faces of a graph are defined as the enclosed areas by a set of edges. Edges of G that don't border any face are identified by the vertex pairs they connect, known as acyclic edges.

One significant outcome, Lemma 3.2, states that if you have a set of faces where each one possesses at least one vertex not confined to color 3, and these faces are either independent or share a common vertex, then they can be colored with three colors.

Applying Lemma 3.2, vertices with a minimal degree (less than 3) can be colored with three colors and then removed at the start of a four-coloring algorithm to simplify the graph. This approach also leads to the conclusion that it's sufficient to consider only one edge between adjacent faces since multiple edges would create degree 2 vertices, which can be merged at the endpoints of their shared boundary.

The internal-face graph, referred to as GF, represents the non-dual face connections in G, excluding the external face. Although GF is planar, it doesn't always hold a tree structure. However, when GF is a tree, its corresponding planar graph, G, is considered a polygonal tree. In such instances, all cycles in G can be organized as a tree with polygon nodes, facilitating an efficient procedure for three-coloring the graph. Polygonal trees are identified as three-colorable graphs.

An algorithm proposed in the paper operates with a time complexity of O(n^2), suitable for coloring planar graphs, where n is the number of vertices. It is based on computing a maximal independent set S derived from the input graph G. S is characterized by including vertices involved in the maximum number of odd faces within G. The method prioritizes the internal-face graph of G while selecting vertices for this maximal independent set.
