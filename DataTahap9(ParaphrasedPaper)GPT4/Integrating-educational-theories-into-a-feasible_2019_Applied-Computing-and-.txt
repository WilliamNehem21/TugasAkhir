Current efforts are focused on improving educational processes through the implementation of new technology to facilitate students' learning. This study presents a new system combining three influential education theories—learning objects, collaborative learning, and mobile learning—in the context of cultural heritage education. This system maintains clear theory characteristics for educators, and its integration into teaching practices is well-received.

Educational theories provide the foundation for a unified digital environment, especially for cultural heritage courses. Collaborative learning emphasizes teamwork and active participation, while mobile learning leverages portable technology to enhance learning inside and outside the classroom. Learning objects theory promotes the use of small, independent, and reusable educational units enriched with metadata. These theories have guided many educational software applications.

The feasibility of adopting traits from collaborative, mobile learning, and learning objects theories into software applications is well-documented. Examples include collaborative learning environments that foster student cooperation, location-aware platforms for history learning, and personalization techniques using learning objects. Software like the MedCGame encourages active cultural heritage learning, whereas the Mused platform offers a repository of reusable heritage content. The Lamp/Pulu platform supports grouped learning but lacks the typical learning object's platform independence and enrichable metadata.

The new system organizes educational content into units that reflect learning objects theory, with each unit being semantically independent, allowing simultaneous use, and suitable for aggregation. Units are collected based on metadata criteria like educational elements and discipline, allowing teachers to create customized collections.

Students can concurrently access and review content, thereby building and sharing personal knowledge—a principle aligned with educational theories like constructivism.

Collaborative projects allow teachers to design projects with goals and tasks for student groups to work on together. The system categorizes projects to broaden educational interactions and offers a user-friendly interface for teachers to create or share their projects.

The mobile lesson service lets teachers take lessons beyond the classroom, using a guide to present cultural points of interest and engage students in discussions and research using mobile devices.

The platform uses a role-based access control model for authorization, distinguishing between registered and non-registered users and granting different levels of access. Registered teachers can access content, create tasks, and oversee student contributions, among other functions.

The platform offers diverse content viewing options, including map, list, and private group views.

The proposed platform successfully integrates educational theory characteristics. Students appreciated the content, services, and adherence to educational theories, indicating a willingness to integrate the platform into their learning process and recognizing its educational value.
