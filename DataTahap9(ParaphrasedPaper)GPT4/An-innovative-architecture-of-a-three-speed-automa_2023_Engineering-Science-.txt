Due to the growing concerns about climate change, bicycles are becoming more favored for their potential to reduce emissions. Recent research has examined various aspects of bicycles, including cost comparisons with cars and their role in urban transport. There is a particular focus on gear systems, evidenced by the extensive literature on the subject.

Derailleur systems, common in most geared bicycles, are noted for requiring more maintenance compared to internal gear hubs. Internal gear hubs, which have been around since the early 20th century, provide benefits such as protection from damage and debris, and better chain alignment, leading to lower maintenance needs. These features make them ideal for city and touring bikes, though racing bikes still prioritize the lighter weight of derailleur systems.

Despite the existence of these two systems, single-speed bikes are popular in urban areas for their simplicity, low maintenance, and durability. However, they fall short on varied terrain or during quick acceleration. A potential solution is the automatic internal gear hub, allowing for different gear ratios while maintaining user-friendliness by automatically adjusting gears based on the hub's angular velocity. These hubs may use electric or mechanical means to change gears; electric systems employ controllers and actuators while mechanical systems use devices like centrifugal clutches and sprag clutches to automatically shift gears.

Currently, automatic gear hubs are not widely available. The SRAM Automatix stands out as a unique offering with two gear ratios. This research aims to expand on this concept by designing a Three-Speed Automatic Internal Shifting Hub (TSAISH), which increases the number of gear ratios from two to three. The newly designed TSAISH is based on the SRAM Automatix but with three gears for better riding flexibility.

This academic paper outlines the TSAISH's design, including the preliminary sizing of its components and a performance comparison with the SRAM Automatix. The paper confirms that the TSAISH provides an advantage in terms of comfort and performance over the Automatix, as it requires less force on the pedals and offers a more uniform torque, without exceeding a pedaling cadence of 90 RPM.
