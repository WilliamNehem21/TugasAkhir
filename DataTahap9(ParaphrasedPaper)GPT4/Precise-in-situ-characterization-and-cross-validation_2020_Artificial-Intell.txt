Switched Reluctance Motors (SRMs) are increasingly popular for use in a variety of applications including electric vehicles and aircraft due to their simple, durable design, potential for low cost production, excellent power and speed capabilities, high efficiency, and fault tolerance. Researchers have focused substantial efforts on aspects of SRM performance such as speed control analysis, controller design, and practical applicationsâ€”all of which rely on accurately understanding the electromagnetic properties of SRMs.

Characterizing these properties precisely for control purposes is challenging because of the non-linear behavior of SRMs, which is a result of their distinctive structure and operation in a state of deep magnetic saturation to enhance power density. Accurate lab measurements of these characteristics often do not translate well to practical engineering scenarios due to variations in manufacturing and materials, the omission of phase mutual couplings, diverse winding losses, and losses from power electronics.

This paper, therefore, highlights the need for a quick and individualized method of characterizing these motors to closely replicate real-world operating conditions, which could be achieved through in-situ characterization.

The paper is structured as follows:

1. Section 2 introduces an accurate model for characterizing SRMs, specifically defining phase and incremental inductance.
2. Section 3 presents an approach based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) circuitry for in-situ characterization, including its benefits.
3. In section 4, measurement results and parameter characteristics are discussed, along with a method for reliable in-situ cross-validation.
4. Conclusions are drawn in section 5.

The paper also discusses converting devices for SRMs, provides detailed specifications of components used in tests (e.g., current sensors, encoders, controllers, and FPGAs), and explains the advantages of using a decaying current profile versus an increasing one for higher current measurements to minimize error.

The effectiveness and precision of the characterization process are verified by using both decaying and rising current methods for cross-validation at the same motor position, and by comparing the data with a numerical model simulation. The results confirm that with precisely measured electromagnetic data, SRM behaviors can be thoroughly examined across various simulated conditions without the constraints of drive circuits and instrumentation.
