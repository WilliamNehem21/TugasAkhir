Contemporary integrated development environments (IDEs) equip software developers with advanced tools to understand and modify code, going beyond standard features like syntax highlighting and compiling. These tools typically include capabilities for code refactoring and visual representation of program structure. Many of the strategies used in IDEs can be adapted or altered to suit the unique characteristics of user interactive theorem proving systems (UITPs).

Transferring techniques from IDEs to theorem proving systems is an idea with a history, yet IDEs have seen considerable improvements over the past decade, driven by the challenges of maintaining and upgrading substantial codebases. As software grows more complex, it becomes harder for even experienced programmers to comprehend the code fully.

Likewise, as automated theorem proving advances, managing the growing volume and aging of proofs demands tools for visualization, comprehension, and manipulation, much like those employed by IDEs. Integrated Proof Environments (IPEs) should integrate these tools, paralleling the evolution of IDEs.

This paper discusses how proof components, such as definitions, theorems, and tactics, align with corresponding parts in the proof or resulting extracted program, enhancing focus and understanding. A visual system distinguishes between incorporated and unincorporated parts of the proof script, such as directives or comments, and marks indirectly generated components.

Refactoring in programming involves restructuring to improve organization without changing behavior. In theorem proving, refactoring could unify assumptions across proofs and encourage proof reuse. Despite the advanced refactoring support in modern IDEs, UITPs lag behind. UITPs should similarly support operations like renaming lemmas and reorganizing proof scripts, akin to the way IDEs support the renaming of functions and restructuring of code.

We've indicated how techniques from software development can benefit those working on large and complex proofs, mirroring the collaborative and long-term nature of substantial software projects. With program extraction becoming recognized for creating reliable software, these methodologies will increasingly aid proof developers.

A proof script, its corresponding proof, and the derived program have intrinsic relationships, which the proof engine and extraction mechanisms must calculate. While establishing these connections is methodologically straightforward, the challenge is to document and display them effectively.

Furthermore, exploring these adaptations could yield significant theoretical insight. While previously mentioned refactoring strategies are simple, more ambitious refactoring examples exist in programming, like converting non-polymorphic Java programs into polymorphic ones. Similarly, advanced refactorings for theorem provers could provide novel and valuable perspectives.
