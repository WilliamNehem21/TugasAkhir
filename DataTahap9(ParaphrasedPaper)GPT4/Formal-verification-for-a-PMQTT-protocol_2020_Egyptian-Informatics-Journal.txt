ProVerif is a proficient tool used in the security testing phase for security protocols, leveraging the pi calculus for assessing confidentiality and authentication properties. Capable of examining multiple protocol sessions, ProVerif allows an attacker to actively interfere with communications, capturing and manipulating messages to compromise the system. It also traces attack paths to identify potential security flaws.

The paper continues with a review of previous enhancements to MQTT security, introduces a secure version named pmqtt, and describes its cryptographic measures designed for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. The protocol is formally verified to ensure secure delivery of intended services. Conclusions and future research directions are then provided, highlighting the benefits of pmqtt in practical MQTT-based IoT environments.

The proposed authentication protocol for pmqtt eliminates the password in the client-broker handshake, using it only when generating or verifying digital signaturesâ€”a process which secures username transmission without the overhead of SSL/TLS.

The pmqtt protocol features a key exchange phase where a symmetric session key is generated using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), and an ensuing phase where data related to patients is securely shared through encryption with the AES algorithm using the established key.

Furthermore, pmqtt streamlines the authentication process in MQTT networks by repurposing the MQTT broker, negating the need for an additional dedicated authentication server. It introduces a modified MQTT connect packet with a digital signature attached to the username, allowing for the safe transfer of the username in clear text and reducing the reliance on SSL/TLS in the transport layer.
