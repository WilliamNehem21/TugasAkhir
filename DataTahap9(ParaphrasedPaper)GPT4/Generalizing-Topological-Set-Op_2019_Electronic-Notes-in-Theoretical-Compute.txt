The academic paper discusses an extended framework of closed sets, termed "generalized" closed sets, and examines the broader applicability of closure systems beyond traditional topological spaces. Generalized closure systems are shown to incorporate closed set structures found in various fields including formal concept analysis, matroids, antimatrods, category theory, and domain theory.

The paper's central contribution is a comprehensive classification of generalized operators associated with closure systems, expanding on the conventional notions of closure, interior, and boundary within topology. By systematically exploring and extending the axioms that govern topological boundary and derived set operators, the authors generalize the concepts of boundary, derived sets, and co-derived sets. These generalizations maintain analogous relationships to the closure, interior, and exterior operators, as seen in classical topology.

The structure of the paper is outlined as such: a review of topological set operator axiomatizations is presented in Section 2, followed by a detailed discussion of the generalized versions of closure, interior, and exterior operators in Section 3. Within this section, the authors also introduce generalized boundary operators (Section 3.2), generalize derived set operators (Section 3.3), and co-derived set operators (Section 3.4). The paper concludes with a brief summary and contemplation in Section 4.

By establishing a complete set of generalized topological operators, the paper enables the extension of topological semantics to various non-topological closure systems, such as matroids and antimatrods, as well as to the study of lattices, highlighting the interconnectedness of topology, lattice theory, and logic. The new axiomatic framework enriches the understanding and application of these concepts in a broader scope beyond traditional topological environments.
