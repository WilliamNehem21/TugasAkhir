This article examines the automatic derivation of sufficient pre-conditions through abstract interpretation and outlines the development of a backward analysis that under-approximates. It concentrates on numerical domains and suggests transfer functions that enable handling of polyhedra without needing disjunctive completion or complementation, while also managing non-determinism effectively. The goal is to find conditions under which a program operates safely within a specific range of states or, conversely, conditions that ensure inevitable failure. Though this construction is in its early stages and largely untested, the authors believe it represents a promising line of research.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the concept of sufficient conditions within transition systems. Section 3 discusses the algebraic properties of backward functions, which are utilized in Section 4 to create under-approximated operators for polyhedra. Section 5 reviews works related to this research, and Section 6 wraps up the paper.

The paper also mentions that generator representations are not unique and the outcome depends on the chosen representation. A potential fix is similar to the one used for standard widening: adding any generator from one set that is redundant with a generator in another set. Also, the suggested lower widening can be fine-tuned using classic methods.

Since E. W. Dijkstra's introduction of weakest preconditions, various exact inference and verification methods have been explored, including interactive theorem proving and automatic finite-state computations. However, these methods provide exact conditions, possibly in relation to a model that over-approximates the actual system, so that the model's sufficient conditions might not always align with those of the original system. Fully automatic approaches based on underapproximations have been somewhat rare.

Ultimately, this article presented the concept of inferring sufficient conditions through abstract interpretation. It detailed the underlying properties of backward underapproximated semantics and showcased some example transfer functions for the domain of polyhedra. There remains extensive work to be done, such as devising new underapproximated operators, exploring new domains, and running experiments on realistic programs. Despite being very preliminary and mostly theoretical, the authors seek to demonstrate to the reader the potential value of this research direction.
