Process algebras are established frameworks for the compositional description of systems that communicate synchronously, defined abstractly by the patterns of their observable interactions. These algebras provide the theoretical basis for various programming and modeling language semantics and are utilized as modeling languages in their own right.

In some cases, the behavior of the scheduler, which orchestrates the order of actions, can be constrained with additional rules such as priorities or fairness. These constraints refine the abstraction by imposing limits on the scheduler that weren't present at a more abstract level. This refinement occurs independently from the task of addressing the combined effects of inherent nondeterminism and the resolvable nondeterminism of a partially specified scheduler.

Within probabilistic process algebras, choice operators are enriched with probabilities to guide the selection among alternatives. While randomized choice represents a form of inherent nondeterminism, it's crucial to study pure inherent nondeterminism within choice operators that lack a probability distribution. This is due to instances where the probability distribution is either unknown or nonexistent. Efforts to incorporate pure nondeterminism within probabilistic frameworks tend to result in highly intricate models, which can unnecessarily complicate the verification process.
