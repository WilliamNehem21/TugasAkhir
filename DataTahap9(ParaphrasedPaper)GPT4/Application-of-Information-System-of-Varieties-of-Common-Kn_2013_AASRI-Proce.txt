Plant Variety Protection (PVP) has become vital for societal progression and has garnered significant global interest. The surge in PVP applications is challenging traditional methods for selecting comparable strains for PVP tests, also known as DUS tests. This paper suggests creating an information system to catalog plant variety data to enhance the precision and efficiency of PVP examinations.

As intellectual property's value is recognized in the knowledge economy, PVP emerges as a crucial element for modern agriculture's growth and societal advancement.

After joining the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) in 1999, China has seen its PVP processes evolve from inception to maturity within 13 years. The country experienced an increase in PVP applications and authorizations — from 115 to 1138 yearly applications within twelve years.

The number of recognized varieties—strains sold commercially, applied for PVP, or listed in a registry—has grown with PVP, pressuring the current manual methodology for selecting similar varieties. Consequently, automating the process through an information-based system is necessary to streamline and ensure accurate selection.

Photographs offer another method for visually distinguishing different plant varieties. To do so effectively, specific parts of a plant need to be targeted for imaging. These photograph targets are then recorded in the system.

Furthermore, when a variety is registered nationally or provincially, registration details such as codes, dates, and conclusions are stored and managed within the system.

For PVP applications, DUS testing is conducted referencing similar varieties based on their characteristic descriptions and DNA fingerprints. Important criteria include common plant genera or species, or subgroup membership when narrowing down candidate varieties.

The selection process zeroes in on comparing characteristic expressions, ranging from qualitative, quantitative, to pseudo-quantitative types, and should follow a specific order for best results. While some differences in pseudo-quantitative characteristics are permissible, they must be minimal, especially for group-defining traits.

DNA fingerprints, obtained through PCR amplification and electrophoresis, form the basis for selecting similar varieties through a comparison of DNA band loci, striving to minimize differences wherever possible.
