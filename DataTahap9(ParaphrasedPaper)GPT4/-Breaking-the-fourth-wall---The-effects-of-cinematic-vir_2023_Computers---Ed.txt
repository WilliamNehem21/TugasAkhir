In a study exploring the integration of experience-based learning and empathy development in educational settings, particularly through the lens of virtual reality (VR), researchers highlighted the pivotal role of experience as postulated by Kolb's experiential learning cycle. This learning process begins with a direct experience, followed by reflection, conceptualization, and active experimentation, and is tailored to individual learning styles, allowing for personal growth and continued learning.

Recent attention has been given to empathy in K-12 educational programs due to its associated benefits, such as reduced aggression and increased pro-social behavior. Empathy, which comprises both cognitive and affective components, is particularly critical during adolescence, a phase marked by significant development in these skills, with notable gender differencesâ€”girls typically display higher empathy levels than boys.

The study under discussion aimed to discern the impact of VR technology in the classroom and to differentiate between 2D VR on screens and immersive VR with head-mounted displays (HMDs), which engage students differently. Conducted over two weeks in a Chicago suburb middle school, the research involved 7th graders who met the participation criteria.

The study employed the Affective and Moral Engagement Scale (AMES) to measure empathy and included a sympathy subscale. However, due to non-normal distribution of sympathy data, it was excluded from the final analysis, which used non-parametric tests.

Researchers performed a two-way MANOVA to analyze how gender and film format influenced empathy-related gain scores, focusing on both affective and cognitive dimensions. Significant gender differences emerged, especially for males experiencing a VR film format, indicating a marked increase in empathy scores compared to females.

Social factors and gender stereotypes, which suggest that females are naturally more empathic, may have influenced these findings. It's important to note that the research adhered to ethical standards for human research established by the American Psychological Association, with informed assent from minors and consent from guardians. Due to privacy concerns, the participant data is not publicly available. The study had received prior approval from the Northern Illinois University's research compliance office.
