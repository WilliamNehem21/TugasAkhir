Virtual Reality (VR) serves as a powerful tool for creating immersive experiences and has extensive applications across various fields, such as arts and humanities, marketing, and STEM education. Researchers like Hutson and Olsen (2021) and Anderson and Laverie (2022) highlight its interdisciplinary utility, while studies by authors like Barbara et al. emphasize VR's growing popularity in education and research. VR creates interactive learning environments and can facilitate training in otherwise inaccessible or dangerous settings, reducing costs and potential risks (Mandal, 2013).

Zhang (2017) noted VR's effectiveness in training where real-world access is limited, such as in submarine operations or surgical procedures. VRâ€™s interactivity, visual learning capabilities, and HMD devices contribute to its educational value. This technology is particularly beneficial in scenarios where traditional learning could expose students to harm.

Fishbein and Ajzen's theory suggests that the intention to perform a task is a key predictor of actual task performance. This was supported by Bagozzi (1983) and further confirmed by Nursiah's (2018) findings regarding technology usage.

The study under discussion focuses on pre-service teachers in Nigeria, taking into account the prevalence of smart technologies in daily life and the necessity for teachers to adapt to new technologies. This research could inform stakeholders and policymakers on integrating VR into teacher education curricula and learning environments to address potential issues such as "sore eyes" associated with technology use (Shibata et al., 2011).

The study used projection-based VR systems like the CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) to isolate users from their surroundings and create a shared virtual space (Sherman & Craig, 2002). VR-based education allows learners to virtually engage with problems, enhancing problem-solving skills (Kim & Im, 2022).

Underpinning this research is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) which guides the systematic literature review on the effectiveness and limitations of VR. Studies have shown that beliefs about VR use, including behavioral, normative, and control beliefs, influence adoption intentions (Mazman, 2019; Kennedy-Clark, 2011). Social good, as a factor in technology use, suggests high chances of adoption if perceived societal benefits are associated (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2011; Alfalah, 2018).

The research involved 231 undergraduate pre-service teachers majoring in educational technology at a Nigerian university. Survey items were adapted from Ayanwale et al. (2022) and measured constructs like perceived usefulness (PU), technology anxiety (TA), and behavioral intention (BI) to use VR.

Data collected from the students provided insight into their understanding and perception of VR. Their familiarity with VR seemed abstract rather than practical. Despite this, their potential interest in VR as an educational tool was significant, supported by theories such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and TAM.

The study found a strong relationship between attitudes towards VR and the intention to use it among future teachers. However, participants' perceptions of VR might have been influenced by its novelty and lack of exposure or sufficiency in training. The perceived complexity, associated costs, and limited availability in schools could also affect perception negatively.

In conclusion, for VR to be more widely adopted in education, enhancing teachers' perceptions of its usefulness, ease of use, and compatibility with teaching practices is crucial. These factors, if addressed properly, could lead to more positive attitudes and a predictive relationship towards VR use among future educators.
