The paper discusses Fallout, a post-run analysis tool that stores a variety of logs and artifacts on a central server for later review. Fallout is commonly used for examining manual test run data, including metrics and benchmarks. During automated test analyses, it sends archived metrics to a central Grafana server for further examination using tools like Hunter, which detects statistical significance through change point detection. Fallout utilizes artifact checkers to scan logs for errors or warnings and may mark a test run as failed based on these findings. These checkers can also post-process files, such as combining HDR files from multiple clients to aggregate metrics.

Fallout allows unlimited artifact checkers to verify the history of operations during a test, with each checker performing unique checks. A test is considered successful only if all checkers report no issues.

In addition to client-side metrics displayed within Fallout's web interface, it also uses the History Server, a central Grafana server, to showcase a broader range of historical benchmarking and operating system metrics collected from test runs.

The tool Adelphi, an open-source QA utility running on Kubernetes, facilitates data integrity and performance testing for Apache Cassandra. Packaged as a Helm chart, Adelphi supports various benchmarks and tests for comparing Cassandra clusters but doesn't manage Kubernetes cluster lifecycle or present results for analysis.

The paper notes that Fallout is designed with modularity in mind, utilizing various tools and components for tasks that are typically integrated within similar services like DSI. Unlike DSI, Fallout does not seem to offer an API for external tool integration. It operates across several cloud platforms, including Google Cloud Platform, Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and an internal OpenStack-based private cloud.
