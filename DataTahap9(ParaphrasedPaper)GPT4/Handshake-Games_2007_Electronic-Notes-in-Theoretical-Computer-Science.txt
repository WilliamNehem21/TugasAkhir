In this paper, I introduce a game-theoretic model for analyzing handshake circuits semantically. This model efficiently captures the associative composition of circuits. Additionally, I construct a compact-closed category that encompasses handshake games and strategies. I also explore the language Tangram, offering semantic interpretations for its components within the model in alignment with the compilation of Tangram programs.

Players in the game, representing concurrent entities, take turns making moves. However, in this concurrent setting, turn-taking is applied to individual threads, allowing for parallel gaming experiences. The semantics of a game are exemplified through the possibility of receiving inputs in varying sequences and producing outputs similarly. There must be an input before an output, yet the reverse isn't necessarily true.

The concept of quiescent plays refers to occasions when players pause to await an opponent's action. Passive plays occur when a player must wait regardless of their preference due to the necessity of quiescence. I discovered that notions like reorder-closedness and receptivity were already recognized within game semantics literature, notably by Ghica and Murawski, and also in the broader context of diagrams in work by Mimram and Melli√®s.

Positionality, a significant characteristic for concurrent strategies to ensure composition, requires attention. While determinism in strategies is a basic prerequisite, it only maintains composability in the presence of positionality, which depends on homotopy relations between plays.

For deterministic strategies, there are standard conditions to satisfy, and such strategies must account for certain infinite plays to ensure non-manipulation by opponents. A third condition specifies these required infinite plays.

I also examine the concept of compact-closedness within my model, which captures the ability to represent internal loops, enhancing the modeling capabilities. This work aims to establish a general framework capable of encompassing a broader variety of asynchronous circuits. Such a framework might integrate process algebras by Mark Josephs and implementations of the geometry of interaction within circuit design, offering a comprehensive and scalable model.
