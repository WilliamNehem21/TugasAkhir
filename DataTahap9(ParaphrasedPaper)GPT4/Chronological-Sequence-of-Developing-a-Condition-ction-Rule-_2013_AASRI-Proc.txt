This research report aims to describe the methods employed for incorporating condition-action rules within an agent component of an expert healthcare support system called HEASSY. It outlines the procedures and strategies used for knowledge retrieval and integration within the HEASSY unit.

In systems governed by condition-action rules, the challenge lies in not merely taking action, but in selecting the most appropriate action for each specific state of the domain. The condition of the domain, which triggers a corresponding action, is determined by sensor-obtained measurements. The assumption throughout is that the system's domain remains fully observable at all timesâ€”a crucial point that must be carefully considered.

The present state of the domain, referred to as "st," is informed by data collected at a given moment. Labeling the complete set of potential states "S," the paper assumes discrete states that have a finite count. However, in a different context, a domain might exhibit an infinite number of states, indicating continuity. The domain is said to be fully observable if all sensors are capable of capturing the current state simultaneously.

The study first examines the domain status, which constitutes the conditions prompting domain actions. Actions may be directed by a single condition or by a combination of multiple conditions. When an action requires more than one condition, these are considered dependent conditions; otherwise, a condition stands independently. The conversation includes a two-fold state scenario.

Regarding the optimal action for any given condition, whether independent or dependent, some actions are derived from facts and principles tied to that condition. These facts emerge through deductive reasoning which serves as a guide for potential solutions. For instance, a high reading from a physiological transducer (such as a body temperature of 40 degrees Celsius) may suggest fever in a patient. However, since high temperature may also indicate other health issues, the paper underscores the importance of consulting medical experts for more advanced diagnosis.

Even though smart home health systems engage with high-level health services for expert consultations, an integrated knowledge database could provide crucial assistance within a well-structured framework. Such a system, when connected to a network, can interact with the smart home health systems from any location. The language used for communication between these systems needs to be well-defined.
