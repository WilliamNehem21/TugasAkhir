This paper proposes a method for quantifying the security of a system through a probabilistic process algebraic approach to noninterference, establishing a model composed of a linear space and linear transformations representing processes. The main metric employed is the norm of a specific linear operator related to the system.

The model integrates both reactive and generative probabilistic behaviors. Systems react to external inputs probabilistically while generating outputs based on a probability distribution. Noninterference is redefined within this context by a probabilistic version of weak bisimulation.

The concept of noninterference is explored further by defining a similarity relation that measures the maximum observable difference between two processes in terms of weak probabilistic bisimulation. This degree of observable difference provides a metric for the indistinguishability of processes, which corresponds to the potential information leakage.

The paper justifies this metric within a mathematical framework where the operational semantics of the probabilistic process calculus are expressed through linear operators on a vector space. The measure of noninterference aligns with the metric induced by a specific operator norm on process terms.

The probabilistic model discussed involves nondeterminism in addition to probabilistic aspects. The system's responses to environmental inputs are nondeterministic, while output choices are probability-driven. A mixed generative-reactive probabilistic model is employed, described by a transition system that distinguishes between input and output/internal actions.

Noninterference analysis in this research seeks to detect indirect information flows, or covert channels, from a high-level user (high) to a low-level user (low). In their framework, the probability distribution of system events is also considered as a potential channel for inferring high-level behavior by the low-level user.

The security verification process is demonstrated by modifying a process to restrict high-level actions, thus presenting the low-level view in the absence of high-level operations. The paper also addresses how probabilistic data related to system behavior can provide a quantitative assessment of potential information leaks. This leads to an understanding of the effectiveness of covert channels.

Finally, the paper presents examples to clarify the application of their approach in estimating security levels and identifying maximal information leakage scenarios. The model's linear operators are defined in a finite-dimensional vector space context, with an indication that their results can extend to an infinite-dimensional setting.

In summary, the research delivers a method for measuring and understanding the security degree of a system, with an emphasis on the probabilistic assessment of potential information leaks through an advanced algebraic framework.
