This study introduces a new method to detect and classify obstacles within dynamic backgrounds. It utilizes inverse perspective mapping and homography for detection, and a fuzzy neural network for classification. A key component is the determination of the vanishing point, which is achieved through a strategic feature extraction approach. By exploiting the geometry of scene elements, obstacles are identified, while successive image frames are aligned using the calculated homography of the road plane. Additionally, a novel fuzzy decision fusion approach with adaptable parameters has been proposed to improve the accuracy of obstacle detection and classification.

The paper also discusses the use of forward collision warning systems, which employ radar and laser sensors to warn drivers of potential collisions and take safety measures, such as precharging brakes or adjusting seats. The U.S. and European authorities are considering making these systems mandatory, with the European Union planning to require advanced emergency braking systems in commercial vehicles by November 2013 for new models, and by November 2015 for all new vehicles.

The potential for these systems to prevent accidents and reduce fatalities and serious injuries is significant, with estimates suggesting they could save thousands of lives across Europe annually. Furthermore, video processing-based solutions have gained prominence over the past decade due to the high costs and limited performance of traditional sensor systems. The paper thus details a complete computer vision-based system for detecting and classifying obstacles even in dynamic environments, relying on the motion parallax derived from aligned image frames to spot obstacles effectively.
