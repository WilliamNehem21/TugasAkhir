In the specified academic paper, the authors describe a convention where the variables x, y, z, x, y, z, and w are unique from each other. The first group of variables x, y, and z are categorized as level 1, while the second group with the same variable names are at level 2. The variable w is at level 3. The authors clarify that although they label the levels with numbers 1, 2, and 3, the proofs presented in the paper would remain valid if the levels were defined by integers, real numbers, or any fully ordered set — this suggests versatility in their system of labelling levels.

The paper asserts that the termination proof for a system denoted by sigma (σ) can be successfully extended when additional rules are incorporated into sigma, leading to the creation of an augmented set named sigma_new (σ_new). The authors also confirm that the system's confluence—the property that guarantees consistent results regardless of operation sequencing—remains valid even after these extensions.

They discuss the "Local Confluence Condition" (LCC), noting its simplicity, clarity, and beneficial characteristics. LCC seems to strike a careful balance between being straightforward enough to manage and expressive enough to be powerful. The authors reflect on a common issue in computer science: finding the correct equilibrium between simplicity and expressiveness. They propose that the LCC might achieve this desired balance effectively.
