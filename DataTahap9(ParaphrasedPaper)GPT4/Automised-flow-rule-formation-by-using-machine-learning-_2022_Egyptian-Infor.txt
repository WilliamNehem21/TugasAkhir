The key points of the academic paper are summarized as follows:

- Static principle formation in the application layer and dynamic rule forming in the control layer are complex processes that can be inefficient and prone to issues.
- A reinforcement learning-based method is suggested to improve rule management by generating rules automatically based on past experiences, avoiding bottlenecks and enhancing efficiency.
- The paper is structured with sections detailing the relationship between software-defined networking (SDN) and machine learning, related studies, the design of the proposed rule formation agent, experimental results, and future research directions.
- The application layer is essential for establishing flow rules in SDNs, which schedule packet traffic and monitor network status, interacting with the control layer through control messages.
- Previous research has focused on dynamic flow rule formation, aiming to increase SDN efficiency by enabling switches to create flow rules locally.
- The proposed reinforcement learning agent (RFA) is evaluated using a simulated environment with the OpenDaylight controller, Mininet, and Ubuntu on a virtual machine. Metrics such as throughput, packet loss, and flow insertion delay are used to measure its performance.
- The model is trained using default rules from the application layer, which facilitates reinforcement learning based on rewards, to address problems at the switch level and improve SDN functionality.
- While SDN has benefits, there are challenges to address, such as deadlock caused by flow rule issues and maintaining network traffic during security breaches.
- Results indicate that reinforcement learning to form flow rules can enhance the SDN environment, and the study contributes to the development of intelligent SDN solutions.
- Latency and missing flow rule issues have been addressed in the research, with an emphasis on maintaining network traffic if the application layer becomes disconnected. Future research may explore other supervised learning techniques for automatic rule formation.
