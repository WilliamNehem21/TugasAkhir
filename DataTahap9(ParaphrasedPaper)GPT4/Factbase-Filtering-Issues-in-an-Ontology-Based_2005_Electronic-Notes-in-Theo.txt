Standardized methods for exchanging data among tools for software reverse engineering have not been effective in creating a cohesive, automated support environment. The reason for this shortcoming is the rigid and prescriptive nature of these methods, which require tool developers to either build specific functionalities or adhere to strict standards to integrate their tools with others.

In the context of an OASIS (Open Advanced System for Information Sharing) framework, reverse engineering tools are chosen to collaborate within an integrated system, each contributing its own services. These services are functions performed by a tool, which produce outputs, such as reports or visualizations, from inputs like source code or code-related information.

Despite some tools, like the Fahmy tool, lacking direct variable representation capabilities, variables can be inferred through the use of relationship models, such as "usevar," and can be defined by their scope and usage within the code's structure.

However, when imprecision arises within an OASIS system, it could signal the need to refine the domain ontology to make important distinctions between similar concepts clearer, which otherwise may be conflated.

When implementing shared services within OASIS, there's a risk of 'information dilution,' where a tool's services might not meet user expectations due to subtle differences in how the tools represent data. These differences can influence the effectiveness of the shared services.

The preliminary OASIS implementation has proven that service sharing is viable for integrating information and services between reverse engineering tools while highlighting certain issues brought about by its design, specifically concerning how information is filtered and managed throughout the system. Addressing these issues will require further investigation to improve the integration of reverse engineering tools and system integration as a whole.
