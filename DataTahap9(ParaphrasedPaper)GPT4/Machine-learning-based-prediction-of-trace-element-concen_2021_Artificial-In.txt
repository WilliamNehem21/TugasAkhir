The study describes scenarios where the nugget effect is significant, the use of mixed numerical and categorical data is necessary, and non-traditional geological descriptions are helpful in resource estimation. Fractal models, which incorporate mathematical complexities, can now be accessed through geographic information systems to analyze geochemical exploration and environmental pollution data.

The paper details the geological structure of the Beaufort Group, characterized by sedimentary layers reflecting changes in the environment, leading to an aeolian landscape and eventual widespread volcanism. This formed the Karoo Igneous Province, with diverse magma originating from deep mantle plumes linked to Gondwana's breakup.

The elemental composition of rocks was determined using various techniques, with major and minor elements normalized, though some trace elements remained near instrumental detection limits. Machine learning uses all rock-forming elements as features, with feature engineering enhancing algorithm performance by transforming data into an appropriate feature space.

A range of supervised regression algorithms considers factors like computation time and data complexity, with an experimental approach optimizing performance. Prediction errors are understood through bias, variance, and noise, allowing the tuning of algorithms for the context.

The study eschews principal component analysis and focuses on content of major and minor elements due to the complex, non-linear interactions typical of geological samples. The end-to-end automated workflow establishes prospectivity maps without human interpretation bias, though this can limit insights into geological processes.
