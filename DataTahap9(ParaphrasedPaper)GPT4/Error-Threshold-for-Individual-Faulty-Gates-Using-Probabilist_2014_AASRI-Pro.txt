The second section of the paper introduces the concept of the Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM). The third section details the application of the PTM to ascertain precise error thresholds for individual gates that are prone to faults. Section four presents thorough simulation results and discussions. The conclusions of the paper are summarized in the fifth section.

In the realm of nanotechnology-based circuit design, the issue of reliability is increasingly significant. To address this, various computational methods to evaluate the reliability of such systems have been proposed. This paper, in addition to evaluating reliability, provides a concise explanation of an analytical method utilizing PTM to determine exact error thresholds for general probabilistic computations. Establishing precise error thresholds for gates subject to faults is a critical aspect in the design of nano-circuit systems, as it delineates the limits beyond which reliable computing cannot be guaranteed.
