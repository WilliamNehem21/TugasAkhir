The state of a smart grid can be categorized into distinct sections based on its operational status. Specifically, during abnormal conditions, the grid can be segmented into highly sensitive regions, disturbance regions, and regions requiring maintenance and repair. By managing these non-standard zones separately, the grid's overall performance can be optimized to maintain normal operational status. Consequently, the power grid's operational states can be characterized by five distinct zones: the optimal operation zone, the routine operation zone, the abnormal and vulnerable zone, the emergency and fault zone, and the repair and maintenance zone.

Furthermore, the smart grid is highly interactive and accommodates a range of distributed energy sources within the distribution network, including various distributed generation units, energy storage options, and renewable energy sources, while facilitating their seamless integration. It supports microgrid operations, enhancing the distribution network's operational flexibility and the reliability of electricity provision to loads.
