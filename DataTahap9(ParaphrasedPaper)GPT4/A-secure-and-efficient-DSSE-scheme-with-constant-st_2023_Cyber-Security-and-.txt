In the referenced academic paper, the authors introduce a data security scheme that offers a balanced trade-off between security and performance. While their scheme provides only modest forward update privacy, it guarantees backward security, ensuring that updated data remains distinct from the index at the cloud service provider (CSP), even for subsequent searches. This minimal level of forward update privacy is deemed sufficient for meeting the security needs without overly impacting performance. Furthermore, the scheme has mechanisms to thwart replay attacks.

The paper outlines the Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) approach, which involves seven key algorithms: setup, keygen, enc, srchtokengen, search, uptokengen, and update. Two main roles are defined: the data owner and the CSP. Encrypted data and indices are sent by the data owner to the CSP. When the data owner wishes to retrieve documents associated with a keyword, they generate a search token that contains the keyword information and send it to the CSP, which then searches the index and returns matching results. The data owner can also generate an update token when updating the data, which the CSP uses to revise the index.

In their specialized index structure, the authors deploy a search control node for enhancing user control during retrieval operations, maintaining weak forward update privacy. To ensure backward security, they employ a symmetric encryption algorithm regarded as secure, encrypting identifier information during updates so that no intelligence is leaked even if deletions occur in the index.

The system's robustness is fortified with a set hash utilized within the protocol. This set hash helps detect any malicious behavior by the three entities involvedâ€”data owner, CSP, and a third party termed the "service peer." The detection relies on metadata or validation data uploaded to the chain, with the authors confident that the security of the set hash is substantial enough to identify and correct errors that may slip through validation.

Additionally, the paper assesses the practicality of applying this scheme to smart devices, comparing it to other methods and demonstrating benefits in terms of storage, computational, and communication costs. The evaluation took place using Python 3, HMAC for pseudo-random functions, SHA-256 for the set hash function, and AES for symmetric encryption, all run on a computer with an Intel Core i5-10210U CPU and 8GB of RAM on Windows 11.

The authors also discuss local storage overhead in the context of sub-keyword counts, mentioning a fish-bone structure proposed by He et al. that reduces storage costs to a constant but has limitations regarding update counts and increased computational resources from the client.
