In this paper, the authors present a new monadic framework for random choice in domain theory that addresses limitations found in the probabilistic powerdomain. Traditional probabilistic powerdomains lack a feasible Cartesian closed category closure and cannot be distributed with nondeterministic powerdomains. This new monad of random choice, however, is closed under the Cartesian closed category BCD and also has a distributive law with the lower powerdomain.

To allow the use of the convex powerdomain, the authors adapt the monad of random choice, which ensures closure under the Cartesian closed categories RB and FS. The adapted monad has a distributive law with the convex powerdomain within these categories. This work builds on the idea of uniform continuous random variables by Goubault-Larrecq and Varacca, addressing the non-monotonicity issue in their Kleisli extension definition.

Mislove extended these ideas to create a monad of finite random variables, showing closure under RB and FS categories. The continuous random variable model also draws from Goubault-Larrecq and Varaccaâ€™s work, but the monad presented in this paper is different in that it can represent computation branching based on random choices, a feature that is inherently programmed into the algorithms such as the Miller-Rabin primality test.

The paper explores how this new monad differs from the probabilistic powerdomain, especially emphasizing the significance of random choice in the branching of computations. The monad confines randomness to the leaves of a tree, representing the potential outcomes of random computation. A modified Kleisli extension that satisfies the monad laws and a distributive law with the lower powerdomain is also provided, with everything established within the BCD category.

Looking ahead, the authors suggest further research regarding these monads and mention already achieved progress beyond this paper's scope, including distribution with the upper powerdomain and operational implementations in languages such as Scala and Haskell. An operational semantics for a new programming language named Randomized PCF (RPCF), which incorporates random choice, has been designed, and the Miller-Rabin algorithm is implemented within this framework.
