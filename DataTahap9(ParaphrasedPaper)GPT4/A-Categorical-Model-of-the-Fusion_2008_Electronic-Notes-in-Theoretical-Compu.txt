Proposition 4.6's description of BF-bisimulations provides a basis for comparing them to the traditional concepts of fusion bisimulation and hyperbisimulation outlined in Definition 2.2. The elements of Definition 2.2 related to communication actions correspond to parts (i) and (ii) in Proposition 4.6. Furthermore, the requirement pertaining to bound actions in Definition 2.2 is encapsulated in part (ii) of Proposition 4.6 by indicating that processes evolving from bound transitions are related as bisimilar but through a distinct relation, and this occurs in a context where a new name has been introduced.
