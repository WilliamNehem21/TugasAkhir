Petri nets were initially developed as a graphical tool to model concurrent processes and synchronization within distributed systems, with their basic form also recognized as place-transition nets. Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs) build upon place-transition nets by adding timing aspects to the model.

Colored Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (CGSPNs) further extend GSPNs by differentiating tokens with colors, making the places contain multi-sets of tokens distinguished by various colors. Transitions in CGSPNs feature multiple firing modes, which are contingent on the colors of the tokens in their input places, and these transitions modify the composition of tokens in connected places.

To assess whether transitions are ready to execute and how tokens will be disbursed or collected during this action, it is important to note that tagged tokens are restricted to movement along tagged paths, while normal tokens can traverse both tagged and untagged paths. Notwithstanding, tagged tokens are still considered normal tokens when figuring out if a transition is permitted under a certain configuration.

Performance tree queries are represented by a tree structure composed of nodes interconnected by arcs. These nodes serve two primary purposes: as operation nodes executing performance-related functions, such as calculating passage time density, or as value nodes, providing necessary input data like state sets, actions, or specific numeric or Boolean constants. A complete catalog of the operation nodes applicable for performance analysis is available and detailed in the relevant literature.
