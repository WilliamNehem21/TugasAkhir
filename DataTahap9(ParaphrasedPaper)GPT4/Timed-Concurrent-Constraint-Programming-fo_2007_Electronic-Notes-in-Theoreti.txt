Concurrent constraint programming (CCP) is a formalism that manages concurrency by allowing processes to exchange and manipulate partial information through constraints (e.g., x < 42). CCP is regarded as particularly valuable because it successfully integrates an operational perspective common to process calculi with a declarative logic-based approach. Within CCP, processes can be understood both as computational entities and logical formulas, thus leveraging methodologies from both domains. CCP is also a suitable framework for modeling and reasoning about biological systems.

One specific variant of CCP, called the non-deterministic temporal concurrent constraint (ntcc) calculus, provides linear-temporal logic-based techniques for verifying that a process satisfies a property, which is especially useful for biological applications such as gene regulatory network analysis.

Biological systems can be modeled using ntcc as processes and their characteristics as linear-temporal logical statements. This unified approach not only facilitates the description of biological systems but also utilizes powerful reasoning tools for analysis. Moreover, the conversion of theoretical ntcc frameworks into practical software tools is feasible, as demonstrated by a prototype developed by the AVISPA research group.

The paper describes the ntcc process calculus and outlines its utility in modeling and verifying biological systems, with particular focus on the sodium-potassium pump. It provides a biological overview and an ntcc model for the pump, as well as verifies significant properties of this model.

The ntcc calculus includes time operators to model the dynamic aspects of biological systems, like delayed or persistent behaviors. This framework provides a strong basis for both simulation (operational semantics) and logic-based verification, enhancing the understanding and analysis of complex biological mechanisms.

An ntcc model of the sodium-potassium pump details the sequence of events during its operation, from ion binding to phosphorylation and the subsequent cycle steps that maintain ion concentrations within a cell. The paper also demonstrates how ntcc can be used to model disruptions in this process, such as the inhibition caused by a drug, highlighting the flexibility and extensible capabilities of the ntcc framework for biological systems modeling and property verification.
