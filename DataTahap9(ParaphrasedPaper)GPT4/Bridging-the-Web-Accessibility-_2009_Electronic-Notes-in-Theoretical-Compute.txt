The internet has become an essential information resource that we increasingly rely on in our daily lives. We typically access it through visual, graphical browsers which, while user-friendly, often present extraneous information like ads and navigation bars that can distract from the content we seek. Sighted users are adept at quickly identifying and focusing on relevant information but must still navigate through the unnecessary data.

Understanding that relevance is a personalized concept that can shift with each new webpage visited, a system called Dynamo has been developed to assist blind users in accessing web content by treating updates from dynamic and static content uniformly. This includes both scripted changes and those resulting from user actions such as form submissions.

Model-directed transactions further facilitate non-visual web interactions by employing a process model resembling a finite-state automaton. Each state represents a web page containing important concepts, with transitions representing user actions. At any given state of a transaction, the model identifies and presents only the most pertinent information to the user.

The remainder of the paper is structured with a system architecture overview in section 2, techniques for improving web accessibility in section 3, a review of related work in section 4, and concluding remarks in section 5. For experimental setup and user evaluations, references to additional papers are provided.

The system includes a dialog generator that creates VoiceXML dialogs for navigating pages and a dialog interpreter to swiftly move between concept instances. These dialogs are handled by a user interface manager, and the process repeats with user interaction.

One key observation is that semantically related information on a webpage often shares spatial alignment. The DOM tree's layout may indicate semantic connections if nodes are consistently aligned along either the x or y-axis.

Two sets of content are considered similar if their cosine similarity exceeds a predefined threshold, implying no topic change. If the similarity is above this threshold, the sets are merged; otherwise, expansion ceases in that direction.

The system uses a machine-learned SVM model to predict the relevance of content blocks. It computes features for each block by comparing context with block text, then uses the model to classify blocks as relevant or not.

Users are generally interested in changes resulting from their web interactions, regardless of whether the website uses dynamic or static content. Techniques like diff algorithms can highlight differences that matter to users for continuing their tasks efficiently.

The Hearsay system underpins the new implementation, with a Firefox extension communicating to a Java backend. This backend processes web content, generates VoiceXML dialogs, and manages the interface using a custom interpreter.

By using a diff algorithm that performs bipartite matching and max flow routines, the system identifies matching and distinct nodes on webpages.

The content analyzer module extracts relevant concepts by partitioning a webpage into semantically related segments, classifying them using an ontology. This includes analyzing segments based on visual cues and machine learning tools such as SVMs to determine their importance relative to the context of incoming links.

In conclusion, the paper presents three strategies for bridging the accessibility gap for visually impaired users. Context-directed browsing helps mimic the efficient browsing behaviors of sighted users and is also useful for devices with small screens. The Dynamo approach has shown promise in making dynamic web content more accessible. Finally, by offering only relevant page fragments at each step of a model-directed web transaction, the digital divide is reduced, enhancing web accessibility for blind users.
