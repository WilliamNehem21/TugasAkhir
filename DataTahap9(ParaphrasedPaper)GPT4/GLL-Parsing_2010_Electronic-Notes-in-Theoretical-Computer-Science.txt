Recursive descent (RD) parsers are favored because they reflect the grammar's structure, making them intuitive to write and debug. However, they are restricted to parsing a limited set of grammars and cannot handle non-deterministic elements or left recursion without significant drawbacks like excessive backtracking or infinite loops.

Seeking a more universal parsing strategy that keeps the intuitiveness of RD parsers while overcoming their limitations, researchers developed the Generalized LL (GLL) parsing technique. GLL combines the depth and efficiency of RD parsing with the comprehensive nature of Tomita-style RNGLR parsing methods, which can parse all context-free grammars.

GLL parsing algorithms achieve this by employing specialized mechanisms adapted from RNGLR to handle parsing ambiguities. Consequently, GLL parsers can manage even left-recursive grammars and operate within a bound of cubic worst-case time complexity.

The implementation of GLL algorithms can be adapted to common programming constructs. For example, "goto" statements used for control flow can be replaced with a case statement described by Hoare, or even completely substituted with equivalent algorithm lines and loop breaks, thereby avoiding "goto" statements altogether.

In the GLL algorithm, elements are added to a set 'R' only once, making it realizable as either a stack or a queue. If implemented as a stack, the algorithm embodies a depth-first parsing pattern, allowing for efficient processing despite the special handling required for left-recursive calls.

Furthermore, the flexibility of the RNGLR algorithm is used in a space-efficient variant called S-RIGLR, by adjusting which non-terminal instances invoke an automaton callâ€”thus optimizing for execution time versus space.

By applying the GLL framework, parsers become not only feasible to construct but practical in use. They mirror recursive descent parsers by aligning closely with the grammar's structure, and can further be enhanced by adopting Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) grammars. EBNF allows for more sophisticated constructs such as factorization and iteration to increase efficiency.

Although the GLL algorithm in this context serves solely as a recognizer, without directly producing parse trees, it explores all possible derivation paths. Researchers suggest that it can be relatively straightforward to extend the GLL algorithm to generate full parse trees, analogous to Tomita-style Shared Packed Parse Forests (SPPF), by utilizing similar modifications as those used to enhance RNGLR recognizers into fully-fledged parsers.
