The academic paper details a study of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, a stress-tolerant halophyte from the Aizoaceae family. The plant can withstand various environmental stresses, such as salinity, drought, and high temperatures, by modifying its hormonal and transcriptional mechanisms, including switching from C3 to CAM photosynthesis during its lifecycle phases: germinating seedlings, juvenile, adult, flowering, fruiting, and seed formation.

The study examines the plant's habitat, such as salt marsh, sand formation, reed swamp, and fertile non-cultivated land, and observes lower relative humidity and higher evaporation in summer than winter. Salt marshes span the coast and connect with natural lakes, while the sand formations comprise dunes and flats. The study area also has reed swamps in depressions and fertile non-cultivated land with slightly higher soil salinity than adjoining cultivated land.

To analyze soil properties, samples were collected from different locations, dried, sieved, and tested for texture, water holding capacity, porosity, organic carbon, sulphate, and calcium carbonate content. Soil solutions were prepared for each sample to measure electrical conductivity, pH, chlorides, carbonates, and bicarbonates.

Growth parameters of the plant, such as root and shoot weight, plant diameter, leaf area, and the number of flowers and fruits, were measured across different habitats at two-week intervals using established methods.

Vegetation classification and ordination were employed using TWINSPAN and CCA to group species based on importance values and examine relationships between flora and environmental factors. ANOVA and LSD tests analyzed soil data.

Cluster groups exhibited distinct soil properties, with Group C from salt marsh habitats showing the highest sodium levels. Significant correlations were found between variables like calcium carbonate and pH, as well as between chloride, electrical conductivity, sodium, and water holding capacity. These factors also influenced the distribution of M. crystallinum.

Over its growth cycle, the plant's fresh weight increased significantly after six weeks, peaking at 14 weeks before declining as it entered the flowering stage. Root growth was highest in sand flat habitats where it could access water more effectively, while high salinity in salt marsh habitats hindered root growth in later stages as the plant adapted to CAM photosynthesis.

Flowering and seed formation occurred rapidly in response to salt stress in salt marsh habitats, with the plant employing defense mechanisms like osmolyte and antioxidant molecule synthesis. Human activities and other biotic factors threaten the plant's habitat, leading to the recommendation that a protectorate be established along Egypt's deltaic Mediterranean coast to preserve these environments.
