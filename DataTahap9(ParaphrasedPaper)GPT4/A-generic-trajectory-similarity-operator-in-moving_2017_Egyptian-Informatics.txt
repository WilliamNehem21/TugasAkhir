Paraphrasing of the abstract:

The assessment of similarity between the paths of moving objects is crucial for a variety of applications. However, traditional similarity metrics often imply a specific definition of similarity and provide algorithms for determining it. We argue that the concept of similarity should be determined by the user, as it varies depending on the application. This paper introduces a user-defined, parameterizable similarity operator centered on the time-warped edit distance. This flexible operator allows users to establish their own criteria for similarity. We implemented this operator in the Secondo database system and tested it on both synthetic and real-world data. The performance met our expectations, demonstrating its potential utility.

Summary of the paper:

The need to evaluate the similarity between trajectories of moving objects in a trajectory database system (TDBS), focused on historical data, is addressed in this paper. We discuss the limitations of existing similarity measures that usually incorporate an implicit and fixed meaning of similarity. To overcome this, we propose a parameterized similarity operator influenced by the time-warped edit distance methodology. It enables users to define similarity according to their specific requirements. The operator has been implemented in the Secondo system and is evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets. The paper concludes by suggesting future work in devising a similarity measure for continuous trajectory representation, as our operator is currently based on discrete trajectory data.
