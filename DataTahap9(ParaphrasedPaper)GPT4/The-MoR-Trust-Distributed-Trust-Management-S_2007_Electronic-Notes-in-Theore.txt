Mor-Trust is a decentralized peer-to-peer trust management system intended for networks and applications that facilitate quantitative transactions or collaborations. It uniquely quantifies trust using monetary units, directly relating trust levels in the network to the values of transactions and their outcomes. This system has been tested through simulations that demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving accurate trust estimates within the network.

Traditional centralized trust or reputation management systems, like eBay's, benefit from users' trust in the provided reputation information. However, in a decentralized peer-to-peer setting, without a central authoritative entity to manage trust, the system must securely distribute trust information across numerous network nodes. Distributed trust management systems are designed to fulfill this requirement, enhancing node functionality for transaction processes.

Mor-Trust, short for monetary-ratcheted trust, is distinguished by its approach of using monetary units to model trust, linking trust estimates with actual transaction values. This reflects how trust and reputation function in real-world communities, allowing for advanced algorithms for trust estimate calculation, application, and dissemination across the network. The system encourages the gradual build-up of trust through repeated successful transactions, potentially exceeding the value of individual transactions.

The EigenTrust system, as an example within the context, provides distributed computation of global reputation values for peers, based on past interactions. It combines local trust values into a network-wide reputation that reflects an eigenvector of a matrix of these values. To maintain security, trust values are stored by unrelated peers within the network, and an extended version safeguards against collusion.

Alternatively, a distributed reputation framework uses Bayesian methods to gather and disseminate first-hand reputation data among nodes to construct global reputation scores. Yet, this framework does not focus significantly on data management or security aspects.

Mor-Trust also compares with other systems such as P-Grid, which simplifies trust into a binary system and uses peer associations for managing transactions. The TrustMe system is noted for providing anonymity by randomly assigning trust management to peers and utilizing public key mechanisms, although it leans more towards data management rather than the trust model itself.

In Mor-Trust, transaction outcomes are gauged on a scale corresponding to the degree of success from the involved nodes' perspectives, allowing for partial success results as well. The Mor-Trust design takes a hybrid path creation approach for network scanning, ensuring independent and non-overlapping paths, and the path trust estimate is computed recursively using local trust values.

The paper references additional research in reputation-based resource selection in peer-to-peer networks, highlighting the ongoing exploration of reliable and secure trust mechanisms in decentralized systems.
