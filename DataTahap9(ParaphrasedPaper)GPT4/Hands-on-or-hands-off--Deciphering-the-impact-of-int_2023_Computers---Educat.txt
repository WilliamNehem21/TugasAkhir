The academic paper discusses the role of virtual reality (VR) in creating immersive, hands-on learning environments that enable embodied learningâ€”the feeling of owning a virtual body as one's own. Despite VR's potential in enhancing learning through embodiment, the specifics of designing effective VR learning experiences for cognitive improvement remain controversial.

The study investigates the intricate relationship between interactivity and learning in VR, particularly within a procedural learning context. The paper argues that heightened interactivity does not automatically improve learning outcomes; instead, the relevance of VR interactions to the learning tasks and their cognitive demands on learners are critical.

Two studies were conducted to explore different interaction conditions in VR. The first study compared: (C1) a fully interactive environment with real-world analogous interactions and (C2) a condition where students use clicks to initiate pre-recorded task demonstrations. The second study compared: (C3) an environment where students can move freely but only observe animations, and (C4) a fixed-position observation mode.

Key findings include no significant differences in learning outcomes between room-scale (C3) and seated (C4) VR settings. Additionally, non-mirroring interactions (C2) resulted in worse learning outcomes compared to direct, real-world-like interactions (C1). Contrary to the belief that more VR interaction equates to better learning, the study found that observation alone could yield similar learning benefits to interactive experiences.

The paper highlights the first examination of specific interaction features on procedural learning tasks within VR, noting the importance of congruent physical movements with learning content. Insights suggest that while interaction techniques like pointer-based manipulation are common in VR environments, they could be less effective if not congruent with real-life tasks, thus increasing extraneous cognitive load.

Surprisingly, participants who merely observed (C3) performed comparably to those who actively manipulated the environment (C1), suggesting that observation alone can be sufficient for embodied learning in VR. However, the study also observed a wider performance distribution in the C3 group, indicating a consistent performance in the C1 condition.

The study concludes that mere observation in VR might produce similar learning outcomes as active manipulation, leading to a re-evaluation of traditional beliefs about the role of interaction in embodied learning. The results offer essential implications for designing VR learning experiences, emphasizing the need for an optimal level of cognitive challenge and considering the role of multimodal learning analytics in future research.

The limitations of the study included the lack of audio instructions, which some participants preferred over text prompts, and the potential for using multimodal analytics to quantify participant behaviors could have supplemented the findings. Audio prompts, interaction fidelity, and the use of distracting objects in the environment are also considered as factors worth examining in future research on VR learning systems.
