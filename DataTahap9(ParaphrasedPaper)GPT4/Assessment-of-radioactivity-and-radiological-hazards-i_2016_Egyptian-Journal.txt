Ceramic tiles are often chosen for interior decoration because they are both aesthetically pleasing and relatively inexpensive. These tiles can be either glazed or unglazed, with zircon commonly used as an opacifier in the glaze or mixed into the tile's body, particularly in porcelain tiles. Zircon sand naturally contains radionuclides, mainly from the uranium and thorium decay series. Although present in low concentrations, these radionuclides are notably higher than those found in typical rocks and soils. As a result, ceramic tiles with zircon in their glaze may exhibit increased levels of natural radioactivity. Since ceramic tiles are widely used construction materials, evaluating their radiological effects on people is important, focusing on exposure to gamma radiation and the inhalation of radon gas released from the tiles.

Additionally, there is a strong correlation between potassium-40 (40K) and other variables studied, except for thorium-232 (232Th), where the correlation is weak. The strong correlation between uranium-238 (238U) and thorium-232 (232Th) is attributed to the fact that their decay series are commonly found together in nature.
