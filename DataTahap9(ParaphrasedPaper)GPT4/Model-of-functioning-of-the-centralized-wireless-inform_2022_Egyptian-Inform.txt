In developed nations, technological and managerial innovations are critical across various sectors of economic and social activity, particularly as they face increasing risks from environmental, atmospheric, and biological threats. The emergence of COVID-19 has brought significant challenges to innovation systems, demonstrating how interconnected the global and national communities are. National economies leverage innovations to drive economic growth and maintain high living standards, supported by accessible and effective innovation methods such as technology transfer.

In the context of optimizing resource use within communication channels, the researchers have adapted an algorithmic method which shows promise because it doesn't require memorizing a complex matrix; instead, its coefficients are recalculated at each iteration. The mathematical framework developed has revealed that a self-restraint function can be key in managing the efficient use of communication channel resources, prompting further study into determining optimal types and values for variables within this function. The findings, initially tested within a 4G ecosystem, indicate potential applications for understanding competitive interactions between enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) services in the forthcoming 5G ecosystem, which the authors plan to investigate in future research.
