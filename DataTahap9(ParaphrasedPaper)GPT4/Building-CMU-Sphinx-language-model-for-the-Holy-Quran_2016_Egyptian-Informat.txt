The paper explores the effectiveness of utilizing a simplified Arabic phoneme set in developing a speech recognition system for the Quranic Hafs narration. Researchers utilized CMU Sphinx 4 to train and test a language model, opting for simple Arabic phonemes over the conventional Romanized version. Initial results demonstrated a remarkably low word error rate (WER) of 1.5% utilizing a limited audio dataset. However, when the training data was reduced to 90% and 80%, the WER increased to 50.0% and 55.7%, respectively.

The paper is structured into sections that cover the background of Arabic speech recognition challenges, specifically for the Holy Quran, and the novel approach to phoneme simplification. It also outlines the experimental setup and discusses the results which show high accuracy with the simplified phonemes. The presence of various speech challenges, such as elongations in Quranic recitation, are acknowledged.

Notably, the lowest WERs were achieved when all audio was used for both training and testing, which may not reflect the model's performance on new, unseen data. Consequently, additional experiments were conducted with varying amounts of unseen data during training to evaluate the model's robustness. This reveals the trade-offs between model training with comprehensive audio data and the need to validate generalization on new data.

The findings indicate that the simplified phoneme set is promising for accurate Arabic speech recognition within the context of the Hafs narration of the Quran. However, further testing is needed to understand the model's performance in real-world scenarios with audio data not used during training.
