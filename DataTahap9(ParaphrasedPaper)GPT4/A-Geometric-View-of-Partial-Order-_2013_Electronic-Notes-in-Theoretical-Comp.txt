This paper discusses the concept of persistent instructions, which are program steps that do not interfere with other parallel instructions and can thus be assumed to execute first when reducing the complexity of program analysis. Specifically, it demonstrates how an instruction like "x:=1" can be considered persistent, simplifying the program to fewer possible execution paths for more efficient verification. This method is part of a technique known as partial order reduction (POR), which has been implemented in tools like SPIN to improve deadlock detection, with potential applications in full reachability that will be explored in future studies. These tools have originally focused on deadlock detection in acyclic systems, a common focus for POR techniques.

The academic paper aims to explore the relationship between persistent sets, used in POR, and inessential paths, a geometrical concept, which has not been formally explored before. The goal is to leverage both partial order reduction and geometric techniques to address the state-space explosion problem in computer science.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 reviews computational models for formalizing persistent sets, specifically labeled transition systems with independence (LTSI), and their generalization into asynchronous transition systems (ATS). Section 2 extends the notion of persistent sets from LTSI to ATS and demonstrates their ability to reduce the search space in deadlock detection. Section 3 establishes a conceptual link between POR and directed algebraic topology, showing that persistent transitions can be considered the algebraic equivalent of inessential paths.

The paper concludes that the extension of persistent sets to ATS matches the original concept on LTSI, maintaining their utility in reducing search space for deadlock detection. It emphasizes that the at hand investigation applies to ATS derived from LTSI, with specific conditions on the transitions involved. Through a conservative extension of the concept and theoretical comparisons, the paper seeks to enhance the understanding and application of POR in the context of algebraic and geometric modeling.
