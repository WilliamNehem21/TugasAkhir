Digital Twins (DTs) are becoming essential in the manufacturing industry, offering the potential to optimize processes and products through accurate predictions. These virtual representations can simulate machinery, production lines, or any aspect of the manufacturing process, making them useful not only for planning and design but also for maintenance and market analysis.

To offer a fully integrated digital platform, both software and hardware aspects need to be incorporated. The DigitBrain project, specifically, emphasizes a device-agnostic framework that employs a cryptographic library for verification. The paper focuses on models as separate, reusable entities within this project.

Building DTs is typically labor-intensive, often requiring individualized construction without leveraging existing models. The work described in this paper aims to address this by categorizing models and attaching detailed metadata to foster their reusability.

These models, developed into co-simulation units by model developers, facilitate the co-simulation of composite systems by standardizing component interaction. As these systems often involve diverse components from various suppliers, protecting intellectual property is crucial.

From a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) viewpoint, the output of one process can serve as the input to another, with processes being the fundamental units for evaluation. By applying characterization factors, the environmental impacts of a system can be assessed using Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data.

The DigitBrain project supports the use of integrated 3D and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models to simulate system behavior over time with events advancing simulation time in discrete steps. These simulations can provide performance statistics for the modeled conditions, aided by a visual development environment for editing prototypes and models.

Efficient creation of DTs relies on the reuse of existing components. The DigitBrain ecosystem promotes reuse by decomposing DTs into data, models, and algorithms, and by storing metadata in a platform that facilitates the creation of DTs through this data-model-algorithm structure.

A major challenge addressed by DigitBrain is model characterization to enable efficient model reuse. The asset metadata registry stores comprehensive metadata of all assets to aid in model discovery and ensure proper integration with the selected algorithm during execution.

The paper also acknowledges the significance of popular machine learning (ML) frameworks and portability standards like ONNX and TensorFlow's SavedModel format, which support the exchange and deployment of ML models across devices.

In particular, the DDDSimulator tool, used for system-of-system (SoS) analysis, enables users to design and evaluate new layouts using reusable modules, which can then be uploaded and simulated on the DigitBrain platform to assess different production scenarios.

The paper concludes with a brief overview of the authors' backgrounds, highlighting their diverse expertise and contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, digital twins, and sustainable manufacturing.
