The study demonstrates that the problem of model checking for (weakly extended) process rewrite systems, with respect to properties expressed by LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formulas featuring the strict eventually and strict always temporal operators, is solvable. An open question mentioned in the same research is whether this solvability is maintained when the property set is expanded to include past equivalents of these operators. The present paper responds affirmatively to this query, establishing that the problem is indeed decidable with these extended temporal properties.
