The paper introduces the Maude Termination Tool (MTT) version 1.5, designed to determine whether Maude programs will terminate. MTT utilizes a variety of transformation strategies and integrates several external termination analysis tools that support the TPDB syntax. These external tools can be linked either locally, in accordance with the termination competition's protocol, or accessed remotely via web services. This compatibility with different tools, such as AProVE, MU-TERM, TTT, and more, allows users to have a uniform experience and choose the most suitable tool for each specific task without limitations.

MTT offers the functionality to validate the termination of Maude specifications by converting them into forms that are compatible with existing formal analyzers. For example, a sugared rewrite theory (SRWT) may be transformed into a context-sensitive term rewrite theory (CS-TRS) and then be subjected to analysis by tools like AProVE and MU-TERM. Different transformation pathways are available. For instance, a context-sensitive membership conditional term rewriting system (CS-MCTRS) can be converted into a context-sensitive conditional term rewriting system (CS-CTRS) using a transformation that might be complete or might simplify by discarding sort information. Alternatively, it could be transformed into a context-sensitive order-sorted conditional term rewriting system (CS-OSCTRS) through a different transformation marked 'OS'. These transformation options provide flexibility, allowing users to apply various analytical tools and methods to ensure termination proof for Maude specifications across different scenarios.
