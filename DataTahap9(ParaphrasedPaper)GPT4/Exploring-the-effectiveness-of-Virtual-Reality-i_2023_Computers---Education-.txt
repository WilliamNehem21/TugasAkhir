The academic paper discusses the under-explored area of using virtual reality (VR) technology for teaching Maltese, a minor language, as a second language (ML2). To investigate VR's potential in language learning, the research used a mixed-methods approach, comprising both qualitative (focus group) and quantitative (online survey) elements, involving 25 Maltese teachers. Findings suggest that younger educators are more convinced of VR's educational benefits, and while VR presents engaging and immersive learning experiences, practical issues such as cost, cumbersome equipment, and technical difficulties pose challenges. Currently, VR is not utilized in teaching Maltese, but the study suggests its potential and calls for the development of tailored VR applications for Maltese language learning.

VR's capability for creating realistic scenarios that foster active learning is seen as advantageous for language acquisition, especially amid physical travel restrictions, like those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through VR, learners can improve nonverbal communication skills and gain confidence in language use without the fear of judgment. The accessibility and ability to connect remote learners make VR a promising tool in language education. Interactive activities, authentic practice, and cultural immersion are highlighted as key benefits of VR in language learning.

The academic paper provides evidence supporting VR's effectiveness in education and suggests its potential application for ML2 learning. While participants indicated a positive outlook on VR's role in language teaching, the study's limitations, such as the small sample size and the participants' lack of direct classroom experience with VR, are acknowledged. To maximize VR's potential in Maltese language learning, further research and development of VR resources are needed, and potential health concerns related to VR use should be addressed through safe practices.
