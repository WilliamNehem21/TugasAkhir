The increasing utilization of biomass is attributed to its status as a renewable energy source and a widely accepted alternative to fossil fuels. Biomass consists of organic materials like wood chips, sawdust, and agricultural by-products from factories, including rice husks, straw, bagasse, and various shells from sugarcane, palm kernels, and coconuts. To enhance their value, these agro-industrial wastes are converted into biomass pellets. Preferred for their lower moisture content, higher density, and uniformity, these pellets offer ease of storage, handling, and transportation due to their grain-like flow properties.

Reflectance values of biomass pellets (r_sample) are measured against a dark background (r_dark) and a white acrylic sheet standard (r_white). r_dark is obtained with the light off, and r_white is captured by scanning a Teflon whiteboard, assisting in building a density prediction model.

The optimal prediction model is sought by comparing various spectral pre-treatments and variable selection methods including the correlation, variance, covariance, successive projections algorithm (SPA), and genetic algorithm (GA). Variables selected through these methods are evaluated before and after pre-treatment of spectral data, including the raw spectrum, its first and second derivatives, and standard normal variate transformations. The comparison of performance across different models ultimately identifies the most effective one.

Correlation-based methods ascertain variable importance by measuring the direct association of absorbance values (X) with the feature of interest, true density (Y). Meanwhile, genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with partial least squares (PLS) regression is advantageous, offering a blend of GA’s optimal feature selection and PLS’s ability to maximize covariance between absorbance and measured values.

The model's efficacy is determined by its R-squared (R²) and the ratio of the performance to deviation (RPD) values; R² between 0.81 to 0.90 and RPD between 2.5 to 3 signify good predictive quality. Models with R² from 0.66 to 0.80 and RPD from 2.0 to 2.5 are considered approximate, whereas R² below 0.66 and RPD below 2 indicate poor predictions.

In a model with excellent performance, as indicated by these metrics, the relative standard error of prediction (RSEP) shows that the prediction errors are on average 6.40% of the reference value, underscoring the model's capacity as a reliable tool for quality measurement.
