In a more concise and paraphrased form:

The academic paper discusses how tactics in theorem proving can break down a goal into smaller subgoals, which are approached recursively through the use of other tactics or by the tactics themselves. The static structure of how these tactics are called is referred to as the call graph, which becomes dynamic during the actual problem-solving, taking the form of a tree representing the series of tactic calls made. This dynamic structure varies, depending on the goal it is applied to, and can involve redundant branches that don't contribute to the final proof.

Users can interact with tactical theorem provers in two ways. Firstly, they may select high-level tactics and rely on the system to manage the specifics. Alternatively, users may intervene when an automatic tactic stalls, offering detailed guidance before allowing the tactic to resume. Currently, theorem provers don't offer a seamless way to resume tactics after user intervention without altering tactic code.

The paper introduces a technique that improves user interaction by using computation traces to allow users to intervene and then resume a tactic without starting it over from scratch. This trace-driven approach enables users to suggest changes mid-execution and then allow the original tactic to continue, avoiding repetition of already completed search efforts.

The document provides an example using rippling, a technique related to inductive proofs, demonstrating how their proposed system allows for user intervention and continuation without the need to alter the existing code of tactics.

In summary, the paper presents a new method for combining automated theorem proving with user interaction. It suggests a way of enabling users to guide the theorem prover mid-execution and discusses potential applications for this technique, such as employing derivational analogy within tactical theorem provers for more complex forms of problem-solving and adaptation.
