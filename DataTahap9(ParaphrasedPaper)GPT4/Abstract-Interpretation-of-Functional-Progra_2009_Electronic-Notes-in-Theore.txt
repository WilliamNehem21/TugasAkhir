The paper introduces an algorithm for abstract interpretation applicable to an intermediate language during the compilation process in a Haskell compiler (which is also written in Haskell). This algorithm aims to estimate the potential values of all variables in the program, providing valuable information for optimizing the generated object code. It functions by collecting constraints associated with the variables and resolving these constraints through a process of fixpoint iteration. As the analysis progresses, the set of constraints expands because the possible values for functions that were previously undefined become clearer.

This constraint collection is done by adding to the abstract syntax tree with an attribute grammar-based preprocessor, which is designed specifically for Haskell. The paper contains an introduction to this preprocessor as one of its goals. Notably, during the execution process, rather than using the naive approach of a function reference being a tag, a more efficient encoding is used where the tag is a pointer to the function's code, as suggested by Peyton Jones and others. This is beneficial for modern pipelined processors, although Boquist has suggested reverting to the naive approach to avoid certain overheads.

Global control flow analysis is deployed to determine the possible tags for each closure, informing decisions about code pruning. The paper presents a comprehensive implementation of this algorithm as part of an experimental Haskell compiler, and for greater detail, references an accompanying technical report.

The paper's presentation is hands-on, showcasing the actual code that embodies the implementation. An attribute grammar preprocessor for Haskell is utilized to allow for the expression of concepts from attribute grammars, making the code succinct enough to be presented almost entirely. Moreover, the paper includes a discussion on this preprocessor to maintain self-sufficiency.

Key features of the preprocessor are discussed, including the definition of the abstract syntax in a syntax declaration that simplifies Haskell data declarations, as well as the automatic copying of attributes to reduce redundancy in the code.

Further, the paper defines the data types and operations of GRIN, an intermediate language utilized for program representation, which includes various values such as integers, tags, nodes, pointers, and the empty value, as well as operations like store, fetchupdate, call, eval, and apply.

Lastly, the paper describes an abstraction interpretation algorithm that iterates over a syntax tree representing the GRIN program, collecting constraints and defining an abstract domain. The output from the abstract interpretation is intended to inform optimizations such as the inlining of eval and apply expressions to convert indirect jumps to a reasonable number of direct branches within the compiler. The authors note, however, that not all optimization transformations in the compilation pipeline have been implemented, and thus the full impact of these optimizations has yet to be determined.
