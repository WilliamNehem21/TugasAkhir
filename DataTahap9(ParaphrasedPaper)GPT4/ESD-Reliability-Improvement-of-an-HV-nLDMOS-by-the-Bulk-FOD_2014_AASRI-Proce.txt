The paper presents a study on the enhancement of Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) reliability for 60V NLDMOS (n-type Lateral Diffused Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) devices through the incorporation of Field Oxide Devices (FODs) in the bulk side. By adding FOD structures in the bulk area, the devices showed a significant improvement in anti-ESD capabilities. Specifically, the second breakdown current (IT2) values increased by about 1.12% to 111.74% compared to the reference devices without FODs. However, the authors emphasized the importance of monitoring the trigger voltage to ensure it doesn't drop below the operational voltage of the device, which is 60V, as the area occupied by the FOD structure increases. The paper indicates that while FOD structures can greatly improve ESD protection, there is a trade-off that involves managing the maximum allowable area for the FOD structures to avoid affecting the device's normal operating conditions.
