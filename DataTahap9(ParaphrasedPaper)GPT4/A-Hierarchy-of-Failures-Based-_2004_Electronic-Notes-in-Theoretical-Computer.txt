In Section 6, we conclude with a review of literature relevant to our work. Throughout the paper, key proofs are integrated into the main text to enhance understanding of the established results. Other proofs are provided in the appendix for reference.

In Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), a process defines a communication pattern that reflects the behavior of a system. This language can model a variety of systems, including individual machinery, networks, and protocols. It allows for the combination of simple elements to form complex processes. System behavior is conveyed through a sequence of events or synchronized communications that indicate the system's progression.

Our research first verifies that it is feasible to encode models with predicates that are either increasing or decreasing, a characteristic observed in all the specific models examined in this paper. In Section 5.3, we demonstrate a similar finding for more general cases and go on to discuss the practical implications of our methodology. Detailed proofs are located in the appendix for thorough examination.

Another study complements our research by delving into practical applications. It identifies and provides rationale for non-conventional measures of consistency. Ensuring consistency within these measures is akin to a refinement within the models discussed in our paper. This paves the way for automated verification utilizing existing tools.
