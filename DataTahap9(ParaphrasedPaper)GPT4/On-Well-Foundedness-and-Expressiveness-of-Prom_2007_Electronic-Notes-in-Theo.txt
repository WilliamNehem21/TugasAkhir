In this study, the authors address two unresolved issues identified by Karen L. Bernstein in relation to her advanced TYFT format for structured operational semantics. The paper explores the necessity of the well-foundedness condition for preserving congruence in the promoted TYFT format, highlighting that this assumption is not dispensable as is the case for other formats like the original TYFT format that use closed terms as labels for transitions. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that the well-founded promoted TYFT format and the original TYFT format have different capacities for specifying transition relations; they are not directly comparable, with each format capable of specifying some transition relations that the other cannot.

The promoted TYFT format, introduced by Bernstein, provides an effective framework for defining operational semantics for higher-order processes. Using this format, Bernstein established that well-founded promoted TYFT ensures that strong bisimilarity is a congruence, and provided semantics for the lazy lambda-calculus and CHOCs through this format, proving that applicative bisimilarity for the lazy lambda-calculus and strong bisimilarity for CHOCs are congruences.

This academic paper is structured as follows:

- Section 2 offers basic definitions pertinent to the discussion.
- Section 3 discusses the concept of well-foundedness in relation to the promoted TYFT format and evidences the necessity of maintaining this assumption.
- Section 4 compares the expressiveness of the promoted TYFT format with the original TYFT format, revealing their incomparability.
- The paper concludes with Section 5.

An additional focus of this paper is on a variant of the TYFT format that uses constants instead of closed terms as labels. This variant is examined and contrasted with the promoted TYFT format in Section 4. It's suggested that this constant-based variant might represent the original TYFT format as initially defined, with the extension to closed terms as labels being a safe and orthogonal generalization that doesn't impact existing results related to congruence and other properties.

The paper emphasizes that the set of arguments for transition labels under volatile operators should be flexible, allowing replacement with bisimilar terms. This means that if there's a transition labeled with a volatile operator, another transition should theoretically be possible with bisimilar arguments under the same volatile operator and adhere to bisimilarity principles.
