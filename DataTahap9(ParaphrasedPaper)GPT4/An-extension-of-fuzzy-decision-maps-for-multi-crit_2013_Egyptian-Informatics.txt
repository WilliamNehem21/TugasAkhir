The paper introduces an advancement in fuzzy decision maps (FDMs) known as Linguistic Fuzzy Decision Networks (LFDNs), incorporating fuzzy linguistic values for representing the importance of criteria and their relative influence in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Unlike traditional FDMs, LFDNs embrace the complexity and uncertainty in real-world decisions by using linguistic variables instead of precise numerical values, thereby providing more flexibility to decision-makers.

Historically, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and its successor, the Analytic Network Process (ANP), have been popular for MCDM due to their simplicity. However, they have limitations in dealing with dependent criteria and feedback, which the ANP sought to address. Fuzzy set theory, proposed by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965, offers a means to handle uncertainty and vague information through fuzzy values.

The paper elaborates on the application of fuzzy numbers and linguistic variables, discusses the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) approach, and then presents the original FDM methodology before introducing the proposed LFDN approach. Through a case study comparison with FDM, LFDNs demonstrate the ability to yield consistent decision outcomes while accommodating a more realistic and humanized decision environment.

The paper concludes that LFDNs represent a significant enhancement of FDMs, effectively addressing the inherent complexities and uncertainties in decision-making by leveraging the power of fuzzy set theory and linguistic values to better mirror human reasoning processes in MCDM scenarios.
