This study addresses the critical need for early detection of invertebrate pests on crops to facilitate timely and effective pest management. Typically, traps are set and then inspected by experts who classify and count pests to gauge infestation levels. This process is slow, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Advances in computer vision and machine learning have paved the way for semi-automatic pest detection, but the decision-making based on lab or trap data often comes too late for optimal pest management.

The research explores the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect pests directly on crops in the field, enabling real-time decision-making. The researchers assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this purpose and developed a standard training pipeline. Due to the difficulty of compiling comprehensive training data rapidly, they innovated by creating a virtual database to train a deep residual CNN. This model achieved a 97.8% accuracy rate in identifying four pest species in agricultural settings, demonstrating potential for real-time, on-site pest detection through robotic systems.

The study addresses the significant economic impact of invertebrate pests on agriculture, highlighting how they can damage crops, disrupt photosynthesis, and introduce diseases. In Australia's major grain crops alone, invertebrate pests cause an estimated annual loss of AUD 359.8 million. While biological and chemical pest control methods exist, they must be used judiciously due to risks like pesticide resistance, environmental harm, and unintended effects on beneficial organisms.

Early pest detection offers several advantages: accurate timing of crop infestation, precise location information, and species identification, which in turn can guide robotic systems to perform actions like selective spraying. These capabilities could also feed into integrated pest management (IPM) systems for optimal decision-making.

In the study, a ten-class database is assembled to test modern CNNs' performance in pest classification and to establish a standard training procedure. Additionally, a five-class database optimized using virtually generated images is created to train a more accurate model. Two models, M10C and M5C, derived from different databases, were field-tested with real-world images captured on smartphones under various conditions, including different illumination and complex backgrounds. The results help to validate the approach of using computer vision technologies for real-time pest detection on crops.
