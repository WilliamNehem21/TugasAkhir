The central concept of a time-dependent network is that the delay of a link changes based on when it's used, relevant to situations like internet data traffic or automobile traffic. Delays depend on the previous path taken to a link, which complicates the shortest path problem, although some specific cases may be solved quickly. Time-dependent networks have been studied before, and our approach is aligned with existing heuristic methods to compute optimal itineraries, such as those used for Germany's rail system, and might enable more extensive or detailed network analyses.

We conjecture that massive networks may allow precomputed queries stored on hard disks as an efficient alternative to algorithmic on-the-fly computations, assuming the network's size is manageable. Our work considers time as an ordered set, such as real numbers or integers, with assumed operations like addition.

However, our definitions have limitationsâ€”station transfers and alternative transport modes, like walking, aren't differentiated. A more detailed model involving explicit edges for valid train transfers could resolve this, but at the expense of more complexity. We introduce time-dependent network terminology and confirm the viability of an algorithm for the fastest path in the specified context, not considering more complicated networks that allow negative delays or non-monotonic delay functions.

We examine "earliest arrival" and "latest departure" problems without presuming addition in our time set. Potential optimization techniques, like the use of heuristics based on geographic distance to the destination, have been highlighted to reduce graph size during computations. Additionally, we discuss the feasibility of using specialized priority queues and the prospects of modular link-traversal procedures to compute travel times efficiently.

Several space and time optimization strategies are discussed, such as organizing station events in arrays with primary and secondary entries to minimize memory use. Yet, the most rapid theoretical algorithms may not perform best in practice due to factors like cache-related delays on actual hardware.

We suggest using a persistent linked list to store upcoming events, improving the method described earlier and supporting cache-efficient graph exploration. Lastly, we discuss the impracticality of instantaneous train transfers in our model and propose extensions to include walking times at stations or the use of virtual platforms to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios.
