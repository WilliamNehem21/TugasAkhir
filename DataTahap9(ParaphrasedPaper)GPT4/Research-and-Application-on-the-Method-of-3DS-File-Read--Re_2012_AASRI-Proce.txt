The article examines the implementation of 3D models in OpenGL using the 3DS file format, finding that OpenGL is an effective tool for rendering basic geometric shapes but less suitable for creating complex models, such as those with curves or bevels, which are more easily constructed in 3DS Max. The study describes a method to read, render, and control 3DS model files by first breaking down the 3DS file structure and interpreting it into a usable data structure in OpenGL. The parsing process involves recursively reading the file, which is segmented into chunks, each with an ID and length header followed by the main data.

The paper outlines the reading of file data, explaining that it is stored in a little-endian format, and proposes a technique for handling the difference in coordinate systems between OpenGL and 3DS Max by swapping the Y and Z coordinates upon data input. This allows for more efficient rendering.

Furthermore, the study discusses the implementation of interactive model control within OpenGL through geometric transformations—translation, rotation, and scaling—and the use of OpenGL's selection mechanism.

Finally, the paper concludes by demonstrating the application of these methods in a simulated system for borehole operations and drilling, reporting positive outcomes from the integration of the aforementioned techniques.
