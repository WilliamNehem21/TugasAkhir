The paper describes how subjective logic is employed within an intelligent coffee corner environment at a research institute to improve authentication practices. A user at the coffee corner can authenticate themselves with identity tokens and, depending on the quantity and quality of these tokens, they can view the whereabouts of colleagues on a wall screen.

The main sections of the paper are outlined as follows:

1. Section 2 explores enhancing authentication using contextual data and trust influenced by the context.
2. Section 3 revisits the fundamentals of subjective logic.
3. Section 4 demonstrates how to compute trust with different location information sources.
4. Section 5 outlines how to apply the framework into a practical sensors model.
5. Section 6 discusses the outcomes of simulations that were run to verify the location-based trust algorithm.
6. Section 7 presents work related to the topic.
7. Section 8 concludes the paper and suggests areas for future research.

The paper acknowledges the extensive research on distributed authentication but focuses specifically on the enhancement that context and trust based on context can provide to traditional authentication mechanisms.

Instead of utilizing probability theory, the authors favor belief theory for developing a scalable general-purpose sensor fusion algorithm. This algorithm can integrate data from an increasing number of sensors and can be adapted to other types of contextual data beyond location.

Simulations have shown that the trend of trust aligns with theoretical expectations. As a result, the authors are implementing the trust algorithm into an office application that allows users to see the location of their colleagues based on their authentication level. The current authentication process relies on recognizing personal devices presumed to be owned by the user (such as PDAs, badges, laptops, Bluetooth devices, RFID). This approach helps prevent unauthorized access, such as someone else using another user's badge or occupying their desk when the user is temporarily gone.
