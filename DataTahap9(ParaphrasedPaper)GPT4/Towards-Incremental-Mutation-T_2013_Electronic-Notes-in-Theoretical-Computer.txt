This academic paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a concise overview of mutation testing principles and delineates the challenges impeding its broader application. Section 3 offers a detailed explanation of incremental mutation testing and confirms its logical soundness. Proceeding to Section 4, the authors describe a practical implementation of Incremental Mutation Testing and their preliminary findings on its effectiveness. In Section 5, the paper reviews existing literature relevant to the topic, and Section 6 summarizes the findings and outlines future research directions.

Further assumptions made within the paper specify that for the combination of two programs, mutation operations are applied separately to each segment, excluding any changes that span the entirety. This assumption permits independent proof concerning subparts. An experimental setup is outlined where traditional mutation testing is contrasted with incremental mutation testing across three scenarios, with different code versions (v1 and v2, where v2 is the later version). Metrics such as the number of mutants generated, the number of mutants killed, and the execution time (inclusive of static analysis for test selection) are recorded and compared for both testing methods.

Moreover, the paper mentions JUnitMax 8, which is akin to incremental mutation testing in the sense that it provides continual, manageable, quality feedback to developers as code changes. It highlights how symbolic execution and automatic static code analysis, despite being valuable, face scalability challenges. The paper references previous attempts to mitigate these challenges by embracing the incremental nature of software development, an approach that also inspires the optimization of mutation testing described in the paper. The ultimate goal is to enhance the efficiency of mutation testing and to provide developers with more immediate feedback on their work.
