Techniques such as transfer learning and active learning can be utilized to predict molecular characteristics or discover new compounds even with limited data availability. Transfer learning leverages data from similar prediction tasks to enhance modeling, while active learning focuses on creating predictive models using a small but significant subset of informative training examples. In the field of medicinal chemistry, these methods are especially useful for studying new targets linked to promising disease biology where compound data is scarce. Overall, there is a significant opportunity for continued computational advancement that can provide practical benefits in medicinal chemistry.
