The academic paper discusses the increasing interest in the control of vehicle platoons in intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs), which holds the promise of reducing fuel consumption and improving the efficiency of transportation systems. Despite progress in developing platoon control strategies, there are significant practical challenges, particularly regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Secure communication via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks is crucial as it can be targeted by cyberattacks, which undermines traditional platoon control methods not designed with security as a priority.

The paper specifically addresses the issue of "Byzantine attacks," where one or several vehicles intentionally send false data within the ICV network, which can disrupt platoon coordination and lead to accidents. Therefore, there is a need for control algorithms and detection mechanisms that can counteract such malicious behaviors to ensure safety and security within these systems.

To face these challenges, the authors propose a resilient distributed model predictive platoon control (RDMP2C) for ICVs with constraints. This system enables vehicles to detect and counteract malicious information, ensuring platoon control objectives are met despite potential cyber threats. The proposed approach combines optimal control with distributed model predictive control (DMPC) optimization to achieve excellent control performance and adherence to constraints.

The RDMP2C algorithm is designed to guarantee recursive feasibility and the stability of the closed-loop ICV system, even in the face of Byzantine attacks. This method addresses the triplet of cybersecurity, operational constraints, and control performance challenges in a unified manner, which is a novel contribution to the field.

The paper is structured as follows: after an introduction, it establishes the basics and formulates the problem of resilient platoon control, presents distributed detection algorithms for Byzantine attacks, suggests the RDMP2C framework, proves the theoretical properties of their approach, and finally provides simulation results. The authors also discuss the concept of achieving a balance between optimality and constraint satisfaction in ICV control, as well as the importance of ensuring safety and rational behavior in the evolution of autonomous driving strategies.

In conclusion, the paper presents a novel RDMP2C framework for improving the security and functionality of platoon systems in ICVs under attack. The study leaves open several future research directions, suggesting the framework's extension to different scenarios, including more complex and dynamic communication networks, and the potential application of advanced machine learning techniques for enhanced cyberattack detection.
