This paper proposes an innovative method for sorting corn kernels that might be in contact with each other and mixed with impurities or defective kernels. It introduces a two-stage solution where the first stage applies a cutting-edge segmentation network which is trained on generated synthetic images. This network is able to separate clusters of instances in an image. In the second stage, a specially designed, compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifies each kernel into one of three categories: good, defective, or impurity.

The segmentation phase benefits from a training protocol that does away with the laborious and error-prone manual labeling of data. Meanwile, the personalized CNN structure is intentionally minimalistic. By having only a select number of layers, it achieves a balance of performance and lightweight design suitable for integrated systems.

Experimental evaluations demonstrate improvements in both classification accuracy and processing speed when compared to existing methods. The tool can be customized for different types of cereals, pointing to its versatility.

The article also reviews relevant research on crop kernel segmentation and classification. It discusses the traditional manual quality analysis, the current state-of-the-art techniques, and the common challenges, such as the need for non-overlapping kernels in the imaging process, sensitivity to lighting conditions, and reliance on extensive preprocessing.

A novel data generation process is explained where three categories of corn kernel samples are manually prepared, imaged, and augmented digitally to optimize training efficiency and convergence. The authors point out that their approach uses significantly fewer parameters in its neural network compared to other leading models without compromising results. 

Looking forward, they aim to refine their approach by developing their own segmentation models for further lightweight architectures and extending the applicability of their method to other grain types.
