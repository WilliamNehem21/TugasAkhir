The academic paper emphasizes that the energy consumption within Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is greatly influenced by both the network's structure and the communication protocols employed by the nodes. The paper advocates the use of hierarchical network structures, such as clustering, to enhance energy efficiency and reliability.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 examines relevant existing literature. Section 3 discusses the benefits of the Scalable Genetic Algorithm (SGA) in reducing both operational and communication costs. Additionally, it examines the processes involved in the Improved Multi-objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (IMOWCA) and introduces the Basestation Genetic Algorithm (BGA), which optimizes basestation placement for balanced energy consumption in clusters. Section 4 presents numerical results, comparative analyses, and performance evaluations of the proposed algorithms before concluding the paper and suggesting future research directions.

The paper references a critical 2014 survey on WSN algorithms, documenting important clustering approaches. It reviews multiple hierarchical clustering protocols like LEACH, HEED, TEEN, APTEEN, and EECS. Specific emphasis is given to advancements in LEACH, and neural network-based clustering tactics are considered. It also incorporates a game-theoretic approach to assigning transmission loads in WSNs, particularly focusing on a cluster-based and surveillance-specific sensor network.

The paper mentions a generational approach for evolving populations in simulations, selecting a stopping criterion of e=0.0001 as an evaluation step after several simulations.

Regarding the BGA algorithm, it stands out due to the genetic algorithms' sophisticated techniques, providing a broader search scope for solutions beyond the vicinity of an initial solution, unlike the Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA), which is limited by the initial choice. BGA leverages selection, crossover, and potential mutations to improve potential solutions within the population.

IMOWCA algorithm distinguishes itself by incorporating diverse metrics—namely, mission cost, communication cost, and sensor-to-basestation distances—into the optimization process. The use of multi-objective optimization and selective clustering ensures energy-efficient communication in WSNs by relegating transmission duties to the most power-capable sensors.
