In this study, we introduce a new approximation method for the analysis of models without altering the state space, such as reducing or aggregating it. Our approach simplifies the analysis by assuming transient probabilities are in product form, enabling a more manageable representation of these probabilities and the analysis of systems with otherwise impractically large state spaces.

The most closely related work to our method established a condition for achieving transient product form in a network of Markovian queues; specifically, the network must consist of queues with an infinite number of servers. Since not all reaction networks can be equated to such queueing networks, the product-form assumption is not universally applicable. However, our numerical experiments suggest that the closer a reaction network resembles an infinite server queueing network, the more accurate our approximation method is.

The structure of our paper is as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the systems of reactions under consideration. In Section 3, we present our approximation technique. Section 4 discusses the properties of this approximation. Section 5 offers numerical examples to demonstrate the technique, and Section 6 presents our conclusions.

We developed a product form approximation for transient probabilities in Markov chains that model reaction networks. The method's computational effort increases only linearly with the number of reactants, making it suitable for analyzing reaction networks where exact analysis is not feasible. Upon testing the method on various examples, we concluded that it provides a reasonably accurate portrayal of the variability and distribution of reactant quantities when the average system behavior is well represented by a mean-field approach or when the transient system behavior closely resembles a product form.
