In this paper, the authors address the issue that manipulating map expressions algebraically is counterintuitive for humans, as it tends to be more suited to machine processing rather than manual manipulation. However, when maps are represented via labeled graphs, individuals find it significantly easier to conceptualize and manipulate the information, as this method abstracts away unnecessary details and provides a visually intuitive approach to understanding map specifications. This approach has been suggested in several previous works.

The authors then describe their initial steps in creating an automated system to facilitate visual reasoning with maps. To achieve this, they utilize Algebraic Graph Grammar (AGG), which offers a visual programming environment tailored for applications that involve the transformation of graphs. In AGG, applications are structured through graph grammars consisting of an initial graph and a set of rules for rewriting graphs. AGG allows users to visually engage with both the starting graph and the rewriting rules, and after formalizing the graph grammar, it facilitates the manipulation of the starting graph.

The paper assumes a particular form of logical expression, consisting of a conjunction of atoms with quantified and free variables. Here, variables represent elements of the domain, while 'p' represents a map expression. The applicability of graph transformation rules depends on whether 'p' is replaced by specific expressions such as the intersection (p1âˆ©p2), composition (p1;p2), or other operations. These replacements are checked through Java methods, and the same methods are used to extract the individual map expressions p1 and p2.

In conclusion, the authors report on their initial endeavor to implement graphical methods for representing and reasoning about maps. They suggest that future work could include developing a more advanced proof assistant that could offer features like backtracking and recommending the most appropriate rule to apply. They view the implementation of such features as the first steps towards creating an automated tool for map reasoning based on graph transformation techniques.
