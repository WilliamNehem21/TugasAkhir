The paper describes an energy-efficient variant of the Fisheye State Routing (FSR) algorithm, termed Energy-Aware Fisheye State Routing (EA-FSR), which prioritizes energy conservation in sensors. Section 2 details the FSR algorithm, Section 3 explains the proposed EA-FSR, Section 4 covers the simulation settings, key parameters, and Section 5 presents the results. The paper concludes with Section 6, summarizing findings and future research directions.

Energy consumption in sensor nodes is crucial for network lifespan, as it impacts tasks including communication, computation, and sensing â€“ with communication being the most energy-intensive. By selecting routes based on nodes' remaining energy, routing protocols can enhance network energy efficiency and longevity. The challenge of energy imbalance and "energy holes" suggests the need for improved path selection methods.

The EA-FSR algorithm addresses this issue by choosing nodes for packet forwarding based on their residual energy rather than proximity, seeking out nodes with higher energy. Simulation results demonstrate that EA-FSR increases the mobility of sensor nodes, enhancing network throughput while slightly raising delay and jitter. Despite increasing network lifetime and decreasing overall energy use by roughly 12%, the algorithm contributes to higher end-to-end delay.

For future improvements, EA-FSR could incorporate optimization techniques like swarm intelligence to reduce energy usage and control overhead. Further analyses might explore the protocol's response to topological changes, duty cycle adjustments, and real-world conditions.
