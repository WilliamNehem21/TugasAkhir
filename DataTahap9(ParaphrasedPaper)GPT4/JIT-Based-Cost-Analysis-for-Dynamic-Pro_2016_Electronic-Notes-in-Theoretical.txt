This paper details the creation and practical implementation of a system for capturing just-in-time (JIT) trace data from the Pycket JIT compiler. It proposes three different cost models that can evaluate the run-time efficiency of Pycket traces, which are validated and calibrated using linear regression on benchmarks. This approach enables accurate predictions of the performance impact of code transformations.

Key achievements include:
1. Developing a system to obtain JIT trace information from the Pycket JIT compiler.
2. Introducing three cost models that vary in complexity and using regression to optimize the parameters for these models.
3. Demonstrating the precision of these models in forecasting the execution times of code alterations.

JIT compilation is a process that blends the benefits of both interpretation and static compilation, providing performance gains for languages typically interpreted, through the dynamic compilation of frequently executed code segments.

The paper also explores various methods of code analysis for estimating computational resources. While many existing analytical techniques consider control flow, JIT traces lack control flow, enabling simpler approaches. Unique to Pycket traces are elements like guards, bridges, and trace graphs, which form a network depicting the execution paths where control flow divergence and convergence are possible.

The research uses a subset of the Pycket benchmark suite and racket programming language benchmarks to calibrate the model, excluding tests that do not complete successfully or involve foreign function calls.

The paper describes various types of parallel computation patterns used in the research and explains how they can be tuned. It then details the experimental setup, including the specific software versions and hardware specifications.

Three cost models of increasing complexity are presented: a basic loop counting model, an instruction counting model, and an intricate architecture-dependent weighted model. Through comprehensive benchmark analysis, the study confirms that these models can reliably predict the runtime effects of certain transformations on parallel computing tasks, particularly when task granularity exceeds a certain threshold.

In conclusion, the paper underscores that even the most rudimentary cost model is effective at forecasting runtime changes due to code modifications and suggests the potential to extend similar modeling techniques to JIT compilers of other programming languages.
