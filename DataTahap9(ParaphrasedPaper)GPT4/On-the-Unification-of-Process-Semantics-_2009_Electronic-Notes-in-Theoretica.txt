The paper describes a method to define the static or non-deterministic aspects of a semantic framework through a single axiom. This approach allows for a larger array of possible constraints, resulting in the emergence of various semantic interpretations under a consistent simulation framework. The cohesive system is created by the application of two fundamental, parameterized axioms which encapsulate not only the traditional semantic models found in the spectrum, but also other potential models.

Additionally, the paper discusses enhancing the comprehensibility of non-determinism by extending methodologies used in an earlier part of the research that was focused on observational semantics. This extension has led to a clearer differentiation between branching and linear types of semantics. A major advancement is the revelation of underlying similarities among all semantics explored, which facilitates a more streamlined and universal analysis that avoids the complications of case-by-case proof examination.
