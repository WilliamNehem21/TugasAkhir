The paper discusses a new, comprehensive model for quantum computation known as the quantum calculus. This model integrates the execution of quantum computations using both unitary transformations, which are typical in the traditional quantum gate array model, and one-qubit projective measurements that are followed by corrective unitary operations from the Pauli group, as used in the one-way quantum computer framework. The innovation presented allows for a more flexible approach that admits any quantum operation, including general measurements, and provides for sophisticated classical control within quantum computations. The paper contrasts a pure denotational semantics that computes over pure quantum states with semantics based on density matrices explored in another section, emphasizing the former's theoretical purity.
