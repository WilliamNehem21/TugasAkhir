The academic paper discusses the mathematical concept of PROPs (product and permutation categories) which are specific types of symmetric monoidal categories in which the objects can be identified with natural numbers. Over the past twenty years, PROPs have gained attention since they offer a framework for studying various computational models with an emphasis on compositionality and sensitivity to resources. Examples of areas where PROPs have been applied include algebraic analyses of Petri nets, bigraphs, quantum processes, and signal flow graphs.

The paper also touches on a nuanced point concerning the technicalities of working with cospans within the context of PROPs. A cospan example is mentioned, wherein despite having the same pullback, they represent different partitions of the number 2. A proper method, less direct and more sophisticated than initially expected, is needed for rewriting in the cosmos context. This involves pulling back only the specific region of the cospan where all sub-diagrams of a certain shape are present, requiring a formal and strategic approach in the analysis.
