This research paper presents the first findings on a universal cellular automaton within the ternary heptagrid, a tessellation with seven-sided polygons. Despite the increased number of neighboring cells within this grid, compared to the pentagrid, it was never proven if fewer states are required for computation. Previous attempts to translate pentagrid results to the heptagrid were insufficient, as they likely would result in an automaton with an equal or greater number of states, highlighting the need for significant work to achieve a better outcome. The inherent complexity of this new research is emphasized, along with the unique characteristics of the heptagrid, indicating that the findings are not simply an extension but a novel contribution.

The paper then describes different types of switch mechanisms essential for the functioning of the automaton. In this context, a "switch" is an element that controls the direction of a virtual locomotive within the automation tracks, with "active" (u to a or b) and "passive" (a or b to u) crossing modes. During active crossings, a fixed switch consistently directs the locomotive onto the same track, whereas a flip-flop switch alternates the selected track after each locomotive passage, but only when crossed actively. The memory switch can be crossed actively or passively, with the selected track determined by the last passive crossingâ€”a critical detail for the automaton's operation.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the management of computational processes, like incrementing or decrementing a register (denoted by r) and selecting subsequent instructions based on the current operation. The architecture of the cellular automaton is detailed, specifying how track intersections and switches are constructed and interconnected, with a focus on the spatial arrangement and numbering of the cell sides around each center.

The paper encapsulates the complexity of developing a universal cellular automaton in a ternary heptagrid, outlining how it involves not only devising switching mechanisms and control structures but also addressing how these components are arranged within an unfamiliar grid topology.
