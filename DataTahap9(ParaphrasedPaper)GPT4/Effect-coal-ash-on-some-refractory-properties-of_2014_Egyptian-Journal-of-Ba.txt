The study focused on enhancing the refractory characteristics of Kankara clay, an alumino-silicate material found in Kankara village, Katsina State, Nigeria, by mixing it with varying proportions of coal ash for the manufacturing of refractory bricks. The additions of coal ash ranged from 5 to 25 weight percent. 

Various refractory performance indicators such as linear shrinkage, apparent porosity, bulk density, cold crushing strength, and thermal shock resistance were evaluated, with the results compared to established standards for medium fireclay bricks. The measured properties of the clay-coal ash blends met the criteria for medium fireclay bricks, indicating that the addition of coal ash improved the refractory properties of the Kankara clay. Consequently, the resulting bricks were successfully used to construct a heat treatment furnace with satisfactory thermal resistance.

Clay is a widespread material with compositions that vary by geological location. It forms through sedimentation and weathering processes and is a key ingredient in many industrial products, including refractory materials essential in metallurgical industries.

Traditional raw materials for refractory products include kaolinite, chromite, magnesite, and different clays. Alumino-silicate and magnesite refractories are commonly used in the metallurgy sector. Various geological regions worldwide have unique clay deposits.

High ash content in coke adversely affects the efficiency of metallurgical processes by reducing carbon content, increasing the need for fluxes, and thereby increasing energy consumption for slag formation. This results in a higher coke rate and diminished blast furnace efficiency.

Previous research indicated that Kankara clay's refractoriness, thermal resistance, and high apparent porosity were unsatisfactory, pointing to the necessity for property improvement.

During the study, the raw clay was soaked, air-dried, crushed, ground, and sieved to a fine powder. Similarly treated coal ash was blended with the clay powder in specified proportions. The mixed material demonstrated good plasticity with 10% water content. Samples were compacted in a mold using a hydraulic press to improve consistency and surface smoothness.

Thermal shock resistance was tested by subjecting bricks to repeated cycles of heating, cooling, and testing until they failed, with the number of cycles leading to failure being recorded for each sample.
