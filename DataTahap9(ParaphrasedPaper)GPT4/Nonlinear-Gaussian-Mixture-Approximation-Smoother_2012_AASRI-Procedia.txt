This academic paper introduces an innovative Gaussian Mixture Approximation Smoother (GMA) designed for improved estimation of nonlinear system states. By converting the smoothing process into a series of Gaussian weighted integrals, the authors have developed an advanced GMA-URTSS algorithm utilizing the unscented transformation (UT) technique. The efficacy of this novel approach is demonstrated through its application in simulations, where it outperforms existing methods.

The paper is structured to first outline the problem, then review the conventional Gaussian Approximation (GA) filter and smoother, followed by the derivation of the GMA smoother based on the established GA estimators. A simulation study focused on the ballistic reentry tracking problem showcases the practical advantages of the new method. The final section summarizes the findings.

As the groundwork for the GMA smoother, the paper starts with the GA smoother's initial density expression. The authors propose an improved general GMA smoother, built upon the standard GA methods, for the specific task of estimating nonlinear states during ballistic reentry tracking. This proposal includes the innovative GMA-URTSS algorithm, which employs UT to effectively compute Gaussian weighted integrals within the GMA smoother framework, resulting in notably enhanced estimation precision as indicated by simulation results.
