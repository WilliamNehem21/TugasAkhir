In their research, Byun et al. introduced a Client-to-Client Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (C2C-PAKE) protocol for use in multi-realm settings, employing Key Distribution Centers (KDCs) from various realms as intermediaries. They argued that their proposed solutions are secure against a range of attacks through heuristic proofs. Within the context of this paper, such protocols are denoted as cross-realm C2C-PAKE protocols, and for the sake of brevity, they are simply referred to as C2C-PAKEs.

The structure of the paper is laid out as follows: The general framework for cross-realm C2C-PAKE protocols is detailed in Section 2. Section 3 revisits the Real-or-Random (ROR) security model, essential underpinning assumptions, and the formal definitions of security. Section 4 delves into the security particulars of the newly devised scheme and delivers an in-depth proof of its security. The concluding observations are offered in Section 5.

The original security model for key exchange protocols was put forward by Bellare and Rogaway, with Bellare and others later broadening it to encompass password-based key exchange protocols in 2000. More recently, Abdalla and colleagues enhanced this model minimally, introducing a more robust Real-or-Random (ROR) model and recommended its application for the validation of password-based schemes. This study employs this updated model to substantiate the security of a newly formulated generic construction for cross-realm C2C-PAKE.

Within the ROR model's framework for semantic security, the adversarial entity is permitted to send a multitude of queries to different oracles—such as execute, sendclient, sendserver, and test—but is prohibited from requesting 'reveal' queries, unlike in Abdalla et al.'s model. It's noted that when the parameter "b" equals zero, identical random key values must be returned for test queries directed at two instances that are part of the same pair.

A proof offered in the paper shows similarities with games G6 and G7 from the security proof of C2C-GPAKE. It outlines the possibility of an adversary, with a specified time-complexity limit, who makes a maximum number of execute queries. Furthermore, the paper presents a generally applicable construction for C2C-PAKE in a cross-realm environment, utilizing two-party PAKE and key distribution protocols. Unlike previous attempts, the authors assert that they can confirm the security of their protocol by leveraging efficient existing protocols based on standard assumptions, rather than relying on random oracle models.
