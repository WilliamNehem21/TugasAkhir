This paper introduces an innovative method of manipulating chaotic systems through application of two-dimensional affine transformations. These transformations incorporate six adjustable parameters that enable precise control over the characteristics of the chaotic system, such as its scaling, reflection, rotation, translation, and shearing. By implementing these parameters directly, rather than as post-processing adjustments, the paper demonstrates an ability to modify the location and appearance of a chaotic system’s strange attractor while preserving its inherent chaotic behavior.

The chaotic systems examined include both basic and Lorenz systems. The effect of affine transformations on these systems' time series, attractor diagrams, and maximum Lyapunov exponent is thoroughly analyzed. Furthermore, the authors show how dynamic scaling and translation parameters can be used to guide the trajectory of the strange attractor in real time.

A practical application is provided in the form of an image encryption scheme, which capitalizes on the modified Lorenz system. The proposed encryption technique is rigorously tested and evaluated against various performance metrics and common encryption attack scenarios, demonstrating superior results when compared to traditional Lorenz systems and other contemporary methods. This includes an assessment of the system’s performance as a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) in the context of image encryption using standard images and the robustness of the encrypted image against noise.

In summary, the paper proposes a method to dynamically control chaotic systems via affine transformations. This approach boasts the ability to fine-tune chaotic attractors and improve randomness and sensitivity. The resulting systems have practical applications, such as enhanced image encryption, and present promising opportunities for future research. The paper concludes with a review of the findings and an overview of potential directions for further study, including potential analysis of the transformation's effects on the eigen vectors of the Jacobian matrix and their inclination based on rotation angle.
