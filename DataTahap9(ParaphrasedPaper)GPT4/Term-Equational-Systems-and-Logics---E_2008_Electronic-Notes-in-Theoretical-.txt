In the paper, we present a simplified overview of the technical development to make the foundational concepts and underlying reasoning more digestible. The expanded concepts of discourse (Definition 2.2 in the paper) are essential for incorporating theories with multiple sorts.

As a point of clarity, we've adopted a notational system in Remark 2.1 where structures that are enhanced with a particular property, V, are underlined to distinguish them. Those without the underline represent standard categorical constructs. For example, an enhanced V-category, C, is shown as underlined, while its unenhanced ordinary category counterpart is not.

The paper states that achieving a universal completeness result for the broad scope outlined in the previous section is impractical. Nevertheless, within specific frameworks that allow for free constructions, an internal completeness result is achievable. The significance of this internal completeness relative to the broader concept of external completeness is further explored through practical applications in the subsequent section of the paper.
