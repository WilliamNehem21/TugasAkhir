To simplify and clarify the upcoming discussion on implementation, let's review the key ideas behind the parallel algorithms used, focusing on the algorithm for L1. We'll skip formal definitions and provide examples for clarity. For an in-depth understanding, please refer to the original academic sources.

We have set up these algorithms in a system we call UPPDMC, which is written in C++ and uses the MPI standard to enable communication between different computers. This system is independent of any prior implementations in Haskell or C++, prioritizing performance over compatibility. Our current version aims to demonstrate the real-world effectiveness and advantages of parallel model checking.

Some algorithms from previous work could be executed as the model is being built ("on-the-fly"), but UPPDMC only partially uses this capability. For comparison purposes, we use the VLTS benchmark suite's pregenerated transition systems in our performance measurements. However, UPPDMC can be easily modified to support true on-the-fly model checking.

Within the model checker, the core structure is defined in the game graph module. Nodes in this graph are indexed by the subformula they correspond to, allowing us to avoid redundant storage. This grouping makes it easier to identify the starting nodes of each graph component when the parallel algorithm processes one component at a time.

When it comes to the actual labeling process within the coloring algorithm, here's a simple way to describe it: if a node behaves like an "or-node," it's labeled green if at least one of its successors is green, and red if all successors are red. Verifying all red successors can be a challenge when nodes are spread across multiple computers, often suggesting that keeping track of children's colors in the parent node would be advantageous. But our algorithm is more efficient because successors shift colors only once, thus we can just tally the number of red and green successors if we know the total.

The structures for both the transition system and the game graph are designed to balance memory use with computational efficiency, though they are not finely optimized for minimal memory consumption. We've mainly focused on proving that the algorithm works well in practice, not on integrating it with more memory-efficient structures, such as Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). Improving memory efficiency could be considered in future enhancements.
