The academic paper discusses the potential use of dune sand (DS) as a novel natural precursor for the production of alkali-activated binders (AABs) in construction materials. Dune sand is abundant in arid regions and is classified as SP, or poorly graded sand, in both the ASTM and AASHTO soil classification systems. Despite its low fineness modulus, which is generally undesirable for fine aggregates in structural concrete, the high silica content and large surface area of dune sand may benefit the geopolymerization process and strength development in AABs. Given its compatibility with the development of the tetrahedral structure of one-part alkali-activated components, there has been an attempt to create a one-part geopolymer mixture using DS, though further research is necessary for carbon-neutral geopolymer cement.

The paper also details how factors like the type of precursor, alkaline to precursor ratio, balance of alkaline activators (sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide), the molarity of the sodium hydroxide solution, and curing temperature influence the mechanical properties of two-part geopolymers. The use of fly ash (FA) from various industrial sources has been explored in combination with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and DS. This study found that integrating industrially discarded DS can potentially enhance the packing and activation of FA in the AAB preparation.

The research reveals that FA-based geopolymers show early strength development through hot curing and that this strength can increase over time by addressing particle size variations. Additionally, by applying uniaxial pressure to precast concrete bricks, pavers, and kerb stones, air voids are removed, making the paste denser, which is crucial for developing high-strength materials.

Lastly, the study describes the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), a multi-criteria decision-making method utilized in the paper to select sustainable construction materials. Overall, the research suggests that DS-incorporated AAB mixtures demonstrate significant strength improvements and thus could contribute to the creation of high-strength and lightweight construction materials, particularly for arid regions. However, considerations beyond just physio-mechanical performance, such as standards for bricks and insulation properties, are necessary for decision-making in material selection.
