This academic paper discusses the role of calcium influx in muscle contractions and the possibility of using phases of action potentials (AP) across species and regions as a template for constructing hybrid automata (HA) models. Recent modified calcium (CA) models have been applied to investigate cardiac excitability and to facilitate comparisons with experimental data, linking the traditional continuous partial differential equations (PDE) representation with the alternative CA-based approach for reaction-diffusion systems, despite challenges in resolving nonstepwise features due to the discrete nature of CA.

The paper presents a model using a Single Node Hybrid Input-Output Automaton (SNHIOA) to simulate the behavior of cardiac tissue, assuming isotropic cell arrangements where the diffusion of electrical signals is uniform. To represent this, a triangular lattice structure is utilized, and each automaton corresponds to the AP of an individual cell. The model also includes input/output variables that allow for interaction between automata, and a distance-based weight function that mediates these interactions.

Furthermore, it mentions that models based on HA can be subjected to formal analysis, including symbolic reachability analysis used in the model checking of linear hybrid systems, which is supported by several tools like D/dt and HyTech. The authors express an interest in extending these analytical techniques from linear to cycle-linear hybrid automata. They highlight that exploring the spatial properties of hybrid automata networks is a relatively new research area, mentioning work that has performed automatic reachability analysis on an HA model for the Delta-Notch signaling network.
