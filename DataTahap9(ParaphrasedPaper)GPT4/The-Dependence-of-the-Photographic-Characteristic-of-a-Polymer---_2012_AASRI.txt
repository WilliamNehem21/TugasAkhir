To synthesize the base samples, initially zinc oxide was uniformly mixed into a polymer base. Specifically, 12 grams of dampened zinc oxide were added to 100 milliliters of a 10% solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in water that had been previously mixed in a water bath. After an hour of resting, 60 grams of this blend was applied onto a glass surface measuring 234 square centimeters. The coated mixture was then left to dry at standard room temperature for one full day while positioned horizontally.

Subsequently, the samples were sensitized using either bismuth or lead salts. The PVA-ZnO layer was immersed for half a minute in an aqueous solution of 1M bismuth chloride to create a light-sensitive PVA-ZnOBiCl3 composite or in a 0.1M lead acetate solution to produce a PVA-ZnOPb(CH3COO)2 composite. After sensitization, the materials were dried under a warm airflow for five minutes to remove any remaining moisture.

For experimental analysis, the photoresponsive layers were exposed to the broad-spectrum light of a DRT-125 mercury-vapor lamp for different lengths of time. The light intensity at the surface was set at 0.105 watts per square centimeter, and the optical density changes were measured using a custom hardware-software setup.

The results showed that in the PVA-ZnO-BiCl3 composite, the volume of acetate groups within the PVA matrix had little effect on the contrast and peak optical density but did significantly affect the photosensitivity. On the other hand, in the PVA-ZnO-Pb(CH3COO)2 composite, an increased acetate content led to a substantial reduction in peak optical density, without markedly impacting the contrast or photosensitivity.
