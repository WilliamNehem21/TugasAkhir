This paper explores the impact of semi-virtual intercultural seminars that utilize telepresence robots on the development of students' cultural intelligence (CQ). Using robots, students from Germany and Kenya could virtually visit the partner university campus, experiencing realistic intercultural interactions. The research aimed to determine whether these seminars significantly improved students' CQ compared to traditional methods.

CQ refers to one's ability to function effectively in intercultural contexts and is related to intercultural competence. While the definitions of intercultural competence vary, CQ facilitates interactive participation and social relationships even for students who are homebound.

There's limited research on telepresence robots in higher education, with few longitudinal studies on how attitudes toward these devices evolve. This study is unique in examining the use of telepresence robots in an intercultural seminar to enhance CQ.

The study involved three groups: active participants from both countries, non-participating students from Germany, and passive Kenyan participants. The seminars were part of a diversity management elective in Germany and a compulsory psychology program in Kenya.

The results showed significant increases in metacognitive, cognitive, and behavioral CQ among seminar participants, but no change in motivational CQ, possibly due to high initial levels. The Kenyan control group's cognitive CQ did not significantly differ, suggesting active seminar engagement was vital for gains in metacognitive and behavioral CQ.

Differences in baseline CQ levels potentially influenced the study's outcomes and future research should use design methods, such as waiting group designs, to address self-selection biases.

Investigator effects are a potential concern as the German lecturers conducted the evaluation, but Kenyan lecturersâ€™ involvement and emphasizing honest feedback aimed to mitigate bias.

The long-term retention of increased CQ was not assessed, and further studies should explore the persistence of CQ gains following such seminars.

In conclusion, the study supports the effectiveness of semi-virtual intercultural seminars with telepresence robots in enhancing different aspects of CQ among students. It suggests that despite technical issues, such as internet connectivity and robot maneuverability that need addressing, these seminars offer a promising alternative to traditional in-person exchanges, especially when global factors like pandemics limit travel.
