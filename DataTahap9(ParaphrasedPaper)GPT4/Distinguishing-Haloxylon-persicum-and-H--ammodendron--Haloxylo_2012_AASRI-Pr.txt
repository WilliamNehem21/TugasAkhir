The plants of the Haloxylon genus, which are part of the Amaranthaceae family (previously classified under Chenopodiaceae), comprise shrubs or small trees that are well-adapted to sandy environments. Worldwide, there are around 13 species of Haloxylon, and in China, the predominant species in the northwestern desert regions are Haloxylon persicum (white saxaul) and Haloxylon ammodendron (saxaul). These species, often referred to as the "kings" of plants adapted to sandy soils, contribute significantly to stabilizing sand dunes, reducing wind erosion, and preserving water in desert landscapes. In China, their habitats overlap; H. persicum typically grows atop sand dunes, while H. ammodendron can be found in various desert ecosystems, including sand dunes, saline areas, and stony deserts.

Research utilizing Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) analyses has shown considerable genetic diversity within and between H. ammodendron populations in Xinjiang, China. Similarly, DNA ISSR marker studies confirmed genetic diversity and gene flow among populations of both H. ammodendron and H. persicum in the same region. Pollen from H. ammodendron has been detected in surface soil at the heart of the Junggar Desert in Xinjiang, prompting discussions on the ecological relationships between vegetation characteristics and surface soil pollen. An analysis that included the ITS1 region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and 14 ISSR primers found no genetic differences between H. ammodendron plants whether or not they were parasitized by the desert broomrape Cistanche deserticola in the Alxa Desert. The analysis parameters involved specific weights and probabilities for genetic matching and alignment.

When it comes to transferring genetic markers, the suitability of SSR markers from tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) to seven other grass species was very high (nearly 92%). However, the transferability of SSR markers from other related genera to the Haloxylon genus was considerably low, at only 1.8%, indicating a significant genetic distance between these groups.
