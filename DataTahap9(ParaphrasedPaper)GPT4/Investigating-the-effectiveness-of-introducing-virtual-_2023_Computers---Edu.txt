Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions on physical movement have led to increased reliance on technology such as video conferencing, virtual reality (VR), and the metaverse, resulting in significant market growth for these technologies. With rapid tech advancements outpacing the development of laws and regulatory frameworks, the cultivation of ethical awareness in society is more crucial than ever.

Traditional moral education approaches, such as those in South Korea, which focus on classical ethics and storytelling, may not effectively nurture the capacity for sensitive moral perception and decision-making. Meanwhile, VR technology, known for enhancing learning through greater engagement and reduced anxiety, has seen little exploration in moral education despite being actively studied in various other subject areas.

Effective moral education should connect closely with children's daily experiences, as studies have shown that relating moral concepts to actual experiences can enhance moral development. Nevertheless, the standard methods of teaching morality, which frequently rely on videos, computer-based instruction, and electronic games, may not always translate into real-world moral behavior.

Rest's four-component model of morality, which includes moral sensitivity, moral judgment, moral motivation, and moral character, supports the notion that morality encompasses social rights, responsibilities, cooperation, and mutual welfare. This study focuses on two of these components, moral sensitivity and moral judgment, as they are fundamental to moral action and have been largely emphasized in previous research.

The research examines the impact of VR-based programs on moral development in elementary school students, particularly in moral sensitivity and judgment. VR's unique characteristics — interaction, immersion, and imagination — may play a pivotal role in enhancing moral sensitivity by facilitating empathetic experiences in moral education.

The participants in this study were elementary students from Seoul, South Korea. The research utilized VR tools measuring elements like interaction and immersion alongside moral development. The process combined VR activities and classroom discussions, with students engaging in group decision-making and reflecting on moral dilemmas after VR experiences.

Statistical analysis was conducted to assess the impact of VR on moral sensitivity and judgment. The results indicated that VR can significantly enhance moral sensitivity, particularly concerning scenarios experienced in VR. However, no significant changes were found in moral judgment. The findings suggest that while VR excites and motivates students, translating this into improved moral judgment requires more sophisticated educational methods.

The study had limitations, such as the need for more appropriate testing tools considering evolving educational media and a broader age range of participants. Furthermore, the impact of the VR-based program was measured after a single session rather than over a longer term, which might have restricted the potential to observe longer-lasting effects on moral development.

In conclusion, VR in moral education shows promise, particularly in raising moral sensitivity, yet challenges remain in effectively enhancing moral judgment, highlighting the need for further research with more advanced methodologies.
