The paper focuses on an encryption algorithm that employs a specific initial value (designated as u0) of 0.12345678901267 in its generation process. This process uses a Markov process (referred to as f_markov) to produce a sequence of unique integers ranging from 0 to 255. If a value repeats, it is discarded, and the chaotic map iteration continues until all unique integers in the range have been generated, resulting in one vector of key parameters.

For the cryptosystem's configuration, the paper specifies fixed key parameters: p=29, d=0.001, r=27, treating the others (x0, y0, z0, n0, u0, key0) as cipher keys. These choices adhere to the IEEE 64-bit double precision floating-point computation standard, ensuring numerical precision.

The paper assesses the strength of an encryption algorithm on its ability to diminish the correlation between adjacent pixels in an image. A strong encryption algorithm greatly reduces this correlation to safeguard against statistical attacks, with zero correlation being the ideal target. In the study, correlation coefficients of adjacent pixel pairs from both the original (plain) and encrypted (ciphered) images are calculated by using equation 4.1.

A security analysis of the proposed encryption algorithm is conducted, demonstrating that even minor changes in the original image lead to substantial alterations in the encrypted output, indicating a high degree of security against various attacks like differential, chosen-plaintext, and known-plaintext attacks. The algorithm introduces a diffusion process to modify the grayscale values across the image, contributing to its robustness.

The paper concludes with a comprehensive examination, involving tests and performance evaluations in key areas such as key space, histogram analysis, correlation analysis, information entropy, and resistance to differential attacks. These analyses serve to validate the effectiveness and security of the proposed image encryption algorithm.
