In the paper, the authors introduce a new logical framework called the weighted modal mu-calculus (WMC), designed for reasoning about weighted transition systems. WMC expands upon standard modal logics like CTL by including weights and is compared to time-scaled extensions of the mu-calculus. The authors develop both a traditional and a symbolic semantics for WMC, showing that the two concepts of satisfaction align with each other. This convergence is key because it proves two important aspects of WMC.

Firstly, despite the absence of the finite model property in classical semantics—a property implying the logic’s formulas can be satisfied by a finite model—it is demonstrated that satisfiability is decidable for WMC. This finding is notable given that similar temporal logics are plagued by undecidability issues. Decidability is achievable due to the finite model property in the symbolic semantics.

Secondly, the paper offers a comprehensive set of axioms and rules for WMC, amounting to the first complete axiomatization of a weighted modal logic with fixed points seen in literature. Despite the logic’s non-compactness, the authors argue for the completeness of the axiomatization, primarily by leveraging finite model arguments specific to symbolic semantics.

In constructing the axiom system, the authors present axioms that cover basic arithmetic, the positive costs associated with transitions, and the uniform measurement of resources. They also incorporate normality properties for box-like operators in WMC and qualifications about the nature of reset operations. The completeness of these axioms for symbolic semantics confirms their soundness and completeness for the semantics of the weighted transition systems as well.
