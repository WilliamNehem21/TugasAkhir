To achieve organizational objectives, understanding the unique dynamics and norms governing resources such as labor, goods, and finances is crucial. Knowledge in these areas helps leaders shape goals to maximize profits with limited resources. One key area is inventory management, with literature continuously evolving to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

Two primary challenges impact inventory strategy. The first is the issue of stock obsolescence or deterioration, where products lose value over time due to various factors, including spoilage and desertion. Effective management strategies focus on reducing losses from these factors. The second challenge is fluctuating demand rates, which significantly influence inventory policies.

Researchers Manna and Chaudhuri proposed a time-dependent deterioration rate model for goods with increasing demand, linking production rates to demand rates. Panda, Senapati, and Basu introduced a model for seasonal items featuring ramped demand rates. Skouri, Konstantaras, Papachristos, and Ganas refined a model by Covert and Philip, incorporating ramped demand, Weibull distribution deterioration rates, and partial backlogging. They, along with Manna and Chaudhuri, also considered stable demand rates post-production periods, both with and without bottlenecks, considering the demand as a time-dependent function.

In new developments, Ahmed, Al-Khamis, and Benkherouf explored a general deterioration rate, while Sanni and Chukwu presented an EOQ model for items with a Weibull distribution of deterioration. Amutha and Chandrasekaran advanced an EOQ model accounting for quadratic demand and time-dependent inventory costs. Srivastava and Singh extended inventory models to address linear demand with variable deterioration rates and partial backlogs.

Research also targeted industry-specific demands, including healthcare, where Shaikh and others modeled inventory for deteriorating goods with ramp-type demand and trade credit policies. Sharma and Kaushik focused on ramp-type demand and delayed payment offers, while Palanivelu and Chandrasekaran developed replenishment strategies for Giffen goods with time-dependent demand. Supakar and Mahato formulated deteriorating inventory models considering ramp-type demand and advanced payment schemes.

The remainder of the paper is as follows: Section 2 explains the assumptions, definitions, and development of Model-I, addressing scenarios both with and without shortages, complemented by numerical examples for clarity. Section 3 details a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters, and the outcomes are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the study with key takeaways.
