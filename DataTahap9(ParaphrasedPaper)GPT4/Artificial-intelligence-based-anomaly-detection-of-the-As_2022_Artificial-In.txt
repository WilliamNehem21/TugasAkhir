The traditional discovery of mineral deposits often occurred by chance and involved labor-intensive and sophisticated techniques such as geochemical analysis of stream sediments, diamond drilling, and surveys using geophysics and geochemistry, or even remote sensing technologies. However, with a growing need for essential raw materials and a decline in new mineral deposit discoveries, exploration geologists are turning to more effective and innovative methods to analyze diverse data throughout different stages of mineral exploration. Remote sensing is increasingly popular for initial searches due to its extensive coverage and cost-efficiency. Publicly accessible satellite imagery from tools like Landsat-8 is employed for geological mapping and identifying potential mineral exploitation sites.

In this research, we adapt an AI-based, unsupervised method of detecting anomalies to locate iron deposits using Landsat-8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery coupled with machine learning. Our unique approach includes: (1) An unsupervised, knowledge-informed anomaly detection not relying on specific known signatures; (2) Anomaly detection strictly within the variable domain; and (3) The application of various machine learning models to strike a balance between understandability and high performance. The method successfully identified known areas of the Assen iron deposit in South Africa and uncovered additional, previously unknown features nearby. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to summarize anomalies, improving the contrast and delineation of the deposit against the background significantly, including man-made structures.

The method showed a robust capability for anomaly detection and seems promising for identifying mineral exploration targets, especially in regions lacking labels or known spectral signatures of anomalies, such as those under "greenfield" exploration scenarios.

This advanced anomaly detection typically occurs within the variable domain that holds most of the encoded information. When dealing with non-spatial or high-dimensional data, anomalies can be effectively identified in this domain. While traditional signal processing techniques are adept at identifying known anomalies with specific signatures, our AI-based method is particularly beneficial for general anomalies within the vast, multiband and high-dimensional datasets provided by modern remote sensing. Pre-processing steps, such as radiometric correction and the FLAASH atmospheric correction algorithm, are vital for optimizing satellite imagery for mineral exploration.

Our machine learning algorithms aim to detect generalized anomalies within certain bands containing iron ore deposit-related information, specifically bands 4, 5, and 6, which are pertinent to ferrous and ferric oxides. This unsupervised detection process is guided by domain-specific knowledge, which suggests which bands are most informative for enhancing iron ore anomalies.

Overall, our methodology shows how to leverage the abundance of remote sensing data effectively for mineral reconnaissance by integrating data-driven techniques with expert knowledge in the field. Although the study primarily focuses on remote sensing for mineral deposits, the workflow's principles can be applied to other datasets, such as geochemical or combined data sources.
