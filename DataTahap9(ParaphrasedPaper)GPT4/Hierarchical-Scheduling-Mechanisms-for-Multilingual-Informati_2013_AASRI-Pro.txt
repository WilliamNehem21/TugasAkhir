The study addresses the challenge of managing and scheduling diverse multilingual information resources within cloud computing environments. These resources are varied and distributed across web pages and databases, making scheduling intricate due to their heterogeneity and imbalance. Recognizing the need for advanced mechanisms, the paper introduces a novel four-layered architectural framework and a hierarchical three-layered scheduling model for multilingual information resource handling in the cloud.

This framework includes (from topmost to bottom):
1. User Accessing Tier: The interface between the user and the cloud resources, facilitating access through devices like PCs and mobile phones.
2. Technology Supporting Tier: Offers necessary technical capabilities for system operation.
3. Resource Scheduling Tier: Manages the allocation and coordination of cloud resources.
4. Resources Tier: Contains the physical and informational assets necessary for the system's functionality.

The proposed scheduling model comprises:
- Home Managers: These manage the private cloud resources autonomously, allowing users to submit and oversee tasks with ease.
- Local Scheduling Agents: These work within individual cloud environments to balance workloads.
- A Global Scheduling Agent: This coordinates scheduling across the entire system, thus reducing its own load and improving overall efficiency.

The authors demonstrate with an example that this scheduling approach enhances the performance of multilingual information resource management in cloud computing. The paper concludes with a commitment to develop an effective scheduling algorithm for these resources as future research.

The paper's structure unfolds as follows: After the introduction, Section 2 elaborates on the four-tier architecture. Section 3 presents the three-layer scheduling model. Section 4 validates the model's effectiveness with an example. The final Section 5 summarizes the study's conclusions.
