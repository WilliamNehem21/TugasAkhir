The concepts of channel and capacity, originating from information theory, have demonstrated significant value in the realm of security. These ideas have been applied effectively to view systems and protocols as channels, with their capacities serving as indicators of security levels across diverse areas such as information flow, quantum cryptography, anonymity, and trust.

However, calculating channel capacity poses a challenge due to its complex nature. While it is conceptually straightforward, no general analytical formula exists for determining the capacity of discrete channels, often necessitating approximation through computational means, such as the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm. Even when formulas are available, as in the case of binary channels, they are intricate and impractical for real-world applications, especially when dealing with varying noise during transmission.

To address this, recent developments in algebraic information theory provide higher-level reasoning tools, specifically for binary channels. This theoretical framework, which merges order theory, algebra, and topology, has demonstrated that capacity is a Scott-continuous function, enabling the comparison of different binary channels as a measure.

One application of this theory is seen in quantum key distribution, where the capacity of a 'hidden' communication channel shrouded by noise, caused by eavesdropping and/or environmental factors, has been explored. A lower bound on such capacity was determined, unveiling an optimal disruption method for secret communications.

Furthermore, the paper contends that the Euclidean distance, denoted by 'det', acts as an upper bound on the channel's capacity. It is deemed as a canonical upper bound for nonnegative channels, and possesses special mathematical properties that are unique to just two functions.

The study goes beyond simple hierarchical structures of binary channels and examines deeper mathematical relationships, leading to a new topological connection between capacity and distance. The paper also defines a directed-complete partial order (dcpo), showcasing how ordered sets, when directed, ensure the existence of a supremum and demonstrate additional mathematical richness referred to as the 'interval domain.'

Finally, the paper delves into the applications of these theoretical insights in communication, providing a primer on quantum key distribution for readers with no quantum mechanics background. This overview presents a simple explanation of quantum states using vector representations known as kets, crucial for describing phenomena like photon polarization, and touching on the quantum equivalent of classical bits.
