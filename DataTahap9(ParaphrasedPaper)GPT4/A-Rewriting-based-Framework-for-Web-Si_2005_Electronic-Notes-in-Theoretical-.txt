The paper describes various approaches for modeling XML and HTML documents, with a focus on hierarchical representations that simplify methodologies, despite the presence of alternative graph-based formalisms for handling cross-references. The work introduces a term rewriting specification language designed to specify and verify web content and structure. This language comprises a finite set of rules wherein the left-hand side and right-hand side terms represent potentially marked web page templates. The core of the technique is a new rewriting mechanism that can extract and modify parts of a web page's structure.

An example provided in the paper demonstrates the use of web specifications to detect errors with the aid of user-defined marks; however, detailed treatment of markings and verification processes is deferred to a later section. The paper outlines three illustrative rules that enforce properties such as: web pages for all group members exist if a member list is present; professor home pages must contain teaching information; and authors on publication lists must be research group members.

The rewriting system uses markings to uncover potentially incomplete or absent web pages, after which it detects actual errors within these sets. The concept of 'simulation' is introduced to match the structure of one web page or template to another, assisting in error detection related to incompleteness of a website according to the specification. The verification framework can identify both errors and their causes, enabling not only bug localization but also straightforward repairs by providing the missing information required to complete erroneous web pages.

The effectiveness of the system was confirmed through tests on various websites, with results highlighting the ability to efficiently detect missing and incomplete pages. An example case demonstrated that the verification process could be completed in under a second, with the system generating error messages when needed.
