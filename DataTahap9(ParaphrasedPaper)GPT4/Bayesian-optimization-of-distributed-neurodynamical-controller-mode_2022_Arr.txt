Title: Bayesian Optimization of Multi-agent Models for Visualizing Complex Behaviors in Neuroswarms

Abstract:
The study focuses on employing robust optimization and visualization techniques on a multi-agent neural model. Specifically, it uses a sample-efficient Bayesian optimization framework that employs Gaussian Process surrogate models. An objective function is formulated for a spatial cooperative foraging task within a neuroswarms simulation to predict reward-capture performance in different maze environments. The surrogate model training is enhanced by leveraging the L-BFGS-B algorithm to update the model iteratively. Furthermore, UMAP embeddings are used for the visualization of high-dimensional parameter spaces, allowing for the selection of high-performing parameter clusters that generalize well across varying environments. The research outlines the application of Bayesian optimization in multi-agent models to encourage complex behaviors such as goal-directed spatial navigation within systems managed by distributed neural control. It also suggests potential future directions for developing new controller models and tasks that could adapt to varying environmental characteristics. The study concludes by acknowledging the contributions of various funders and highlighting the relevant research interests of Mr. Armin Hadzic, a key team member at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
