The integration of RGB and depth data in computer vision has seen a significant boost in popularity due to the availability of affordable depth sensors like the Microsoft Kinect. These sensors can accurately capture depth information alongside color images, which helps resolve complex problems encountered in traditional 2D image processing. Depth data is particularly powerful because it is not impacted by poor lighting conditions that commonly plague indoor environments, serving as a valuable complement to RGB data.

In our research, we incorporate depth information to address the practical challenges of real-time, multi-target tracking in indoor settings. Prior studies have successfully utilized depth data for motion detection, background subtraction, and 3D body pose estimation, thereby providing robust detection methods. These studies also introduced various depth-based features for target detection and representation, such as 3D position, motion, and spatial layouts, which enhance appearance modeling. By leveraging a diverse set of depth-based features, we can significantly increase the robustness of our tracking system, especially in cluttered and poorly lit environments, or when dealing with scale variations on the 2D plane.

While previous work has explored spatial layout for better spatial information integration, limitations arise due to relying solely on 2D image patches. Practical scenarios often feature misalignment, truncation, or occlusion of targets due to subpar detector performance in complex settings. To address these issues, we introduce a novel depth-invariant part-based model for reducing errors caused by these challenges.

Additionally, we recognize the importance of high-level features like appearance in pedestrian-focused applications and the inadequate use of body structure information by low-level descriptors in existing methods. Within this paper, we execute a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed framework, which includes a scene-adaptive feature selection, the depth-invariant part-based appearance model (DIAM), and a hierarchical data association (HDA) approach. We assess its effectiveness in various scenarios and compare it against non-adaptive and non-hierarchical models using standard multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) metrics and real-time performance measures like frames per second (FPS).

For our detailed experimental analysis, we investigate how the construction of a hierarchical feature space affects the HDA and compare the HDA with non-hierarchical data association schemes. Our results underline the strengths and potential applications of our framework.
