We cannot consider the result type of concretion as t(n/nj), given what we mentioned in section 2.1, which is that the soundness of FreshMLTT judgements generally isn't maintained through substitutions of names—rather, it's preserved via permutations of names.

In proving this, we conduct a mutual induction based on the judgements of the FreshMLTT type system. We've skipped detailing the induction steps for judgements that already exist in MLTT (Martin-Löf Type Theory), as a comprehensive proof is accessible in [22, Chapter 3] utilizing contextual categories. The remaining parts of the induction are based on the characteristics of the nom-CWF (nominal sets category with families), which we discussed in Section 3. We elaborate on the notable cases within the proof.

The semantics for FreshMLTT have been described through the identification of specific structures within the CWF of nominal sets. It may be feasible to formulate these structures as a core part of a generalized algebraic theory, extending the one for categories with families as outlined by Dybjer [8, Sect. 2.2]. Doing so could lead to an algebraic rendition of the type theory examined within this research.
