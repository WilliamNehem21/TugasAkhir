This paper introduces a novel approach to feature selection for information retrieval systems (IRS) using topological spaces. The authors present a new concept called Topological Information Retrieval Systems (TIRS), which is an extension of traditional IRS. To improve feature selection, the paper applies the idea of topological near open sets to TIRS and discusses the indiscernibility of keywords within these systems. The paper also explores how the relationships among documents in a document space can be represented by an order relation.

Topological space concepts, particularly near open sets, have emerged as potent tools for data analysis, with recent applications in fields such as chemistry and physics. The authors propose using topological structures to enhance information retrieval applications, building on the foundation of rough set theoryâ€”a mathematical framework developed by Pawlak in 1982 that deals with qualitative uncertainty reasoning.

Utilizing the framework of general topology, the proposed Topological Information Retrieval System represents each document through a finite set of keywords and defines a topological basis on this keyword set. This allows for approximate retrieval of information, wherein a query can be reduced and refined using topological methods like near open sets.

Traditional feature selection methods mainly depend on statistical or information-theoretical analysis to identify important features within a dataset. For text-based tasks, these methods focus on the vocabulary-specific attributes of a dataset to select significant terms, even though they do not take the actual text meaning into account. The authors reference Relief, a statistical feature selection algorithm based on instance-based learning.

In the context of information retrieval, the paper also touches upon the concepts of precision and recall, which are critical for evaluating the effectiveness of an IRS. Precision and recall are determined by comparing the set of documents retrieved by an IRS (such as the results from a web search engine query) with a set of documents that are truly relevant to a particular topic.

Overall, this work aims to lay the groundwork for the application of topological structures within information retrieval, providing a new perspective on feature selection that could lead to better performance in information retrieval tasks.
