The paper presents a method for expanding labeled seismic exploration data using deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) to address the challenge of insufficient labeled examples for supervised machine learning applications. VAEs are composed of an encoder and a decoder, both implemented with neural networks. Traditional supervised learning in seismic data processing can lead to overfitting due to a scarcity of labeled training samples. However, training VAEs on the entire dataset of seismic information, which is a data-driven process, can mitigate this overfitting risk.

The encoder part of the VAE learns to map seismic waveforms (y) to a latent space of deep features (z), whereas the decoder regenerates the seismic waveforms from the latent features. Using labeled seismic examples, the encoder generates latent features, which can then be modeled by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for each class of the data. This model enables the resampling of new, expanded latent features (z*), which the decoder can then transform into synthetic seismic data that supplements the original labeled dataset.

The augmented dataset produced by this technique has been shown to improve classification performance in seismic facies analysis. In experiments with both synthetic and actual data, the method successfully addressed the issue of inadequate labeled data. For instance, in an experiment using synthetic data with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3, the classification accuracy was elevated by 20% using the proposed approach.

The VAE's training is guided by a loss function composed of two parts: the reconstruction error, calculated as the Euclidean distance between the original and reconstructed data, and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which quantifies how much the latent features (z) diverge from a prior Gaussian distribution.

This semi-supervised label expansion approach makes use of the full seismic survey data, which helps prevent network overfitting and allows the VAE to effectively project seismic data into the deep feature space and regenerate seismic data from those features.
