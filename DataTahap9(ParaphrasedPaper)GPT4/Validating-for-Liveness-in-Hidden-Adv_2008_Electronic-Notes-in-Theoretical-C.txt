This academic paper discusses systems that can be modeled using hidden variables that represent the past interactions which are either finite, ending after a certain period, or infinite, where the history is continuously maintained. The paper proposes a default assumption for a system's states, where states without specific restrictions are permissive ("p modality") by default, and restrictions ("p constraints") define minimal states that are otherwise restricted unless activated.

The interaction schema is recognized to have certain limitations, such as the lack of definition for disjunction of constraints and their propagation; however, this simplification is intentional for the initial steps of developing a theory for human-autonomous systems (HAS). The current schema uses a simple model as a starting point, noting that practical applications, like LogicFence, employ more intricate constraint semantics.

The paper introduces a concept known as the "altruistic collaboration number," which applies to paths in the interaction schema that are considered “clean” if they can be cleared of constraints through collaboration, and this is realized before the entry of adversaries (as per their model assumptions). This underscores a reliance on collaborative processes in the absence of adversaries, and the authors recognize the limitation of not accounting for adversarial influence during the collaboration phase.

The interaction schema model itself is designed to capture the interplay between autonomous processes with separate goals without requiring a collective overarching objective; collaboration emerges for convenience to lower uncertainties rather than being a focal goal.

The paper emphasizes its focus on validating altruistic collaboration in an idealized HAS model, acknowledging the limitation due to the assumption of an adversary-free initial phase. It concludes with an intention to further explore how teleological objectives (system-wide goals) can be integrated with game-theoretical strategies reflecting individual process goals, especially in scenarios where adversarial influence cannot be ignored and collaborative efforts must contend with it in a probabilistic fashion.
