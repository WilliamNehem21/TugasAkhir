This paper presents a review of methods for quantifying the similarity between stochastic processes, with an emphasis on approximation metrics, particularly for processes with continuous state spaces. It explores the concept of approximate bisimulationâ€”a variant of probabilistic bisimulation aimed at comparing stochastic processes. The paper differentiates between two primary approaches for introducing metrics: one that utilizes the underlying probabilistic structures (conditional kernels) of the processes through algebraic, logical, or categorical means, and another built upon comparing the dynamic properties of process trajectories.

The discussion includes foundational work on probabilistic bisimulation for finite-state Markov chains and expands to consider both discrete-time labeled Markov processes and continuous-space processes. Topics such as relational, logical, and coalgebraic characterizations of bisimulations are addressed, alongside the development of metrics leveraging these bisimulations, including work on Kantorovic distances for Markov decision processes (MDPs) and bisimulation metrics for diffusion processes.

The survey also looks at randomization techniques for defining approximation distances without relying on assumptions about process dynamics, promising potential for model reduction approaches. An alternative perspective is offered by methods evaluating processes semantically, focusing on actual trajectories observed over finite time.

One contribution emphasizes conditions to generate stochastic bisimulation functions for specific classes of continuous-time processes with hybrid features, including spontaneous jumps. Another part of the research investigates metrics based on probability distributions of process samples and the empirical convergence of these metrics.

Overall, the paper draws attention to the rich history of using metrics to measure process similarity and recent interest in approximation based on probabilistic bisimulation, highlighting the divergent strategies of the dependability and formal verification community compared to the systems and control field. Finally, a procedure for creating a discrete approximation of a diffusion process is discussed, emphasizing its bisimilarity with the original process within a specific approximation precision.
