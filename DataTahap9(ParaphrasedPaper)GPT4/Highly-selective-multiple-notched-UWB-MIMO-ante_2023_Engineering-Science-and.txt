To reduce the error rate, multiple instances of a signal are generated, enhancing the likelihood of successful transmission to the receiving antenna without degradation due to fading. Moreover, to curtail potential disruption from existing frequency bands within the ultra-wideband (UWB) spectrum, like the 5G sub-6 GHz, WLAN band, and satellite downlink frequencies, an innovative parasitic decoupling structure is implemented to sharply confine any interference.
