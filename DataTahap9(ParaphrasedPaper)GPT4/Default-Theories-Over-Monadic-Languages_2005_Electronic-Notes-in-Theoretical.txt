The structure of the paper is as follows: The upcoming section revisits the symbols and fundamental concepts that will be utilized throughout the paper. In the third section, it's established that when dealing with default theories in languages with a single variable (monadic languages), the size of an infinite underlying set doesn't affect the possible extensions. The fourth section demonstrates that when assuming the domain is closed, the possible extensions for default theories with single-term functions (uniterm default theories), also remain unaffected by the domain's size. This means that for practical purposes, one can focus on a predefined finite set.

The paper then introduces a definition of extensions for open default theories that adapts the concept from definition 2.2 to interpretations using Herbrand bases with an infinite addition of new constants, labeled 'B'. This is necessary since typical proof theory methods fall short in characterizing a Herbrand universe unless the theory's domain is explicitly limited to being finite, an exception highlighted by axiom(2).
