The paper introduces a novel method for measuring soot concentration using an integrated approach that combines scattering and transmission techniques, which does not rely on prior knowledge of the soot particles' average size within the dust flow. An instrument designed to measure soot concentration based on this method has been developed, and experiments have been conducted to test its functionality.

The experimental setup includes a laser that emits a light beam which is converted into parallel light through a set of collimator lenses. This parallel light is then split into two separate beams with a splitter prism. One of the beams is directed towards a photodiode via a focusing lens, which measures the initial light intensity by converting the optical signal to an electrical current signal (I0).

The other beam passes through the area containing soot particles, and as it does, both the transmitted light and light scattered at small angles are measured by a second photodiode. This photodiode generates an electrical signal (I2) that reflects the combination of the small angle scattered light and the transmitted light. By comparing the signal from the initial light intensity (I1) and the signal after passing through the soot (I2), the device calculates the intensity of light scattered at certain angles.

This detailed information allows the instrument to determine the concentration of soot particles in the medium without needing to know the average particle size beforehand, offering an improvement over traditional extinction methods.
