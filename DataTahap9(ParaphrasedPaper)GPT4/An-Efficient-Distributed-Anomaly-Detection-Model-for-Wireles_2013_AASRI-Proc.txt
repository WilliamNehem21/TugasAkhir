This academic paper discusses the importance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for environmental data collection and monitoring. Anomalies in these networks can compromise data integrity due to various reasons like hardware faults, software errors, unusual events, or malicious attacks. To maintain data quality for accurate decision-making, the paper proposes a new distributed online anomaly detection model that assesses sensor data dissimilarity using principal component analysis (PCA).

The proposed model performs detection tasks across the network to reduce energy consumption while maintaining high detection capability. The model's performance, in terms of detection rate and false positive rate, was validated using real sensor data from the SensorScope project, showing improvements over an existing model.

Unlike hierarchical structures often used in distributed systems, this model avoids such structures by grouping less capable sensors around a smaller number of more powerful ones based on spatial proximity. The model adapts an in-network outlier detection method to reduce communication overhead by implementing a distance similarity measure to identify global anomalies, with nodes broadcasting their findings to their neighbors.

The paper also highlights limitations of existing models based on QSSVM - a computationally expensive method not suitable for resource-constrained sensor networks. Instead, the new model employs the one-class principal component classifier (OCPCC) for online anomaly detection, choosing detection thresholds based on the maximum and minimum bounds of the training data's dissimilarity vector.

The Grand St. Bernard (GSB) SensorScope project, with its deployment of 23 sensors measuring meteorological and environmental data at the Grand St. Bernard pass, was used for evaluation. Specifically, temperature data from five of these sensors was chosen to test the proposed model, which demonstrated promising results.

In conclusion, the paper outlines a promising new model for distributed anomaly detection in WSNs, which shows high detection effectiveness while efficiently using network resources. Future work will involve further testing with multivariate data and more real-world datasets to better assess the model's performance.
