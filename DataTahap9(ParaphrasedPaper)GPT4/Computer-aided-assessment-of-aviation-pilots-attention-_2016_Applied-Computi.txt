This academic paper emphasizes the importance of a pilot's ability to develop situation awareness (SA) that is universal across various types of aircraft systems. Attention has been established as a key component of SA, with studies showing that greater attention leads to more effective pilot decision-making. Although there are many computerized instruments to measure attention, very few are designed specifically for aviation pilots and have validated results published in the scientific literature.

The paper then introduces a computer software that includes a battery of seven tests tailored for assessing the attention factors relevant to aviation pilots. This battery was validated through a study with 50 experienced aviation pilots and a control group of 50 untrained individuals. The results of the study demonstrated the capability of the tests to differentiate between the pilots and the control group. Moreover, the tests allowed for the creation of individual attention profiles which could inform personalized training programs.

Due to limited training resources, such as aircraft or certified simulators, selecting candidates with the highest potential for success is critical. The software presented in the paper assists in such selection by providing a benchmark for cognitive functions specific to aviation pilots. By using the software in conjunction with other psychoattitudinal tests, the most promising candidates can be identified, and the attention profile generated by the software can pinpoint which factors need further development through tailored training programs. Currently, the software has been incorporated into the evaluation and training protocols of several flight schools.
