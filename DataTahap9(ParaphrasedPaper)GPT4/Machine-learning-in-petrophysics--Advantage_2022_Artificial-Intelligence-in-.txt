Machine Learning as an Alternative Approach for Petrophysical Analysis

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a potent alternative to traditional methods for analyzing subsurface petrophysical data. By processing large datasets, ML can extract hidden patterns, rules, and knowledge, proving particularly useful when physical explanations of the data are complex, latent, or unknown. Its flexibility and wider applicability enable it to surpass conventional interpretation models, while also aiding in demanding human tasks like identifying bad data, classifying facies, and segmenting geological features in images.

Petrophysical data, coming from core laboratory analysis or well logging, is typically well-structured and benefits from established physical models. This allows for the effective application and validation of ML algorithms. Xu et al. (2019) classified petrophysical data by source, type, index, and dimension, with core measurements and well logs being the most prevalent in ML application. The specifications of the data may vary according to the objectives of acquisition.

Despite the speed of ML adoption in petrophysics and its broad potential applications, ML isn't a panacea. In certain instances, suboptimal results may arise due to the nature of the problem or the quality and quantity of data available. Before employing ML, one should consider its necessity and cost-effectiveness.

However, the goal of using ML in petrophysics is to aid in business decision-making. Even imperfect results can be valuable, especially when facing data uncertainty and representativeness issues (Ma and Amabeoku, 2015). When physical models are too complex or absent, ML can provide insights with quantified uncertainty, echoing the sentiment that "all models are wrong, but some are useful."

Human ability to interpret high-dimensional data such as arrays, images, waveforms, and 3D volumes is limited. In scenarios where differentiation of mineral content in thin sections or mapping of pore structures in CT scans is required, machines are indispensable.

Yet, ML and human analyses both face the challenge of data representativeness. Outliers and errors within data can be corrected by ML techniques with expert input, but data processed by ML without such corrections may lead to unreliable outcomes. Consistent, accurate, and representative data are crucial for successful modeling.

The accuracy of labeled data used for training ML models is also critical. Inaccuracies or biases in labels, such as core data errors or geologist biases, can mislead the ML model. Additionally, the involvement of physics is vital, especially with small datasets. Physics-informed ML can enhance performance and facilitate data correction and attribute extraction.

Avoiding overfitting is essential for small datasets, and simpler machine learning models are often recommended to prevent fitting noise rather than underlying patterns. Combining expert petrophysical knowledge with ML workflows can add value, leveraging human insights for quality control, data labeling, and model verification.

Although ML has shown enough promise to potentially reshape business practices, it often serves as a complementary tool that must align with physics-based models. It can parallel or, in big data scenarios, outperform traditional models, but it may not always deliver superior accuracy.

For example, in the 2022 SPWLA ML contest, ML's task was to replicate results from a conventional multimineral solver without clear evidence of outdoing it. Interestingly, future advances, such as the use of convolutional neural networks for automated segmentation of geological features from voluminous imagery data, suggest that ML's trend towards automation will introduce groundbreaking applications.

In conclusion, ML offers a powerful alternative in petrophysical analysis but remains a complement to traditional physics-based methods, depending on quality and size of datasets, labeled data accuracy, and appropriate implementation (Akkurt et al., 2018).
