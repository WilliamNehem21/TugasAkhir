The referenced academic paper focuses on the issue of state explosion in model checking and various techniques used to address it. Traditional methods such as symmetry and partial order reduction, bit state hashing (supertrace), and hash compaction are mentioned for their usefulness in lowering the number of states needed to be explored, but they are ultimately limited by the memory capacity of a single workstation. The paper emphasizes that these techniques still fall short when the model checking task requires more resources than a workstation has available, leading to an incomplete verification process.

The paper presents an empirical study on the limitations of the static partition algorithm when used for distributed model checking across multiple processors in supercomputing environments. The study reveals significant load imbalances across processors, resulting in high idle times and overly large search queues, which hinder effective state enumeration and can cause early termination of the model checking due to memory exhaustion.

To address these issues, the authors propose a load balancing algorithm based on Generalized Dimensional Exchange (GDE). This algorithm aims to minimize processor idle time, even though it introduces additional communication overhead. The new algorithm successfully improves the speed of distributed model checking and reduces queue sizes, despite increasing inter-processor communication.

Empirical tests were conducted using a selection of models from a model database chosen for their diversity and relevance to the study. Although not exhaustive of all problem types, these models helped illustrate general observations made by the researchers.

A further technique discussed is state caching, which can reduce the number of messages sent between processors and the associated hash lookups required. The study found that many duplicate states were being communicated due to the same state being reachable from different paths within the model. A direct mapped state cache is implemented on each processor to combat this issue, such that only new states are forwarded to their corresponding processors.

The paper uses the queens8 problem as a case study, demonstrating how the GDE load-balanced algorithm outperforms both the static partition algorithm and the serial approach. It is shown that load balancing leads to earlier detection of errors and requires exploring fewer states. The paper concludes with a consideration of future work, suggesting that future load balancing schemes should autonomously determine the timing of load balancing without user input and processors should avoid idle periods. A deeper investigation into the GDE scheme and other dynamic load balancing methods is also proposed as an avenue for further research.
