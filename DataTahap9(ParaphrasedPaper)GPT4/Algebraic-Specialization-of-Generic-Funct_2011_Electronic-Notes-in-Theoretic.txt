In prior research, we enhanced program specialization and optimization using a rewrite system for generic programs. This paper expands that system to include recursive data types. The approach leverages recursion patterns like folds and paramorphisms, harnessing algebraic laws to drive significant optimizations, and is implemented in Haskell using recent features like type-indexed families.

Generic programming simplifies coding at the expense of performance, as seen with the SYB library running seven times slower than non-generic counterparts due to runtime checks and inherent traversal inefficiencies. Uniplate and Smash are two libraries attempting to address these issues by, respectively, limiting traversal power and moving type checks to compile-time.

Our method diverges by specializing generic functions for specific types in two stages, initially to a non-optimized, point-free form and subsequently optimizing using established laws. However, recursive types weren't supported until now.

This paper's main contribution is extending our specialization to recursive data types, focusing on inductive types expressible as functor fixpoints. We apply well-known recursion patterns governed by algebraic laws, which post-specialization, enable further optimizations, yielding performances near manual, non-generic implementations. We demonstrate this with a type-safe Haskell encoding, utilizing recent language features.

Current implementation limits include only single recursive inductive types, with ongoing research into more complex recursion forms like mutually-inductive or nested data types. The extension to recursive types promises more efficient generic programming for a wider variety of data structures.
