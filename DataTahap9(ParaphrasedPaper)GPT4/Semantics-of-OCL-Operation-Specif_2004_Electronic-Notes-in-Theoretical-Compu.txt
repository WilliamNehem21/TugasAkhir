The paper discusses a framework for operation specification within the context of the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Initially, it presents a scenario where an operation specified to be valid only when 'balance >= limit' fails to represent an actual model of the operation because the precondition is not sufficient. When the precondition is refined to include both 'balance >= limit' and 'balance - amount >= limit', the operation specification becomes achievable.

To build a foundation for understanding operation specifications in OCL, the paper introduces the concept of labeled transitions with output and defines a semantic domain. It defines the conditions necessary for states to satisfy preconditions and postconditions, consequently setting the criteria for what constitutes a model of an operation specification. In these models, preconditions can be relaxed while postconditions are made more stringent. The paper goes on to prove the existence of a canonical model that accurately serves as the semantics for a satisfiable operation specification and aligns with the 'contract view'.

The paper highlights that OCL can express preconditions and postconditions using specific variables, such as 'self', 'result', and method parameters (x1,..., xn). The 'result' variable is unique as it denotes the output of a method call, contrasting with 'self' which refers to the newly created object in the context of constructors.

The authors note that operations can be defined by multiple OCL specifications, forming contracts which clients and suppliers must fulfill and respect, respectively. Suppliers must meet the postconditions of all contracts applicable to the precondition state in which an operation is called.

Furthermore, the paper touches on the concept of inheritance, where operation specifications from a superclass form implicit contracts for the subclass.

Although the paper strives for precision around OCL, some aspects such as in-out parameters, feature overloading, and various parameter types are omitted. It suggests that integrating the discussed concepts into a formal proof environment like HOL-OCL and addressing related proof obligations could be valuable future work.

Lastly, the paper implies that better integration of operation specifications in a modeling environment or tools such as KeY or USE would be an important step forward in practical modeling applications.
