A new algorithm that enhances the mean shift method using a modified histogram is introduced to address the challenges of tracking small infrared targets against complex backgrounds. This updated algorithm utilizes a lower-dimensional, feature-weighted histogram. The similarity between distributions is quantified by the Bhattacharyya coefficient, and the mean shift technique identifies the target's location. To enhance the accuracy and stability of this amended mean shift approach, particle filtering is employed to yield the best estimate of the target's position. Test outcomes indicate that with this refined algorithm, the variance in the tracking point is restricted to a maximum of 2 pixels for the case examined.
