The paper discusses the merging of machine learning (ML) with software-defined networking (SDN) to advance intelligence in diverse wired and wireless network applications, a concept known as Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN). Harnessing ML algorithms to process parameters such as bandwidth, quality of service (QoS), and power can lead to automated and performance-optimized networks. Information like user mobility and velocity can be transformed into knowledge that benefits localization and handover processes.

The notion of autonomous networking is introduced, endorsing self-managing networks that optimize through real-time ML-derived insights, which is particularly crucial for the envisioned 6G networks. Despite its promise, the paper notes that comprehensive research on KDN applications across network layers remains scarce, a gap that the paper aims to fill partially.

The paper reviews several ML applications across various network layers, except for the physical layer, focusing on issues like resource management, networking, and mobility. It details how KDN can be appliedâ€”from the data plane operations to employing protocols like OpenFlow (OF) and Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) for efficient data collection.

The Behavioral Model (BM) compiler and strategies for target-independent compilation of P4 programs are also covered. Moreover, the paper refers to different ML techniques for solving problems in networking, including how regression and classification can be integrated into networking issues.

Special attention is given to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and neural networks, including Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), for their potential to empower network automation. Insight is also provided into transfer learning, enabling knowledge transfer across similar networking scenarios to bolster efficiency.

Several case studies, involving dynamic spectrum allocation, backhaul load minimization, vehicular communication, and other network optimizations, exemplify the practical application of ML to various wireless networking tasks.

Towards the end, the paper discusses the acquisition and utility of training data for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning and debates the use of algorithms like SVM, KNN, and deep neural networks for regression, classification, and clustering within KDN-based networks.

Ultimately, the paper argues for the utility of ML in handling complex datasets and problems, alongside its superiority over traditional optimization algorithms regarding flexibility and adaptability to changing networks, highlighting its importance for next-generation 6G networks.
