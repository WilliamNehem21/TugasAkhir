The diversity of challenges and solutions that abstract interpretation encompasses can vary greatly with the programming language in use and the specific properties being analyzed, which may themselves be dependent on the language. Given its emphasis on semantics, it's understandable that programming paradigms with robust semantic underpinnings, such as functional and logic programming, have historically provided a prolific environment for the development of advanced abstract domains and specialized algorithms for calculating fixed points. Conversely, even though object-oriented programming is increasingly dominant, the work in abstract interpretation within this paradigm remains somewhat piecemeal, possibly obscuring its full potential applications in popular programming languages.

In the realm of class analyses, multiple approaches with varying trade-offs between precision and computational expense have been suggested. For example, Palsberg and Schwartzbach's original study offered a highly precise but computationally intensive analysis for untyped object-oriented languages. Subsequent enhancements by these authors, among others, have yielded faster but less precise class analyses aimed at optimizing the execution of virtual function calls in languages like C++.

Class invariants are a fundamental concept in the high-quality engineering of object-oriented software. These invariants are properties that hold true both before and after any class method is executed. They can be viewed as an abstraction of trace semantics, focussing only on the states at the start and end of method calls for class instances.

Furthermore, in the context of abstract domains, a given abstract domain encompasses all characteristics of a more refined domain, along with additional specific properties. Similarly, an extended class inherits all traits from its base class, along with additional onesâ€”an example of this can be seen in classes representing two-dimensional and three-dimensional points, where the latter inherits from and expands upon the former.
