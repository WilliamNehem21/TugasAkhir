The study administered various doses ranging from 1.82 to 3.23 mg/kg of body weight of mice and determined that a 1.34 mg/kg dose of each tested compound was safe. While all compounds showed inhibitory effects on mycobacterial enzymes, their efficacy was somewhat lower compared to that of streptomycin sulfate, which served as the benchmark. Of all the benzimidazole derivatives synthesized, compound 19 proved to be the most potent anti-tuberculosis agent with inhibition rates of 67.56%, 53.45%, and 47.56% for the enzymes isocitrate lyase, pantothenate synthetase, and chorismate mutase, respectively.

The assay procedure involved adding 39 ml of diluted pantothenate synthetase (PS) to buffer to start the enzymatic reaction in 1 ml volume. The reaction mixture had final concentrations of 0.4 mM of NADH, 5 mM of pantoic acid, 10 mM of MgCl2, 5 mM of Î²-alanine, 10 mM of ATP, 1 mM of potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, and 18 units/ml of PS; all within a 100 ml volume containing a buffer at a pH of 7.8, 1% DMSO, and PS at 5 mg/ml. Following the initiation of the reaction, the mixture was quickly transferred to a microplate reader and absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 12-second intervals for a total of 120 seconds. The test included 16 control wells, with 12 containing the full reaction mix and DMSO and 4 lacking PS. Percentage inhibition was calculated using a specific formula.

To assess cell viability, the cultures were strained with sulforhodamine-B, an aminoxanthen dye mixed in acetic acid for 15 minutes. The cultures were then rinsed with 1% acetic acid to remove excess stain before the absorbed dye was solubilized using Tris base solution, and the resulting color intensity was measured using a spectrophotometer. This assay was conducted with at least three replicates to ensure reliable results.
