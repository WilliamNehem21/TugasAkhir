In the contemporary interconnected world, the widespread adoption of mobile devices capable of installing third-party applications comes with significant security risks such as potential service disruptions, financial loss, and data breaches. The academic community has developed various strategies to mitigate the dangers of untrustworthy mobile code, one of which is runtime monitoring of apps to ensure compliance with established security policies.

The paper discusses a monitoring tool developed as part of the Security of Software and Services for Mobile Systems (S3MS) project, designed for the .NET environment using bytecode inlining. The efficacy of the tool's key algorithms has been both formally validated and demonstrated to be effective in real-world scenarios, applicable to both mobile and larger-scale computing platforms.

A challenge addressed by the tool is identifying security-relevant method calls amidst dynamic binding and delegates, which is complex but successfully tackled using an algorithm created by Vanoverberghe and Piessens. The paper also describes how dynamic binding and inheritance are handled by extending the logic in the Policy Decision Point (PDP) to include the runtime type of an object, not just its static type known during inlining.

To manage potential issues arising from long-running or blocking security-relevant methods (SRMs), the tool introduces strong synchronization. SRMs are partitioned based on the security state variables they access, allowing partitions that access different variables to be locked separately.

The S3MS.NET runtime monitor, developed through the European FP6 S3MS project, forms part of a larger security framework for mobile devices. This framework endorses the security-by-contract paradigm, which supports the development of trustworthy applications.

The paper also contrasts the capabilities of this tool against Code Access Security (CAS), highlighting its advanced expressiveness due to being stateful rather than stateless. This means that the security policies can be dynamic, allowing for nuanced control, such as limiting the number of times a particular method can be invoked.

However, there are limitations to this approach. For instance, it is difficult to monitor and predict the exact amount of network traffic generated due to challenges like DNS lookups and redirects. Therefore, expressing certain policies as security automata over API method calls, such as limiting network data transmission, can be very challenging.
