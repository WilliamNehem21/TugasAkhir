The paper discusses a technique for encrypting images using logistic and Lorenz chaotic systems. This approach encrypts images by altering pixel locations and values, effectively concealing information within carrier mediums to enhance security during transmission. To recover the original image, the decryption process reverses the encryption and employs secret keys for descrambling.

The paper highlights the unique challenges of image encryption, which stem from large data volumes, high redundancy, and the relationships between pixel values. Chaos theory, characterized by nonlinearity, ergodicity, and inherent unpredictability, provides an ideal foundation for image encryption by obscuring information before transmission and allowing secure retrieval via encryption keys. Information-hiding technology leverages human insensitivity to subtle changes and digital signal redundancy to transfer secrets securely.

Experimental results indicate that the proposed encryption technique maintains good randomness in the chaotic sequences. It also significantly increases the difficulty of unauthorized decryption, thereby improving the security of encrypted images. The method's decryption quality is evaluated using a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), with a reported PSNR value of 21.78 when comparing restored and original images.

The study also points out that, compared to previous techniques, the new method offers visual quality improvements, with fewer color discrepancies and no mosaic artifacts. The processing time is faster, with the newer method taking 4.1099 seconds compared to the 15.307 seconds required by previous algorithms.

PSNR, a quantitative measure based on pixel differences, is used to compare the performance of different encryption methods. A high PSNR indicates less distortion and better image restoration quality. According to the paper, the SNR value for the carrier image is 56.36, indicating negligible quality degradation after embedding hidden information. The main differences in the PSNR of the original and restored images occur in areas with significant color shifts and complex textures.
