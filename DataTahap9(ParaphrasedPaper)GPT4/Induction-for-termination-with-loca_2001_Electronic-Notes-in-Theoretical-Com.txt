This academic paper discusses strategies for ensuring the termination of expressions in programming languages that allow for defining such strategies, such as OBJ3, CafeOBJ, and Maude. These strategies involve assigning an ordered list of integers to operators, indicating the order in which subterms should be evaluated for a term with a given top-level operator. For instance, in a term with top operator f, this list would dictate the specific evaluation order of its subterms to guarantee that the evaluation process terminates.

The method proposed in the paper involves proving that specific forms of terms will terminate under the given strategy, regardless of the actual values of the ground terms involved. It assumes that base constants and specific term forms like f(t), zero(t), ite(t1, t2, t3), h(t), i(t), g(t), s(t) are guaranteed to terminate as long as they adhere to the specified evaluation order. For example, in the case of the term i(t), if an induction ordering suggests that i(t) is greater than t, one can assume by induction that t is terminating. Consequently, i(t) must also terminate because i is considered a constructor, meaning it is not the top symbol of the left-hand side of any rule.

The paper lays out a structured approach for applying this reasoning in the form of an algorithm. Additionally, it discusses the notions of rewrite rules, constructors, and defined function symbols, and the concept of an LS-rewriting strategy is formalized. The research then further explores how LS-rewriting is executed, how to determine if a term is LS-terminating, and the elaboration of related concepts such as substitution, ordering, and narrowing steps.

To support inductive reasoning, the paper introduces definitions for abstraction constraints and methods to verify the satisfiability of constraint problems. It also defines a procedure to apply narrowing steps on terms and discusses how to calculate usable rules for terms - the rewrite rules likely to be applied in deriving normal forms. Proving the termination involves finding a simplification ordering that all applicable rewrite rules can adhere to, ensuring no infinite rewrite sequences can occur.

Finally, the paper presents specific lemmas and propositions to support this framework, demonstrating that if a proper simplification ordering exists for the set of usable rules of a term, then all ground instances of this term will terminate. The paper concludes with proof principles and various steps to iteratively abstract and narrow terms until a conclusion can be drawn about their termination.

The significant references in the paper are to works in the field of rewriting logic and its applications, particularly those discussing principles of Maude and evaluation strategy with on-demand flags. It focuses on the formalization, correctness, and exemplification of the rule-based algorithm designed to facilitate proofs of termination.
