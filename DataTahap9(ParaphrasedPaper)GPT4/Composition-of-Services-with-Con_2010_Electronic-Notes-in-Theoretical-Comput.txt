Several contemporary research efforts have been dedicated to employing finite automaton-based frameworks to solve issues surrounding the combination of web services. In references [18, 17], a formal model is proposed that defines web services composition in BPEL using state transition systems, including both communicative and invisible (internal) actions. Further developments of this model incorporate elements such as a knowledge base and a theoretical framework. These methods have been implemented in real-world scenarios as indicated in references [24, 12, 11]. References [1, 21] explore web services outlined by PWL-S documents, employing guarded finite automata for modeling. A comparable line of investigation is conducted in another study, which also defines web services in BPEL. In another instance, the authors of a study use input/output automata to model the interfaces of web services that are described in BPEL, OWLS, and WSDL.
