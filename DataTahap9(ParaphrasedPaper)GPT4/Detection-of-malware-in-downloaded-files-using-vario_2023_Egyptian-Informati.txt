The prevalence of malware compromising critical computer data has soared dramatically as a result of files acquired via the internet, making system infection a matter of seconds. As these infiltrations grow, automated analysis becomes a necessity for institutions and cyber security firms striving to mitigate financial fraud through pattern analysis for effective detection systems, despite the uncertain timeliness of such defense strategies, putting users at risk.

A stark example of malware is ransomware, which hijacks data demanding payment without guarantee of data restoration or non-distribution. Critical data storage on electronics has seen a 74% rise in malware spread in 2022. Malware attacks have been linked to broader socio-economic and political conflicts, with hackers using malware to steal data and disable systems, affecting various industry sectors. In 2021, numerous breaches impacted from government to business sectors.

The study by N. Udayakumar and others explores how machine learning can detect and classify diverse malware types, utilizing such data features as debug size, export size, and image version. Three algorithms - decision trees, multilayer perceptrons, and multi-support vector machines - were used, with neural networks displaying utmost accuracy, up to 99% on test datasets. Debug size emerged as a crucial, highly-correlated feature.

Previous machine learning models in malware detection were limited, but this work expanded the repertoire, now able to identify a wide array of malware, including trojans and ransomware, using supervised methods like logistic regression and random forests, as well as unsupervised methods like K-means clustering.

Datasets from numerous online sources were merged to form a substantial dataset, containing essential features for malware recognition. Deep dataset familiarity enabled selecting relevant features and identifying patterns. Supervised models outperformed unsupervised ones, with random forests showing high accuracy. Balancing techniques like oversampling and balanced bagging improved accuracy significantly - up to 99.96% with decision trees and 99.50% with random forests.

Numerous machine learning models were trained on this dataset with oversampling, undersampling, and synthetic minority oversampling techniques to balance it. The effectiveness of five models was compared, proving better than past research, highlighting the necessity for continuous model optimization, hyperparameter tuning, and balance.

In conclusion, traditional antivirus methods are inadequate against sophisticated threats like polymorphic malware, but machine learning, through static or dynamic analysis, could offer robust cybersecurity solutions.
