The academic paper examines the effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on grape development, particularly focusing on the roles of Abscisic Acid (ABA), auxins, cytokinins, ethylene, and Gibberellic Acid (GA3) in regulating growth and ripening. Additionally, it investigates how these hormones, with varying functions and activity peaks, can impact the coloration of grape skins.

Where berry firmness and detachment were concerned, the researchers used a fruit texture analyzer (penetrometer) with a 2 mm diameter probe to measure firmness, and a hook to measure the force required for separation; both metrics were presented in Newtons (N). The team also documented the percentage of berry shattering and the extent of rachis browning, along with the water loss and color of the berries. Color analysis was conducted through ImageJ software, which provided Red-Green-Blue (RGB) signals to calculate the hue angle of the grape clusters.

The results indicate that physical qualities of the berries, such as firmness and water loss, can be markedly influenced by treatment with vitamin B12. It is suggested that B12 may play a role in enhancing the wax layer on berry skins, which serves as a protective coating to prevent dehydration. Berries receiving the highest B12 treatment appeared to have increased wax production.

Additionally, berries treated with B12 exhibited antioxidant properties, likely contributing to the protection of berry cells and tissues by scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This antioxidant action may help maintain cell membrane integrity, leading to reduced water loss and lower berry shattering rates.

The study observed that the B12 treatment maintained the appearance of the stem and pedicel, potentially by protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage during the storage period. This protective effect of B12 is seen up to the fourth day of shelf life.

Regarding the shelf life of the berries, the content of beta-carotene (b-Car) and Total Anthocyanin Content (TAC) peaked on the second day after which it declined. The high concentration of B12 (9 mM) seemed to activate metabolic processes favoring vitamin A production, while also boosting TAC due to the activation of anthocyanin precursors like cyanidin, peonidin, and their derivatives in the berry skin and pulp. At the same time, the decrease in chlorophyll content may be attributed to the senescence and deterioration of the berries over the shelf life, enhancing the visibility of TAC towards the end of the experiment.
