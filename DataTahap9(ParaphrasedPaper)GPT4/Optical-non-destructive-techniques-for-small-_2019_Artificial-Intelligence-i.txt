This review paper discusses the application of various non-destructive optical techniques for assessing the quality and safety of small berries, such as strawberries and blueberries, which are popular for their taste, appearance, and potential health benefits, including anti-cancer properties. The authors cover methods such as visible-near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy, computer vision systems, hyperspectral and multispectral imaging, laser-induced methods, thermal imaging, and their roles in ensuring that these fruits meet quality and safety standards.

A key challenge identified is the lack of spatial information in spectroscopic techniques, which some researchers try to address by using spatially-resolved spectroscopy. However, these methods may still be insufficient for analyzing nonhomogeneous biological materials. Computer vision, in contrast, can provide spatial dimension analysis to assess external qualities, such as color, shape, and size, of heterogeneous samples.

The review also acknowledges the complications of varying natural light conditions on image analysis and mentions advances such as stepwise algorithms and the use of flash lighting to counteract these issues. For small berries, successful sorting of bayberries using computer vision and evaluating appearance quality of gooseberries to enhance export opportunities are highlighted as examples of the technique's utility.

The authors anticipate future research to focus on multi-dimensional vision techniques, for instance, using 3D scanners for fruit measurement and computer vision combined with different light sources, like ultraviolet, to extend the capabilities of the vision systems.

The discussion moves on to laser-excited techniques, mentioning studies that have explored quantifying specific compounds in blueberries using laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy and laser air-puff instruments for assessing fruit firmness.

Other techniques considered include photoacoustic spectroscopy for various applications, from evaluating pesticide residues to comparing ethylene gas release between organic and nonorganic berries, emphasizing the potential of the technique for further study due to the opaque nature of biological materials.

X-ray techniques, which are popular in security inspections, have been used in food and agriculture to detect pest infestations, inspect foreign bodies, and analyze internal fruit structures. For example, the ability to differentiate between frozen and defrosted berries using X-ray imaging is noted, along with challenges related to handling large image data volumes.

A limitation is mentioned regarding terahertz (THz) reflectance spectroscopy for blueberry quality evaluation due to the fruit's curved surface, with further research needed to address technical hurdles such as attenuation by water and scattering by inhomogeneous media.

Acknowledgments at the end of the review credit funding sources and contributors who have supported the research, including THz experiments, and express gratitude towards professionals from various institutions.

In summary, this review paper presents a comprehensive overview of the diverse optical non-destructive techniques used to assure the quality and safety of small berry fruits, outlining current capabilities, challenges, and potential areas for future development.
