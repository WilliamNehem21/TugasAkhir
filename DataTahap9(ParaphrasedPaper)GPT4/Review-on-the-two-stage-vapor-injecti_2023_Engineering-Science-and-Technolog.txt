The growing need for a higher standard of living has led to increased building energy consumption, and in response, air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) have become popular for their lower installation costs and renewable energy use. However, ASHPs face challenges when operating at high-pressure ratios, which can cause high discharge temperatures, oil degradation, and compromised compressor performance. Consequently, research efforts are directed at expanding the efficient operational range of heat pumps.

Vapor injection systems have emerged as a promising solution to address the issues associated with large compression ratios in heat pumps. By injecting vapor at an intermediate pressure, two-stage compression with vapor injection cools the refrigerant between compression stages, which lowers the compressor discharge temperature, broadens the operating temperature range, and enhances heating performance and the coefficient of performance (COP).

Experimental studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of vapor injection, particularly for heating, where vapor injection has a more pronounced impact on the condenser than the evaporator. Scroll compressors are commonly utilized for this technology due to their ease of incorporating injection ports and the ability to fine-tune the injection pressure. However, their performance can suffer under varying operational conditions, leading to investigations into alternative compressors, such as rotary and twin-screw types.

Comparative research shows that two-stage compression systems with vapor injection can outperform traditional single compression systems, particularly at specific pressure ratios. The benefits of intermediate heat exchangers (IHX) and flash tank (FT) systems have been examined for their influence on improving COP, with IHX systems allowing for greater operational flexibility.

The role of intercooling and subcooling in enhancing heat pump performance, as well as the impact of specific heat capacity on COP, has been widely studied. The paper discusses the challenges of measuring intermediate pressures within compressors and suggests control strategies for managing vapor injection systems' performance, including the use of thermostatic expansion valves (TXV) for IHX systems and model-free real-time control strategies, such as extremum seeking control (ESC), which offer cost-effective and optimal control for the FTC cycle.

Overall, while one-compressor quasi-two-stage systems present simpler and more reliable options, they cannot match the efficiency of genuine two-stage systems in extreme conditions. The research continues to refine vapor injection technologies and control strategies to enhance the performance and reliability of heat pumps in diverse operation scenarios, although direct control of injection quality remains a challenge in practical applications.
