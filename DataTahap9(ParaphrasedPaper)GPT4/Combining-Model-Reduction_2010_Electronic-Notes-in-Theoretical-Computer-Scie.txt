This academic paper discusses the issue of combinatorial explosion in molecular biological models, particularly when dealing with protein complexes and their modifications, which result in a vast number of distinct chemical species. This complexity makes it challenging to generate explicit quantitative semantics or compute their properties. To address this problem, the paper proposes model reduction techniques that change the observation granularity to simplify the models.

Specifically, the paper puts forward two frameworks that unify model reductions. It introduces a symmetric product operator to merge model reductions in stochastic semantics and presents a method for further abstracting reduced differential systems using linear projections. These approaches are utilized to refine the quantitative semantics of models expressed in the kappa language, taking into account the symmetries of protein binding sites.

Moreover, the paper discusses signaling pathways, the interactions among proteins that facilitate intracellular and intercellular communication. A combinatorial blow-up in the number of distinct chemical species characterizes these pathways, but rule-based modeling provides a compact way to represent these systems by using context-free rules that eliminate the need to specify every potential context for an interaction explicitly.

The framework is applied to models written in kappa, with a focus on the operational semantics of kappa and the definition and use of symmetric sites to further reduce the state space dimension of stochastic and differential semantics. The paper reviews a generic framework designed to reduce the stochastic semantics of weighted labeled transition systems through backward bisimulations that identify statistical invariants, which can then be used for lumping states together in a method they term weak lumping.

The authors propose a new operator to combine abstractions, defined as a span when two abstractions are from the same weighted labeled transition system (WLTS) and as a cospan when they are going into the same WLTS. This new operator captures the most abstract version of the two individual abstractions that still retains key properties.

Lastly, the paper provides an overview of the core kappa language using a process-like notation and operational semantics, intentionally omitting additional features like internal states and agent creation/deletion for the sake of theoretical simplicity. The integration of model reductions aims to simplify the analysis and understanding of complex molecular biological systems by reducing their inherent combinatorial explosion.
