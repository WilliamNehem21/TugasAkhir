Tom and Apigen are two software tools designed to streamline the handling of abstract data types. Tom extends Java with additional capabilities for pattern matching, in a way that's both data structure-agnostic and compatible with Eclipse. Apigen generates implementations of abstract syntax trees and works seamlessly with Tom. This paper discusses the enhancement of the Eclipse platform to support Tom programming by adding a specialized Tom editor, automating the build process, and managing errors, thereby fostering the use of formal methods within the Eclipse community.

Furthermore, Tom is adaptable to C programming and focuses on simplifying the description and transformation of structured entities such as trees or XML documents. It operates as a compiler that translates pattern matching constructs into native Java or C code. Another significant aspect of Tom is its support for list matching which is beneficial when performing tasks such as sorting algorithms on lists. Tom's abilities also extend well into XML processing, offering a syntactical approach familiar to those working with XML data.

The paper emphasizes the experience of developing a Tom plugin for Eclipse, highlighting how the flexible framework of Eclipse simplifies the integration process. Features such as syntax coloring and error reporting have been designed to bolster Java's existing facilities with Tom's functionalities.

Notably, the integration of Tom in Eclipse has been impactful in the educational sector, making it easier for students to focus on core algebraic concepts. On a practical note, the case study with CRIL technology group demonstrates how the Tom plug-in significantly improved the development of automation tools for timed automata.

Lastly, the authors compare Tom to other systems that integrate pattern matching into imperative languages, emphasizing Tom's generic approach and its non-intrusive nature, which makes it more adaptable to language updates. Despite similar initiatives to integrate Java extensions into Eclipse, the paper suggests that Tom's incorporation is more complete, offering better error management in the programming environment. The authors conclude by expressing interest in extending these advancements to the C language using the CDT tools within the Eclipse framework.
