Symbolic model checking has emerged as an effective method for verifying complex finite state systems, capable of handling systems exceeding 10^20 states. The central concept revolves around the use of propositional formulas to represent very large state sets in a compact way. The primary tool for implementing these formulas is Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), which have consequently become a crucial structure in contemporary VLSI CAD systems.

In the context of a game like checkers, individual pieces called men can only move forward diagonally, one square at a time. They have the ability to capture opposing pieces by jumping over them to an empty square, with multiple captures allowed in a single move so long as the jumped pieces are adjacent and the landing squares are unoccupied. Men cannot leap over their own pieces.

To represent the transitions within the states of the game, we require a duplicate set of binary variables: one representing the current state and one for the next. As a result, the total count of binary variables becomes double the number needed to represent the game's state configurations. The total number of possible game scenarios can reach a maximum value calculated by the formula 2^(3 * (n^2 + 1)) + 1.

Each possible game state aligns with a distinct assignment of binary variable values. The complete set of states of the Kripke structure is defined as all the possible variable assignments, which is not explicitly listed due to the impractically high number of combinations. The initial game state is depicted by variable assignments representing the starting board position, with variable 'm' indicating that it is the black pieces' turn.

Finally, problems with a regular pattern, such as the game of American checkers, are often more efficiently encoded when using a variable ordering that reflects this regularity. This is due to the consistent game board structure and the fact that each move involves a small number of adjacent squares with consistent rules, including possible promotion from a man to a king. In such cases, a regular diagonal variable ordering aligns well with the game's intrinsic symmetry.
