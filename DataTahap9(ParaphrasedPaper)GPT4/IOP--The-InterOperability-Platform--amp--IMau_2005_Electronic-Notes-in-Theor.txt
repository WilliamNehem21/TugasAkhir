The Maude system is a high-performance computational model founded on rewriting logic and possesses many sophisticated features. Interaction with Maude is traditionally achieved using a command-line interface. To interface Maude with additional tools or alternative visual presentations, users typically craft custom solutions, including scripts in languages such as Perl or leveraging graphical toolkits like Tcl/Tk.

Rover, a visual component, represents a controllable graphical object with a known position and orientation. It can react to user inputs, such as mouse clicks and keystrokes, as well as messages from other IOP actors. The IMAUDE actor supports mobility, and similarly, the graphics actor must handle messaging with its graphical objects. Initially, communication with the Rover is defined by a specific syntax and coded in Java. Future objectives include creating a universal syntax for interactive graphical elements and developing module transformations to showcase system behavior animation.

Communication between actors is text-based, consisting of two layers: the user layer and the transport layer. In the transport layer, a message is a text line indicating a number followed by that amount of bytes of data. The user layer, built upon the transport layer, includes the recipient actor's address, the sender actor's address, and the message content, each on a separate line.

The graphics actor is an initial effort towards a graphical algebra, establishing a connection between Maude's algebraic data types and corresponding graphical objects that are interactive. Defined objects include graphs, menus, text, grids, containers, and sprites. They are described with a Lisp-like syntax, as are messages to active graphical objects.

To create user interfaces, a read-eval-print loop is utilized. This loop [inq, s, outq] features inq and outq as input and output streams and s as the system state that persists across interactions until loop termination. Maude's tokenizer interprets input as a list of quoted identifiers and vice versa for output.

The operation "qid" transforms a string to a quoted identifier, and the same variable name is reused for clarity. An example rule in Pathway Logic Assistant module demonstrates how to display a previously saved graph with annotations and display characteristics.

The IOP/IMAUDE effort focuses on transitioning from a declarative functional language to an interactive system while maintaining clear semantics and facilitating tool interoperation. Interaction semantics for actors provide the underlying semantics for Maude actors, and functional reactive programming (FRP) is noted as an alternative approach, extending functional languages with interactive features.

ToolBus, a software coordination framework, interprets interactions between tools using a process algebra-based scripting language. Integrating tools into ToolBus requires adapters for data and communication protocol translation.

IOP's coordination model is based on asynchronous message passing, primarily using strings for communication. IMAUDE leverages Maude's metalogical expressivity to program coordination scripts. Adaptors might be developed based on ToolBus concepts, with the choice of external representations like graphs being context-dependent.

IOP is an infrastructure managing an array of actors, including basic communication actors, a graphics actor, and adapted versions of Maude and PVS tools. IMAUDE supports defining behaviors for the Maude actor. IOP's application in the Pathway Logic project is for biological network modeling and experimentation, and its future evolution will be driven by its use in various ongoing and prospective Maude endeavors.
