The paper discusses the implementation of an interpreter, written in Haskell, which can handle various evaluation strategies. It was melded with profiling tools to examine how different evaluation approaches affect the performance of certain parallel skeletons in the programming language, Eden. The goal was to move beyond the initial experimental evaluations and conduct a more thorough and formal comparative analysis.

Key contributions of the paper include broadening the range of evaluation strategies that blend aspects of both laziness (deferred computation) and strictness (immediate computation), and formalizing each evaluation model. Even though the experiments are based on Eden, the fundamentals and conclusions can be applied to other parallel functional languages.

The structure of the paper is as follows: An introduction to parallelism in Eden is provided, followed by a description of the calculus used in the analysis. The third section classifies potential evaluation strategies and divides them into three concepts. Next, a distributed operational semantics for the calculus is introduced in the fourth section, formalizing previously defined evaluation strategies. The fifth section offers examples to demonstrate how evaluation strategies might impact issues like program termination or deadlock. The concluding discussion summarizes the findings about combinations of laziness and eagerness and suggests directions for future research.

The paper also touches upon the pivotal question of distributing computation between processes or between a parent (producer) and child (consumer) in a parallel language. This aspect is not unique to Eden, though Eden provides additional avenues for exploration.

Specifically, a problematic example is discussed where, under certain conditions (free variables evaluated to weak head normal form before copying), the program execution fails to terminate, indicating an underlying communication issue between processes.

The paper acknowledges the challenges with curry able parameters inherent in Eden and suggests two approaches to address the issue, one preserving currying and the other being less elegant but more straightforward for programmers.

Future research directions include applying the techniques to other parallel functional languages, such as GpH, and expanding the calculus to encapsulate additional features of Eden, like streams. This expansion would enable a comprehensive analysis of the implications of different evaluation strategies on Eden's skeletons.
