Regarding Lemma 5.4, the conclusion would naturally result from Theorem 5.2 if the combination of being star-shaped, co-recursively enumerable (co-r.e.), and closed ensured that the collection of star-points, denoted S(A), was also co-r.e. Yet, it was previously demonstrated that this inference is invalid, even for uncomplicated, compact 2-dimensional sets.
