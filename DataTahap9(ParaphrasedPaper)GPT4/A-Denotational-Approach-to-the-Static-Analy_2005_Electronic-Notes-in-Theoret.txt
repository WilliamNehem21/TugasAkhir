In this study, we introduce a static analysis technique that is not uniformly applied to evaluate the term-substitution characteristic within spi calculus-specified processes. This characteristic is crucial for identifying security issues such as confidentiality and authentication violations. Our analysis approach is wholly denotational, which means it maintains the principle of compositionality and is easily adapted for functional programming environments.

Our analysis considers cryptographic operations as they relate to how processes handle values. Term substitution is an important action in both term-passing and term-processing that can reveal security flaws in processes. Such substitutions can happen during operations like communication, successful decryptions, signature validations, and the deconstruction of data structures. Security risks emerge when a process at a lower security level gains access to high-security information, resulting in an information leak, or when a high-trust process receives data that should be classified at a lower level, leading to an authenticity issue.
