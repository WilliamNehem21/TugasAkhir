The specified transformation functions h and g should be designed to apply uniformly to any given input string w, ensuring they have the capacity to create any possible input string. This requirement entails an inherent nondeterministic characteristic of the process. Nevertheless, this is not an issue since the transformations are permitted to be noninjective, meaning that different input elements may yield the same output.

In regards to the study findings, it's worth noting a few points. Specifically, Theorem 7.3—which covers the scenario of biprefix morphisms—was originally proven in an earlier work. More recently, however, a new proof has emerged that is more straightforward and educational in its approach. In this recent proof, it was demonstrated that the parameter p can be assigned a value of 2.
