The academic paper describes Delphin, a functional programming language designed to support the development and analysis of complex dependent higher-order datatypes. Delphin operates on two levels: the data level, which uses the Logical Framework (LF) to manage dependent types and higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), and the computation level, which provides tools like case analysis and recursion for data manipulation.

Delphin is a versatile language useful for general programming as well as for formalizing proofs due to its robust metareasoning capabilities. It is particularly effective for projects such as the Logosphere project, which aims to create a digital library of formal proofs and facilitate the translation of mathematical proofs between different proof systems.

Terms in Delphin at the LF level are enclosed in angle brackets, while computation-level expressions are not. Different types of types are used within Delphin to distinguish among LF types, parameter types, and computation-level types. Parameter functions in Delphin can handle dynamically introduced parameters, utilizing the 'params' keyword to specify the parameters accepted.

Furthermore, the language supports implicit arguments and a coverage checker to handle exhaustive checks of cases in functions, as well as a termination checker to confirm function totality. Functions that pass the coverage checker and are terminating can also be interpreted as proofs.

The paper also highlights a prototype termination checker, based on lexicographic extensions of ordering, that excludes implicit arguments. Delphin includes a case study of Mini-ML, demonstrates a Hindley-Milner style type inference algorithm, and depicts the operational semantics, value soundness, and type preservation proofs.

Comparatively, Delphin can support parameter functions that Twelf cannot, as Delphin's meta-logic is higher-order, allowing Delphin to express extensions naturally using the 'with' keyword.

Lastly, Delphin offers an interactive loop for development, error/warning message reporting, integration with tools like SML of New Jersey, and the ability to pretty-print expressions. Users can load LF signatures, execute Delphin files, and control the coverage and termination checkers for experimentation and debugging.
