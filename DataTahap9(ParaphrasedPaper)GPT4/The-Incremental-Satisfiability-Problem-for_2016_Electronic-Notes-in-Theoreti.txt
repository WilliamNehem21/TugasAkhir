The automation of human intellectual activities, particularly reasoning, represents a significant scientific challenge, as it taps into one of the more advanced aspects of cognitive thought. A crucial issue within automated reasoning is the propositional entailment problem, which has implications across a range of applications in artificial intelligence, including belief revision, abductive reasoning, logic-based diagnosis, and other AI tasks. 

The logic entailment problem is notoriously difficult, classified as co-NP-hard even when restricted to propositional logic. Nevertheless, certain subsets of propositional logic, notably the Horn clauses, yield to more efficient automated reasoning techniques. This paper introduces a new approach to address the entailment problem between conjunctive normal form expressions and applies this method to the incremental satisfiability problem (ISAT). ISAT involves determining whether a body of knowledge remains satisfiable when new conjunctive clauses are added to it. 

When evaluating a 2-conjunctive normal form formula with a partial variable assignment, if contradictory unit clauses emerge, then the number of models (#SAT) for the modified formula is zero, indicating the formula is unsatisfiable. This is because contradictory unit clauses cannot be satisfied simultaneously under any circumstances. 

Several methods have been employed to tackle ISAT, including variants of the branch and bound algorithm such as the incremental Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (IDPL) approach. Unlike the standard DPL algorithm, IDPL retains the search tree created for the initial clause set when new clauses are integrated. This makes IDPL substantially more efficient than DPL for many satisfiability problems. 

This summary paraphrases the themes and findings from the paper "Chaff2004: An Efficient SAT Solver" by Mahajan, Fu, and Malik, as presented in the revised selected papers from the 7th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2004), held in Vancouver, Canada.
