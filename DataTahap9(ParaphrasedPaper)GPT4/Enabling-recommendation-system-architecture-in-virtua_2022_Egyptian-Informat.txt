This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews previous research in the field. The proposed system is thoroughly described in Section 3. Section 4 details the experimental framework used to assess the proposed system's effectiveness and includes a summary of the results. The paper concludes in Section 5, presenting possible avenues for future study.

The study also addressed challenges such as the lack of real-time assistance during quizzes and absence of an online support agent. The Virtual Agent (VA) in the Enhanced Learning and Recommendation Architecture (ELRA) mitigated these issues, and the recommendation feature lowered the risk of selecting unsuitable courses. Consequently, individuals in the experimental group, which comprised students, instructors, or virtual agents, reported higher satisfaction levels compared to those in the control group. Furthermore, a parametric analysis indicated that users of ELRA were more satisfied than those using traditional methods, with a satisfaction rate exceeding 50%, in contrast to less than 50% for users of traditional approaches.
