The academic paper discusses the potential of modern machine learning methods to create cyber threats that can evolve and become resistant to standard security measures. These threats could adapt to the specific characteristics of target information systems through a pseudo-evolutionary process, gaining complex heuristic and swarm-like behaviors.

To address this emerging challenge, the paper emphasizes the immediate need to model and analyze the spread of these advanced cyber threats to devise effective defensive strategies. Existing research models the dynamics of cyber threats using methods like autoregression and Fourier analysis, which can forecast the path of an infection. However, for critical computer networks, it is also essential to consider models that account for the blocking of network nodes in response to the detection of threats. The Cayley tree structure is an example of such a model that helps calculate infection probabilities of nodes based on their network position.

The paper also presents a study of an active viral cyber threat's impact on a high-availability cluster within a theoretical framework that includes Markov processes, graph theory, and mathematical analysis. The authors contribute a formalized, computationally efficient method for approximating the average number of elements in a target cluster affected by a cyber threat. To support their research, they received data from the Vinnytsia City Council's IT department in Ukraine, which oversees a critical information and communication system.

The article provides a Markov model of the threat's impact on a high-availability cluster, a compact metric for accurately assessing the average number of affected elements, and a method for estimating parameters of this metric. Moreover, the authors propose a criterion for evaluating the trend of the model's quantitative parameters over medium to long timeframes.
