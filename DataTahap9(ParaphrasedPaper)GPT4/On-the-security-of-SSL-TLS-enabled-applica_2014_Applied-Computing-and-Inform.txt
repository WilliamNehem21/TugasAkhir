The paper's structure is summarized as follows. In Section 2, the SSL/TLS protocol is reviewed, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on applications secured by SSL/TLS are discussed, and existing countermeasures for these types of attacks are outlined. In Section 3, a new method for protecting SSL/TLS applications against MitM attacks is introduced. Section 4 evaluates this new approach and compares it with existing methods. The paper concludes in Section 5.

Regarding One-Time Passwords (OTPs), an OTP is a single-use passcode typically printed on a piece of paper or card, known as a scratch card, which is securely sent to the customer. Once the customer uses this OTP to log into the system, it becomes invalid, meaning an adversary gains no advantage from obtaining a used OTP. Consequently, each subsequent login would require a new and unique OTP.
