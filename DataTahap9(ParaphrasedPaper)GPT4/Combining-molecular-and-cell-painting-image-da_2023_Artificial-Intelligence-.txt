The paper discusses the benefits of integrating multiple data sources to predict the mechanism of action (MoA) of compounds, which is how they produce their pharmacological effects. The study examined the combination of Morgan fingerprints (structural information) and cell painting image data (morphological information) to improve MoA prediction for 10 well-represented MoA classes. Using deep learning models, the paper reports that combining both datasets yielded a significant improvement in predictive performance, with a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.92 on a test set, compared to 0.58 and 0.81 when training on structural and image data alone, respectively.

The paper also refers to prior research indicating complementary strengths of different assays for MoA prediction, including cell painting, L1000 gene expression profiling, and chemical structure data. Machine learning algorithms beyond deep learning, particularly on smaller datasets, demonstrated competitive performance.

In their experimental setup, the authors used high-resolution cell painting images of U2OS cells treated with compounds and converted SMILES strings of chemicals into structured data for their models. Despite finding blurred images, they retained them, citing blurring as a common data augmentation technique.

Finally, the authors pointed to the potential of further enhancing prediction models by integrating transcriptomics data and exploring other forms of chemical structure representation, acknowledging the prevalence of polypharmacology in biological systems. They assert that their study is the first to combine molecular fingerprint data and five-channel fluorescence cell painting image data with deep learning for MoA prediction, highlighting the importance of using raw images for improved model accuracy.
