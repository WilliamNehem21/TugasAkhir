The academic paper discusses the increasing adoption of AI-driven technologies in businesses, focusing on the use of chatbots, particularly ChatGPT developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT leverages a large-scale transformer-based language model called GPT to simulate human-like conversations through Natural Language Processing (NLP). It was trained on diverse online interactions, enabling it to provide instant and quality customer support.

The paper suggests that ChatGPT can enhance customer experiences and human-computer collaboration. It introduces the PSI (Priority Significance Index) and COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment) methodologies for ranking the benefits and uses of ChatGPT in business operations. The paper encourages a clearer and more detailed presentation of these methods and their merits for this analysis.

Sections 2 and 3 of the paper cover an extensive literature review and the research methodology. Section 4 discusses data analysis and results, while Section 5 interprets these findings, with Section 6 concluding and discussing limitations and future research directions.

The COPRAS method, created by Zavadskas and Kaklauskas in 1996, ranks alternatives by considering multiple criteria and assigning importance and utility value to help decide the most advantageous option.

The paper highlights how ChatGPT can improve customer interactions by providing timely and personalized responses. Satisfied customers can lead to increased loyalty, repeat business, and positive referralsâ€”all crucial for business growth.

However, the study acknowledges it does not address potential implementation challenges for ChatGPT, such as data privacy concerns, technical issues, or diminished customer trust. No full cost-benefit analysis or risks of automating customer support with ChatGPT is provided.
