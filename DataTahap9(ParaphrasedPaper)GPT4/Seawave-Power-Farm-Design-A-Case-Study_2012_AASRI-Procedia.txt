The academic paper outlines the process of designing a power farm optimized for energy extraction off the coast of Western Sicily. Experimental data concerning the energy density of sea waves in the northwestern part of Sicily, within the Mediterranean Sea, was utilized to fine-tune both the individual converters and the overall farm layout.

The paper presents the approach used to simulate the converters, where a recognized numerical model for inverters was employed. Key parameters taken into account in the simulations include the ripple on the DC link, the operational time for each inverter, and the consistency of power generation. Multiple simulation runs were executed, each subjecting the generators to a variety of waveforms as detailed in the paper. The characteristics of each generator correspond to the specifications mentioned previously.

The numerical results of these simulations and the methodology for optimizing the power farm are further elaborated within the paper.
