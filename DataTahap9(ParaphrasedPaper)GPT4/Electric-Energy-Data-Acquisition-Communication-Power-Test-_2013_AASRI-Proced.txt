The original passage discusses the integration of smart electricity applications into China's smart grid, focusing on an electricity data acquisition system that acts as a communication bridge between power providers and users. The system being described includes a testing section with three positions for testing different carrier modules and emphasizes the need for high-speed and precise sampling of voltage and current signals. The measurement section is managed by a microcontroller and uses specific hardware to collect real-time data. Communication protocols and interfaces are detailed, highlighting the use of a serial interface for data collection and instruction interactions with a PC. The microcontroller utilizes a real-time operating system (RTOS) called UC/OS-II. Additionally, there are functions for assembling and interpreting data packets, CRC checks, and simulating various aspects of the data acquisition process.

Here is a paraphrased version of the excerpt:

The implementation of smart electricity tools and the collection of electric energy information are crucial for the advancement of China's smart grid infrastructure. Such applications rely on the data acquisition system of electricity, which essentially serves as a communicative link between the energy supplier and consumers.

The evaluation area includes three testing stations designated for testing the concentrator carrier module, the module for the three-phase meter, and the module for the single-phase meter or collector. To accurately replicate the power characteristics of the carrier modules being tested, the system demands rapid and precise sampling of voltage and current, which are seen as continuous signals.

The measuring component is governed by a microcontroller, tasked with the real-time assessment of current and voltage signals. Central to the measurement device is the microcontroller, which, alongside the CS5550 chip, the ADR431, and an analog switch, acquires current and voltage in real time.

The CS5550, a Cirrus Logic chip, is outfitted with two A/D converters and a comprehensive serial interface for A/D conversion. The CS5550 interfaces with the microcontroller's SPI and is configured to measure current and voltage from the carrier module, with one converter dedicated to current and one to voltage, using a voltage divider for the latter.

For communication protocols, UART interfaces with the three-phase meter carrier module and emulates its communication protocol. Another UART interface connects to the module that collects carrier communication data, simulating its acquisition protocol. The interface connected to the PC compiles instructions and records data.

The microcontroller's measurement apparatus runs on the UC/OS-II system. This trimmed, preemptive RTOS is highly portable and well-suited for microprocessors and controllers, offering robust real-time system performance.

PC interactions occur through a serial interface, collecting data packets that include start and end markers. Upon receiving a complete data packet, a CRC check is performed, after which commands are parsed, and responses are dispatched.

The task of simulating the data concentrator involves sending data to the concentrator carrier module and activating its transmission state to measure energy characteristics. This task, along with others like it, is executed in a model employing both tasks and interrupts, similar to the PC interaction process. Tasks for collector and meter simulation use a corresponding approach for emulation.
