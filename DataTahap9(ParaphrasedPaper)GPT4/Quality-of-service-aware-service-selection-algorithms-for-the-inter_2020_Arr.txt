The paper reviews various strategies for service selection and composition in cloud manufacturing and IoT (Internet of Things) environments, examining the strengths and limitations of current approaches. Specifically, it discusses research that categorizes selection criteria, algorithm types, and other aspects affecting service quality but notes gaps such as limited consideration of IoT-specific challenges and QoS (Quality of Service) factors.

Bouzary et al. categorized approaches in cloud manufacturing but did not adequately address IoT environments. Hamzei et al. surveyed methods in IoT but missed certain QoS aspects relevant to IoT architecture. Asghari et al. reviewed IoT service composition, examining functional and non-functional QoS factors without full acknowledgment of IoT architecture's heterogeneity.

Aoudia et al. assessed dynamic composition, security, and other criteria in IoT but lacked detailed explanations. Dongre et al. studied various QoS parameters without examining solution techniques. The paper also introduces a new classification method, discusses design and implementation solutions, and proposes performance evaluations for service selection algorithms (SSAs).

In dynamic service selection, the paper notes that real-time changes present a complex challenge that must consider various factors, such as time constraints and correctness. An architecture proposed by Li et al. for QoS in IoT incorporates traditional QoS attributes with IoT-specific characteristics like energy consumption and information accuracy.

Various methods, including simulation and prototyping, are employed to evaluate SSA performance. Heuristic, meta-heuristic, hyper-heuristic, and non-heuristic algorithms are considered across different IoT layers, addressing a range of optimization goals. Some studies also examined the energy efficiency and security in QoS optimization.

The paper follows with a comprehensive analysis of different research contributions, specifying algorithms and methods employed across IoT layers, and presents performance evaluations for these algorithms. It suggests extending research to encompass broader optimization algorithms and encourages constructing a representative QoS dataset for IoT environments.
