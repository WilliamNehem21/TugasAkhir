Sweet oranges, also known as Citrus sinensis, belong to the Rutaceae family and are popular for their nutritional and health benefits, which may explain their early acceptance in international trade despite their perishability. These fruits are rich in vitamin C, have notable amounts of vitamin A, folate, and fiber, and are free from fat, sodium, and cholesterol, contributing to various health benefits such as immune function, bone health, eye health, and DNA synthesis, while potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Although red acalypha (Acalypha wilkesiana) is recognized for its antimicrobial properties and used to treat bacterial and fungal infections, its effectiveness in preventing decay in sweet orange fruits and as a comparison to chemical biocides has not been explored. Within this study, microscopy techniques were employed to examine fungal growth, while the red acalypha leaves were collected and authenticated at Osun State University, Nigeria. The leaf extract was prepared using previously described methods.

Various concentrations of the red acalypha leaf extract were prepared to test their efficacy against fungal pathogens of sweet oranges. Most of the tested fungal strains were susceptible to treatment, with the extract demonstrating potential as a powdered fungal biocide for field application. Despite the overall high efficacy, susceptibility varied among the fungal species. Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium species, known to be major fruit deteriogens, were prevalent in the study, with Aspergillus niger identified as the most pathogenic. However, not all fungi were capable of causing deterioration in the fruits, an area requiring further research.

This study showed that red acalypha leaf extract could effectively control fungal-induced decay in citrus fruits, similar to chemical biocides, presenting an alternative for preservation, particularly important for regions with limited access to advanced harvesting and storage facilities. The research did not receive specific grants but thanked Osun State University for material support and acknowledged an individual for proofreading the article.
