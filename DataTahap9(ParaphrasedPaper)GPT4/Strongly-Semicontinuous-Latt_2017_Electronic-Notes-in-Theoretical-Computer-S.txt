This paper presents a novel category of complete lattices termed "strongly semicontinuous lattices." These lattices are positioned between semicontinuous and continuous lattices. The authors determine that a complete lattice L qualifies as strongly semicontinuous if and only if it is both semicontinuous and meet semicontinuous. The paper establishes certain versions of the strong interpolation properties for the semiway-below relation within these lattices. Furthermore, the authors provide characterization theorems through various distributivity laws and approximative identities, revealing that strongly semicontinuous lattices share several characteristics with continuous lattices. Additionally, the authors offer a carefully constructed counterexample to demonstrate that not all semicontinuous lattices are strongly semicontinuous.
