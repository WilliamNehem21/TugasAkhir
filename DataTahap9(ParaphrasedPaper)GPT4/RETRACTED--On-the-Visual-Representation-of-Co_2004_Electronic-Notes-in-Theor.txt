Graphical illustrations are typically associated with conceptual understanding and idea generation rather than as tools for rigorous formal proofs. While visual representations are often used during the exploratory phases of research, empirical justification has taken precedence over analytical justification when it comes to the formal presentation of proof in mathematics or logic.

Many errors can arise when graphs are improperly relied upon in constructing logical proofs, as this may lead to reasoning that is guided by the visual aspects of the graphs rather than by foundational axioms. There is a concern that the use of pictorial methods represents a flaw within formal reasoning systems.

However, researchers such as R. Bardohl, Isabel Luengo, and Miller argue that the issue does not inherently lie with the use of graphical tools, but rather with inadequate semantics and syntax when they are used. They claim that a formal, graph-based reasoning system can be devised, complete with its own semantics, syntax, and rules for inference. Such a system can ensure logical soundness, avoiding the generation of fallacies.

Fallacies in graph usage often arise when incidental properties of a visual graph are mistaken for its substantive features. A clear and well-defined system of syntax and semantics for graphs could therefore prevent such logical missteps.

In specific terms of mathematical or logical systems, any row or column—or a path within a system labeled mroute—can be removed. Similarly, a part or subdivision of a row or column can be erased, and any cell that does not serve as a junction of an mroute or intersection of a row and column, and is not part of a subdivision, may also be erased. It is required that if an mroute is erased, any markings that identify this mroute should be erased as well. This rule presumably contributes to maintaining the integrity and coherence of the formal system being described.
