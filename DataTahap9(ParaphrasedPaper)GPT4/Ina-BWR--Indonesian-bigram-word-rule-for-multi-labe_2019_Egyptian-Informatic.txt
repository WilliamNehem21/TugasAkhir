For students, Twitter is a social platform for sharing personal experiences, expressing emotions, and seeking support from peers. Chen's study examined Twitter data to understand the challenges students face in their academic lives. The findings could help educational institutions identify at-risk students and provide appropriate support. Using social media as a data source to detect academic struggles is a relatively new approach compared to traditional methods that rely on data like demographics, academic performance, and social networks.

In his research, Zhang identified seven factors contributing to student issues: personal, family, peer, academic content, faculty, institutional, and societal factors. Focusing on four primary categories—personal challenges, relationship issues with family and peers, academic subject difficulties, and problems related to institutional personnel—Chen developed a new method to extract complaints in these categories from English-language tweets.

The study introduces an Indonesian Bigram Word Rule (INA-BWR) to address limitations of traditional bag-of-words approaches, which can miss the order of words and grammar nuances. INA-BWR is designed to understand multi-label student complaints in Indonesian tweets, involving pre-processing informal text (e.g., removing hashtags and correcting slang), identifying complaint sentences using bigram rules, and matching complaints to objects based on four tailored corpuses: personal, relationship, subject, and institutional agent.

The research aimed to create Indonesian-language corpuses related to student complaints and offer an Indonesian pattern rule to aid future research. Two novel contributions include new pre-processing methods for multi-label student complaints and the introduction of INA-BWR to identify complaint subjects more effectively.

During the first semester, common student complaints classified under "subject" included workload and difficulty with the material, while "relationship" complaints centered around romantic issues, making friends, and homesickness. Complaints involving "institutional agents" focused on faculty-related issues like delays or absences.

Previous research on Twitter has explored numerous areas, such as sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and topic modeling. There is a significant body of work in Indonesian opinion mining, involving subjectivity detection, orientation classification, and target recognition. The Indonesian Natural Language Processing Toolkit (INaNLP), with modules for various text processing tasks such as formalization and tagging, supports this research.

Ultimately, the study found that transitioning to university life is a unique challenge for first-semester students, highlighted by their social media postings. The research proposed INA-BWR as an improved method to understand these challenges and identified ways to better capture student concerns by enhancing text processing and adopting a semantic approach. This enhancement leads to better accuracy in capturing student complaints about personal, academic, and relationship issues, although further improvement is necessary for complaints about institutional agents. Combining INA-BWR with existing best-practice methods could offer the most accurate insights into student complaints.
