The article emphasizes that principal ports of cells are fundamentally different from auxiliary ports because transformations, referred to as rewritings or interactions, can only occur at principal ports. Specifically, an interaction rule involves a pair of cells linked via their principal ports, with the interaction altering cell labels and reorienting these principal ports, analogous to the cell turning.

Remark 5.3 clarifies that an invariant net is made up of a network alongside a specific partitioning of its free ports, noting that multiple invariant nets may derive from a single network. Furthermore, a network can be classified as invariant if it admits such a partition.

Despite having defined constants, pipes, duplication, and addition within the uniform subsystem, the paper suggests it is unlikely that multiplication can be defined similarly. The addition operation, described as binary exclusive OR (XOR), does not encompass the complete functionality of binary addition, which calculates both the sum and the carry. It is argued that constructing a uniform system with universality is implausible.

The paper goes on to describe how invariant nets with various inputs and outputs could be designed for vectorial Boolean functions with multiple inputs. These invariant nets can be integrated into systems that process binary words by employing the 'split' and 'merge' nets to transition between parallel and serial formats.

Lastly, the proposed system is posited as a strong contender for a universal computation system within the realm of hard interaction nets. Yet, this research presents just an initial foray into the field, leaving numerous fundamental and practical questions awaiting exploration.
