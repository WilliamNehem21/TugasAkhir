Social VR platforms have recently gained traction for fostering social presence and enhancing interaction in distance education. Yet, understanding VR's impact on learning requires further exploration, particularly regarding off-the-shelf VR applications utilized over longer durations.

In this qualitative study, amidst COVID-19 campus closures, 35 master's students engaged with the AltspaceVR platform for university seminars and group work over six weeks. Post-experience interviews with 23 students revealed that Social VR offers a more natural, dynamic communication compared to videoconferencing, boosting feelings of presence and community, with overall high acceptance for educational use. Activities that benefited most from VR's interactive nature were small group tasks. Despite positive feedback, students noted VR limitations such as image resolution issues, lack of note-taking functionality, and discomfort from extended use.

The findings suggest Social VRâ€™s significant potential for enhancing online education's social dimension while also highlighting areas for improvement to integrate this technology within higher education effectively. These insights contribute to a limited but growing body of research on VR's role in education, particularly through extended use and with larger groups. Future research should continue to explore the diverse impacts of VR on learners and address topics like platform effects, privacy concerns, and habitual use adaptations.
