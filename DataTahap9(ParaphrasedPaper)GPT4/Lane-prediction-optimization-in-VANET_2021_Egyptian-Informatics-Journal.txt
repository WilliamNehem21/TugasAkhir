This paper discusses how limited visibility of heavy vehicles in certain lanes can impact a driver's decision-making when choosing a lane to switch to. Assuming a driver in lane four has the option to move to lane two but is blocked, the driver might revert to the original lane or opt for lane three if it has more space. The paper underlines the importance of anticipating lane-level traffic data upstream to enhance mobility and inform drivers' routing decisions.

The paper introduces a metric, 'avsud,' representing the average frequency of sudden actions, like harsh braking or unexpected lane changes at high speeds, observed for each vehicle. A high 'avsud' suggests a greater potential for abrupt traffic pattern changes. Traffic scenarios are evaluated, with preferable options being when the 'decider vehicle' moves quickly without surrounding vehicles that frequently exhibit sudden lane changes or hard braking.

An essential component of the discussed system is Road-Side Units (RSUs), which analyze traffic and advise drivers on the best lane to ensure reduced travel time. Simulation results indicate that the system performs well, with improvements in congestion ranging from 12.5% to 20%, especially in heavy traffic with rich informational inputs.

Additional experiments show the benefits of the system in operation compared to when it is off, as it helps reduce delays. The impact of the number of origin-destination announcements (ODAs) is also examined, demonstrating more ODAs result in more available information, which aids in making better decisions.

Finally, the paper suggests that future work should explore the security aspects of the system to enhance its robustness. The referenced study is by Yuan, Scholten, and Van Lint and was presented at the 2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems.
