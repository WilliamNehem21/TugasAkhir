To handle the diversity, independence, and conflicting interests among varied participants in a multi-agent system (MAS), governance structures have been established, which prescribe norms or rules that all entities within the system must adhere to. These norms are designed to direct agent behavior by specifying what they are permitted to do (permissions), required to do (obligations), and not allowed to do (prohibitions). Norms address the challenges posed by agent autonomy and their differing goals and desires. Recent studies have explored the relationship between these norms and system architectures.

Agents in a MAS can have various architectures:

Simple Reflex Agents: These agents use condition-action rules to determine their actions based on current perceptions from the environment. A subsystem processes the perceived information to select an action from predetermined options that the agent then executes.

Model-Based Reflex Agents: Similar to simple reflex agents in their use of condition-action rules, these agents maintain an internal model of the environment to help them deal with situations where not all information about the environment is visible. They use a "next function" to update their internal state based on new perceptions, which then guides them to select their next action.

Utility-Based Agents: When multiple goal states exist, these agents use a utility function to determine the desirability of particular states, aiming to optimize their actions based on the current goals. They expand upon the capabilities of goal-based agents.

The extension of TAO focuses on representing the internal architectures of agents together with the static components of a norm. Templates are used to define the properties and relationships of each element within a metamodel layer. A norm template presents a "norm class" to specify restrictions on resources, detailing the common properties and relationships of all norm instances.

To integrate the concept of norms into TAO, changes are necessary. The traditional concepts of rights and duties are replaced by permission and obligation from deontic logic. Thus, these deontic concepts are incorporated into templates for goal-based and utility-based agents.

The MOISE+ organizational model expands upon the original MOISE by considering roles, plans, and norms from an organization-centered viewpoint. It can express permissions and prohibitions for roles within an organization but has limitations: it doesn't define agent properties, allow norms for agents and environments, support sanction definitions, nor fully support heterogeneous internal agent architectures.

The OPERA organizational model differentiates between the organization's structure and agent behavior. It can specify norms related to obligations, permissions, and prohibitions for agents, roles, and groups, and includes norm activation constraints. OPERA, however, does not model the structural elements of agent organizations, only supports punishment (not rewards), and does not restrict agent behavior in environmental contexts.

TAO+ facilitates the representation of both the structural and dynamic properties of MAS entities alongside the static elements of norms, encompassing deontic concepts, involved entities, actions, activation constraints, sanctions, and context. This allows for the modeling of normative MAS with varying agent architectures.
