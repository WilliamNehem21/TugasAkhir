Two models were developed to predict wheat yield on a field scale using optical sensors, both exhibiting promising results with RMSE values of 0.001 t/ha and 0.136 t/ha for a holdout group. Their performance was consistently strong across three datasets as confirmed by scatter plot analysis. This method is particularly valuable since field-scale yield predictions are not commonly available but essential for developmental projects.

However, the application of visible and infrared spectra (VIS) for crop yield prediction faces challenges in three main areas: sensors (issues like cloud coverage, missing satellite orbits, and image distortions), data (lack of long-term yield records), and statistics (complex relationships between predicting factors and yields). Critical growth stages of crops yield the most useful images for predictions, with a study showing a strong correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and yield, particularly after heading and full inflorescence.

This study aims to overcome such challenges using four approaches incorporating the Gapfill algorithm with Sentinel-2 (S2) sensor data, consideration of crop phenology, a tilling method within the Gapfill framework, and assessment of yield predictions from cloud-restored images through seven machine learning and ensemble methods, hypothesizing that these techniques, individually and combined, can effectively predict winter wheat yields.

Data preparation for Gapfill required a four-dimensional array of spatial, seasonal, and annual indices. Field-collected wheat yields from 67 farms over two years and two commonly used fertilizers (urea and NPS) were included to enhance prediction methods. An algorithm ranks sub-images for prediction based on their values, and empirical quantile levels are assigned to observed values at target pixels, which aids in estimating a pixel's value.

The study used a cross-validation method to compute Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and assessed the visual coherence of restored datasets. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) were tuned and employed among other algorithms, with RF showing particular robustness against outliers even in small datasetsâ€”a trait valuable for this study's observation size.

Despite rigorous application of ensemble machine learning methods, which typically involve multiple algorithms for superior performance, the study found no significant improvement over single algorithms. This may be due to limited diversity and small data set size, which affects stability. The study emphasizes choosing appropriate hyperparameters and considers RF's capacity to handle non-linear and outlier data as a possible reason for its solid performance in this context.

The study acknowledges challenges such as the relatively new availability of S2 sensor data and the high computing demand due to the sensor's high-resolution images. Even so, the Gapfill method was effectively applied, with regression analysis showing that including restored observations could enhance prediction skill most of the time.

In summary, the study confirms the potential of combining Gapfill and machine learning techniques for wheat yield prediction, despite certain challenges, particularly with cloud coverage and small data sets. The results, while not superior with ensemble methods, indicate that individual machine learning models, particularly RF and GLM, performed optimally with strong agreement between model outputs and observed data.
