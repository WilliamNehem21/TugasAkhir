This academic paper reviews research studies on cattle identification using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The systematic literature review (SLR) posed seven research questions to guide the investigation.

The paper gathered 731 articles from various databases, refined through inclusion and exclusion criteria based on relevance to cattle identification using ML/DL, publication type, and language. Data extracted from the selected studies was organized in a spreadsheet to concisely capture the essence of each article, including research goals, datasets, and challenges faced.

Traditional cattle identification methods like ear notching and tagging were found to have limitations, thus advancing the use of ML and DL, which can process larger datasets with higher accuracy. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and the YOLO object detection model, alongside its improved versions like YOLO-v2 and YOLO-v3, were highlighted for their capabilities in cattle identification. The paper also notes the use of other object detection models such as Region-based CNNs (R-CNNs) and variations like Fast and Faster R-CNNs.

Creating standard benchmark datasets was identified as a challenge due to the absence of uniform data standards, as was the need for efficient feature selection methods for large datasets. Moreover, certain breeds of cattle presented unique identification opportunities through their patterns. While advanced deep learning models exist for object detection, their application to cattle identification is still limited, offering room for further research and development.

The study cautions against model overfitting, which reduces performance on new datasets, and suggests using techniques like data augmentation and cross-validation to mitigate the issue. Implementing cattle identification in real farm environments, especially for beef cattle which are often found in open environments, presents a challenge that the maturity of IoT technology might help solve in the future.

The research acknowledges limitations in the search method, which could have potentially missed relevant studies. However, the authors claim this does not undermine the review's main objective, which is to provide a comprehensive overview of ML and DL applications in cattle identification.

The conclusion emphasizes the anticipated importance of automated and real-time cattle identification systems in livestock farm management and the need for further research to develop these systems.
