This study investigates the integration of decision-making and machine learning approaches in evaluating and selecting football players based on their attributes, such as physical, technical, tactical, and behavioral characteristics. It aims to understand how this selection impacts both the financial and sporting performance of football clubs. Player selection being a complex task, involves considering a myriad of criteria that demand simultaneous evaluation, including both sporting abilities and financial implications. The research seeks to identify the key criteria used by decision-makers in forming team line-ups and to predict how these selections might affect the club's sporting and financial outcomes. Decision-making methodologies can support the recruitment and selection of suitable players, while machine learning algorithms are proposed as effective tools for forecasting the consequences of these choices in terms of sports and financial performance.

To establish a thorough understanding of the topic, the study includes a systematic literature review (SLR) of not just academic journal and conference papers but also books and book sections pertaining to sports management and decision-making. The review focuses on complex and in-depth studies that respond to three or more research questions, aiming to convey a more comprehensive approach without disregarding the value of less extensive research.

The report is structured in four sections: The first section examines the link between managerial-financial and sports performance. The second section outlines the main criteria and sub-criteria for player selection, such as technical skills, experience, goal-scoring average, team coordination, moral and behavioral attributes, and social prestige. The third section discusses the decision-making methods that aid in tackling player selection issues. The fourth section introduces hybrid models that synthesize all technical and economic aspects to guide decisions on ideal team composition.

In particular, the paper references a two-phase approach for player selection, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to prioritize player attributes followed by a 0-1 integer linear programming model to determine the best players for inclusion in a team. Another highlighted tool is PlayerRank, a machine-learning-based framework enabling scouts to assess, search, rank, and recommend players using a vast database of match records.

The study recognizes the need for improving decisions by using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) alongside machine learning. Additionally, it suggests future research directions that could involve incorporating biometric and psychological data to improve predictions, exploring artificial intelligence techniques for enhanced transparency in decision-making, and applying these methodologies across different sports for wide-ranging results.
