The paper describes support vector machines (SVMs), a machine learning algorithm capable of classifying compounds into different classes, like active or inactive, by mapping them into a high-dimensional space wherein these samples can be linearly separated. Kernel functions handle the mapping and determine the shape of the boundary that separates the classes. This method is effective in predicting chemical and biological properties due to its robustness against complex and noisy data sets, although it can be computationally demanding.

Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) are introduced as a solution to the vanishing gradient issue in deep neural networks (DNNs), with their ability to directly pass positive inputs while zeroing out negative ones. This has made ReLUs a prominent choice for activation functions in various DNNs, aiding in easier and often superior model performance.

The paper also explores geometric deep learning (GDL) approaches used in predicting how ligands bind to protein targets. These approaches involve initially forming a mesh that defines the shape of the molecular surfaces involved in binding and representing the ligands as undirected graphs. Independently processed by residual graph convolutional neural networks, the features from the targets and ligands are combined to model their interactions.

Moreover, the document discusses the optimization of multi-task learning (MTL) models through bespoke aggregated loss functions suitable for sparse data. These models are refined via transfer learning that employs a larger dataset to learn general features, which are then fine-tuned for a smaller, specific dataset.

In the field of multi-objective optimization (MOO), it's crucial to translate chemical and biological properties into mathematical objectives, using techniques like scalarization and the Pareto method to handle multiple objectives simultaneously.

The paper touches on the Chemical Checker platform, which organizes data into five complexity levels, from chemical compounds to clinical outcomes. These levels help streamline drug discovery processes like target identification.

The concept of dominance in solutions is also explained. Non-dominated solutions are those that cannot be improved on one objective without worsening another, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balance in objective functions.

When considering molecular similarity for drug comparison, the paper underscores the significance of shape and electrostatic properties. Sometimes combining multiple drugs with varied mechanisms is necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, as single drugs may not suffice. The paper references a study on the human kinome targeted by FDA-approved multi-target drugs and reviews the use of synergistic drug combinations against SARS-CoV-2.

Lastly, the paper cites two studies that apply deep learning and machine intelligence to traditional Chinese medicine, exploring novel computational modeling techniques to unravel the rules and pharmacodynamic characteristics of drug combinations.
