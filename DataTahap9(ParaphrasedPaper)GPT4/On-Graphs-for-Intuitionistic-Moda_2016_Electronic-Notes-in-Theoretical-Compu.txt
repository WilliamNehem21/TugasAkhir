In this paper, we introduce a graph-based method for delving into the world of intuitionistic modal logics, offering a singular and uniform set of tools to depict, evaluate, and contrast Kripke-style semantics. This innovative method leverages the adaptability of graph calculi to clearly and instinctively represent the semantics of possible worlds within intuitionistic modal logics. Demonstrating the practicality of these concepts, we apply them to select well-known instances of intuitionistic multi-modal semantics.

We have developed graph calculi which use diagrams as their elements. The rules of these calculi allow for the transformation of diagrams in a way that visually encapsulates the semantics of modal operators and the relationships of accessibility between them. These graph calculi serve as versatile and standardized frameworks that facilitate the investigation of Kripke-like semantics regarding the conditions for the truth of propositions (satisfaction conditions), the identification of universally true propositions (valid formulas), among others, in the realm of intuitionistic modal logics. To exemplify these ideas, we look at two case studies that reference logics discussed in previous literature.
