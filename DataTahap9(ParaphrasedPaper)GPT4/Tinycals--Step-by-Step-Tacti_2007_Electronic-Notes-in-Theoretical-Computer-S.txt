The academic paper discusses the challenges of working with procedural proof languages in interactive theorem provers like Nuprl, Isabelle, Coq, and Matita 4. These systems rely on tactics, commands that move a proof forward, which are executed atomically, making them hard to understand and debug due to limited feedback.

The authors propose a new approach called "tinycals" to replace tacticals, the traditional method for combining tactics, to achieve more granular execution steps. The tinycals system is designed to make the process more transparent by providing richer intermediate feedback to users. However, this approach is only relevant to systems that don't exclusively use declarative proof languages, and particularly benefits those systems which allow procedural scripts to be embedded within declarative proof steps.

When debugging, the traditional tacticals often return error messages related to an inner status unknown to the user, making correction difficult. The paper suggests using tinycals to tackle this by providing a more intuitive step-by-step process that better integrates with user interfaces, supports tactics with side effects, and improves proof scripting and maintenance. It introduces the syntax and semantics of tinycals, while also acknowledging that some tacticals cannot be covered by tinycals and need independent re-implementation.

The paper is structured into sections that detail the syntax and operational semantics of tinycals, the implementation in Matita, a discussion of tacticals not covered by tinycals, related work, and final conclusions. The authors emphasize the need for a proof status to represent the logical status of a current proof, and a goal used to index conjectures. Tinycals are shown to have advantages over LCF tacticals in terms of unstructured syntax and step-by-step evaluation, which facilitates user understanding and interaction during the proof development process.
