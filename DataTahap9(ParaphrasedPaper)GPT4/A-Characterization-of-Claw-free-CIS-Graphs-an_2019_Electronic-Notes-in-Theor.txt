Theorem 2.3: For a graph H without isolated vertices and G being its line graph (denoted by L(H)), G is a CIS graph (each vertex is contained in a unique maximal clique) if and only if H contains no subgraph that is similar in form to a "bull" (a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges) and every maximal matching in H is "absorbing" (every edge not in the matching is adjacent to an edge in the matching).

In the paper, the authors investigate the properties of claw-free CIS graphs (graphs without a "claw"—a three-branching star—and where each vertex is part of a unique maximal clique). They introduce several lemmas providing necessary conditions for a claw-free graph to qualify as a CIS graph. For example, the "gem" is a specific type of graph created by taking a 4-vertex path (P4) and adding a vertex that connects to all others (a universal vertex).

Previous research by Kloks and colleagues identified that the category of graphs which are free from claw, gem, and W4 (wheel with four vertices) is identical to that of "dominoes" — in these graphs, each vertex is in no more than two maximal cliques. It's important to note that these dominoes are the line graphs of multigraphs that do not contain triangles.

Combining this with lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 from the paper leads to the following result: To affirm that a particular question (Question 1) holds true for claw-free CIS graphs, the authors prove a property of weighted randomly internally matchable graphs, a conclusion derived directly from a previous characterization of such graphs in Theorem 3.3. This argumentation relies upon specific definitions introduced in their text.
