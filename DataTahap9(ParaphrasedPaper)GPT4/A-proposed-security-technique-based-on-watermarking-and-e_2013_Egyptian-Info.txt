The paper discusses various watermarking methods designed to ensure the integrity and privacy of medical images without altering their diagnostic value. Specifically, it introduces techniques for embedding data within an image that allow for the original image to be fully restoredâ€”this is known as reversible watermarking.

To safeguard medical images, a technique is described that divides the image into a region of interest (ROI) and a region of non-interest (RONI), embedding the ROI within the RONI. This enables detection and self-restoration of any unauthorized modifications. Another section describes using an adaptive data hiding scheme employing integer wavelet transform, aiming to minimize distortion in the watermarked image, though it shows limitations in imperceptibility and application to color images.

The paper further proposes a block-based authentication watermarking technique for distributing medical images, offering an efficient and secure method for authentication of fragmented image blocks.

Additionally, a lossless watermarking technique interlaces critical patient data with the image, ensuring a high level of security, albeit the technique may lead to detectability due to changes in the image's statistical properties.

Another proposed method uses an original image decomposition followed by the embedding of a watermark and is particularly useful for ensuring authenticity during the medical image acquisition process. This technique, however, offers a very low embedded capacity.

Highlighting a scheme based on image classification and histogram shifting, the paper suggests this technique can offer high embedding capacity with low distortion. Moreover, it discusses a security technique that combines encryption and watermarking, achieving high capacity and high peak signal-to-noise ratio, yet risking detectability due to statistical changes in the image.

The paper also illustrates a technique that aims to preserve image integrity without altering unused parts of the image, potentially offering enhanced security.

Finally, the paper suggests future work could improve watermarking techniques, including increasing the amount of data that can be embedded and employing different encryption methods to ensure greater security and authentication within medical information systems.
