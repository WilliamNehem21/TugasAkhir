The paper discusses the notable rise in cybersecurity breaches, with 2020 being the worst year on record as incidents surged to a troubling 36 billion. It highlights the necessity for effective cybersecurity policymaking to address and minimize security threats and ensure business continuity. The research proposed within the paper combines risk assessment with the ISO/IEC 27001 cybersecurity framework to guide policymakers in developing more robust IT security systems. The authors introduce a model that evaluates the threat level against ISO/IEC 27001 compliance to prioritize threat mitigation strategies.

This model also simplifies decision-making by mapping ISO/IEC 27001 domains to threat mitigation priorities, focusing on the impact of threats and framework application on business continuity. The model's effectiveness is validated through security testing and a statistical evaluation, using a significance level (p-value) to compare system conditions before and after implementing the IT security recommendations. Additionally, the paper covers governance factors in information security, risk management strategies, framework readiness, asset management, and technology aspect evaluation.

A cybersecurity attack is defined as any illicit activity by cybercriminals targeting computers or networks, employing methods like brute force, port scanning, malware, phishing, spam, ransomware, denial of service (DoS), among others.

The research adopts the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle to structure the problem-solving process. The 'Do' phase incorporates a hybrid method combining the OCTAVE Allegro risk analysis technique with ISO/IEC 27001 framework compliance evaluation. The approach includes identifying areas of concern to create a detailed risk profile for IT assets.

Risks that are neither accepted nor mitigated immediately are termed "deferred," monitored, and re-evaluated in the future. The "correlation layer" integrates the outcomes of risk analysis and cybersecurity framework compliance evaluation, determining priority values for threat mitigation strategies by calculating relative threat and evaluation scores.

Lastly, the study uses R programming language to quantitatively analyze the impact of the implemented security recommendations. With a significance level set at 5% (0.05), a normal distribution is indicated if the p-value is greater than 0.05. The paper determines that data before and after implementation are normally distributed, based on p-values of 0.6469 and 0.2037, respectively.
