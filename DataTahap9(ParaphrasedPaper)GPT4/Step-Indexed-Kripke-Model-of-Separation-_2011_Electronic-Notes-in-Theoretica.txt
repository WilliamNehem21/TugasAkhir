We introduce a specialized version of separation logic aimed at simplifying the reasoning about concurrent programs that involve dynamic allocation and manipulation of locks and the creation of new threads. The assertions in this logic are based on a Kripke model that operates on a recursively defined set of possible 'worlds,' and soundness is established via a relation to the standard operational semantics of concurrent programs. This approach resolves the complex issue of circular dependencies, which occurs when the lock invariants that describe the state of the memory are themselves stored in the memory that they describe.

Our logic facilitates the understanding that resource invariants are coupled with locks, which are passed between threads as the locks are acquired and released. However, due to locks being dynamically stored in the heap they are meant to protect, we must address a challenging circular situation for demonstrating the soundness of our logic.

In our method, we provide a simplistic yet potent solution to these semantic and soundness concerns, directly addressing the circularity problem. We illustrate our approach using a simplified programming language, which intentionally does not allow the release of either memory cells or locks, thereby avoiding the need for a complex system of fractional permissions used in some previous approaches.

To describe lock properties within our logic, we use two predicates: `ex(e, p)` and `locked(e, p)`. The predicate `ex(e, p)` states that the expression `e` evaluates to a heap-allocated lock with the resource invariant `p` with no assumption about the lock's availability, while `locked(e, p)` additionally asserts current ownership of the lock by the thread.

Our handling of heap sharing differs from traditional methods used in concurrent separation logic. Rather than having a generalized shared space accessible to all threads, our logic incorporates copies of the shared memory values into individual private spaces, aligned with the scope of the lock variables. This ensures that locks and their associated resource invariants remain within the knowledge of a limited set of threads, enabling more precise reasoning.

Soundness of our logical rules is proven using strong induction on the index of the safety predicate, evaluating each rule's proofs by breaking down various definitions and ensuring safety after possible state transitions. We also outline a principle that governs cases where state changes occur in threads that have recently undergone execution.

Future enhancements to our work may include adding more language features like storable procedures, which should be seamlessly integrated. Moreover, our soundness proofs seem well-suited for formalization and machine-assisted verification efforts, possibly leveraging existing work by researchers like Benton and others.
