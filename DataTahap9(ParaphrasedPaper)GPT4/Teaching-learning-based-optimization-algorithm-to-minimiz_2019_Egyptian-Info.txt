The paper discusses the significance of image thresholding, particularly focusing on the use of cross-entropy in multilevel thresholding for image segmentation. It proposes the use of the Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm to identify an optimal set of threshold values across different levels to minimize the cross-entropy. The TLBO approach is modeled after educational interactions where students learn from a teacher and each other. This method, termed as the TLBO-Based Minimum Cross Entropy Thresholding (TLBO-based MCET) algorithm, aims to determine the best threshold combination to segment images accurately.

The paper evaluates the performance of the TLBO-based MCET on standard test images, comparing it with other established algorithms such as Firefly-Based Minimum Cross Entropy Thresholding (FF-based MCET), Honey Bee Mating Optimization-Based Minimum Cross Entropy Thresholding (HBMO-based MCET), and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Minimum Cross Entropy Thresholding (Quantum PSO-based MCET). The evaluation uses two key performance metrics: Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and uniformity. Results of the experiments suggest that the TLBO-based MCET is an effective and viable method for finding the optimal threshold values at different levels, specifically at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th levels.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the TLBO algorithm, Section 3 details the proposed TLBO-based MCET algorithm, Section 4 discusses the performance evaluation, and Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

The TLBO-based MCET is reported to outperform other methods in terms of uniformity and fitness value, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving adequate solutions based on the minimum cross entropy criterion. Hence, the TLBO-based MCET is presented as a competent strategy for optimizing threshold combinations at various levels for image segmentation.
