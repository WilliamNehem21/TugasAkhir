The paper presents a new program logic tailored for HAL programs with a focus on explicit time resource bounds. This logic ensures that programs comply with invariants defined in assertions while also providing a specific limit on the number of function calls before completion. The authors anticipate its application in real-time systems where exact execution time is crucial.

Unlike other logics, their logic can handle complex uses of function pointers, including recursive functions and higher-order functions. These elements are verified collectively or independently, contributing to the overall compositional verification of program termination. The authors also successfully use step indexing to offer a more concise approach to resource bounds logics.

The core of the logic includes rules that dictate how functions with pointers are verified. These criteria include: recognizing a termination measure "t," ensuring that a function precondition "pl" is met and that a corresponding postcondition "ql," when combined with an argument "a," satisfies the overall postcondition "q."

The paper acknowledges that while the program logic has strengths, it also has limitations: the upper bounds on resources provided might not be tight, and specifying explicit termination measures can be burdensome for users only interested in termination. They suggest that employing well-founded relations might be a more user-friendly approach.

Additionally, the paper discusses the use of semantic assertions within the programming language syntax, recognizing them as part of a broader category of instructions that integrate logical formulas into program code.

In conclusion, the authors introduce a program logic that can reason about the total correctness concerning time resource bounds in programs with function pointers. The logic's soundness is proven against an operational semantics model that uses step-indexing, validating the effectiveness of step-indexed models for resource logics.
