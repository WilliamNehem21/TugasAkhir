In this academic paper, the authors present an advanced development of pure bigraphical models by incorporating a concept proposed by Jensen and Milner, referred to as "kind." They introduce "kind bigraphs," an extension that generalizes the idea of atomic and non-atomic controls in a bigraph, by allowing a control to include a subset of the total controls.

The innovation by Jensen and Milner involved assigning each node in a bigraph a specific "kind," which dictates the set of controls that its nodes can include. The authors have built upon this idea, formally developing and validating that kind bigraphs extend pure bigraphs while preserving much of the foundational theory. The modification involves defining a control within a signature to hold a subset of the entire set of controls within that signature. This amendment enhances the modeling accuracy for complex systems, such as smart buildings, and also incorporates the concept of "sorting" for modeling finite CCS processes. Kind bigraphs maintain essential construction properties for creating labels for a bigraphical system's canonical labeled transition system (LTS) and ensure that bisimulation over this LTS remains congruent. Reaction rules in kind bigraphs are found to be more expressive than those in pure bigraphs.

The authors note the relevance of modal logics, which account for both time and space, in verifying some specifications that pure bigraphs cannot. They express interest in exploring how the additional structure in kind bigraphs could facilitate a modal logic to meet certain specifications.

The fundamental building blocks—the objects and arrows of specific categories—are defined as interfaces and kind bigraphs, respectively. Kind bigraphs are similar to pure bigraphs, with two key differences: controls in a kind bigraph must adhere to those specified by the signature, and during composition, the sorting of roots and certain leaves in the place graphs must make sense. The authors employ a "forgetful functor" to demonstrate that these adaptations do not compromise the valuable properties of bigraphs.

Central to bigraph theory is the notion of relative pushouts, akin to pushouts in capturing minimal overlaps, and they contribute significantly to the operational semantics within the LTS of the theory. The paper outlines the existence of these constructions for kind and fitting bigraphs, with complete proofs provided in a technical report.

Their expressiveness is exemplified by the ability to prevent certain controls from appearing in reaction rule parameters, something not expressible in pure bigraph theory. The authors showcase this by describing a scenario in an office building where key holders and thieves interact with locked and unlocked doors according to specified reaction rules, demonstrating the added expressiveness and potential for modeling flow-control dynamics.

Finally, the paper aims to define a modal logic that would allow the proof of certain conditions within this scenario, such as a thief eventually accessing an unlocked room despite all doors initially being locked and key holders being outside. The goal is to use this logic to prove whether a building reaction system (BRS) satisfies certain security specifications.
