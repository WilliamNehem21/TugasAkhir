The research explored the use of Gabor wavelet-based techniques for classifying scenes in wild blueberry fields in Central Nova Scotia, Canada, into categories such as bare patches, plants, or weeds. This method aimed to improve the site-specific application of agrochemicals. Gabor wavelet features obtained from field images were then classified using step-wise linear discriminant analysis based on pre-established visual categories.

Wild blueberry fields, which are wild and perennial in nature, often have limited weed control practices other than the use of herbicides. As a result, the blueberry industry expends substantial sums on these chemicals.

The study discussed various technologies used for site-specific herbicide application, highlighting the effectiveness of digital image classification systems over other methods like ultrasonic ranging or discrete wavelet transforms. These systems can distinguish weeds and bare patches regardless of height, with recent studies showing promising results for image-based spot application of chemicals.

The process for obtaining a Gabor wavelet transform involves convolving an image with a Gabor wavelet filter, which is sensitive to specific shapes, sizes, and orientations in images. This acts similarly to a selective filter based on a mother wavelet matched to elliptic shapes.

Within the study, various fields in vegetative and fruiting years were analyzed under different lighting conditions. Predominant weeds identified included lamb's-quarters, sheep sorrel, goldenrod, and others, varying from field to field along with different extents of bare patches.

The user interface designed for this system allowed users to start new classification tasks or resume existing ones, displaying six image segments in separate windows for classification.

In terms of accuracy, the highest classification performance was observed in Field 4 with 98.3%, while the lowest was 81.4%. These results were comparable to those obtained with a color co-occurrence matrix-based texture analysis technique as reported by Chang et al. (2012).
