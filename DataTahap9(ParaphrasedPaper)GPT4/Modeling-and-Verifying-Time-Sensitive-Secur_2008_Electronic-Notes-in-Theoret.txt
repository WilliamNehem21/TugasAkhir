This academic paper explores the challenge of modelling and verifying time-sensitive security protocols with timestamps, using time constraints within a Horn logic framework. Existing methods for addressing timeouts and retransmissions in such systems are examined; however, these do not typically provide the capability to automatically generate counter-examples.

The paper is organized into six sections. Section 2 introduces a process calculus for a formal and intuitive description of security protocols. In Section 3, an enhanced Horn logic model with time constraints is presented, along with the process for translating a security protocol into this model and the associated verification method. Section 4 outlines the specific characteristics of constraints within this model and proposes an approach for determining if solutions exist for these constraints. Section 5 applies the model to a detailed analysis of the Denning-Sacco protocol. Section 6 discusses future work.

Emphasizing simplicity, the paper avoids a deep dive into Horn logic verification techniques found in related literature. Instead, it presents an outline of the model in which security protocol roles are defined as logical rules with encrypted data representation, network delay considerations, and constraints that must be satisfiable to execute associated rules.

Translation of a process consists of sets of constrained Horn clauses that allow proof of certain messages being sent or specific events occurring, with satisfiable conditions triggering rules to fire. The paper focuses on the final four protocol events.

It introduces a definition for 'derivation sub-tree,' a concept crucial to understanding how portions of the model's logic can be derived and validated. These sub-trees help determine the solvability of constraints.

While general methods exist for solving linear constraints, such as simplex and Fourier-Motzkin algorithms, these techniques are often complex and do not necessarily accommodate symbolic arguments. The paper discusses satisfiability assessment for the proposed constraint system.
