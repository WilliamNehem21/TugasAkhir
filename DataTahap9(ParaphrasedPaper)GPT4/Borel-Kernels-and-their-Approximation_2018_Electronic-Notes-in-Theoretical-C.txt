This paper presents a structured approach to understanding both the precise and estimated meanings of probabilistic programs. The authors create a dagger symmetric monoidal category based on Borel kernels, with the dagger operation representing Bayesian inversionâ€”a key concept for reverting probabilistic processes. By doing so, the authors connect this category to categories of Banach lattices, which capture the essence of how program semantics can be seen through different lenses (either by transformation of predicates, which is backward-looking, or by transformation of states, which is forward-looking). These connections are not arbitrary but are bridged systematically through functors (mapping structures that preserve the category's properties), and their relationships are further articulated with natural transformations, which are mappings between functors that also respect the category's structure.

Within this categorical framework, a space called 'GPol' is defined as an endofunctor on the category of Polish spaces, 'Pol'. Specifically, for any Polish space 'X' and time 'T', 'GPol(X, T)' is determined as the collection of Borel probability measures over 'X' endowed with a weak topology. The weak topology itself is significant because it provides a way for this space to remain Polish (i.e., a complete, separable, metrizable space). The Portmanteau theorem offers several ways to understand this weak topology, making it a useful tool for studying these probabilistic measures.
