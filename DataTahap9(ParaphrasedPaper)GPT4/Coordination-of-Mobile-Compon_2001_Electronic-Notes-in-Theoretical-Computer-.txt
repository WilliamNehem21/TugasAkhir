In this paper, we introduce p!, a new approach for piecing together software modules that revolves around the idea of adaptable communication paths. In the p! framework, both the modules themselves and the communication channels they utilize can move. Modules can change their physical or logical position while maintaining their connections, and channels can be detached and reconnected, leading to a dynamic reconfiguration of the system's architecture. Inspired by the IWIM coordination model, p! enriches previous work on formally defining component interfaces to explain how components behave when observed from outside.

p! emphasizes the channels and their manipulation rather than the processes and components linked to them. Past research has connected problems in coordination with foundational challenges in software engineering and mobility, suggesting that an IWIM-like model is effective for enabling a robust channel-based structure that integrates the concept of mobility.

p! builds on former research, introducing a language for dynamic component networks and a compositional semantics for asynchronous operations. It provides a formal model for component-based systems and a formal-logic-based language for interface descriptions, offering a complete system for deducing the behavior of composite systems from their individual components. Additionally, p! proposes a concrete incarnation of mobile channels that underpin our model for component-based systems, examining dynamic reconfigurability using data flow networks and a different approach to observables through stream functions.

A software component is an executable unit on a specified location, termed a component instance. These instances interact through channels, exchanging data. A component instance can move during its lifespan without breaking connections. Channels serve as point-to-point, reliable conduits, and their makeup can change dynamically. Initially, component instances link to certain channels but can restructure these connections during operation. Channel composition in p! is achieved indirectly, utilizing various constructs and patterns to regulate data exchange. Channels can operate synchronously or asynchronously, with various buffering behaviors, and can be manipulated using read, take, and write operations. Other specialized channel types offer unique behaviors for synchronization and communication.

Component instances comprise an interior and an interface. The interior carries out operations solely through its interface, which is initialized with existing channels upon creation. Components communicate solely through this interfacing system, which can dynamically spawn new channels. Actions on channels include waiting for conditions, reading and writing values, and operations like `wait`, `read`, `take`, and `write`.

Connectors are networks of channel configurations and form dynamic communication topologies. Operations like 'join' and 'split' enable structural changes by merging or partitioning nodes, which are points where channel ends converge.

The paper also relates p! concepts to other coordination models like Manifold and Linda, showing how p! can express similar constructs through its channels and operations.

Overall, p! proposes a highly adaptable and dynamic system for component coordination, focusing on the underlying communication channels. Ongoing efforts include developing an implementation platform for the proposed constructs and advancing theoretical models for a calculus of channels.
