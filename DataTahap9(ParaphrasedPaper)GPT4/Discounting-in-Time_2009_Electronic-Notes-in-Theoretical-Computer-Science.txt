When applying discounting techniques within weighted timed transition systems, different methodologies can be adopted. One option is to apply discounts based on the number of steps taken, as exemplified in references [14] and [17], while another approach is to apply discounts based on the amount of time that has elapsed.

Our research demonstrates that if the objective is to create an accumulated weight function within a timed transition system that adheres to a specific additivity criterion (as outlined in definition 2.2), there are limited ways to appropriately define this function. Notably, the accumulated weight functions resulting from the quotient method, nor the step-based discounting methods mentioned in references [14] and [17], align with a time-discounted approach as required by the specified additivity property.
