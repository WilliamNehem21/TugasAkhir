This paper discusses advanced computational models that mimic the transport of molecules across cell membranes, which are influenced by certain molecules (proteins) attached to the membranes. Drawing inspiration from brane calculus, these models have been developed to represent membrane systems with attached objects. However, traditional models do not account for the concept of inner and outer membrane surfaces, which is critical in actual biological processes. Real-life cellular activities, such as endocytosis and exocytosis, heavily rely on the presence of proteins on specific sides of a membrane.

Membrane systems communicate within a cell by transferring molecules through transport vesicles to various compartments, where they undergo subsequent reactions. In the field of computational models, a membrane is symbolized by square brackets, and associated multisets represent the contents on each side, termed internal and external markings. Objects within these multisets are proteins, and they can be either free-floating or attached to the membrane.

The paper also introduces attachment rules, which specify conditions for applying rules based on the membrane's markings and the presence of certain objects within the region it encloses. These rules help model molecular attachment to membranes. Additionally, evolution rules focus on depicting biochemical reactions occurring within cell compartments, separate from the membrane dynamics.

Later in the paper, a simulator is presented that provides a stochastic interpretation of the model and allows for the simulation of complex biological processes involving molecule transport and reactions within various cell regions. An example simulation of the G-protein cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is provided for illustration.

The notation used in the paper involves vertical bars to distinguish between the internal and external markings of membrane-bound objects. It's important to note that the simulation timing in the described system starts at zero and that this does not directly correspond to the theoretical concept of minimum evolution steps in membrane systems. Additionally, while a theoretical system might measure maximum evolution steps, the simulator uses different units without explicit conversion for this measure.
