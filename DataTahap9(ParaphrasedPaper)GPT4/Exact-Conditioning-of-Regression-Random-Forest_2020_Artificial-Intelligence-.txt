The academic paper describes the use of regression random forests, which is a type of ensemble method combining multiple regression tree models. These models are built by taking bootstrap samples from the training dataset, as outlined by Breiman in 2001. To introduce variability and reduce the likelihood of overly correlated trees due to dominant predictor variables, the algorithm randomly selects subsets of predictors for determining where to split the trees. This method improves prediction accuracy by averaging over the individual regression trees, thereby reducing overall prediction variance.

Chiles and Delfiner (2012) mention the use of the R package 'rgeostats' for simulation studies. These simulations are based on data with a known ground truth and explore scenarios with non-linear relationships and interactions among the predictors. The response variable in this simulation exhibits spatial autocorrelation and does not follow a normal distribution.

Results from regression kriging, a traditional regression random forest, and an alternative version of the regression random forest are compared. The spatial prediction maps obtained from regression kriging generally appear smoother than those derived from both the traditional and the alternative regression random forests. This suggests that different methods can yield varying spatial predictions, highlighting the influence of the underlying algorithm on the results.
