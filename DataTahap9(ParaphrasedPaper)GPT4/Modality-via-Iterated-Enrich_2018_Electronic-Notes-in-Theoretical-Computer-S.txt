This paper introduces an innovative approach to studying modal type theories through a new categorical semantics called change-of-base semantics. This approach is unique in its utilization of iterated enrichment and interprets modalities as hom objects, which could be potentially infinite in iteration. The work establishes a close connection between the meta-level and object-level computations, mirroring the relationship between enriching and enriched categories within a categorical context. This connection lays the foundation for a categorical understanding of scenarios where the logic at different stages may be entirely distinct.

The paper also demonstrates that Fitch-style modal type theory is aptly represented within the iterated enrichment of categories, leading to the insight that this theory serves as the right adjoint of the dual-context calculus. The authors further explore how temporal logics—specifically, linear temporal logic, S4 logic, and linear exponential modalities—are represented using change-of-base semantics.

Additionally, the discussion expands into the realm of effectful computation, offering a framework for understanding multi-staged computations with varying effects at each stage, which taps into the idea of generalized contextual modality.

One of the challenges addressed is the formalization of infinitely iterated enrichment for categories, a process that is crucial for modeling complex logical systems. Although complete methods for creating truly infinitely enriched categories are left as future work, the paper proposes finite approximate constructions that serve as models for the type theory.

The paper references the dual-context system, originally conceived to study exponentials in linear logic and subsequently refined to accommodate other logics. It provides details on how the modal and non-modal constructs are derived in such systems and how they relate to the enrichment of categories.

In the appendices, the paper delves into higher-dimensional monoidal structures, discussing definitions offered in the context of Gray monoids and suggesting an approach to defining monoidal objects in any monoidal 2-category, with a focus on strict categories for simplicity. The paper concludes with examples to illustrate the concepts introduced.
