This paper introduces a new method for modeling gene regulatory networks using timed automata, incorporating both discrete and approximate continuous elements to better reflect the dynamics of gene expression. The approach offers finer granularity in expression levels and integrates Boolean logic with an approximation of Hill kinetics by introducing dynamically changing delays based on gene activity levels. Implemented in the UPPAAL software, it was evaluated through benchmark models and a case study.

Systems biology focuses on understanding the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control cell function through gene interactions. Traditional discrete models of GRNs ignore the temporal aspect, resulting in only qualitative approximations. To address this, the authors propose extending these models to include time, enabling a more accurate representation of gene expression.

While existing frameworks exist for abstracting continuous systems with timed automata, they do not support the nonlinearities observed in GRNs, which are based on Hill kinetics. So, the authors developed a method that maintains the temporal and concentration aspects of protein dynamics, unlike purely Boolean models that yield multiple, possibly unrealistic paths from the same initial state.

The paper also details constraints used to model different regulatory situations, and introduces a tool, Model-Builder, that automates the translation of GRN models into the UPPAAL language, enhancing the visualization of gene expression trajectories from simulations or model checking.

Performance benchmarks demonstrated that higher granularity in the model results in more accurate outcomes, although setting appropriate delay values becomes more challenging. The study presented results using automata that did not use stopwatches and plans to improve the method by automating delay settings related to rates in the model, particularly for regulations and degradation delays. An open question is to use inverse problem solving to align delays with empirical time-series data. Finally, the authors aim to more rigorously define the relationship between timed automata and the approximated ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, as the current paper only provides an informal definition.
