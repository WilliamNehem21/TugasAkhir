The aforementioned techniques, while useful, come with certain limitations and downsides. For instance, the outcomes yielded by the Discrete Transfer Method (DTM) diverge significantly, though it is evident from our examples that there is a minimal pointwise absolute discrepancy between results derived using the Runge-Kutta 4th order method (RK4) and the precise solution. The traditional RK4 method is extensively applied to tackle initial value problems, delivering estimates that move closer to the actual solution as the step size (h) reduces[8,9].
