This research paper focuses on understanding how the concept of regularity is maintained during innermost rewriting within term rewriting systems (TRS). The paper aims to delineate a subset of TRS where the innermost strategy is more effective than general rewriting. Specifically, it examines 'shallow' term rewriting systems, where variables appear only at depths 0 or 1 within rule terms, and highlights that despite their seemingly limited scope, many properties (like reachability, joinability, confluence, and termination) are undecidable for shallow TRSs.

The traditional method of proving regularity preservation by adding transitions to an automaton to simulate rule applications of a TRS does not prove successful for innermost rewriting of general shallow TRSs. This is because the bottom-up simulation typically deployed for shallow TRSs falls short in this context.

To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes a unique approach that pivots on processing terms reachable from a given regular language using a single constant. This involves incorporating the inverse of a tree automaton's (TA) transition rules into the TRS, allowing terms of a language to be generated from the automaton's final states in reverse using an innermost strategy.

Key concepts are defined: a term is a weak normal form either if it is a constant or it is composed of a function with subterms that are constants or normal forms. The paper also finds that while ground reachability and joinability remain undecidable for flat TRSs, they become decidable under an innermost strategy.

The paper's crucial findings include that innermost rewriting with linear right-shallow TRSs preserves regularity, although this is not the case with TRSs whose right-hand rules are shallow and non-left-linear. These results have implications for understanding the boundaries of decidability and regularity preservation within the framework of syntactically restricted TRSs.
