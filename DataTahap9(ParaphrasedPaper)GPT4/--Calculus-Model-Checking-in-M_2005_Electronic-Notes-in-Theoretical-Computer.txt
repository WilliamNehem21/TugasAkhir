The paper discusses utilizing the Maude system, a high-level language and high-performance interpreter founded on rewriting logic, as a comprehensive platform for model checking, a technique for verifying concurrent systems. Rewriting logic has been noted for its adaptability in modeling concurrency and acting as a formal logical framework since its inception. Within this rich framework, the paper explores if all aspects of model verification can be executed solely using rewriting logic. This prospect is underscored by a case where an active network protocol's verification was conducted by encoding the protocol and a specific property directly in Maude, and then employing a meta-theoretical approach to examine all potential behaviors of the model to check against the property. However, the results were limited as only invariant properties were evaluated.

The authors provide an example with an initial Kripke structure featuring 100,000 processes in a 'wait' state, and they propose different properties (prop1, prop0, prop2, and the notably intriguing prop3 regarding deadlock freedom) to evaluate the system's behavior under various conditions.

Ultimately, while the paper showcases Maude's capabilities for defining models, specifying properties, and implementing verification algorithms through rewriting logic, it acknowledges that the approach is not exhaustive. To compete effectively with established formal verification tools, significant enhancements are necessary.
