The paper discusses the microstructure and properties of a coating produced using a zinc-magnesium oxide (Zn-MgO) mixture at a current density of 1.0 A/cm². The coating at this current density, particularly for the Zn-40MgO mixture, was found to exhibit clustering of solid crystals with some loosely adhered films. This issue appears to be related to a rise in particle concentration in the electrolyte, which hinders the movement of films from the anode area. The study notes a hardness trend across the coatings, with the control sample displaying a hardness of 35 HVN (Vickers Hardness Number). Coating samples showed noticeable improvements in hardness, with Zn20MgO at 1.0 A/cm² reaching 137.94 HVN, Zn-40MgO at the same current density reaching 222.6 HVN, and the highest hardness seen with Zn-20MgO at a reduced current density of 0.5 A/cm², achieving 236.4 HVN. These enhancements are attributed to crystal formation and nucleation, which are influenced by the operational conditions of the coating process.

Previous studies have suggested that the microstructure and resulting properties of a coating are linked to the process parameters. The paper's findings concur with this idea, suggesting that the grain size developed during coating contributes to the observed surface hardness improvements.

These Zn-MgO composite coatings with MgO ceramic particles were further examined for their microstructure, thermal-oxidative performance, and micro-mechanical properties. Not only did the MgO particles contribute to heightened mechanical and corrosion resistance, but the optimal hardness was again observed at 236.4 HVN for Zn-20MgO at 0.5 A/cm². Heat treatment led to the formation of new crystalline structures and Zn20MgO coatings at 0.5 A/cm² maintained performance, indicating superior properties among the series tested. Moreover, by moderately incorporating MgO into the Zn²⁺ matrix, the thermal stability of the composite coating was improved, with good morphological structure limiting temperature penetration and consequently augmenting the stability of the coated alloy.
