To create initial samples, zinc oxide was first dispersed in a polymer matrix. Specifically, 12 grams of water-moistened zinc oxide (ZnO) was mixed into 100 ml of a 10% solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in water, which had been previously homogenized using a bain-marie. After allowing the mixture to settle for one hour, a portion weighing 60 grams was spread onto a glass plate measuring 234 square centimeters. The coated plate was left to dry at room temperature, positioned horizontally, for a full day.

To examine the photoreactivity of these prepared samples, they were subjected to light from a DRT-125 mercury-vapor lamp, which emits a broad spectrum of light, for varying lengths of exposure. The light intensity striking the surface of the samples was measured at 0.105 watts per square centimeter. The degree of optical darkening of the samples was assessed utilizing a specially designed hardware-software system developed by the authors.

In conclusion, it seems that the acetic acid groups within the PVA structure are likely to initiate a deacylation reaction (the removal of acetic acid groups) when exposed to early stages of irradiation. It's well-recognized that deacylation reactions occur more readily in the presence of electrophilic agents due to the high polarity of the bond. In this case, a potential electrophilic agent in the PVA-ZnO-BiCl3 system could be the proton (H+), which might be generated within the composition during light-induced processes.
