The integration of randomness and non-determinism constitutes a complex yet widely explored field of research, with numerous potential intersections. The paper does not attempt to provide a comprehensive review or historical perspective, referring instead to other sources for such an overview and a coalgebraic framework for classification.

The paper proceeds to define the concept of a convex subset within the context of a semimodule, which refers to a set that is stable under the formation of linear combinations where the sum of the coefficients equals one. The primary objective is to reinterpret Varacca's model using free semimodule constructions. This reinterpretation not only adopts a semiring as a variable component but also accommodates convex subsets that are not finitely generated, which is necessary since a trace in this context is not typically a finite or finitely produced collection.

To demonstrate the process of calculating traces within systems that exhibit both nondeterministic and probabilistic characteristics, the paper examines a specific state-based system. This example provides a preliminary overview of the paper's contributions, with more detailed technical information to be provided in subsequent sections. As a result, some concepts may not be fully clarified at this introductory phase.
