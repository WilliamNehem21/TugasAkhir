The concept of open science has fundamentally influenced the creation of numerous contemporary chemoinformatics tools and resources, which serve as both educational aids and research instruments. Advocating for the democratization of science is likely to enhance collaboration across the globe, connecting research groups and students at all levels of academia. Understanding the research undertaken in diverse regions across the world can facilitate these international linkages. In this context, a Latin American perspective on chemical informatics was offered in 2018, reflecting on the potential of open science. 

Chemoinformatics applications, particularly those web-based, are often designed with drug discovery in mind, aiding in the identification and optimization of lead compounds. However, their utility extends into broader computational research areas, such as pharmacoinformatics, molecular dynamics, and biophysics, as highlighted in Section 2.1 of the paper.

In a specific instance, the focus was not on the macroscopic pKa values of compounds, but rather on the pKa of distinct microstates to accurately predict experimental observations. Here, machine learning techniques were not employed due to the lack of experimental data on microstates. Instead, submissions utilizing first-principles methods were received, and some used open chemoinformatics tools like Open Babel for conformational analysis. Notably, Latin American groups participated and achieved excellent results, including the second-highest ranked submission.

Latin America is home to various research hubs, some of which are exceptionally well established. Collaborations within the region can fund face-to-face or hybrid meetings which are beneficial on their own. These interactions have the potential to foster multi-center projects specific to Latin America.

Such collaboration is not only encouraged by funding agencies, both public and private, but is also made easier by the prevalence of online conferences and webinars. These virtual events save time and reduce organizational and attendance costs while maintaining the convenience of active involvement with editorial boards of peer-reviewed journals. There are growing instances of Latin American scientists playing significant roles on the editorial boards of publications like the Journal of Chemoinformatics, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, and eLife. Additionally, there is an emerging trend among scientific publishers to include early-career researchers on editorial boards, such as with Protein Science, creating opportunities for Latin American scientists in arenas where their presence has been historically limited.
