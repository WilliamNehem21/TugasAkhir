From this standpoint, it makes sense to examine a hierarchical relationship among statements that maximizes affirmations and minimizes negations. Remarkably, such a hierarchical relation is invariably found in a d-frame. Intriguingly, this order emanates solely from the characteristics of the distributive lattice and the presence of two complementing components. While historical acknowledgment of this concept can be traced back to early sources, proving this relationship is relatively simple and can be regarded as a rudimentary task for demonstration.
