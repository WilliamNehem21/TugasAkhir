The paper discusses an innovative method for handling coercion between types in programming, where coercion is the process of interpreting a value of one type as if it were a value of another type. Instead of converting the value into the representation of the target type, the authors propose constructing mappings between the computational behaviors of the source and target types using elimination operators that are fundamental to both types, simplifying the transformation process. They argue this approach has several benefits, such as making the links between types explicit and easier to understand, simplifying proofs, and providing a framework to discuss and characterize different coercions.

The authors suggest coercion should occur in two stages, where a coerced term is marked and then transformed upon reaching an eliminator for the target type. This method prevents conversion of the value itself, and computation is only performed when necessary. The process maintains type safety, though the broader implications for canonicity and convertibility warrant further research.

The paper also expands on inductive families by substituting a constant with an indexed form and modifying the construction of operators to insert indices, noting that parameters remain consistent while indices may vary within the type based on its construction.

An example is given with summation functions on vectors and lists—normally cumbersome due to extra work—and how a more efficient method can be derived by adjusting eliminator arguments. Similar transformations are suggested as a basis for coercive subtyping by using a special form of eliminator that is well-typed, ensuring type correctness.

The authors address issues of canonicity and how coercions behave under composition, including the need for coherence checks and accounting for multiple coercions. They foresee potential efficiency improvements as computations can be applied directly to source data without intermediate structures and optimizations like partial evaluations are possible.

The paper concludes that although the research is in preliminary stages, the approach offers promising directions for characterizing coercion functions, proving their key properties, and enhancing the efficiency of their use. This contributes to the viability of coercive subtyping as a practical tool in programming languages.
