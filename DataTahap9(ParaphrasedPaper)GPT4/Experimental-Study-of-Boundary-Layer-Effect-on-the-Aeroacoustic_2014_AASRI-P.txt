The study discusses the significant increase in drag and potential for structural vibration and fatigue damage that can result from oscillations caused by airflow over a cavity. Properly identifying these oscillations from noise generation mechanisms is crucial. Experimental research on cavity flow began in the 1950s internationally, with numerical simulations becoming more prevalent since the 1980s for analyzing cavity flow mechanisms and noise-related issues. In China, research on cavity flow, particularly utilizing numerical simulations for small-scale cavities, has started more recently. The Aerodynamic Center has conducted experiments on the flow and acoustic properties of cavities in both subsonic and supersonic conditions. Research indicates that cavity geometric parameters, such as the length-to-depth ratio, aspect ratio, and flow parameters like Mach number, can influence the stability of the cavity's shear layer, which in turn affects flow types and noise spectral characteristics.

The paper particularly examines the complex flow within a rectangular cavity when affected by low-speed turbulent flow. This flow results in a pressure spectrum that includes a mix of broad band noise and discrete tones. An experimental setup was constructed in a low-turbulence wind tunnel to measure cavity flow noise and to provide validation data for numerical simulations. The study focuses on the effects of varying boundary layer profiles at the cavity inlet and their impact on the aeroacoustic properties of cavity flow. By altering the inlet boundary layer profile through different block installations, and using measurement techniques such as wall pressure sensors, microphones, and hot-wire anemometry, the acoustic properties of the cavity under different inlet boundary layer states were captured. These findings contribute to the understanding of cavity flow noise and may help in developing methods to reduce such noise.
