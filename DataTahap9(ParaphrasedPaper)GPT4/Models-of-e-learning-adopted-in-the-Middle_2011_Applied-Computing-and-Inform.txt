This paper offers an assessment of the advancement and uptake of e-learning in Middle Eastern (ME) educational institutions, ranging from traditional to online or hybrid models. The acceptance and assimilation by learners and parents towards e-learning vary across the region. Some institutions have begun providing a considerable selection of e-learning courses, while others are at the initial stages of developing such programs. The paper discusses the motivators and obstacles faced in adopting e-learning in the ME, different e-learning approaches being utilized, efforts to overcome existing hurdles, and a projection of the future for e-learning with a specific case study of progress in Saudi Arabia.

In many ME countries, internet censorship is prevalent, affecting the widespread adoption of the internet and e-learning due to concerns about political influence and immoral content. With the integration of the internet being relatively delayed, research on e-learning's benefits, constraints, and receptiveness in the ME is scant; however, recent studies suggest a high level of endorsement from both instructors and students.

The paper explores multiple research studies highlighting the potential of e-learning in the region, with individual country's perspectives, such as attitudes towards e-learning in Kuwait, the relevance of online MBA programs in the Arabian Gulf, and the impact of integrating e-learning materials in traditional English courses in Saudi Arabia, which showed students using e-learning resources had higher success rates.

Several reasons are identified for the ME's slow response to e-learning, including low internet penetration due to high costs, poor-quality connections, and fears of cultural and family corruption. Additionally, the scarcity of Arabic-language online educational resources and faculty skill gaps hinder e-learning adoption.

The paper then surveys various models of college-level e-learning institutions across the ME, including the Mediterranean Virtual University, the Knowledge International University, and branches of the Arab Open University. It also describes the establishment of a national center for e-learning and distance learning in Saudi Arabia, which aims to support educational processes and includes projects like the Jusur learning management system (LMS), the Zad digital library, and the national learning objects repository.

Despite previous delays, the recent economic boom, particularly in oil-rich nations, has prompted governments to address educational challenges. Initiatives to update K-12 educational systems include the early integration of technology and the English language. Even if many in society are still unfamiliar with technological advancements and e-learning, plans are underway to make these technologies widely recognized and used soon. Emphasis on training and workshops for faculty, along with regulatory frameworks for e-learning and distance learning, can foster broader participation in these educational modalities.
