The presented academic paper discusses how certain fractal structures can be represented by infinite streams of symbols, with the focus of making this concept formal. A particular example given is that of the unit interval [0,1], which can be considered as composed of two identical copies of itself. This concept is described as a 'combinatorial specification' and relates closely to the idea of 'self-similarity systems' from other literature, where the resulting structure formed by this specification is akin to a 'coalgebraic fractal.'

The authors of the paper draw a distinction between their work and that of others by mentioning that their focus lies in connecting coalgebraic fractals with metric fractals that are specified in a manner similar to iterated function systems (IFS). They compare their approach with that of Leinster, who mainly provides a topological extension by giving coalgebraic fractals a canonical topological structure and offering recognition theorems to determine whether certain topological spaces are solutions to specified self-similarity systems.

Overall, the research aims to formalize the idea that streams of symbols can be used to represent the fractal structure of shapes, delving into how these symbolic representations relate to both metric and topological properties of fractals.
