The paper discusses a testing methodology for verifying planning domains used in the EUROP-2 project, which involves generating test cases to check the validity of flight rules within the system specifications. Initially, it emphasizes two test cases for assessing propositions p and q that contribute to the true value of a formula, and highlights a single test case that accounts for the formula's false value, which is common for both weak and strong evidence.

Furthermore, it suggests that this testing approach, which ensures coverage using Uniformly False Coverage (UFC), represents an advancement over the current manual and coverage-unassured methods of generating test cases for EUROP-2. The paper also indicates an intention to automate the testing process by converting temporal formulas into executable code.

Although existing verification techniques often involve direct use of model checkers or generation of test cases, the paper sets itself apart by focusing on tests derived from flight rules, i.e., temporal specifications, rather than general planning techniques. It acknowledges the need to investigate certain challenges, such as translating nested temporal operators into planning goals. To tackle this, the authors are developing a software tool to automate their methodology, which includes a parser that transforms temporal patterns from flight rules into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, and subsequently into New Domain Definition Language (NDDL) code for execution.

This work represents a step toward both refining testing processes in planning domains and incorporating automation to enhance efficiency and reliability of the development of plans, particularly for space missions.
