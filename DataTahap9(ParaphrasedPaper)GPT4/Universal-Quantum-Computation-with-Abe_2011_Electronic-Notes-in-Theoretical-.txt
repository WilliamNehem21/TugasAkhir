This paper explores the potential of abelian anyon models in the context of topological quantum memories and quantum computation. While these models are usually not considered capable of universal quantum computation through topological operations alone, the study investigates the impact of including non-topological operations, such as spin measurements, and shows that they enable universal quantum computation with topological protection.

Anyons are peculiar quasiparticles that emerge in two-dimensional materials, and the study of their unique, non-local attributes is not only fundamental to quantum physics but also practical for building fault-tolerant quantum computers. Although non-abelian anyon models are primarily studied for their direct applications in quantum information processing, this paper broadens the approach by extending the use of an abelian anyon model, such as the toric code, to demonstrate that it can support universality and fault-tolerance in computing.

The paper mentions that, in this abelian model, logical states are introduced into the code by creating "holes" where the stabilizers are not applied. Hamiltonian alterations reflect this by eliminating terms associated with the plaquettes and vertices where the "holes" are located. The paper highlights that braiding and fusion, while topologically interesting, do not offer a complete set of operations for computation; however, when measurements of lattice spins are included, a full gate set emerges that admits universal quantum computation when the dimension 'd' is a prime number.

Furthermore, the authors address the robustness of the system against errors, noting that perturbations in the Hamiltonian affecting the degeneracy are unlikely due to the non-local nature of qudit encoding. In contrast, thermal errors and other perturbations that do not impact degeneracy are effectively suppressed.

The paper also outlines that the techniques for dealing with errors in abelian models can be adapted to non-abelian quantum double models, with the fault-tolerance reliant on the distance between logical "holes." Moreover, spin projections can improve the computational abilities of both abelian and non-abelian models.

The authors reflect on the anyonic codes' capacity for error protection and the limited protection offered by storing information in holes of other stabilizer codes. They consider whether topological codes are unique in their protection capabilities or if other types of codes could provide similar benefits.

Emphasizing the practicality of their research, the authors point to experimental prospects like Josephson junctions and polar molecules, which could provide physical systems to implement the discussed models. With advances in experiments showing anyonic braiding, these systems could soon illustrate the ancilla state preparations proposed in the paper.

In conclusion, the paper demonstrates that abelian anyon models, though limited in their topological operations, can achieve universal quantum computation with the addition of single spin measurements. This significantly broadens their computational capabilities and offers insights into the similarities and potential synergies between abelian and non-abelian anyon models.
