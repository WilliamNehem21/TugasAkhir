The paper discusses the evaluation of several specific scenarios to challenge the assumption that a mathematical structure, denoted by G, is irreducible. The core of the paper seems to revolve around proving statement (i), which is not detailed in your description, through the examination of these scenarios. The process involves identifying a "reducing triple" for G that, if found, would conflict with G's presumed irreducibility.

Additionally, the paper includes an improved version of Lemma 4.4, particularly relevant to a certain subset of planar 3-treesâ€”a special graph class with specific properties. The improvement is defined by a measure on any complete graph with four vertices (K4) within a planar 3-tree G. The measure, denoted as G(H), assesses the maximum and minimum number of vertices inside a face of a K4 structure, H, within G.

The authors present a special case of planar 3-trees named "restricted." A restricted planar 3-tree includes a K4 subgraph where one face has no internal vertices (notation G(H) = (2,0)), and this face is considered the external face of G. Furthermore, if there exists a K4 subgraph with exactly one vertex inside two of its faces, then G is described as "super restricted." These definitions and properties will be utilized in subsequent sections of the paper to aid in proving the main result or statement (i).
