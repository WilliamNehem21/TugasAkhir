This academic paper discusses the challenge of estimating human age from facial images, a task with potential applications in areas such as human-computer interaction and demographic data analysis. The authors introduce a framework for age estimation using Bio-Inspired Features (BIF), which previously showed promise in tasks like gender recognition. They focus on analyzing specific facial regions including eye wrinkles, the whole internal face without the forehead, and the entire face including the forehead.

The research reveals that the patterns found in eye wrinkles, which take up about 30% of the facial area, carry the most significant aging features compared to those in the full face or the internal face only. To validate the approach, experiments are conducted on the publicly accessible FG-NET aging database, with additional images from the MORPH database used to enhance representation of older age groups.

The paper is structured to first discuss related work, then introduce the bio-inspired model, followed by the proposed age estimation framework and results. The authors employ regression techniques and landmark-based facial feature extraction for their analysis. The results show that eye wrinkles can estimate age with nearly the same accuracy as using the full face, which can offer the benefit of reduced processing time.

The study improves age estimation performance by integrating images from the MORPH dataset into the FG-NET, reducing average estimation errors by 20%. Future work aims to explore more sophisticated statistical modeling techniques to better understand the relationship between various factors that influence the aging process as reflected in facial features.
