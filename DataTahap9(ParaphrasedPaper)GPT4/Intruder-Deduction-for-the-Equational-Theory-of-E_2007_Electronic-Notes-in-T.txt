The current surge in interactive internet services has led to widespread use of cryptographic protocols to ensure a degree of security, effectively functioning as basic programs in an unprotected setting. Various methods exist for modeling these cryptographic protocols and assessing their safety features, including the Dolev-Yao approach which simulates an adversary's capabilities through a system of deductions. This framework is commonly employed to determine the security of protocols from passive attackers â€“ entities that gather information by intercepting communication between honest parties and infer further data from these exchanges, an activity known as the intruder deduction problem.

Cryptographic models often rest on the tenet of perfect cryptography, meaning encrypted messages are impenetrable without the corresponding decryption key. However, this premise is overly optimistic, as there are instances of protocols considered secure under such an assumption that are nonetheless vulnerable to attackers who can exploit the combination of cryptographic functions and protocol specifications to reveal secrets. Therefore, it's vital to weaken the perfect cryptography assumption by enhancing the intruder's inferential abilities, including the capacity to consider certain algebraic properties, to reflect a more accurate depiction of potential threats.

The remainder of the paper introduces novel concepts, such as a definition for subterms and alterations to proof construction, which support the claim that all proofs can be restructured into what is referred to as a normal proof. It's then demonstrated that a normal proof is, by nature, a local proof, which has implications for the solvability of the intruder deduction problem as indicated by previous theorems.

All proofs are modifiable into simpler versions; through editing or combining steps within a proof structure, we can arrive at what's known as a flat and simple proof. This process entails the consolidation of consecutive applications of similar rules and the reduction of proof branches, thereby simplifying the proof's complexity.
