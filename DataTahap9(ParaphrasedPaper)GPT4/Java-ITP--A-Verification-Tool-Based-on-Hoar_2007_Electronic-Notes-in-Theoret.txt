This paper delves into the field of Java formal logics, semantics, and theorem proving by building upon substantial related works cited as references [16,14,13,15,9,20,17,2,3] and compares with closely associated projects like the Maude ITP, ASIP-ITP [6,22], and JavaFAN project [7,8], enriching the latter's theorem proving capabilities. The paper's organization is as follows: Section 2 briefly presents the continuation-passing style (CPS) semantics of Java; Section 3 describes the algebraic semantics of Hoare triples; Section 4 develops the paper's own Hoare logic and its theoretical underpinnings; Section 5 focuses on the formal implementation in the Java+ITP tool and practical case studies, while Section 6 revisits related work and provides conclusions.

The paper introduces a novel handling of program variables where variables map to locations rather than values directly, creating a two-tiered system where variables point to locations and locations to values. For instance, a location might be shown as l(17), and the framework allows concatenations for lists of expressions.

From a program verification perspective, the paper asserts that their concrete approach to environments and stores is preferable over more abstract concepts for managing the complex side effects and hiding capabilities inherent in their Java variant. This concrete representation also better supports future extensions to include complete Java features such as exceptions, loops, and locking mechanisms.

To determine program termination, the paper proposes checking the 'sort' of the program state. A 'superstate' indicates incomplete execution, while a 'wrappedstate' suggests all code has been executed.

The paper further explores the subtleties of Java's Hoare logic, not visible in simpler languages or even in Java tools like Jive, and emphasizes maintaining compositional Hoare logic at the source code level. Although the Java variant explored is still basic, the authors plan to extend it with features like exceptions and objects, with the expectation of easily integrating such features due to the CPS semantics. Finally, threads and concurrency are also intended for future inclusion, with the goal of creating modular Hoare rules applicable to Java as well as other languages that share similar features, revealing an ambitious direction for future research.
