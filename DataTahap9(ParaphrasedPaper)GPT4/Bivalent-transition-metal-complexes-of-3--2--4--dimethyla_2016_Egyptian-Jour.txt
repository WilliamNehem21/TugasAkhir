The study describes the synthesis, purification, and analysis of a compound and its computational modeling.

A compound was synthesized by combining 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (0.01 mol; 1.5 g) with 50 ml of ethanol and 1 ml of glacial acetic acid, and the resulting mixture was heated under reflux for 3 hours. The product formed during this process was collected through filtration, purified using recrystallization from absolute ethyl alcohol, and dried in a vacuum desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride. This pure compound was verified using thin-layer chromatography (TLC), as shown in Scheme 1.

For computational analysis, the DMol3 program from the Materials Studio package was utilized to perform cluster calculations. Geometry optimization for the isolated solid compounds was executed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) within the Gaussian 09 program package. The Double Numerical Polarization (DNP) basis sets employed in the study were more accurate than Gaussian basis sets of equivalent size. The exchange-correlation functional was selected based on the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), with the RPBE functional deemed most suitable. This optimization was done without imposing symmetry constraints.

For laboratory experiments involving metal ion complexation, double distilled water was used to prepare the system. The mixture was agitated for 2 minutes to ensure thorough complexation. Subsequently, 2 ml of a surfactant (HOL) at a known concentration was added. The container was vigorously inverted 25 times by hand to promote complete flotation and left to stand for 5 minutes. The remaining concentration of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions in the solution was measured using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). The flotation efficiency (F%) for the Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions was determined by a specified mathematical relation.
