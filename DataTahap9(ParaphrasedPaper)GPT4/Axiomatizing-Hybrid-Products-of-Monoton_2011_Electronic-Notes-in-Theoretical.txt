This paper's primary objective is to introduce a novel and reliable methodology for integrating two types of monotone hybrid logics, building on previous work in topological semantics and bimodal logics. The approach involves extending the concept of topological products to monotone neighborhood frames and integrating dual nominal terms (i and a) with corresponding satisfaction operators (@i and @a) to characterize the product of these frames.

The authors present five key axioms that facilitate interaction and prove a general pure completeness theorem for the bi-hybrid logic applied to monotone neighborhood frames. They also adapt their results to derive a pure completeness theorem for bi-hybrid logic concerning topological products.

Furthermore, this paper expands on previous research on the amalgamation of topological modal logics proposed by McKinsey and Tarski, which is complete over products of rational lines but not over products of real lines. Existing work has not explored the analogous concept of products in neighborhood frames; hence, this paper ventures into this gap.

A central innovation of the study is the introduction of nominals for naming lines instead of the conventional hybrid logic approach of naming points. This creative twist is shown to be effective in extending pure completeness to two-dimensional Kripke semantics. The authors aim to retain this novel approach in the context of two-dimensional neighborhood or topological semantics and to evaluate its effectiveness in achieving a general completeness result. The findings confirm the robustness of using line-naming nominals in securing completeness theorems.
