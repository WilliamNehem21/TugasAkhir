The paper discusses a method of preserving data confidentiality in environments where networks of different security levels exist. It employs an information unilateral transmission system that allows information to pass between these networks while a security module ensures the data is not tampered with in the less secure network. The MD5 hashing algorithm is used to create digital signatures, and the RSA algorithm is implemented for encryption and decryption purposes. Experiments confirm the effectiveness and safety of the approach.

In more detail:

- A procedure starts by assigning initial values to variables a, b, c, and d.
- It divides a 512-bit data block into 16 chunks, each 32 bits long.
- Each 32-bit portion undergoes four rounds of calculations, involving a variety of operations.
- The first operation in each of the four rounds is unique, while the subsequent operations are consistent across rounds.
- Four nonlinear functions are implemented during these processes.

After computing four rounds for each block:

- The resulting values of a, b, c, and d are added to their initial values.
- This process is repeated for subsequent data blocks.
- The final output is a concatenation (cascading) of the resulting a, b, c, and d values.
- Upon processing all data blocks in this manner, concatenating the outputs produces the MD5 hash.

For data formatting:

- Data is prepared using PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards) conventions; the format includes a block type (bt), padding string (ps), and the plaintext data (d).
- A leading '00' byte ensures that the encrypted block (eb) length exceeds a predefined threshold, 'k'.
- In encryption (bt=02), the ps consists of non-zero random numbers; for decryption (bt=01), ps is filled with 'FF' bytes.

When extracting the original plaintext from the PKCS-formatted data:

- The procedure also checks the integrity of the information.
- If there are problems like inability to clearly separate data, padding cluster issues (less than 64 bits or not matching the block type), or if bt doesn't match the required type, then decryption is considered to have failed.
