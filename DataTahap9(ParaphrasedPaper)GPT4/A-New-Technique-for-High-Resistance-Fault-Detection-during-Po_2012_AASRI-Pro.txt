The academic paper discusses a challenge in power systems where fluctuations in the rotor angle can cause power swings, leading to disturbances. Conventional distance relays are designed to block their response during power swings to prevent incorrect operations. However, these blocking mechanisms can mistakenly prevent relays from tripping during actual faults coinciding with power swings. The paper introduces a novel fault detection method that uses the S-transform technique on bus voltage data to distinguish between faults and power swings, aiming to improve relay performance.

This new approach addresses the shortcomings of existing methods, especially during high-resistance and symmetrical faults. The proposed technique was tested using simulations within the IEEE 14-bus test system framework. Results indicate that the method can effectively identify various types of faults and different levels of fault resistance, even during power swings. This advancement suggests that the method could lead to more reliable and accurate relay operations in power systems.
