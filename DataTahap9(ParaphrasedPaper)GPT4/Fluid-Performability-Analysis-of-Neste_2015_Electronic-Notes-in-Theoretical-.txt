The academic paper discusses the modeling of complex hierarchical systems, highlighting the challenges of predicting behavior in entities that can be described by automata. Unlike Unified Modeling Language (UML) state machines which use abstraction to hide details, the nesting in these systems reflects actual structural complexity. Due to this complexity in organizational hierarchies, it is crucial to analyze performance and reliability before deployment. Reactive models—with discrete states—used for formal reasoning quickly become impractical as component population increases, due to the exponential growth in problem size.

The authors reference previous work on nested Markov models as suitable representations, but note that efforts to manage computational costs have been limited. Past researchers, such as Buchholz, have used Kronecker algebra for hierarchical models with stochastic Petri nets and queueing networks, yet only two nesting levels were addressed. Lanus and Trivedi considered hierarchical Markov models that allow state partitioning to create reduced models for availability and performance, but state space sizes and computational complexity remain a concern.

The paper is structured into sections:
- Section 2 introduces a Markov model for systems of systems using a simple example to define key concepts.
- Section 3 talks about fluid approximation and presents results of symmetrical reduction in ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
- Section 4 validates the fluid approximation through a case study of a hierarchical distributed computing system, assessing both accuracy and computational benefits compared to stochastic analysis.
- Section 5 concludes the study.

The model presented describes systems of systems, where each hierarchy level has a prototype agent for each agent type, these being defined in 'agent classes'. The tree structure of the model represents the hierarchical organization of these classes (for example, in a server farm model, farms are parents to computers, which, in turn, are parents to jobs).

The paper explains how events impact synchronization between automata and affect rates of these occurrences. It also introduces the 'causal map' to model the impact of parent automata transitions on their child automata.

For future research, the authors suggest exploring biological processes, which would require accounting for birth and death events to model dynamic populations of automata. They also aim to extend the concept of lumpability to higher-order moment approximations and hope to improve convergence results for nested automata by examining how scaling influences approximation errors.
