The paper discusses challenges in integrating software components and services with signature and behavioral mismatches, even when interface description languages (IDLs) like CORBA for components and WSDL for services are utilized. Brogi, Bracciali, Canal, and Pimentel previously proposed a formal method for deriving adapters from service interfaces, but this required an abstract adaptation contract that was assumed to be manually constructedâ€”a process prone to human error and requiring detailed service understanding.

In response, the authors present a new approach that automates the creation of adaptation contracts. Abstract BPEL, a simplified version of BPEL, is introduced as the language to describe service interfaces, which can be translated into finite state machines (FSMs) for easier and more concise behavior representation.

The paper illustrates the proposed approach using an example of a file exchange system with client-server mismatches. The proposed adaptation method also employs a set of rules, including indeterminism penalization, to evaluate how "bad" a mapping is, aiming for lower values which indicate better adaptations.

An implementation tool, Dinapter, is described, which automatically generates adaptation contracts from the behavior descriptions provided in abstract BPEL. The tool explores the state space of possible behaviors to produce contracts using a heuristic-based A* algorithm. The efficiency of the tool, how it handles conditional branches, and how it reduces the search space are discussed.

The authors compare their work with related approaches, highlighting limitations in previous methodologies, such as handling message incompatibilities, failing with signature mismatches, message reordering, or message splitting/merging. The paper also identifies potential future work to extend the methodology to more expressive languages and semantics, as well as validation against other adapter generation methodologies.

The paper concludes by distinguishing their approach, which is based solely on the behaviors and arguments of the services, from others that require schema matching. It also suggests semantic and syntactic information could enhance heuristic effectiveness by comparing operation semantics and arguments using tools like WordNet::Similarity.
