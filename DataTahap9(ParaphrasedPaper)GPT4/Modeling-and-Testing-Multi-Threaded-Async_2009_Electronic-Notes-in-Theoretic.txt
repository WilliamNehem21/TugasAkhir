The research paper discusses the development and execution of test cases for a large-scale multi-threaded software system using the Creol modeling language. Creol is an object-oriented, concurrent language that enables models to closely reflect the structure of the actual implementation, and these models can serve as test oracles. The study presents a way to maintain structural similarity between Creol models and implementations, and introduces a unique conformance relation that requires less control compared to automata-based relations for verifying the system under test.

Formal testing of multi-threaded or distributed systems is highlighted as a complex and ongoing research area. In contrast to the extensive theories and practices available for testing single-threaded applications, this field still presents numerous challenges. 

A case study illustrating the proposed testing approach is carried out on ASK, an industrial software platform that connects users via a context-aware response system. The ASK software, primarily coded in C, is inherently multi-threaded and utilizes asynchronous communication. A significant portion of ASK has been reproduced in the Creol model.

The paper is organized into several sections, including related work, details about the Creol language, the ASK system case study, the detailed testing approach, and finally, conclusions and directions for future research.

Creol's characteristics help in accurately modeling concurrent systems. In Creol, each object has its own internal scheduler, and processes within an object execute one at a time without preemption. Instead of preemption, Creol employs explicit conditional suspension points, which aid in detecting race conditions by making scheduling points clear-cut.

The paper explains how distributed systems are naturally represented in Creol, where each object maps to a system module with distinct communication interfaces. Methods are notated with a co-interface to control caller access and provide callback capabilities. Runtime conditions are checked using the "prove" statement and method invariants.

The ASK software's components are also noted to be multi-threaded and implemented in C. Threads within a component handle incoming tasks from a shared queue and can send messages to other components or queue additional tasks, but they do not directly communicate with one another.

In testing, an execution of the system under test (SUT) is initiated to check whether the outcome matches the expected behavior as per the model. For asynchronous systems like ASK, this involves monitoring both actions initiated by the tester and the resultant system events.

To conclude, a test is successful if the model faithfully processes the same sequence of actions as the implementation without any assertion or invariant violations. If a model's assertion fails, it indicates an error in the model, not the implementation. Deadlocks during testing imply a disagreement with the test assumptions, leading to test failure, while tests that complete without issue are considered successful.
