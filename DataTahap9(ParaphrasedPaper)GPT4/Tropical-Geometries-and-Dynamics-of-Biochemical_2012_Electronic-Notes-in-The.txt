The academic paper discusses the limitations of identifying reversible reactions in the kinetic modelling of chemical systems, stating that step 3 of Algorithm 1 does not distinguish between reversible reactions. Furthermore, it mentions the challenge in determining the cut-off concentration which differentiates quasi-steady-state (QSS) from non-QSS species among slaved species, suggesting that using dominance criteria might be more effective.

The paper proceeds with an example, using a simplified model derived from system (2) and analyzes it with specific parameter values, including various rate constants such as k1=0.015, k3=200, and so on.

It also describes the concept of tropicalization, an abstraction of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, which can capture some dynamic behaviors but might not be accurate for others. The approximation's quality is not assured when the model's trajectories are a finite distance from the tropical variety. For instance, tropicalized trajectories may depart from sliding modes with a delay compared to smoother trajectories leaving the vicinity of tropical varieties.

Additionally, the paper evaluates how tropicalization retains qualitative aspects of attractors, but may introduce timing changes to the occurrence of Hopf bifurcations when compared to the ODE model. It can approximate the location of a bifurcation but behaves differently regarding the amplitude of limit cycle oscillations near the bifurcation. Notably, for the ODE model, the oscillation amplitude reduces to zero at the bifurcation, whereas for tropicalization, it does not.
