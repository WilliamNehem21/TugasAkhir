In recent times, advancements in NLP have allowed Arabic language processing to approach the more advanced state of English NLP, leading to significant improvements across various tasks including complex ones like short answer scoring. Despite thorough research for English, limited work has been done for Arabic, prompting the development of the first deep learning-based system for Arabic short answer scoring. The new system aims to aid educators in Arab regions by saving time on grading, thereby improving the overall instructional quality.

Research on automated grading has strived to create fair and efficient systems, but Arabic short answer scoring, especially using deep learning, remained largely unexplored. Many systems for Arabic were based on comparing student answers to a reference, and response-based methods proved superior given enough human-rated data, but they hadn't been previously implemented with deep learning technology in Arabic contexts.

This paper provides an overview of Arabic language challenges including complex morphology, dialectal variations, and lexical ambiguities, which traditional NLP methods and even some advanced techniques like pretrained embeddings struggle with due to context insensitivity and inability to handle unseen words.

The paper includes the implementation of models such as Bi-LSTMs with attention and transformer language models, which have shown excellent results in NLP tasks but minimal use in short answer scoring. Arabic adaptations of BERT and ELECTRA pretrained language models demonstrated that transformer-based models could significantly outperform traditional methods. The best results were achieved using ELECTRA, which attained a QWK score of 0.78, demonstrating the effectiveness of recent Arabic NLP advancements.

The paper also notes that further advancements could come from pretraining language models on domain-specific corpora, which may enhance the applicability of models for educational purposes, despite the additional computational costs involved.

This study not only establishes a new benchmark for Arabic short answer scoring but also emphasizes the potential of deep learning models in enhancing Arabic NLP tools for diverse educational applications.
