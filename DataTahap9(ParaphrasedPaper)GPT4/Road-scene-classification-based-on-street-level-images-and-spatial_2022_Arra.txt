For autonomous vehicles, understanding the context of a scene is incredibly important. While humans can easily grasp scene context at a glance, computers find this challenging. Deep learning models for scene classification can address this by automatically labeling data, creating balanced datasets for training advanced detection models tailored to specific road conditions.

The study outlines a new deep learning framework using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic classification of road scenes in street-level images from vehicles. A benchmark autonomous driving dataset was used for evaluation, combining scene classification predictions with geolocation data to generate labels. These labels were applied to train and evaluate a ResNet-50 model for scene classification. The approach and its comparison to existing methods are discussed in the paper.

Although progress has been made in image classification, particularly with the ImageNet benchmark, scene categorization remains more complex due to scene diversity and scenario combinations. Typically, autonomous vehicle datasets lack scene labels, offering only object-level data and dataset descriptions. Manually labeling these scenes would be time-consuming.

This paper examines image classification in the context of categorizing road scenes as urban, rural, or highway based on a single image. Two CNNs are employed: one for deriving scene labels from object classes and another using map-based spatial information.

The paper is structured as follows: a review of related works, an explanation of the proposed methodology and architecture, a presentation of scene classification results, and a discussion on findings and future research directions.

Early image classification efforts focused on achieving high accuracy on benchmarks like the PASCAL VOC competition. More recent approaches, such as spatial Fisher vectors and, notably, CNNs like AlexNet, have outperformed traditional methods like SVMs. Advances continue with deeper networks like VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet emphasizing the importance of network depth.

For traffic scene classification, past studies have used object probability vectors or semantic labels for categorization. DenseNet-121 features have been employed to train SVMs, while ResNet-50 based methods have been refined using Places365 datasets and LSTM modules for temporal improvement.

Spatial data-based urban scene recognition, often using satellite imagery, assists in urban land planning and use. OSM is another resource for generating semantic labels and maps.

Experiments were conducted with PyTorch, creating a balanced dataset through subdivision and augmentation techniques like random cropping, flipping, and normalization. This approach improved training effectiveness and accuracy.

Future work includes exploring diverse and state-of-the-art datasets, employing unsupervised classification through clustering, and integrating scene labeling in both online and offline applications, including semantic mapping and driver assistance.
