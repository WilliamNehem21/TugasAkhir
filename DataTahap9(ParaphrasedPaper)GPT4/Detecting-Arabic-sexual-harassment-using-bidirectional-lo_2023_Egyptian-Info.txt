The study examines the significance of addressing sexual harassment detection within the Arab world by analyzing 56,245 Arabic tweets between 2019 and 2020. The researchers conducted various experiments and found an optimal solution to enrich feature extraction by combining two methods. They utilized BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) networks to learn word representations with embedded word features, along with TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network) enhanced by pre-trained FastText embeddings.

The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 offers a survey of related work. Section 3 provides a theoretical foundation for classification techniques relevant to identifying instances of sexual harassment. Section 4 explores the methodology adopted in the study. Section 5 evaluates and elucidates the models implemented, and Section 6 presents the conclusions derived from employing the proposed hybrid approach.

The research introduces XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) â€“ a robust and scalable distributed gradient-boosted decision tree machine learning framework. XGBoost is an enhanced version of traditional gradient boosting algorithms, offering parallel processing capabilities at the node level. It provides improved computational speed and robustness against overfitting compared to standard gradient boosting methods.

In terms of evaluation metrics, True Positives (TP) indicate correctly identified cases of sexual harassment, while True Negatives (TN) refer to accurately recognized non-harassment instances. False Positives (FP) are instances where non-harassment content is mistakenly labeled as harassment, and False Negatives (FN) are harassment cases incorrectly classified as non-harassing content. The ROC curve is utilized to depict the trade-off between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) at various thresholds for binary classifiers used in the study.

For future exploration, the paper suggests to develop better tailored methods for stemming and removing stop words specific to the dataset, instead of relying on pre-set lists, such as those in the NLTK library. It also proposes the integration of other optimization approaches, like Particle Swarm Optimization with CNNs, to increase classification accuracy of Arabic text. Furthermore, the research encourages the examination of other deep learning strategies to advance the classification of Arabic text for the detection of sexual harassment.
