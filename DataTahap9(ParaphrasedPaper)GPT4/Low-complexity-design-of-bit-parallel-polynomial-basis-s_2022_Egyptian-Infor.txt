The Galois field, named after the mathematician Ã‰variste Galois and also known as a finite field, is crucial in several areas such as cryptography, digital signal processing, random number generation, switching theory, and error-correction for data storage and management. Fundamental to finite fields is modular arithmetic, which also underlies a variety of practical applications, including error detection in ISBNs, modern public-key cryptography, and bank identifier systems.

Finite fields are capable of performing arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. While addition and subtraction map to XOR operations, multiplication can be quite complex and time-consuming. Efficient multiplier designs are paramount to accelerate multiplication in finite fields. Finite field elements can be represented in different forms: dual, polynomial, or normal basis, with polynomial basis being favorable for its ease of integration and lower complexity.

High-speed encryption is a necessity for effective data security and relies on finite field arithmetic. This paper introduces a bit parallel systolic polynomial basis multiplier designed for speed and efficiency, particularly leveraging cut-set retiming to enhance the performance of systolic multipliers by reducing critical path delays. This design offers a superior area-delay trade-off, making it suitable for application to specific polynomials such as trinomials and pentanomials.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews existing literature on bit parallel polynomial basis systolic multipliers; Section 3 outlines the fundamental theory of such multipliers; Section 4 presents an algorithm and architecture for the proposed multiplier; and Section 5 discusses results, complexities, comparisons, and FPGA implementation outcomes. This section highlights the proposed multiplier's superior performance compared to previously reported designs at m=8 and m=163.

The paper also addresses other structures like irreducible pentanomial based multipliers, and suggests Montgomery multiplication architectures for reduced complexity. It suggests the use of parallel processing in dual basis digit serial multipliers to lower latency. The research includes FPGA implementation results, showing substantial improvements in delay and area efficiency, albeit at a slightly higher power consumption.

Ultimately, the paper posits that through strategic logic component modifications, the systolic polynomial basis multiplier realizes the best tradeoff between area and time complexity. This proposed multiplier is notable for its reduced time complexity and lower critical path delay, as supported by comparison with previous reports. The area-delay product is highly competitive, endorsing the design for VLSI implementations and the potential for optimization for other polynomial types.
