The original text explains that discerning customer feedback is pivotal for corporate decision-makers to appreciate which aspects contribute to satisfactory or unsatisfactory consumer experiences. Emerging methodologies for gleaning customer feedback from textual data are being developed. For example, Wang et al. (2011) introduced a systematic approach for funneling customer input from online content into product design choices. Similarly, Yan et al. (2015) crafted an innovative technique for prioritizing terms from online customer reviews to discern corporate qualities valued by customers. Zhou et al. (2015) recently put forward a framework that blends sentiment analysis and analogical reasoning to deduce corporate attributes and implicit customer demands from online reviews.

Furthermore, sentiment analysis has been applied to predict market behaviors, such as forecasting product sales and stock market movements. Nguyen et al. (2015) used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topical sentiments from social media, demonstrating its utility in predicting stock market performance. Ho et al. (2017) researched the potential link between social media sentiment and future stock prices.

Additionally, the paper points out that time series analysis, under certain conditions, assumes stationarity in segmented intervals (Liu & Bahadori, 2012). Time lag is regarded as non-zero based on the understanding that there is typically a delayed response in market outcomes following certain news or events (Hou & Moskowitz, 2005), which is supportive of models purposed for predicting future outcomes.
