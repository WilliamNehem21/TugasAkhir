In this academic work, the authors describe that when employing a specific encoding method, two operations can only be executed at the same time if they are not attempting to modify the same element. This means that the actions being modeled cannot have any points of intersection in terms of the resources they are manipulating. Consequently, the resources within the marked network are represented as exclusive-access entities, where only one operation can use a resource at any given moment. This principle is also applicable to elementary nets, and as such, contact-free elementary nets can be understood using this perspective.
