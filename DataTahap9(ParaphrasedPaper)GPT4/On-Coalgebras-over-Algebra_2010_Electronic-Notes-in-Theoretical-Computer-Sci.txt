The current section has outlined the following scenario: Given two endofunctors T and H, the objective might be to identify a suitable monad that allows T and H to operate in harmony. While there's a unique relationship between the T-algebras and H-coalgebras, it remains uncertain whether this applies generally to any two (finitary) endofunctors on the category of sets. Alternatively, one could begin with just one endofunctor and a (finitary) monad, and look for a distributive law that would enable a lift to the Kleisli (or algebra) category. Successfully doing so, the next step would be to construct a secondary endofunctor on the category of sets (assuming it's feasible) to form a commuting pair with the first functor, within the context of the algebras of the monad.

The latter part of the paper introduces the concept of a commuting pair of endofunctors in relation to a monad, which appears to be a novel idea. However, thorough analysis and additional examples are required for a more in-depth exploration of this structure, such as its connections to bisimulation and traces which have been touched upon in the text. The authors indicate their intentions to further investigate this topic in a future publication.
