The article discusses the employment of the B method, especially the Event-B subset, for modeling and verifying the SCORE processor that serves as a near-complete embodiment of a Java Virtual Machine in hardware. While B has traditionally been utilized in software development, its application in hardware verification facilitates the concurrent development of software and hardware systems. The objective is to ascertain the fidelity of microcode instruction implementation for Java bytecodes.

The paper begins with a discourse on Event-B, focusing on its refinement principle. This is exemplified by scrutinizing the iadd JVM instruction, which manipulates operands on the stack but does not account for more complex aspects such as the program counter or instruction invocation. The analysis provides a basis for navigating all arithmetic and logical bytecode operations.

It then discusses how Event-B's refinement strategy allows for melding implementation details into an abstract formal model without compromising the intended behavior of the original specification. The refinement process involves adding elements and introducing the 'status' set due to the nature of Event-B refinement. In the case of the iadd operation, two distinct events are defined to handle the transition from precondition to postcondition, which is indispensable due to Event-B's limitations regarding the splitting of events.

The paper demonstrates refinement by modeling the iadd operation with pseudo-microcoded instructions that mirror the actual processor functionality, albeit with some omissions. The authors aim to prove that this more concrete model adheres to the Java instruction set architecture (ISA) for iadd through Event-B refinement process.

The study also compares this method with other formal approaches in the field, notably that of Panagiotis Manolios, who employs the ACL2 theorem proving system and Lisp as the modeling language to construct ISA and microarchitecture models.

In conclusion, the authors have successfully shown the application of Event-B refinement in verifying an example Java processor bytecode and its corresponding microcoded instruction. Event-B was selected due to its robust tool support and efficient refinement capabilities, which the authors utilized to their full potential. This verification process could potentially be generalized to support the complete lifecycle of formally verified hardware, linking the formal specification with the physical implementation in clocked hardware systems.
