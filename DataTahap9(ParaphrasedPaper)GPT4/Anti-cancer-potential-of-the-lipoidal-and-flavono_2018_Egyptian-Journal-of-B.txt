The paper discusses evaluating the level of the Bax protein, a pro-apoptotic molecule, using an analytical technique that involves a monoclonal antibody specific to Bax, captured on a plate. Following incubation, a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate is added, and the chemical reaction is stopped with an acidic solution. The intensity of the resultant color is then measured at an optical density of 450 nm.

The study describes the antioxidant and anticancer properties of different plant-based compounds. Hesperidin, a key flavonoid found in the ethyl acetate fractions of two plants being studied, is known to counteract oxidative stress induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) in the liver of rats, an effect linked to its antioxidant characteristics. Further research has looked into hesperidin's effects on the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, as well as prostate cancer cells. On the other hand, pyrogallol from Vicia faba has been reported to exert a moderate impact against prostate cancer. Additionally, catechol, isolated from Pisum sativum, has shown a notable influence on two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, found in substantial quantities in both P. sativum and V. faba, has demonstrated significant cytotoxic effects on colon (HCT116) and liver (HepG2) cancer cells. Pyrogallol has also shown potential anticancer activities against renal cell carcinoma, with no impact on normal, healthy cells.

The study concludes that the peels of both plants are rich in phenolic and flavonoid compounds, which play a significant role as antioxidants and anticancer agents. The findings confirm that apigenin, extracted from the ethyl acetate fraction of P. sativum, reduces the viability of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and induces mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. The process is characterized by Bax activation, Bcl-2 downregulation, and disruption of the balance between Bcl-2 and Bax, leading to the activation of mitochondria-mediated caspase pathways, including caspase-7 activation. These outcomes highlight the potential of using plant waste as an effective treatment option against cancer.
