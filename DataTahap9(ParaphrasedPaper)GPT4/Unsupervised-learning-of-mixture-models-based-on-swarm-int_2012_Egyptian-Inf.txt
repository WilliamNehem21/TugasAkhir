In this paper, a novel technique for unsupervised learning of finite mixture models (FMMs) is introduced, designed to handle datasets that contain missing values. This new approach integrates the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to mitigate the challenge of local optima, a common problem with the traditional EM algorithm. Additionally, it addresses the issue of biased estimates caused by overlapping clusters, which is problematic when estimating missing values. By employing locally-tuned general regression neural networks together with an optimal completion strategy (OCS), the proposed algorithm can provide more accurate predictions for incomplete and overlapping datasets.

The researchers conducted comparisons with other well-known algorithms and demonstrated that this new method excels in minimizing misclassification errors during the clustering of data with overlapping clusters that vary significantly in size. The paper firmly establishes that the proposed algorithm is effective in dealing with outliers, overlapping classes, and uneven distribution of data classes. Detailed experiments and findings are discussed, with the proposed method showing marked improvements in handling incomplete and complex structured datasets.
