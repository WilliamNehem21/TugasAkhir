The structure of the paper is summarized as follows:
1. Related research areas are reviewed in Section 2, including the concepts and techniques that have influenced this work.
2. Section 3 discusses new architectural modeling techniques, with a particular focus on role-based modeling.
3. Section 4 highlights areas which the paper does not address within the proposed approach.

The paper presents an architectural method that incorporates coordination laws, consisting of ECA rules, to manage the interaction among system components. Developed through industry-academia collaboration, this approach uses coordination interfaces to depict the roles that components inhabit when responding to events. An example provided illustrates the coordination between a doctor and a respiratory control system in an emergency room.

The approach emphasizes the integration of human elements into systems, using role models to encapsulate autonomy, abilities, and responsibilities. The significance of roles is derived from the organizational context in which they operate.

The importance of communication is addressed through the lens of workflow management systems, which elevate task allocation to be crucial for collaboration rather than merely another communication protocol. Defining workflows with clear start and end actions is crucial to identify the intentions and objectives of the agents involved.

Roles define expected behavior via operations and norms related to specific organizational statuses (e.g., head of surgeons) or capabilities (e.g., qualifications of a doctor). It is essential to differentiate between having the capacity to perform an action and the qualification or authorization to do soâ€”lack of proper role or qualification can lead to role violations.

Finally, while delegation is an important aspect of dynamic organizations, it is noted that delegation is beyond the scope of this research.
