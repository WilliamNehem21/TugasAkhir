This paper explores the utilization of vision, a primary human sense, in the field of computer vision to interpret digital images. The authors aim to create a computational model that uses low-cost components such as a webcam and a laser pointer to estimate real-world distances. Techniques from pattern recognition, statistical learning, projective geometry, and image processing are leveraged, with a particular focus on image range finding, which measures the distance from the camera to objects in a scene. This range finding is crucial for obtaining 3D information like an object's background context, shape, and depth, which has applications in mobile robotics and engineering.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews existing literature on distance estimation; Section 3 details the camera calibration process; Section 4 describes the 3D scanner and model geometry; Section 5 discusses the implementation and analysis of the techniques; and Section 6 presents the conclusions and future research directions.

For calibration, the paper uses a method developed by Abdel-Aziz and Karara, called the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT), which has been improved to account for lens distortion. Others have suggested genetic algorithms and the usage of 2D patterns for simplifying the calibration process. In this work, they use the OpenCV library for calibration and validate the results with MATLAB's camera calibration toolbox.

The experimental setup involves a Class II laser pointer with a red light between 630-650nm wavelength. Various distances from the webcam to the laser pointer (denoted as 'h') and different image resolutions were used to create a regression model for distance estimation. The data samples were taken at regular intervals, called 'steps.'

For example, one experiment used a 25cm 'h' distance, with a 352x288 image resolution, obtaining 25 samples linearly spaced by 5cm steps. The performance of the distance estimation was quantified using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), with significantly better results post-camera calibration. The calibrated system reported an MAE of 0.6492cm and a MAPE of 0.557%, indicating high accuracy in estimating distances with the proposed low-cost setup.
