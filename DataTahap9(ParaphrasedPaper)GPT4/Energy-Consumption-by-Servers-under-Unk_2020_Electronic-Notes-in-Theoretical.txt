The paper investigates the energy consumption of three task allocation policies in a uniform computational environment using a testing approach called Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA): Task Assignment Based on Guessing Size (TAGS), Shortest Queue strategy, and Random Allocation. The authors used PEPA modeling to obtain numeric results, demonstrating that under TAGS, servers used more energy overall compared to the other strategies, while contrary to this, TAGS consumed less energy per task than Random Allocation under certain conditions.

The research structure is as follows:
1. Section 2 discusses TAGS using the Markovian process algebra PEPA.
2. Section 3 presents numerical results evaluating performance metrics.
3. Section 4 describes the energy model used and the outcomes of energy consumption evaluation.
4. Section 5 discusses potential future research directions and concludes the paper.

The policies are modeled in PEPA under Poisson job arrivals with a single service per job. The study considers both exponential and hyper-exponential service demands in a system where queues have a maximum capacity, leading to potential job loss when full. All queues operate on a first-come-first-served basis.

Random Allocation assigns jobs without considering queue lengths, leading to unbalanced loads and potential job drops. Shortest Queue aims for load balance by assigning jobs to the queue with the fewest tasks, reducing job loss as long as the arrival rate does not surpass system capacity. TAGS, introduced to address long service jobs' delay on short service ones, operates by transferring jobs to subsequent servers with longer timeouts if not completed within a given timeframe.

Energy consumption is primarily assessed in a two-server setup, looking at high workload variability. The paper underscores that the considered server homogeneity does not reflect real-world heterogeneous data center environments.

The results indicated that TAGS has higher total energy consumption but operates more efficiently per job under high-variability workloads compared to Random Allocation. The Shortest Queue was optimal under the same conditions.

The study does not explore the trade-off between energy consumption and performance metrics, emphasizing the need for a cost function encompassing both aspects for comprehensive policy evaluation. Future work suggests considering heterogeneous server environments, possibly combining different scheduling strategies to optimize energy usage.
