Monitoring heat demand presents more challenges than tracking electricity usage, primarily because heat meters are not as commonly deployed. Researchers often point out the difficulty in accessing actual heat demand data. Not all buildings are equipped with sophisticated automation systems to facilitate measurement, and the diversity of technologies and sources providing heating complicates the task further. Forecasts of heating demand tend to focus more on district heating systems where data at a higher resolution is more readily available than on a national scale. Gathering building construction details, like insulation properties, is also relatively easier at this local level. However, this doesn't mean that all district heating systems have adequate monitoring, leading some researchers to construct physical models to simulate high-resolution data.

In many cases, the training data used in research originates from simulations that model building behavior, which is particularly useful during the early design stages of a building. Singaravel et al. have developed a data-driven model suitable for the design phase that allows for the reuse of data under similar conditions. Singh et al. have identified that enriching datasets can be more beneficial than increasing their size for improving the accuracy of early-stage building energy predictions, and they advocate for a more efficient data collection strategy.

Typically, high-resolution models are used for smaller domains, such as a university campus, but there is a lack of data necessary for long-term forecasting over larger areas like cities or countries. Estimates of large-scale heat demand, such as at the national level, often rely on economic data, which can only provide annual demand figures. With global efforts to decarbonize and the increasing integration of various energy sectors, it's becoming clear that longer-term forecasts cannot solely depend on economic models.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 delineates the methodology, Section 3 applies the model to Scotland, Section 4 discusses the results, and Section 5 concludes the study.

In sensitivity analysis, the influence of input variables on a model's output is examined. There are two main types of sensitivity analysis: local and global. The one-way method, a type of local sensitivity analysis, involves altering one parameter at a time to study its impact while keeping other parameters constant, although it does not account for interaction between inputs. The Morris method integrates both local and global analysis approaches, offering a more comprehensive evaluation by approximating the local derivative using a finite difference scheme.

Due to the shortage of heating demand monitors, like in Scotland, it's challenging to acquire detailed heating data, such as hourly measurements, compared to electricity demand data. To validate the model's reliability, the researchers compare annual heating demand from a software tool called DesignBuilder with official government statistics, and also cross-reference hourly heating data from the paper with simulated building data.

Finally, the paper suggests that refining an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) by discarding inputs with minimal impact enhances the model's performance, as shown by changes in performance metrics such as the Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE) and the Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE).
