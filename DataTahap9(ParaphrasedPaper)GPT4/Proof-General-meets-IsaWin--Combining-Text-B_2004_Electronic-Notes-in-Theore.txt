This paper discusses the creation of a new system that merges the technologies of Proof General, a proof interface that operates independently of specific theorem provers, and IsaWin, a sophisticated graphical user interface for developing proofs. Proof General utilizes an Emacs-based script management system that is well-regarded due to its adaptability to various proof assistants and its user-friendliness. Its script management system effectively manages large-scale proof developments.

However, facing limitations of the Emacs Lisp implementation, the Proof General (PG) Kit was developed to establish a standardized communication protocol termed PGIP, which each prover must support, making it easier to interface with different theorem provers.

IsaWin, representing the Gengui graphical user interface for the Isabelle proof assistant, visualizes and manipulates proof-related objects like theorems and tactics using icons on a notepad interface with direct mouse interactions.

The paper acknowledges that while Gengui and IsaWin provided valuable insights, their add-on implementation approach resulted in less modular and robust architectures that hindered reusability and presented issues when the proof assistant incurred errors.

The proposed PG Kit system architecture utilizes lightweight protocols, separates components for robustness, and preserves compatibility with existing theorem provers through a mediator that synchronizes various components during interactive proof development.

The authors have created prototype implementations, using Haskell and Haxml to parse and validate XML for PGIP messages crucial to the mediator's function. Display engines like Emacs and PGWin are used to visualize display messages. Through the concept of an object within the interface, context and dependencies are managed, allowing users to switch between proofs easily.

The paper also discusses efforts to connect this system to the Isabelle/Isar proof assistant and the extensions made to its module to support PGIP. The new system aims to support mixed graphical and textual interactions and the creation of a more generic, high-level interface for interactive proof development.

Finally, the paper mentions related systems such as Omega (now part of the MathWeb and ActiveMath projects) and Prosper, which have different focuses or approaches but share similarities in their architecture with the described system, emphasizing the trend towards interoperable and modular design in proof assistance software.
