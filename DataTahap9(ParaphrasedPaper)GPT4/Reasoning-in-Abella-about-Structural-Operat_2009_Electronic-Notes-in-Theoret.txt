This paper discusses the methodology of analyzing formal systems by using logic-based specifications. The core concept relies on determining whether certain properties can be proven within a logic system that has been defined to represent the system specifications. Two methods for this analysis are described.

The first method involves integrating the specification logic within a universal theorem-proving environment like Coq or Isabelle. The second, and the focus of this paper, is the creation of a specific meta-logic dedicated to reasoning about the specification logic, within the context of a theorem-proving system named Abella.

Within Abella, the properties of the specification logic can be invoked either automatically or by employing tactics. The study illustrates this with a property demonstrating that a certain judgment doesn't change even when the context of assumptions is modified. This is an example of the kind of argument that can be proven within Abella's logic, termed G.

One advantage of Abella is that inductive arguments do not require specifying a natural number target, as they are built into all definitions implicitly. Consequently, induction over a definition actually references this implicit argument.

The authors then discuss how proofs in this system are typically created, often relying on induction, case analysis, leveraging lemmas, and forming arguments based on hypotheses, yet foregoing extensive detailing of these proofs. Instead, the focus is on emphasizing the use of inductive arguments and key lemmas, with the understanding that full details are available in the software's distribution.

A challenge in proving weak normalizability is that the property doesn't hold under the application operation. It's necessary to strengthen this property to include the notion of closure under application. A logical relation called 'reduce' is defined to tackle this issue.

Also discussed are results concerning the occurrences of nominal constants in judgments and proving properties of substitutions, particularly the property that closed terms (typeable in an empty context) remain unaffected by substitutions.

The paper concludes that while testing with prototypical examples has shown the two-level logic approach to be promising for reasoning about formal systems, practical issues with Abella have been identified. The study recognizes these problems and proposes future work to address them.
