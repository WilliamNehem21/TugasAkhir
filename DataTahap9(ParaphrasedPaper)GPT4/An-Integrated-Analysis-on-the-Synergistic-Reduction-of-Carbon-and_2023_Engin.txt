The academic paper states that while Carbon Emission Reduction (CER) in the iron and steel industry (ISI) can be influenced by adjusting the ratios of Scrap Steel Ratio (SSR) and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) usage, significant CER can only be maintained if Crude Steel Production (CSP) growth is kept below 2.2% per year. To sustain 2021 levels of carbon emissions by the year 2030, the SSR and the EAF ratio should stand at 50.0% and 14.8% respectively, with an 84.0% SSR of EAF. 

Particulate Matter (PM) emissions are projected to rise by 8%, mainly due to increased emissions from the steel scrap pretreatment process as SSR increases. In contrast, solid waste (SW) generation is anticipated to decrease from 385 million tons in scenario SC-1 to 356 million tons in scenario SC-4.

The research underscores that controlling the growth of CSP is crucial to curbing both carbon and pollution emissions in the ISI, with the composition of raw materials and adjustments to technology playing supportive roles. With an annual CSP growth rate near 2%, carbon emissions in 2030 can only match 2021 levels with extensive adoption of steel scrap recycling and EAF technologies; however, CSP growth will also lead to increased emissions of pollutants like PHPs, PM, and SO2. Moreover, while China implemented regulations to control CSP in 2021, production still exceeded the set target by 35 million tons, and in the first three quarters of 2022, production reached 0.81 billion tons, marking 81% of the yearly target, suggesting the need for stricter enforcement.

The paper also highlights the varied outcomes between CER and Pollution Emission Reduction (PER) when employing different low-carbon measures due to the varying Carbon Emission Intensity (CEI) and Pollution Emission Intensity (PEI) across different industrial processes. PM emissions, unlike other pollutants (COD, PM, SO2, NOx), could increase; consequently, an integrated, multi-objective optimization of the industry's developmental pathway is necessary, considering differences in environmental capacities across regions.
