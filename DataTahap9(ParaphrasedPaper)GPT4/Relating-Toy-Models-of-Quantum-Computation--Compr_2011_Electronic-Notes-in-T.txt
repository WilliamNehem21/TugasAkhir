The complexity of mathematical models of physical systems, especially those in quantum physics, can be attributed to the sophisticated mathematical frameworks they are based upon. The process of identifying and examining the conceptual elements and specific quantum phenomena that emerge from segments of these frameworks has a history that dates back to the seminal work of Birkhoff and von Neumann.

Different interpretations of test spaces are prevalent in scholarly discussions. In our perspective, test spaces can be seen as a relational construct akin to rays, though numerous scholars conceive them as generalizations of bases. This interpretation is also viable and can be articulated through the concept of comprehension, although a detailed discussion on this would need to be reserved for a later time.

Dagger autonomous categories offer a semantically richer landscape when compared to dagger compact categories. These categories not only capture the essence of abstract composition and duality operations that are instrumental in constructing quantum systems and processes (traits characteristic of the dagger compact framework), but they also encapsulate the notion of complementarity, which is central to quantum logic. Complementarity, when considered as an integral aspect of the global structure of quantum computation, gives rise to the concept of dagger autonomy.

Nevertheless, a more detailed or refined representation does not necessarily lead to greater understanding. A key advantage of the dagger compact structure lies in its compatibility with a streamlined string diagram calculus that facilitates computations. Whether there exists an analogous, practical expansion of this calculus that accommodates the dagger autonomous structure—and the extent to which such a development might prove useful—remains an open question.
