The concept of a bounded functor is discussed in works referenced as [rut96] and [gs98], where they also establish Theorem 2.7 in the context of coalgebras over the category Set. A more extensive proof of the theorem that applies to a broader range of cases is available in sources [hug01] or [kur00].
