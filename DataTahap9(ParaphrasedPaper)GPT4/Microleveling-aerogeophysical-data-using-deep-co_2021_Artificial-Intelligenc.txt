The paper discusses a method to correct a type of noise in airborne geophysical data known as streaky noise, which remains even after the standard leveling process. This noise affects the ability to process and interpret the data accurately. The authors introduce a novel two-step microleveling technique to address this issue. Firstly, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used to approximate the raw data into two components: a nature-reflecting low-level portion and a high-level detailed corrugated residual. Secondly, the mixture of Gaussians robust principal component analysis (MoG-RPCA) is employed to extract subtle geological structural details from the residual component.

The DCNN operates without the need for a training dataset, leveraging a handcrafted network as a "deep image prior" to encapsulate the low-level natural geological formations within the aerogeophysical data. MoG-RPCA is used to separate the remaining fine-scale structures, improving upon the limitations of RPCA by handling data noise as a mixture of Gaussians, which has proven useful for noise removal and background subtraction in other fields, such as machine learning and computer vision.

Experiments with both synthetic and real field data demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework. The final microleveling result combines the low-level component obtained from the DCNN and the fine-scale structures extracted by the MoG-RPCA, enhancing the accuracy of the data for interpretation.

The paper is structured to detail the algorithms (DCNN and MoG-RPCA), present their respective models and parameter selections, discuss experimental outcomes, and finally, conclude the findings. The combination of DCNN and MoG-RPCA also has the potential to generate labeled data for supervised machine learning methods, further contributing to advancing microleveling techniques in aerogeophysical surveys.
