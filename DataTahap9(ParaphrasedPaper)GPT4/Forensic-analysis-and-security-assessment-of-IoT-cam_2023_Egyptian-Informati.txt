The Internet of Things (IoT) is plagued by intricate firmware issues, due to the multiple specialty microprocessors within each device, each running its firmware and potentially different operating systems. Firmware ensures these devices perform their designated functions and manage diverse physical components, like the device kernel, file system, and bootloader.

Son et al. (2019) proposed a blockchain and IPFS-based firmware management architecture to improve security and allow secure firmware updates through blockchain networks. Thakur et al. (2019) offered a method for over-the-air firmware updates to overcome the inefficiencies of manual upgrades. Zhu et al. (2020) used code similarity and homology analysis for detecting security concerns in IoT firmware. Another study by Zhu et al. (2019) developed a dynamic analysis tool to detect memory corruption issues in lightweight IoT device firmware packages.

Jang et al. (2020) investigated IoT firmware behaviors and vulnerabilities, introducing an S-trace-based dynamic analysis model for immediate use on IoT devices. Wang et al. (2021) introduced a smart scheme for analyzing firmware file systems and building a repository of their characteristics. The IETF's new SUIT specification was evaluated by researchers for secure IoT firmware updates on devices with limited resources, demonstrating its viability.

Ahmed et al. (2020) developed a scalable method to check IoT firmware security against the Mirai botnet, finding a significant number of firmwares vulnerable to it. Almazrouei et al. (2023) focused on the security issues of IP cameras, aiming to predict attacker behaviors and improve system security.

The research quoted underscores the importance of addressing firmware vulnerabilities to protect privacy and enhance cybersecurity awareness. It also brings attention to manufacturer and service provider responsibility for the security of their IoT products. Finally, it stresses the need for secure firmware updating mechanisms across different IoT devices to prevent them from becoming persistent security threats.
