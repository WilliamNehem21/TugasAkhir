Model-checking can yield insights into biochemical systems by answering quantitative questions difficult to address with stochastic simulations alone. This process can be computationally intensive and unmanageable for larger systems and also requires predefined molecule count bounds for each species. This paper introduces a method that combines stochastic simulation with the PRISM model checker to determine these molecule count bounds and reduce the computational demands of model-checking.

Stochastic simulation is first used to establish realistic bounds for molecular populations, which inform the PRISM model's parameters and define its state space. This preliminary simulation can also identify time intervals of interest for focused model-checking, or use experimental data when available.

The paper aims to explore how stochastic simulation can aid in making model-checking more feasible for analyzing biochemical systems. By using bounds derived from simulations, model-checking can be significantly accelerated with minimal error introduced.

This research contributes by integrating simulation and model-checking in two novel ways: initially, simulation informs the scope of model-checking, and secondarily, the paper compares results from exact and approximate probabilistic model-checking approaches.

Probabilistic model-checking is appealing because it offers definite answers to stochastic properties of biochemical phenomena without needing multiple runs for averages. However, the traditional approach is limited by state-space explosion as system complexity increases and is better suited for models where all species have low molecule counts.

To address limitations with models involving processes like synthesis, this paper applies stochastic simulation to bound discrete-state models, thus converting an unbounded problem into a bounded one.

The paper focuses on biochemical networks, typified by species interacting through reactions with specific kinetic laws. It addresses how to determine molecule count bounds for these species, noting that reliance on experimental data or pre-existing biological knowledge can be inadequate due to incompleteness or variability. Stochastic simulations inform the selection of bounds that are plausible.

The paper utilizes the BIO-PEPA language to represent biochemical networks, and implements automation for generating simulation models and PRISM input, as well as for executing independent simulation runs.

In summary, this work suggests a method where stochastic simulation assists in setting bounds for model-checking, thus making this computationally intensive technique more practical for studying biochemical systems, while also reducing the uncertainty inherent in stochastic simulations.
