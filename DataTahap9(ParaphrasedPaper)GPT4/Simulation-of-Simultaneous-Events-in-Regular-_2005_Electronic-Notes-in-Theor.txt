The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a summary of the MAC framework, while Section 3 introduces the MEDL-RE extension. The construction of the dependency graph is the focus of Section 4. The Augmented DFA algorithm is presented and validated in Section 5. Section 6 reviews related literature, and the paper concludes with Section 7.

Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is adept at expressing a broad range of system safety properties. Monitoring scripts use the Primitive Event Definition Language (PEDL) to specify the transmission and processing of data into events for the MAC system. Steering actions in response to breaches are scripted in the Steering Action Definition Language (SADL). For specifics, references [9,10] are suggested.

An event represents an instantaneous occurrence, while a condition denotes a state that persists over time. Boolean operatory syntax and specific event triggers are detailed, with formal semantics available in references [9,11].

MEDL integrates PEDL events, composite events, and condition definitions, as well as stating safety properties, with auxiliary variables and functions for additional capability. Safety conditions ensure persistent system truths, whereas alarms highlight undesired states. For instance, specific variables might track event frequencies, aiding in raising alerts upon certain thresholds being met.

Monitoring aims for efficiency, prompting the preference for Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) over Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) due to resource considerations. The paper chooses an Aho, Sethi, and Ullman algorithm for its proficiency in direct DFA construction, as supported by Watson's empirical findings.

DFA simulation steps involve comparing events with potential transitions and tracking system state changes. Challenges arise when multiple events are simultaneously generated; this facet is elaborated in Section 5.

Primitive and composite events and conditions are detailed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Composite events, triggered by primitive ones, are unordered due to simultaneous occurrence.

Regular Expressions (REs) defining composite events require handling simultaneous incidents, where event order is inconsequential. An approach involving the augmentation of DFAs with alternative transitions is outlined so that simultaneous event recognition can occur during system runtime.

Section 4 outlines handling special cases, like concurrent event occurrences (e1&&e2), and the intersection of resultant event dependencies.

To handle simultaneous events efficiently, additional information is incorporated into the DFA. An algorithm is proposed that expands upon a minimal DFA (DFAorg) to construct an augmented DFA (DFAaug), assuming that simultaneous events are not multiple instances of the same event.

Linearization establishes a total order within a set of simultaneous events. The proposed algorithm outlines several key steps based on linearizations and alternative transitions, aiming to simplify state navigation within DFAs and maintain the integrity of event tracking.
