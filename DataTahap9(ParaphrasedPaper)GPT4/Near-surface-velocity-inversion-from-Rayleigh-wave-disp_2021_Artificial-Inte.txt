The paper discusses a non-invasive technique for quickly determining the sub-surface velocity profiles by interpreting the dispersion curves of surface waves. To enhance this method, the study introduces the Block Coordinate Descending (BCD) method to bolster the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm's ability to optimize multiple parameters simultaneously. The goal is to accurately invert the parameters, specifically the thickness (h) and shear-wave velocity (Vs), for each stratum in a layered subsurface model using the improved SA algorithm.

The study focuses on using the fundamental-order Rayleigh wave's dispersion curve, selected due to its higher energy and easiness to observe, to invert the near-surface Vs and h for individual layers. An advanced technique, the Fast Generalized Reflection-Transmission Coefficient method, is employed to calculate dispersion curves for various models.

To enhance the inversion's precision, the values for Vs and h are allowed to vary within a defined range (0.5 to 1.5 times their true value). Practical limits are also placed on the search ranges for these parameters to constrain the inversion solution space. The research notes that the investigational depth is limited to half the maximum wavelength of the Rayleigh wave.

The paper details the inclusion of Gaussian noise (at 20 dB) in the dispersion curve to assess the performance of the improved SA algorithm (BCDESA) and the conventional SA algorithm under noisy conditions. The termination error for BCDESA is set to 12 due to the mean square error of the data, with and without noise, falling between 10 and 11, while other parameters remain unchanged.

Inverting Vs profiles from Rayleigh wave dispersion curves is a typical nonlinear inverse problem with multiple parameters and high dimensionality. Traditional nonlinear inversion techniques, like the SA algorithm, encounter significant errors with an increase in the number of layers. The paper proposes the BCDESA algorithm, which resolves the high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problem by incorporating the BCD algorithm into the SA methodology. The Differential Evolution (DE) technique's attributes of population evolution and optimal control are applied to the SA algorithm, guiding the entire iterative process with regards to error and avoiding instability in the inversion process. This innovative approach is suggested for potential use in other nonlinear inverse problems in the future.
