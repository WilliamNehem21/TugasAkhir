The concept of automaton minimization has been expanded to the framework of compositional settings within graph spans, particularly in the context of branching bisimulation. Such minimization techniques underpin compositional model checking strategies, which aim to overcome the issue of exponential state growth seen in comprehensive automated state-space exploration. These methods have been effectively implemented in actual model-checking tools and have addressed various issues, although their limitations have been identified.

Concerning model checking, the issues under consideration are restricted by exponential functions, denoted as b(n) = c^n, where c represents the maximum quantity of states and transitions any problem instance xi can possess. The focus, however, is on problems that can be restricted by polynomial functions.

Remark 4.6 provides detailed characterizations of the four minimal graph spans, f1, f2, f3, and f4, as derived from lemma 4.4. It's clarified that f1 comprises 4 states, corresponding to cases where states 4, 5, 7, and 8 are nonexistent. Span f2 includes 6 states when cases 3 and 6 are absent. Spans f3 and f4 each contain 5 states; f3 lacks cases 3, 7, and 8, while f4 lacks cases 4, 5, and 6. These minimal spans are described as subsets of the larger span, q, which possesses 8 states, each representing outcomes from the partition described in lemma 4.4's proof. The transitions are subsequently detailed:

- Span f1 is a subset of q consisting of states 1, 2, 3, and 6.
- Span f2 is a subset of q including states 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Span f3 is a subset of q with states 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Span f4 is a subset of q with states 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.
