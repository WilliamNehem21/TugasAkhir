This academic paper discusses the use of coalgebras in examining reactive systems, framing this study within the context of measurable spaces and functions with an emphasis on stochastic behavior. The role that the subprobability functor (S) plays is analogous to the role of the powerset functor, but it focuses on stochastic aspects rather than non-deterministic ones.

The paper introduces two key technical properties of sets of predicate liftings: separability and admissibility. The concept of separable predicate liftings presented here is a refined version of the definition previously used in coalgebraic logic over the category of sets. The first proposal of this notion for unary predicate liftings is also acknowledged.
