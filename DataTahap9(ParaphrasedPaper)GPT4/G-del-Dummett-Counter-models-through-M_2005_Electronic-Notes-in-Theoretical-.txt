The academic paper outlines a method to determine the provability of formulas within a logical calculus (LC) and construct counter-models for unprovable formulas. The three-step process begins with building a specially structured graph called a bi-colored graph (GD) based on the decomposition tree of a given formula (D). This graph includes green and red arrows, which may have boolean conditions attached to them.

The essence of the decision procedure hinges on finding a way to instantiate the boolean conditions in such a manner that the resulting specific graph (an instance graph) does not have any R-cycles. Initial details are laid out informally, followed by a concrete decision algorithm involving conditional matrix computation to tackle this problem. If the instance graph is devoid of R-cycles, one can construct a counter-model from it by computing a bi-height.

A key theorem presented in the paper states that a formula D of LC is provable if and only if every instance graph derived from its associated bi-colored graph contains at least one R-cycle. In practical terms, the task then becomes finding boolean valuations that break all the R-cycles in the graph. While a simple method would involve identifying all R-cycles and solving a corresponding boolean constraint system, this na√Øve approach is deemed highly inefficient due to the potential exponential number of R-cycles.

To address this, the paper suggests solutions to eliminate R-cycles and describes the implementation of a prototype. This prototype uses sparse arrays to represent conditional matrices and employs Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) for efficient boolean function processing. Moreover, the algorithm used to compute bi-heights is a slightly tailored variant of a depth-first search algorithm.

Overall, the paper discusses a theoretical framework and accompanying practical tools for analyzing logical formulas, specifically focusing on the detection of provability and the construction of counter-models when formulas are found to be unprovable within the logical calculus under investigation.
