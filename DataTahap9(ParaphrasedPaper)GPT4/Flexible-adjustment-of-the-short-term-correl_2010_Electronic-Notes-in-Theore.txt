In the research we present and evaluate, we introduce a traffic model. We discuss in Section 5 the application of the Whittle estimator as a method to validate that these new models offer increased adaptability when fitting to the autocorrelation function derived from real-world VBR data. Section 6 concludes the paper with final observations and directions for future research.
