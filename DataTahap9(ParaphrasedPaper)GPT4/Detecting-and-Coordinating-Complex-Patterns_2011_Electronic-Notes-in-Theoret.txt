A distributed system is a network of independent computers referred to as nodes or hosts, which are linked by a network and distribution middleware. This middleware enables coordination and resource sharing such that to the users, the system appears as a singular, coherent computing resource. Crafting these systems is complex due, in part, to the lack of specialized mechanisms within predominant techniques and tools for explicitly defining and managing the distribution aspects and communication methods. Programmers often resort to creating complex, individual software components to implicitly manage these aspects, leading to a scattered and intricate codebase that's hard to maintain and understand.

This paper proposes new design strategies and an event-driven kernel library to address these limitations. Despite existing best practices and design patterns that target the challenges of distributed systems, they typically fall short in reducing actual code complexity, as demonstrated by research into Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) server clusters.

The document includes a thorough analysis of practical scenarios highlighting the difficulties in managing distributed events. Current middleware and debugging tools lack the abstractions necessary to succinctly capture complex interacting events, forcing developers to encode control flow dependencies manually, making the debugging and testing of distributed systems particularly challenging.

The proposed kernel library uses an event model based on finite state automata to detect complex event patterns. A fully distributed architecture is suggested, where every node can join or leave the network at will and notify others about event occurrences. The implementation of this model with automata allows the translation of event patterns into detectable states.

The library supports the construction of sophisticated distributed aspect-oriented languages, as exemplified by AWED, an aspect-oriented extension developed to address cross-cutting concerns in distributed systems. The study also evaluates the library's effectiveness in encapsulating coordination logic within distributed applications, ultimately offering enhancements to distributed aspect-oriented programming.

Future work aims to enhance the model with complex patterns like epsilon transitions, push-down automata, and implement applications such as a fully distributed debugger for Java and tools for dynamic graphical modeling that can generate software artifacts.
