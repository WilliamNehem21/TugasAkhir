An academic paper describes enhancements to the typical performance limitations of integrated Hall elements used in magnetic microsystems chip design. This was achieved through the development of an efficient, integrated micro coil. This micro coil was optimized utilizing advanced finite element multiphysics simulations. A comprehensive analysis of the integrated Hall element led to the formulation of a detailed simulation model applicable to high-level system simulations and precise circuit evaluations. The effectiveness of these enhancements and the simulation model was confirmed through experimental testing of the produced application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).

The paper explores the integration of different magnetic field sensor types on a chip, including Hall-effect sensors and micro coils for generating alternating current (AC) magnetic fields. The authors focus on the Hall element and the near-field micro coil, examining their use in the study.

One critical factor affecting Hall elements is the temperature coefficient of Hall element sensitivity, which is notably non-linear and heavily influenced by the fabrication process. Furthermore, mechanical stress from packaging influences the sensor's accuracy. To counterbalance these impacts and turn an imprecise sensor into a precise measurement system, the paper suggests real-time sensor sensitivity calibration employing a near-field micro coil.

The micro coil's essential purpose is to induce a strong onboard reference magnetic field, aiding in the real-time or post-production adjustment of the Hall element's sensitivity. Offline sensitivity tuning can be done at the wafer sorting stage or during final testing by running a reference current through the coil and calibrating the Hall element's output as needed. Despite being straightforward, this adjustment technique doesn't address the temperature-related sensitivity changes or those stemming from the packaging-induced stress.

The paper emphasizes that ongoing investigation and development of these magnetic sensor systems are crucial for achieving higher precision in integrated Hall elements within microsystems technologies.
