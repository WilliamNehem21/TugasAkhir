The problem of optimizing station locations involves determining where new facilities should be added along existing railway lines to increase ridership. The primary objective is to make train travel more appealing for local commuters without causing significant inconvenience to current passengers through higher costs and increased travel time. Consequently, the study aims to recommend the fewest number of new stations possible, inspired by a joint analysis with Deutsche Bahn regarding this issue.

For a solitary railway segment, the station location issue is computationally manageable within polynomial time constraints, yet when dealing with multiple segments, the problem escalates to NP-hard status. A practical method to mitigate complexity involves segmenting the railway network into discrete, independent sections. This strategy requires careful examination of overlapping segments to refine solutions. The current paper serves as an initial exploration of such segmentation methods.

Evidence is provided that a specific algorithm can evaluate the need for up to four new stations along two intersecting railway lines by considering whether they can sufficiently serve the intersection zone. Should four stations fall short, a fifth is added to ensure complete coverage. The algorithm's efficiency is confirmed, operating within cubic time complexity.

The study proceeds to discuss the intricate challenge of covering the intersection of two straight railway lines, highlighting the difficulty of the problem—which is NP-hard—and providing an analytical approach based on the angle of intersection. This approach yields an algorithm that efficiently calculates a near-optimal number of discs (proxy for stations) required to cover the junction, even though it isn't guaranteed to determine the absolute minimum number. The insights gained are then extrapolated to the broader issue of station placement on a network with two railways intersecting at a significant angle.
