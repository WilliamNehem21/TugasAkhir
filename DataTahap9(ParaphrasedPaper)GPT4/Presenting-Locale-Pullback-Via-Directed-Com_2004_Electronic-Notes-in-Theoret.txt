This academic paper discusses the structure of frames in mathematical logic, particularly their infinitary directed join and finitary (distributive lattice) aspects, with the aim of illuminating the parallels between certain mathematical concepts like proper and open maps. The authors suggest that in the duality of frames, the finitary structure is inverted, while the infinitary structure remains unchanged. They present a unified pullback stability result for locale maps with a special type of assignments called "tri-quotient assignments." This result generalizes to known stability results for proper and open maps when considered dually.

The paper highlights the significance of the Townsend/Vickers result, which provides an external characterization of the part of the theory of locales invariant under this duality. This characterisation is particularly important as it could help refine the definition of continuity in mathematical contexts. Furthermore, by extending the discussion to geometric morphisms (a concept in topos theory), the authors believe that their work could further deepen our understanding of the relationship between proper and open maps within the framework of topos theory, which is a branch of mathematics that generalizes set theory and serves as a foundation for various mathematical theories.
