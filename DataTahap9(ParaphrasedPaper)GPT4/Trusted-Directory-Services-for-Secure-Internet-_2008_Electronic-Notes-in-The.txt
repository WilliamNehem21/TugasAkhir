The paper discusses the importance of securely linking authentication credentials to corresponding cryptographic keys to prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. It explains that merely possessing public keys is insufficient to confirm the true owner of those keys, often requiring a Trusted Third Party (TTP) to establish a trustworthy connection between individuals and their keys.

Public key authentication is a system that verifies whether a public key belongs to a specific entity. Two primary methods for this include the Certificate Authority (CA) model, utilized in protocols like SSL/TLS, and the web-of-trust model seen in systems like PGP. Obtaining public keys usually involves either direct communication with a TTP or accessing a public, trusted directory that provides keys for many parties.

The paper proposes leveraging DNS (Domain Name System) and its secure variant, DNSSEC, to create directories for public keys and certificates, particularly for Virtual Organizations (VOs) â€” groups with common interests in secure credential exchange. This concept is similar to how grid computing VOs operate.

The paper acknowledges the complexity and limitations of using X.509 certificates, which can be federated and syndicated. It suggests DNS, with existing protocols for syndication and simple ways to emulate federation, can integrate with DNSSEC to provide a trust layer and assist in establishing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

Despite DNS being initially designed for identifying network resources, it can resolve credentials using key and cert records. The proposal to use DNS as a trusted directory for keys and certificates has sparked debate within the DNS community. The use of DNS for this purpose raises two major concerns: 

1. Performance: DNS was optimized for small messages, and integrating key and certificate data would significantly increase the network load. For large certificates, DNS might have to switch from UDP to TCP, increasing resource usage and latency.

2. Dependability: Relying on DNS for certificate resolution makes it a prime target for attacks and a potential single point of failure. 

Furthermore, the proposed e-TLS protocol is susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks as it processes the presented certificates, a vulnerability shared with the standard TLS protocol.
