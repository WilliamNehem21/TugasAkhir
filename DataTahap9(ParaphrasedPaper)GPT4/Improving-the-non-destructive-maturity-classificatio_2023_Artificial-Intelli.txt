The durian, sometimes referred to as the "king of fruits," is a significant agricultural commodity, with Thailand being its top producer and exporter globally, especially the renowned Mon Thong variety for its sweet and delightful flavor. According to 2021 data, Thailand exported roughly 900,000 tons of durian, a market worth around $3 billion, marking a significant increase from the previous year.

To assess durian sweetness, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been applied in both online (with moving samples) and offline (with stationary samples) settings, with the online method yielding an R² of 0.70 and an RMSEP of 4.0%, and the offline method an R² of 0.81 and an RMSEP of 3.27%. NIR hyperspectral imaging has been used to predict dry matter (DM) content and to classify durian pulp ripeness.

Existing literature indicates that NIR spectroscopy is a highly promising method for determining the maturity and ripeness of durian fruit and pulp, though past research methods have been destructive or minimally destructive. This study aimed to apply NIR spectroscopy non-destructively to whole fruits to classify their maturity stage using both short-wave and long-wave NIR. The study had two main goals: first, to develop a classification model for the maturity stages of whole Mon Thong durians using SWNIR and LWNIR spectroscopy, and second, to identify the best method for fully non-destructive maturity classification.

A total of 160 durian samples, collected at various stages post-blossoming, were classified into three maturity stages: unripe (80-100 DAB), pre-mature (101-120 DAB), and mature (121-130 DAB). Additional ripening occurred in some pre-mature fruits for seven days to reach the ripe stage, thus including this fourth class for classification. The cross-validation (CV) approach used for model training involved dividing the data into five sections and using each as a test set in turn, while the remaining data served as the training set.

The research also explored combining pre-processed rind spectral data with raw or pre-treated stem spectral data to generate a comprehensive classification model. The purpose of this blending was to test its effectiveness in classifying the ripeness stages into unripe, pre-mature, mature, and ripe.

The study concluded that NIR spectroscopy is efficient in reducing operational time, and that using rind positions combined with stem spectra yielded similar performance in predictions, regardless of the position sampled on the rind. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification model built from mean-absorption (MA) baseline-corrected rind spectra (from different rind positions) and MA-smoothed and normalized variance (SNV) stem spectra proved to be successful for the SWNIR spectrometer, providing accurate categorization of the maturity stages.
