In the research paper, the authors discuss the complexities of demonic refinement algebra and the extensive nature of their proof search and axiom usage. To maintain readability, they have omitted complete details such as all input/output files and full machine proofs from the paper but make them available on a website for interested readers.

The authors clarify that the refinement calculus developed by Back and von Wright, which relies on a predicate transformer model, is not included in their demonic refinement algebra since it doesn't fully meet the Kleene algebra axioms. Specifically, they differentiate between universally and positively conjunctive (or disjunctive) predicate transformers in relation to these axioms, with the former being compatible and the latter not.

Building on the predicate transformer model and dealing with infinite iteration, the authors have formulated axioms for their demonic refinement algebra. They reiterate that demonic refinement algebras cannot capture relational semantics because of the implications of the right zero axiom on the isolation axiom.

The structure of the input provided for proofs includes the precedence of operators, axioms of demonic refinement algebra, and previously proved useful laws. This structure aims to aid in the development of basic refinement laws, which can prove more complex ones or help analyze and refine software programs without always resorting to lower-level axioms found in Kleene algebra.

The authors also mention a toolkit of theorems for Kleene algebras and extensions that leverage the right zero axiom, which is relevant in the weaker context of demonic refinement algebra. The use of Prover9 and Mace4 software helps them to confirm the validity of hypotheses and incrementally build towards a proof by avoiding counterexamples.

They have applied this automated proof framework to laws for data refinement of action systems, translating laws from the predicate transformer setting to demonic refinement algebra. This section of the work involves balancing the need for specific hypotheses with higher-level refinement laws to create a manageable proof search with Prover9.

In a specific proof regarding data refinement, they list several hypotheses related to data refinement by upward simulation and the standard data refinement of initializations and finalizations. Their approach leverages experience in data refinement to hypothesize that certain denesting and commutation strategies along with simulation laws would be instrumental in translating algebraic reasoning into diagrams for refinement processes.

The authors report that simplifying the atomicity refinement theorem leads to efficient automated proofs, and they propose extending demonic refinement algebras to include downward simulations for a more comprehensive model of data refinement.

They express gratitude towards Mark Schaefer for providing computational resources that aided their proof search and to the reviewer for insightful literature suggestions.
