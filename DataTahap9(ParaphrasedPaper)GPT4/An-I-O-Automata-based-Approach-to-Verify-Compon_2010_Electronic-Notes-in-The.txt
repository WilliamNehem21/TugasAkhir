This paper addresses the challenge that developers face in determining whether the assembly of components in their software applications is correct when using platforms like CORBA, Fractal, or .NET. The focus is on component interfaces described by interface automata, which define action protocols for scheduling component operations. Related works include models that associate protocols with component connectors, and studies comparing interoperability at different levels (operation signatures, interface protocols, and quality of service).

The authors build on the work of L. de Alfaro and T. Henzinger, who used interface automata to model component interfaces with input, output, and internal actions. These automata allow interfaces to interoperate by synchronizing actions. The paper presents an approach that not only reuses this model but also strengthens it by incorporating action semantics for more reliable interoperability verification.

Here is an overview of the paper's structure:

1. Interface automata are introduced, along with definitions and an algorithm for verifying component interface compatibility (Section 2).
2. The authors describe their approach to verifying interface compatibility and apply it to the case study of the Cycab vehicle (Section 3 and 4).
3. The paper concludes with a summary and future research perspectives (Section 5).

I/O automata, defined by Nancy A. Lynch and Mark Tuttle, are used to model distributed and concurrent systems and have actions categorized as input, output, and hidden.

The authors propose enhancing interface automata by annotating transitions with pre- and post-conditions and adapting the existing compatibility verification algorithm to take these conditions into account. The composition of interfaces remains consistent with existing methods, with the synchronization of shared actions and interleaving of others.

The Cycab case study is a fully computer-manipulated electronic transportation vehicle with various automatic driving modes. Using an analysis of illegal states and backward reachability, the authors show that the vehicle and station interfaces are incompatible.

Research directions of the paper include creating a verification tool incorporating action pre- and post-conditions and studying composite components to ensure they meet the composite's constraints.

Referencing a work by Becker, Overhage, and Reussner, the paper indicates the classification of software component interoperability errors to support component adaptation.

Thus, the paper contributes to the field of component-based software engineering by enhancing the theory of interface automata with action semantics to verify component interface compatibility in a more rigorous manner.
