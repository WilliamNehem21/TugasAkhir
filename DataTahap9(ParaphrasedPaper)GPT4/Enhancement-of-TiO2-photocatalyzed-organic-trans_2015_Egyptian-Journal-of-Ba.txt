Paraphrasing of the provided text:

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) in its anatase form serves as a photocatalyst for the oxidation of diphenylamine (DPA) into N-phenyl-p-benzoquinonimine (PBQ) when exposed to light in an ethanol environment. The production of PBQ escalates with the increase in DPA concentration, TiO2 amount, the rate of air flowing in, and the strength of the light. UV-C light proves more effective than UV-A in this photocatalytic process, and the TiO2 catalyst can be recycled. A reaction mechanism for the photocatalysis along with kinetic parameters has been suggested. The incorporation of zinc oxide (ZnO) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) boosts this oxidation process, indicating charge transfer interactions between different semiconductor particles.

Photocatalysis using semiconductors, for the purpose of environmental remediation, is a well-researched area. TiO2, due to its benign nature, is commonly used for such processes. Upon excitation, TiO2 generates electron-hole pairs, which can create reactive oxygen species (ROS) capable of breaking down organic contaminants. In non-aqueous media, the photogenerated holes can directly oxidize the adsorbed organic substance. TiO2 demonstrates selective oxidation of various organics, including converting alcohols into aldehydes or ketones, reducing functionalized nitroarenes, transforming olefins into epoxides, and oxidizing benzyl amines into imines.

For the experiments, fresh ethanol was placed into uniform cylindrical glass vessels with TiO2 catalyst powder covering their bottoms. Air was pumped in, and the resultant PBQ was monitored spectrophotometrically. To maintain consistency in sunlit experiments, the setup ensured equal sunlight exposure to all test areas, enabling comparative analysis despite varying reaction conditions.

The catalyst's performance does not proportionally increase with the TiO2 quantity beyond a certain critical amount. Increased TiO2 does not guarantee increased exposure to light, leading to nonlinear photocatalytic reactions with respect to light intensity.

In mixed semiconductor systems, charge separation often leads to more efficient photocatalysis. While coupled semiconductors share a single particle for charge separation, mixing TiO2 with ZnO or ZnS powders enhances DPA transformation to PBQ through interparticle charge transfer.

Although one might assume that mixing semiconductors in equal weight would yield maximum photocatalytic efficiency, factors such as different densities, particle sizes, and aggregation potentially interfere with this assumption. Additionally, electron transfers between excited states are unlikely due to their scarce population within the material.
