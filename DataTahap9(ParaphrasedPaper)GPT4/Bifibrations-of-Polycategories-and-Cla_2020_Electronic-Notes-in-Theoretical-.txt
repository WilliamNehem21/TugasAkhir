The paper suggests that Definition 2.8 can be seen as an extension of the concept of strong universal multimap within a multicategory, and similarly, Definition 2.10 extends the idea of representability from multicategories to polycategories (referencing Definition 2.5 for context). Section 3 of the paper will demonstrate that these ideas are actually special cases within a broader framework of fibrational concepts. Similar to how strong universal multimaps in a multicategory are compositionally closed, both in-universal and out-universal polymaps in a polycategory share this characteristic, being compositionally closed in a certain way.

Furthermore, the authors highlight that the findings in the current section, particularly those related to polycategorical Grothendieck correspondences, rely on the theoretical groundwork of weak 2-polycategories. However, they acknowledge that an elaborate theory of weak 2-polycategories has not yet been fully established. The authors propose that the development of this theory should be an objective for future research. Once the foundational aspects of weak 2-polycategories have been addressed, the authors intend to outline the assumed properties of such theoretical constructs, following a review of the established ideas related to categorical Grothendieck correspondences.
