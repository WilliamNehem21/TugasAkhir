Academic research has highlighted several non-functional issues in large-scale computing, notably the increasing cost of energy. Energy expenses are now the largest part of the total cost of ownership (TCO) for IT infrastructure. Data center operators may soon spend more on electricity than hardware, with energy costs overtaking hardware expenses within five years. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates data centers are responsible for 1.5% of U.S. electricity consumption. Gartner reported that the ICT industry accounted for 2% of global CO2 emissions in 2007. With the consumption of 56 terawatt-hours (TWh) by Western European data centers in 2007 and expectations to double by 2020, improving IT energy efficiency is critical.

Cloud computing offers significant benefits through its scalability and flexibility, transitioning from capital to operational expenditures. Its on-demand, seemingly infinite resources are crucial for processing the growing volume of data collected across various fields.

A key challenge in distributed systems is managing energy consumption against workload variability. Various load balancing techniques and traffic shaping measures can handle demand spikes, and strategies like dynamically increasing server availability during high demand can manage supply.

This paper continues by comparing the context of the current work to other energy reduction research. The system model is explained, six heuristic strategies for adjusting server power states are introduced, and simulation methods are detailed. Experiment results are discussed, with a focus on minimizing the time jobs remain in the system and balancing energy saving benefits.

Various states including powered-up, powered-down, and fault-mode servers, as well as transition possibilities between states are described. One heuristic involves picking an optimal number of servers to power on and then maintaining that number unless faults necessitate more power-ons.

A 'semi-static' method improves on static allocation by separately optimizing server numbers for high and low arrival periods, avoiding the issue of powering too many servers. However, this method underperforms when transition periods are erratic or long.

Another heuristic, the 'high/low', estimates job completion times based on processing speeds, considering the impacts of turning servers on or off. The heuristic prioritizes processing speed slightly over energy savings.

The data center model was simulated in Java with JFreeChart libraries, running over 10,000 units of simulated time. Each heuristic's performance, the cost impact of powering servers on and off, and the number of resulting faults were evaluated.

The paper concludes by acknowledging the limitations of the study, such as assuming negative exponentially distributed delays and identical servers, suggesting that future work could explore different server types and energy consumption patterns to enhance modeling accuracy and real-world applicability.
