This study examined the financial feasibility of implementing ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems on swine farms in Beijing, China, by comparing the initial costs and operating expenses of the GSHP system with those of coal-fired heating (CFH), wet curtain fan cooling (WCFC), and air conditioner (AC) heating and cooling systems. The research revealed that while the GSHP system had higher upfront costs than a combined CFH and WCFC system, its operating costs for heating were slightly less than CFH and similar to AC systems. For cooling, the GSHP system's operating costs were much lower than the AC, but higher than the WCFC system.

By 2009, Beijing had 18 million m^2 of buildings using GSHP systems, and projections showed an increase to 50 million m^2 by 2015. The sustainability of shallow groundwater heat pumps in the Beijing area has been assessed, and the city government has considered the feasibility of GSHP systems in policy decisions. Considering that GSHP systems are more expensive initially, they require financial support from the government to encourage adoption in swine farms despite their energy efficiency and lower emissions.

In terms of operating costs for cooling, GSHP systems proved to be more costly than WCFC but significantly cheaper than AC systems, while GSHP heating was more expensive than WCFC cooling. Currently, lack of subsidies means that Beijing's swine farmers are unlikely to adopt GSHP systems. However, considering the benefits of reduced PM2.5 pollution and energy savings during the heating period, GSHP systems could become more widely accepted in the future.
