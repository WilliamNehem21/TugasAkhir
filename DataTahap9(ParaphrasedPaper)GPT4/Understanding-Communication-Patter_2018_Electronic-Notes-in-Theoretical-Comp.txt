This brief research paper presents a preliminary exploration of communication patterns in the High Performance Conjugate Gradient (HPCG) benchmark. The study aims to pinpoint characteristics and patterns that could lead to enhancements in the efficiency of CG algorithms and applications dependent on them. The paper reports on collecting communication traces from HPCG benchmark executions across various processor configurations to identify possible efficiency impediments. Initial findings indicate that network throughput declines as more processes engage in mutual communication, caused by network contention.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the value of benchmarking systems and explains how it helps system designers to create the most appropriate architectures for their applications. There are many benchmarks offered for evaluating overall system performance and its subcomponents, each with its specific pros and cons. For instance, MPI benchmarks, like SKaMPI developed at the University of Karlsruhe and the Intel MPI Benchmarks, are useful tools for looking into subsystem performance, specifically MPI. These benchmarks are instrumental for testing communication via MPI on both point-to-point and collective levels with various message sizes.

The paper also notes a significant discrepancy between the observed network throughput (0.26 Gbps) during the benchmark and the maximum capability of the interconnect (70.96 Gbps), which suggests that the underperformance might be due to external network traffic affecting the shared system. Nonetheless, this external factor cannot fully account for the observed performance gap.

Finally, the paper cites a study by Rajovic et al., "Supercomputing with commodity CPUs: Are mobile SoCs ready for HPC?", presented at the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC), in 2013, which considers the potential of mobile System-on-Chips (SoCs) in high-performance computing applications.
