Hence, given u(tk) = (x, yk), the subsequent state u(tk + 1) will be (x, yk + y^2). Consequently, the particle requires a time increment of one to transition from yk to yk + y^2. Given the infinite count of these intervals, the particle is unable to reach infinity within a bounded temporal frame. As a result, for this initial condition (x, 0), the system does not experience a blowup.
