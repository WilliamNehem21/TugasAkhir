This paper continues prior research on asymptotic densities within propositional logic by examining the proportion of true formulas of a specified length (n) relative to all possible formulas of that same length. The main goal is to identify the limit of this proportion as the length approaches infinity, which if it exists, is termed the 'density of truth' for the logic in question.

A notable point discussed in the paper is an extension of the original language with the addition of negation. This extension revealed that the limit does indeed exist but that the presence of negation reduces the density of truth to about 42.32%. Moreover, the paper cites another study which introduces a quick (logarithmic time complexity) probabilistic method for determining if a given formula is a tautology.

Broader findings are available in another work that explores languages constructed with two connectives (AND, OR) and literals. For such languages, researchers concluded that the asymptotic density is present for any Boolean function, as long as the number of variables remains constant. They also refined the upper bounds for the asymptotic density for selected Boolean functions.

To proceed with the analysis, the paper focuses on establishing the value for 'tk'. An initial observation offers enough insight to derive a closed (but complex) expression for 'tk' in Lemma 2.5. Then, Theorem 2.6 provides a more practical form for working with 'tk'.

According to Lemma 2.2, each formula can be conceptualized as a binary tree, with leaves marked by variables. Therefore, the task becomes to count the binary trees with 2n leaves, where each label appears an even number of times. Following Remark 2.4, one can then deduce the quantity of all tautologies with an even length.

More specifically, in the case being discussed, there are 'c2n' binary trees with a single label. To conform with the requirement that each variable appears an even number of times, every tree must be labeled appropriately. The paper defines '2ij' (for j = 1,..., k) as the number of occurrences of the label 'vj'.
