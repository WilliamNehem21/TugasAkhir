The paper discusses the application of machine learning techniques, including neural networks, in selecting important features and predicting oil and gas production. Traditional methods mainly focused on medium to long-term forecasts but paid less attention to daily output time series and lifecycle anomaly detection for tight gas fields. To address this, the authors propose a new prediction approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, comparing it with existing machine learning methods such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

A Decision Tree (DT) is a method that builds a decision-making process, potentially leading to overfitting. To combat this, the RF algorithm uses multiple DTs and averages their predictions to improve robustness. RF generates different DTs through random sampling of the dataset.

SVR works on a linear function and creates a margin around it, penalizing data points that fall outside this margin using a loss function. The method uses kernel functions, like the Gaussian kernel, to handle data in higher-dimensional spaces.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) struggle with long-term input dependencies because as they backpropagate through layers, they can experience vanishing or exploding gradients. LSTM networks were developed to overcome these issues, allowing for handling long-term dependencies.

The study ignores some dynamic production characteristics of gas wells and focuses on daily gas production time series for predicting with RF, SVR, and a deep learning LSTM-based model (DLSTM-FNN). In a test on 1692 tight gas wells in the Sulige gas field, the RF performed best with small training sets, while DLSTM-FNN outperformed SVR in the test set, aligning well with actual daily production trends. The DLSTM-FNN offers better accuracy and reliability, making it suitable for time series prediction in other tight gas fields using transfer learning.
