Recent developments in the food industry have been marked by the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and blockchain technology. Chen and Yu (2021) have summarized advances in remote monitoring tools that are both efficient and cost-effective, highlighting AI-based methods, image processing, and sensor technologies for quality assessment in food. They mention that such technologies can be used for classifying products by shape and size, identifying defects and microbial contaminants, and grading food quality. Qazi et al. (2022) have reviewed the literature on IoT and AI applications in smart agriculture, discussing the current challenges and future directions. Tripodi et al. (2022) have focused on how AI and machine learning contribute to data analysis and their role in the development of new plant breeding methods.

The research presented unfolds in several stages, starting with an investigation of publication trends, key journals, nations, and impactful studies in the field, followed by discussion of findings, future research directions, and shortcomings. The study concludes with some reflective observations.

A bibliometric review shows that scholarly output in the AI sector saw a gradual increase from 1992 to 2000, a steady rise from 2001 to 2010, and a significant leap in publications from 2011 to 2020, peaking in 2020. This upsurge is attributed to the growing prevalence of AI applications within the agri-food sector. The most common AI techniques identified include machine learning, deep learning, and artificial neural networks. These have played a key role in digitizing agriculture, leveraging technologies such as robots, IoT, wireless sensor networks, and drones. However, emerging technologies like blockchain and augmented reality have been less prominent in the research data.

The most productive sources in this area were found to be technical journals, with "Computers and Electronics in Agriculture" being particularly prominent. Most influential research is from the United States, Europe, and Asia, with Latin American and African contributions being minimal.

The study points out the significant water consumption in agriculture and the need for AI to help manage water resources sustainably. Given the focus on effective water usage, AI could play an essential role in reducing health issues and pollution.

The study also provides a resource-based view (RBV) framework for practitioners, outlining seven resource categories for evaluating AI applications in agri-food processes. It emphasizes the importance of assessing the economic, technical, ethical, and social aspects of AI implementation.

The study's limitations include its reliance on a single database, the Web of Science, and the potential bias due to the authors' choice of keywords. Future studies could improve by using multiple databases, broadening keyword selection, and incorporating different analytical methods.

In conclusion, AI's integration in agri-food systems presents numerous benefits for modernizing agriculture throughout the entire supply chain. With increasing recognition since 2015, AI has potential in a variety of areas, including resource management and addressing barriers such as social, technical, privacy, ethical, and organizational concerns. The study anticipates future research to focus on enhancing AIâ€™s role in conjunction with other advanced technologies.
