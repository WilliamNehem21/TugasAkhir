Abstract Paraphrase:
Successfully forecasting time series data (TSD) over long periods is a valuable yet challenging task in various disciplines. This is particularly difficult for financial TSD due to their inherent volatility. A major issue in multi-step forecasting for financial TSD is achieving both high accuracy and preserving the underlying trend over the prediction horizon. Traditional linear models like ARIMA and GARCH can to some extent maintain trends at the expense of forecast precision. Alternatively, nonlinear models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) can offer accuracy but often lose track of the trend. This paper introduces a new linear hybrid model designed to preserve both high accuracy and the trend in forecasts. A thorough analysis supports the model’s effectiveness. The novel approach includes a MA filter for preprocessing, and partitioning and interpolation techniques. It's evaluated against existing models on NSE India stock market data, showing promising results.

Main Body Paraphrase:
Engle's ARCH model from 1982, and its subsequent enhancement, the GARCH model, introduced by Bollerslev, Engle, and Nelson in 1994, are well-regarded for predicting volatile TSD. Various GARCH extensions are surveyed and have found application in different markets such as the Swiss stock index and electricity markets, demonstrating improvements over ARIMA in environments with high volatility and price jumps. However, GARCH models may be insufficient when the data does not adhere to a Gaussian distribution, in which case distributions like Student’s t may be more appropriate as explored in literature.

The proposed model divides a TSD with 500 points, for example, into 10 sections with 50 points each using a partitioning and interpolation method. Apart from the significant benefit of being suitable for long-term predictions, the new model retains data dynamics and outperforms common ANN models in predictive accuracy. Unlike ANNs, which focus solely on maximizing prediction without considering data trends, the linear nature of the new model allows for trend preservation.

Despite the model's advantages, it does have limitations: the number of partitions is determined through trial and error, and the estimation of the optimal number of partitions can improve the model at the cost of increased complexity. Additionally, the model doesn’t consider covariates; while its current form works well with univariate data, incorporating covariates could further enhance accuracy by accounting for data dependencies, albeit with greater complexity and a need for more parameter tuning. These aspects are not covered in this research.

In testing with Tata Steel's number of trades data, the model's 20-step ahead predictions yielded better accuracy and trend preservation compared to existing models.
