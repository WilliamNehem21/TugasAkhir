Researchers investigate distinct groups within families using social data analysis, employing cluster analysis and data mining, which is a technique used to uncover patterns in databases across various sectors. Yet, social data sets pose unique challenges due to the nature of data collection and storage, which often leads to mixed-type data and missing values.

The study deployed the silhouette method to determine optimal clustering and used the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm, an improvement on k-means, which is known for its speed and simplicity. To handle data heterogeneity, they utilized the daisy function with the Gower similarity coefficient to process different data types.

In addition to clustering, the paper describes the use of classification techniques, like decision trees, to infer the predictive relevance of certain variables in the data. These trees provide insight into variable significance and interactions in the clustering outcome. Furthermore, feature selection was performed to eliminate redundant or irrelevant variables, enhancing the data mining process.

The analysis yielded significant findings among social security income and food security within two identified clusters of families. In Cluster 1, families generally had higher social security income and provided support to others, even when their income was lower. In contrast, families in Cluster 2 had less social security income but a higher food security index.

The paper concludes by noting the difficulties of handling categorical data in data mining and suggesting future work to improve data processing abilities, either by standardizing variables to numerical values, altering data collection methods, or applying advanced clustering and classification strategies that better accommodate categorical variables.
