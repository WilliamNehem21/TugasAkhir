In the early 1990s, the concept of a final f-coalgebra for a functor f in category theory emerged as a valuable tool for the theoretical representation of potentially infinite structures within computer science. These structures include data types such as infinite streams and dynamic systems like processes or automata, which can be understood as behavioral systems under a type f. This approach enabled a unified treatment of various formerly independent concepts.

The work discussed in this paper is generalized for an arbitrary category C, though examples and explanations are provided using the familiar category of sets and total functions, denoted SET, to aid comprehension. This paper serves as a condensed version of a more comprehensive CWI Technical Report with the same title, which includes detailed proofs and additional examples.

The proposed method allows for working directly with specific relations without the prerequisite of describing all potential configurations, which represents a shift from previous methods exemplified by Rutten, who considered all possible pairs in his approach.

This research lays the groundwork for future exploration of the framework's potential in different contexts. Discovering new applications is a goal, especially since the framework's effectiveness was established without requiring the functor T to be a pointed functor or a monad. This flexibility suggests that the framework can accommodate a wide array of examples.

Gratitude is extended to the author's colleagues, notably Jan Rutten, Alexandru Baltag, and Alexander Kurz, for their discussions and advice. Thanks are also given to Dirk Pattinson for his input, to anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions, and to Matteo Coccia for sparking the author's interest in category theory during a stay at the CWI.
