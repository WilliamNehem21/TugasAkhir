In research focusing on the potential applications of virtual reality (VR) in medical education, scholars have attempted to determine its effectiveness in teaching subjects like gastrointestinal endoscopy, anatomy, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Studies have indicated that the absence of tactile feedback limits VR's capacity to hone practical skills. Nevertheless, there is evidence to suggest that a combined learning approach, utilizing VR's immersive capabilities, could enhance baseline knowledge in anatomy, bolster clinical reasoning abilities, foster empathy towards patients, and better prepare students for hands-on clinical experiences.

The goal of our study was to analyze the effectiveness and practicality of VR in educational settings by testing both the educational content and the VR software. The research team explored, produced, and procured various VR educational modules, selecting four in particular due to their convenience, feasibility, and promising long-term applications:

1) A 360-degree video related to COVID-19, previously developed by a team member.
2) An anatomy learning module utilizing the HoloLens.
3) An assessment module that leverages Oculus headset and controllers.
4) A 360-degree video for research planning.

Participants faced technological challenges, such as iPhones no longer supporting YouTube's 360-view videos, prompting a switch to older Android devices to maintain module functionality.

Masters of Occupational Therapy students at the University of Toronto were the study's subjects, who were recruited without any coercion or impact on their academic performance. After consenting verbally and in writing, 23 students participated in the study and attended one of two three-hour VR module testing sessions, where they tested each VR module and completed a questionnaire immediately afterward.

The questionnaire, influenced by established models and scales, assessed students' perceptions of experiential learning and VR technology through a Likert scale and included an open question for additional feedback.

Analysis of the data showed that students preferred engaging with VR modules that allowed them to play an active role. Modules using HoloLens and Oculus were favored due to increased interactivity and immersion.

Participants appreciated the value VR added to the learning experience and found it a safe environment to practice clinical skills. Moreover, they also enjoyed learning new technology. Existing literature supports that devices like the Oculus enhance learning enjoyment and focus through increased user control and immersion.

However, some participants expressed concern over adapting to the new technology. The Google Cardboard headset was considered less engaging than other VR modalities, which is inconsistent with some prior research comparing immersion levels between different types of VR.

The findings suggest that VR has potential as an educational tool in medical education, yet future research should aim to quantify its effectiveness more rigorously compared to traditional methods.

Limitations of our study included small sample size, potential response bias from self-selected participants with an interest in VR, and mixed technology and pedagogies that hinder the clear assessment of learning impact. Finally, the incomplete response rate to the final survey may impact the reliability of the study's conclusions.
