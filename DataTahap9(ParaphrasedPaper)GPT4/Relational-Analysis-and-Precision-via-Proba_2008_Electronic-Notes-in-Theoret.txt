Our research presents a novel approach within the probabilistic abstract interpretation framework, expanding on standard abstract interpretation theory by Cousot and Cousot. Abstract interpretation traditionally simplifies a program's semantics, focusing solely on components pertinent to a particular analysis, represented within an abstract domain, usually formed as a complete partial order.

In this work, we apply abstract interpretation to linear operators on vector spaces, introducing the concept of a linear generalized inverse—specifically, the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse—as an analog to the traditional Galois connections, ensuring our abstraction's validity. Although our broader discussion pertains to Hilbert spaces, this paper primarily examines finite-dimensional vector spaces for probabilistic domains.

We evaluate our approach's precision using the metric \(\text{precf}(P, R)\), which reflects the completeness loss related to the chosen abstraction. A lower value indicates higher precision in the resulting analysis. We investigate different levels of abstraction, varying from weakly relational (providing limited variable correlation information) to stronger, more precise forms.

Our experimental results on analyzing extremely short programs highlight varying levels of precision across different types of abstractions. For example, assigning a constant value to a single variable, or assigning one variable's value to another, yields differing levels of precision across our abstractions.

We compare our methodology to previous work that quantifies static analysis precision using bounds on false positives. Although effective, those methods typically require manual validation, limiting the scalability and practicality within tools designed to optimize analysis selection. Our structured lattice of abstract interpretations, combined with a precision measurement method, offers a more systematic and potentially automated approach to choosing appropriate abstract domains for program analysis, enhancing both theoretical understanding and practical application.
