This paper discusses the need for reliable and energy-efficient multipath routing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to ensure critical information reaches the sink node from the event occurrence node effectively. The paper introduces a new event-triggered multipath routing mechanism utilizing static and mobile agents, which leverages the location information of sensor nodes and the sink node.

The proposed method involves several steps: the event node calculates a midpoint, establishes the shortest path using a mobile agent, identifies special intermediate nodes, and deploys cloned mobile agents to discover potential paths. The mobile agents collect information from each sensor node they pass, which the sink node uses to construct a partial network topology. Based on this information, the sink node determines multiple efficient paths considering link quality, energy ratio, and hop distance.

The paper compares the proposed system to traditional WSN mechanisms, highlighting limitations such as redundant data transmission and excessive energy consumption, which can impact network lifetime. It describes the advantages of the new multipath search protocol in finding node-disjoint paths, balancing network traffic, and optimizing energy use by taking into account battery relaxation times.

Additionally, the paper discusses other routing approaches, the drawbacks of existing techniques, and the benefits of employing mobile agents for intelligent path discovery. It underscores the importance of location information for efficient routing and suggests that expenses associated with GPS modules can be mitigated through selective implementation and localization techniques.

The rest of the paper is structured to provide an overview of software agents, an in-depth explanation of the proposed routing scheme (LEDMPR), simulation models, result analysis, and a comparison between mobile agent-based routing and traditional message passing. It concludes by detailing the performance benefits of the new method, emphasizing the increase in disjoint paths in larger networks with extended transmission ranges due to the mobile agents collecting detailed neighborhood information.

Finally, the paper suggests the use of a limited number of best disjoint paths to minimize overheads and concludes by summarizing the work and indicating directions for future research.
