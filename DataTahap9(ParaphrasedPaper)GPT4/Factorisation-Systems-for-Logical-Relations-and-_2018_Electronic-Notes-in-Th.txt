The core aspect of our factorization approach is its inherent modularity. Initially, the factorization is conducted at a purely structural level, without reliance on semantic qualities like monad laws. Additionally, the factorization is flexible, accommodating the incorporation of extra data that the relevant morphism may preserve. For clarity, we have defined the exact structures that are to be factorized.

Up to this point, we have engaged with a general factorization system denoted by (E, M). This system becomes an epi-mono factorization system when M comprises of monomorphisms. In such a context, Theorem 2.5 is applicable with the more lenient condition that T is a monad, and it suffices for S to merely possess a monad structure. To validate this theorem, we bypass the diagonal fill-in property and instead utilize the cancelation property associated with monomorphisms.
