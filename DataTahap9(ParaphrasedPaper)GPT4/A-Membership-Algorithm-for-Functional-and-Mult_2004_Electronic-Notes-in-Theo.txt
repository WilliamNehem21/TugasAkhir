The necessity for data storage solutions beyond traditional relational databases has become increasingly clear over time. As the demand for capturing the semantics of applications grew, new data models emerged, such as semantic data models, which initially served as design tools. Some of these models, including nested relational, object-oriented, and object-relational models, encapsulated by the higher-order entity-relationship model (HERM), evolved to be considered as valid data models in their own right.

This paper addresses two key challenges by proposing a unifying framework based on abstract concepts of types for nested attributes and subtyping. Analogous to the relational model (RDM), where the subsets of a relation schema form a Boolean algebra, the paper utilizes an algebraic approach to extend relational dependency theory to accommodate complex object types.

Using this algebraic methodology, the authors establish that it can be correctly applied in polynomial time and suggest its natural fit for complex object databases. This approach extends the nesting of attributes to encompass sets, multisets, unions, and references, possibly creating a unified basis for dependency theories in advanced data models.

The paper presents a data model predicated on the nesting of attributes and subtyping, mainly addressing complex object types like records and lists. The authors highlight the significance of derivations in the relational model that don't rely on the Brouwerian complement rule, believing that similar decision procedures could be adapted for various data types.

The paper also outlines potential future research directions, including the exploration of more comprehensive type systems incorporating sets, multisets, unions, and references, leading to what are known as rational trees. It examines functional dependencies (FDs) and multivalued dependencies (MVDs) within such systems, noting the altered behaviors of MVDs and the need for more advanced inference rules in the context of sets. The paper suggests the possibility of extending these findings to lists and multisets, exploring the implications for dependency rules in these situations.
