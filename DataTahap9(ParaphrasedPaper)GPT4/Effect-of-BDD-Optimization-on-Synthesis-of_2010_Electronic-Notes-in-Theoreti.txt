This paper discusses an enhanced binary decision diagram (BDD)-based methodology for synthesizing reversible and quantum circuits, focusing particularly on incorporating techniques like shared nodes, complement edges, and variable orderings to optimize the process. The paper delves into the necessary adjustments for these optimizations during synthesis and evaluates the trade-offs. A case study illustrates that these optimization strategies generally result in much smaller circuits in terms of both gate count and line requirements.

Reversible and quantum logic hold potential in various fields, including low-power, quantum, optical, DNA, and nanotechnology computing. Given the distinct nature of reversible and quantum circuit synthesis—where the traditional design constraints of no fan-out or feedback exist—this subject has drawn increasing attention in research.

The authors detail an advanced BDD-based synthesis approach that takes advantage of shared nodes, complement edges, and adaptive orderings for reversible and quantum logic, analyzing both potential enhancements and limitations. The paper provides empirical evidence of the benefits of these optimization methods on circuit sizes, showing substantial reductions in most instances.

The paper is organized into several sections. It begins by outlining the fundamentals of reversible and quantum logic and the principles of BDDs. Next, it reviews existing synthesis approaches and then introduces the new BDD-based technique incorporating shared nodes, complement edges, and reordering. The optimization effects on the resulting circuits are examined in an experimental evaluation, and the paper concludes with final remarks.

The paper explains how reversible functions uniquely map each input to an output and highlights that both feedback and fanouts are disallowed in this context. Current leading BDD packages, like CUDD, utilize various optimization methods to create smaller BDDs, and the paper describes how to adapt these techniques for reversible and quantum circuit synthesis. Complement edges offer further BDD size reductions by representing a function and its negation with a single node, and the authors explain the necessary modifications to support this in the synthesis process.

The variable ordering greatly influences BDD sizes. The paper references various strategies for achieving optimal orderings, including sifting, and mentions that these can be integrated into the synthesis method without additional alterations to previously introduced substitutions.

The paper concludes by addressing how decision diagram optimization techniques benefit the BDD-based synthesis of reversible and quantum logic. It also notes that future research will aim to refine these optimization techniques, focusing more on expected circuit size reduction rather than solely on BDD size, and to explore alternative decompositions.
