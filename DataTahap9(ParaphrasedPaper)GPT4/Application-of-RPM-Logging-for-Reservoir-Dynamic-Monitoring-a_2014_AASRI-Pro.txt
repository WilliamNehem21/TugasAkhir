The research indicates that the values for neutron capture cross-section (ncor) and the capture cross-section ratio of the formation to borehole (fcor) are influenced by the rock types and pore space within the geological formation. The study points out that by plotting fcor and ncor under conditions where the borehole and formation contain either entirely oil or completely water, it is possible to create a four-sided figure for each scenario. This shape's dimensions are linked to the formation's lithology and porosity. Typically, all data points from measurements tend to lie within the area of this four-sided figure.

The presence of water in the borehole and the proportion of oil within the formation both have an impact on ncor and fcor values, meaning this figure can serve as a tool for deducing water volume in the borehole and the amount of oil within the formation's pores.

For the special case of gravel-packed wells, such as those in the M oilfield offshore, it's noted that the presence of a gravel pack—mainly found around the screen and between the casing and perforation tunnel—can influence measurements. In the M oilfield, the gap between the production string and the borehole wall has inner and outer diameters of 15.24 cm and 21.1 cm respectively. Given that the instrument's detection depth is limited to 21 cm and that it logs at a speed of 0.6 meters per minute with a vertical resolution of 61 cm, the readings can be skewed by the gravel pack.

Therefore, the study suggests that a volumetric model must be applied to the neutron and capture cross-section readings to adjust for these influences and increase the accuracy of the formation parameter estimates.
