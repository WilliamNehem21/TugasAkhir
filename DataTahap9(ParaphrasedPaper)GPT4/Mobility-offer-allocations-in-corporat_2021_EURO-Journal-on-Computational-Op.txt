This paper presents the Mobility Offer Allocation Problem (MOAP), an optimization challenge aimed at efficiently fulfilling all employee mobility needs while considering fleet size, cost, and emissions. The study emerges from a research project in Austria, which explores corporate mobility to enhance cost-effectiveness and environmental impact by optimizing fleet utilization and including electric vehicles.

The paper introduces and applies an optimization model and solution techniques, considering:

1. Integration of various transportation modes, including public transit and car-sharing alongside traditional fleet vehicles.
2. Keyless vehicle access through digital devices, enhancing user convenience.
3. Scheduling, including vehicle charging considerations, to better align with demands and vehicle availability.

The problem is modeled as a generalized operational fixed interval scheduling problem, where vehicles represent machines, mobility demands are jobs, and mobility offers are the job-machine interval assignments. The objective is to efficiently assign these offers to fulfill the mobility demands with minimal costs.

This study also introduces conflict graphs as a method to identify possible vehicle assignments without overlapping and resolve scheduling issues. The conflict graph helps develop more efficient algorithms, which the paper compares against heuristics for similar problems.

A critical aspect of the model allows for multiple, non-overlapping time windows for mobility demands, as well as alternative scheduling for a single demand. An empirical study then evaluates the model, using benchmark instances to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in realistic scenarios.

The findings highlight significant fleet size reductions (between 50 to 85%) while increasing or maintaining average utilization rates. Thus, the paper asserts the importance of optimizing corporate mobility strategies, considering the costs and environmental impacts while satisfying the multiple mobility demands of employees.
