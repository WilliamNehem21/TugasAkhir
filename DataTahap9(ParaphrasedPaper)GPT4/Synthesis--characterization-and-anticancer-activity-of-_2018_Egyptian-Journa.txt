Vincristine is employed to combat various cancers, but its use is restricted due to adverse effects. To minimize these effects, we created vincristine-loaded folic acid-chitosan nanoparticles via ionic gelation. These nanoparticles were characterized through dynamic light scattering (DLS) for size, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for functional group identification, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology, and transmission electron microscopy to confirm vincristine encapsulation.

The DLS confirmed the creation of small nanoparticles (<200 nm), the FTIR analysis demonstrated the presence of characteristic functional groups, SEM showed smooth spherical particles, and TEM verified vincristine encapsulation within the folic acid-chitosan nanoparticles. The anticancer efficacy was evaluated using MTT assay on NCI-H460 lung cancer cells, in addition to assessing reactive oxygen species levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptotic changes, which together indicated the cytotoxic potency of our nanoparticles. Furthermore, an erythrocyte aggregation assay verified the nanoparticles' non-toxicity to red blood cells, suggesting their potential for treating NCI-H460 cells.
