This paper discusses the challenges of automated malware detection in mobile applications, which include (1) the prohibitive cost of analysis, (2) the limitation of automated systems to only detect known behaviors, and (3) the fact that the malicious nature of behaviors is context-dependent and requires human assessment. To address these challenges, the authors propose an alternative approach: semantics-based program analysis with human-in-the-loop.

The method uses human-crafted semantic predicates for searching and filtering during program analysis, enabling it to systematically and efficiently describe an application's behavior. The analysis is based on an abstract CESK* machine that adapts Abstracting Abstract Machines (AAM) principles for object-oriented bytecode, focusing on specific Android features like multiple entry points and reflection APIs.

The authors introduce a tool equipped with a semantic predicate library, which permits analysts to balance between speed and precision. This tool allows detailed inspection of each suspicious state during program execution, enabling analysts to determine the actual malicious intent of a behavior in the context of the application. The tool also generates permission and profiling reports to help in identifying common malicious patterns.

The paper is structured into several sections: Section 2 describes the syntax used for object-oriented bytecode analysis; Section 3 focuses on Android-specific issues like multiple entry points and reflection APIs; Section 4 outlines the tool implementation and customizable predicates for analysts; and Section 5 examines related work. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

The paper emphasizes the need for understanding how security-critical resources are used. The main contribution is a novel approach to malware detection that involves a combination of automated analysis and human judgment. The authors assert that this technique allows for systematic, rapid, and precise characterization of mobile application behaviors, with further details and case studies available in an extended report.
