The paper discusses the complexity inherent in floating-point arithmetic, which is often difficult for people to understandâ€”especially for those with a background only in conventional mathematics. These individuals may find it unintuitive that operations with floating-point numbers do not always follow the associative property (e.g., (x+y)+z might not be equal to x+(y+z)) and the existence of non-zero values that, when squared, yield zero. This lack of understanding leads to the direct implementation of mathematical formulas from textbooks into programs without considering the nuances of floating-point computation, which might not be advisable.

The paper highlights that a significant issue with floating-point numbers is their limited precision; exact results cannot always be faithfully represented and must be rounded. One critical detail explained is that the value 'u' is not a power of the base (radix), which implies that the number preceding 'u' shares the same exponent and unit of least precision (ulp). Proving this statement constitutes approximately half of the proof.

Regarding rounding to the nearest number with ties away from zero, the paper affirms that this mode of rounding maintains the property under discussion without any dependency on a "mid-point behavior." However, when trying to generalize this property across all rounding methods, one must consider five different rounding modes referenced in a previous theorem, making the analysis more complex. Furthermore, if directed roundings (rounding upwards or downwards) are used, the results discussed no longer apply.
