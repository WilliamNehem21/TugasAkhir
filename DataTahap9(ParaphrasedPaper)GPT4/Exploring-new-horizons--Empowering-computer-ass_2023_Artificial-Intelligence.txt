The field of Computer-Assisted Drug Design (CADD) is rapidly evolving, with advancements in techniques classified mainly as Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) and Ligand-Based Drug Design (LBDD), based on the structural information of targets and ligands respectively. Artificial Intelligence (AI), a term coined by John McCarthy in 1956, plays a critical role in this progress, enhancing the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks.

Few-shot learning (FSL) is emerging as a solution to tackle data scarcity in drug discovery. FSL can be utilized in tasks like classification (where 'n-way-k-shot' learning involves 'n' classes and 'k' examples, with variations called one-shot and zero-shot learning) and regression (estimating functions from few data points). It can also be applied in semi or unsupervised learning contexts, utilizing reinforcement learning to optimize the use of prior knowledge and predictions.

This review showcases the application of FSL in drug discovery, particularly in challenges like molecular property prediction. It highlights novel approaches like motif vocabulary in task augmentation, which has shown significant improvements in model performance and is robust across various tasks, indicating potential practical applications.

In representation learning, deep neural networks like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are trained on large-scale datasets to learn data patterns. These representations are then used for FSL tasks to make predictions based on similarities in the embedding space.

Researchers are introducing innovative techniques in the realm of drug synergy prediction, drug candidate identification (including against SARS-CoV-2), and enhancing querying of bioimaging databases using chemical structures, making strides by integrating FSL into these processes. Approaches including prior-guided hypernetworks, GCNs, contrastive learning, and meta-learning frameworks are being employed to improve predictions and efficiency in drug discovery.

Further, techniques like Property-Aware Relation Networks and Modern Hopfield Networks (MHopNets) have been developed, focusing on specific tasks like molecular property prediction and reaction template prediction, demonstrating high accuracy and fast performance.

The paper discusses the role of Meta-Learning and Graph Attention Networks in improving predictions with limited data, highlighting the success of these methods in various studies.

It acknowledges that the quality and diversity of data are critical for achieving generalization, and points out the ethical concerns and challenges related to regulatory acceptance of FSL models. The need for standardized approaches and datasets to compare model complexities is emphasized.

The review concludes by emphasizing the success stories in the field, the importance of representation learning approaches, and the potential of integrating computational science with medicinal chemistry to create predictive models that can address a wide array of challenges in drug discovery and development.
