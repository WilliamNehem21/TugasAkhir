To enhance the dependability of complex systems, utilizing formal methods is strongly advocated. These are defined by the use of mathematical languages, as well as techniques and tools designed for system specification and verification. Despite a few notable triumphs, such methods have not become standard in industry primarily due to the steep learning curve associated with mastering a complex technology and a general aversion to mathematical approaches. To counteract these barriers, the development of 'lightweight formal methods' and 'invisible formal methods' has been initiated. The former involves a less intensive application that provides cost-efficient, focused analysis to ascertain critical findings. The latter is oriented towards integrating user-friendly and potent tools into practice without resistance from users.

The subsequent sections of the paper outline various aspects as follows. Section 2 provides foundational details about KAOS and its formal semantics, while Section 3 elaborates on the features of a supportive toolbox. Sections 4 and 5 delve into two developed tools: the Early Analyzer, primarily concerned with verification, and the Animator, focused on validation.

The paper discusses goals as modular elements derived from specifications to form a system's structural model comparable to UML class diagrams. Objects can be passive (entities, associations, events) or active (agents), and they possess states influenced by attribute values and relationships to other objects. Agents interact through a shared interface that manages attributes and associations.

However, even if every goal in a model is refined correctly, there can still be internal inconsistencies, namely conflicts between goals or divergences under certain conditions. Unlike refining goals, detecting these inconsistencies is not confined to individual goals.

The Early Analyzer tool assesses goal-model correctness and presents counter-example traces for any errors detected, which can be further examined using the Animator tool. It also functions to validate by generating constrained animation traces.

Errors are common when formalizing informal stakeholder statements within four constructively aligned models. The primary aim of the analyzer is to verify formal consistency early on and to generate potential system behaviors for validation purposes.

It notes the importance of considering responsibility and emphasizes the benefit of enforcing postconditions over preconditions. The latter is a known operational pattern, and had it been consulted initially, some mistakes might have been avoided. The analyzer ceases to return counter-examples in certain scenarios.

Experimental tools include the BDD-based and SAT-based engines of NuSMV, the CLP engine of Oz, and plans to incorporate Alloy and theorem provers like STEP or PVS are underway. These tools employ strategies like mapping infinite domains to finite ones and using bounded time structures, requiring careful interpretation of the results by analysts.

The SceneBeans framework is mentioned for its abstraction level and ease of defining new views, which can be integrated with the simulation engine swiftly. A mapping tool aids in this process by linking views with the model.

Future improvements to the Early Analyzer will incorporate checks for obstacles and conflicts, and enhancements to the Animator mappings are in progress. Additionally, components for control panel design and other tools like the acceptance tests generator and obstacle generator are either in development or being planned.
