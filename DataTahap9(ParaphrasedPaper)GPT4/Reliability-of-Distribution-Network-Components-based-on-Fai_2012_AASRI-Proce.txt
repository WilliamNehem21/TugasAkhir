The paper focuses on evaluating the reliability metrics of components within electrical distribution networks, which is crucial for both assessing network reliability and implementing maintenance strategies based on reliability. The determination of these metrics depends on the availability of comprehensive outage and interruption data curated by distribution companies. Due to inconsistencies in the data, straightforward extraction of reliability parameters is challenging.

In this research, calculations based on databases are presented, and a methodology is proposed to extract reliability parameters using data from outages in the Czech and Slovak Republics. This approach includes discussing recent empirical findings.

An investigation into the duration of failures revealed that most of the significant failure rates are attributable to poorly managed service operations. The impact of these failures on the overall reliability of network components was then quantified. The methodology adopted here is largely akin to that discussed in a previous section, with the exception that the 'time to repair' considered in these computations is not confined to a single month.
