This paper investigates the connections between ordering structures on semirings and the semiring-based valuation algebras they induce. It establishes that a valuation algebra derived from a semiring forms a complete (or continuous) lattice if and only if its originating semiring is also a complete (or continuous) lattice, when considering the reverse order on the semiring. Additionally, semiring-induced information algebras are shown to be compact if the inverse of the semiring forms an algebraic lattice.

Valuation algebras serve as a generic tool to handle uncertainty and enable local computation, and they have been found to underpin a variety of systems in different domains, such as soft constraint systems, probability potentials, and propositional logic. This research focuses on semiring-induced valuation algebras and their characteristic ordering structures.

The order relation in these algebras is intimately tied to the multiplication and addition operations of the underlying semirings. However, semiring ordering emerges directly from addition. Given this, the paper studies the interplay between semiring order structures and the valuation algebras they motivate. It outlines the prerequisites for a semiring to induce an information algebra and uncovers the constructive links between the continuity of order relations in both semirings and their respective induced information algebras. Additionally, it discusses creating compact semiring-induced information algebras, a concept vital to the representation of information, specifying conditions for semirings to yield continuous or compact information algebras.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces fundamental concepts relevant to semiring-induced valuation algebras. Section 3 sets forth the necessary and sufficient conditions for these structures to exemplify complete information algebras. Section 4 illustrates the relationship between the continuity of the order structures in semiring-induced information algebras and their corresponding semirings. Lastly, Section 4 also articulates a condition under which semiring-induced information algebras can be considered compact.
