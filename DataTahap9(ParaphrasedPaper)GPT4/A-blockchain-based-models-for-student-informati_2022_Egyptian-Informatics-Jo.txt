Blockchain technology, often cited as a rapidly growing innovation in recent years, has gained a strong foothold in various applications, especially in safeguarding the integrity of student information systems (SIS). The inherent characteristics of blockchain—such as the ease of data sharing and transparency—are optimal for any SIS, giving stakeholders the ability to observe transactions analogous to those in fiscal systems. Once course enrollments and exam grades are recorded in the system, they are irreversible, unless a new counter-transaction is introduced to negate the previous one. Blockchain ensures this immutability by incorporating cryptographic hashes; any modification to a block's content destabilizes the integrity of the entire chain. Each block comprises several elements including a transaction list, its cryptographic hash, and specific blockchain components like the hash of the prior block, which maintains chain connectivity.

The suggested model amplifies security by utilizing hashing and decentralization for more accessible data storage. As universities disseminate blockchain information, all relevant parties can view it. This model effectively combines blockchain features like immutability, tamper-resistance, and secure record-keeping to successfully implement an SIS. Blockchain can also carry an array of records beyond transactions such as birth certifications and student loans.

The model discusses the coexistence of various SIS roles within the network's architecture, distinguishing between "full nodes," which store the entire blockchain, and "lightweight nodes," which contain only parts of it. The system's decentralization increases with the number of nodes.

In this framework, traditional mining is excluded, as the SIS blockchain allows only verified nodes to create blocks. This eliminates the need for miners, who typically receive cryptocurrency rewards for their efforts.

Though some data, deemed "stateless," may be considered critical, certain systems might prefer to handle them using a conventional setup with a super-administrator who ensures confidentiality. However, transactional data are always highly sensitive.

An updated block isn't validated until it achieves consensus. For instance, if node A initiates a transaction, a nearby full node authenticates it according to SIS rules, including checking for adherence to mark submission deadlines. Other nodes then confirm this verified block before it's appended to the blockchain.

Transactions themselves include identifying details of their origin node and timestamp. Each block is connected to its predecessor by a cryptographic hash, ensuring that once a consensus is reached, the data on the blockchain remain unalterable.

The paper outlines three distinct models suited to organizations of varying sizes, emphasizing that blockchain can work without miner incentives. Through consensus protocols, a single full node can validate and add a transaction, which is then disseminated across the network.

The simplest, first model is suitable for smaller entities, utilizing a permissioned network where all nodes are full, and only stateful data are accepted. This model keeps stateless information outside of blockchain, in a standard system.

The second model wasn't mentioned in the original text provided.

In the third model, both full nodes (with full blockchain copies and transactional powers) and guest nodes (with read-only access) coexist. Full nodes are initially located within the organization's physical premises.

Blockchain technology detailed in the paper demonstrates how universities can deploy a student information system that prioritizes security and facilitates data sharing and storage via a decentralized approach. This can redefine how SIS are maintained and accessed, promoting a trustworthy data management model.
