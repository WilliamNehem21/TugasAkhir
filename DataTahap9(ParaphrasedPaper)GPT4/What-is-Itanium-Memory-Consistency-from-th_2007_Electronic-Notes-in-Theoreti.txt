The paper acknowledges that there are multiple existing frameworks for understanding memory consistency but identifies only the framework by Adir, Attiya, and Shurek as being notably similar to their own. Arvind and Maessen's work on serializable memory models is mentioned but not explored due to a lack of integration with the author's approach.

The paper describes the Itanium processor's distributed-shared memory (DSM) architecture, in which each processor has a local copy of shared memory that consists of shared variables. These variables can be loaded without inter-processor communication, but a store operation updates both the local copy and is broadcasted to other processors. The order of visibility of store operations first to the local processor and then to others is highlighted, and the communication channels between processors are noted to be non-FIFO for different variables, leading to complex interactions.

The concept of an instruction invocation and its response is explained: a store or fence instruction results in an acknowledgment, whereas a load instruction's response provides the requested value.

The paper comments on the Itanium memory consistency model, which is presented at a low architectural level, rendering it less accessible for programmers and algorithm designers who work at higher conceptual levels. The authors admit their failure to create a programmer-centric description of Itanium memory consistency, but instead, they offer two definitions (one stronger and one weaker than the official Itanium model) to serve as bounds for these lower-level specifications.

These two definitions may not perfectly align with Itanium's model, yet they are helpful to programmers. For instance, to show an algorithm's unsolvability on Itanium, it suffices to demonstrate this with the stronger Itanium model. Conversely, proving an algorithm's correctness for Itanium requires showing it works under the weaker Itanium model. Despite their utility, these definitions do not provide a singular, precise description for programmers, highlighting the significant challenge of fully capturing the Itanium model's behavior. The paper concludes with a hope that the techniques presented will eventually help achieve this goal.
