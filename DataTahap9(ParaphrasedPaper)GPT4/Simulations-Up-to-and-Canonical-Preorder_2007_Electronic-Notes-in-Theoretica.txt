The paper indicates that the various preorders that define the semantics within the LTBT spectrum, which are less fine-grained than the ready simulation, fulfill the requirements of the stated lemma because they are all action factorized. The research also explored an alternative provision to obtain a more comprehensive finding. Moreover, it is important to point out that the opposite of this finding does not universally hold. To achieve the converse result, an extra condition must be imposed.

Additionally, the paper discusses the technique known as "up-to with mutual simulations up-to." This approach applies to a wide range of semantic frameworks, especially those within the LTBT spectrum that are less fine-grained than ready simulation. The findings for bisimulations up-to are derived as a direct consequence of the results obtained for simulations up-to, as illustrated by specific corollaries within the paper (corollaries 3.7 and 3.15).
