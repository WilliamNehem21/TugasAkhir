In this paper, we introduce two computational models of a Kai-protein-based circadian clock using process algebras: Bio-PEPA and Continuous Pi-Calculus. The circadian clock we model can function outside of a living cell and does not require gene transcription to maintain its rhythm. Our models replicate existing results from Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models and enable us to perform stochastic simulations to explore potential mechanisms responsible for the rhythmic signal.

Our work builds upon the ODE-based model by Van Zon et al., which aligns with experimental data. The Bio-PEPA model allows us to replicate these ODE results and also examine the impact of random fluctuations through stochastic simulations. Moreover, our process algebra model facilitates more straightforward computational experiments, as illustrated by our analysis of "shortcut reactions," detailed later in the paper.

We focus on the KaiC protein, which groups into six-part units called hexamers. Each KaiC monomer in a hexamer can be phosphorylated, resulting in seven possible phosphorylation states for a KaiC hexamer. Moreover, each KaiC hexamer can exist in either an active state, where it's more likely to be phosphorylated, or an inactive state, where it's more likely to be dephosphorylated, leading to a total of 14 distinct states for a single KaiC hexamer.

For a cell-wide circadian signal to emerge, individual KaiC hexamers must synchronize as they cycle through these 14 states. Two other proteins, KaiA and KaiB, regulate this synchronization. It's hypothesized that KaiA favors phosphorylating active KaiC hexamers, especially those with less phosphorylation.

Our modeling captures the 24-hour rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation, and we use logic to formalize the oscillation of average phosphorylation levels in the KaiC population, as well as its dependence on KaiA. Model-checking verifies our model exhibits these behaviors.

Within this framework, we use continuous-time linear temporal logic to describe behaviors over time. We also introduce a new operator that allows us to examine how processes behave in certain contexts.

In previous research, Kwiatkowski and Stark developed a Continuous Pi-Calculus (C-Pi) model for the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock, based on Van Zon's mechanism, confirming its periodic nature. In this study, we have adapted their model parameters and methodologies, but we've extended the work with new analysis tools and techniques.

We showcase the Continuous Pi-Calculus Workbench (CPIWB), a novel software for model analysis in Continuous Pi-Calculus, including ODE solvers and a model-checker. CPIWB is open-source and supports a temporal logic for scrutinizing time series data derived from models. This tool has capabilities for computational experimentation by allowing modifications to a model during evaluation. While the current implementation is specific to Continuous Pi-Calculus, the concept can theoretically apply to other models, including Bio-PEPA.

In conclusion, our models not only reaffirm the findings from previous ODE models but also offer a platform for future stochastic and in silico experimentation to further uncover the dynamics of the Kai-protein-based circadian clock.
