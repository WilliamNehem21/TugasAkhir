The paper describes a specialized type of Petri nets known as Petri nets with counters (PNZ). These are enhanced place/transition (P/T) Petri nets that incorporate a global vector of integer variables which can undergo linear transformations. PNZs maintain the traditional elements of P/T nets such as places, arcs, and tokens, but they also include annotations on transitions that dictate the linear transformations to apply when transitions fire. PNZs can be considered as encoding the control state within their places and the data state within their variables, and they relate to coloured Petri nets wherein integer variables correspond to places marked with integers.

An innovative approach introduced in the paper is the creation of a more condensed form of the state graph. This is achieved by identifying sequences of executions that impact only the data state and not the control state, and grouping them into what is referred to as a meta-transition. Consequently, the resulting graph is more compact but can still represent a wide range or even an infinite number of reachable markings.

This concept is illustrated through reachability graphs, which depict all the attainable markings as nodes, and the transitions that lead from one marking to another as arcs. Such reachability graphs serve as a succinct depiction of all possible execution traces from an initial marking, and they can remain finite despite potentially supporting infinite-length traces.

The researchers also discuss a prototype tool they've developed for calculating these compacted state graphs for PNZs, utilizing a data structure called NDD that is part of the LASH library. However, they encounter limitations because, in certain situations, LASH cannot iterate a transformation indefinitely, a problem that is inherent as the process is not always fully achievable. The researchers acknowledge that the tool may not always terminate since termination itself is an undecidable problem. Nevertheless, they reference existing conditions that can ensure termination and suggest the need for future studies to determine how to incorporate these conditions into their current framework.
