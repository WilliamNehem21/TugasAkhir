Optimization is a broad concept utilized across various disciplines, encompassing intelligent computation and diverse scientific fields, to achieve the most favorable outcomes which may include objectives like minimizing cost, maximizing performance, etc. The type of optimization applied depends on the nature of the problem and the goals set by researchers, which are determined by the problem's objective function(s). The specific interpretation of optimization often aligns with the context in which it is being used.

Optimization involves determining the best possible solution under a set of given conditions and can be categorized in multiple ways, such as whether it involves maximization or minimization, single or multiple variables, and whether constraints are present or not. Objectives for optimization can be singular or multiple, and the foundational elements of the process are the decision variables, objectives, and constraints involved. Optimization algorithms are procedures iteratively run to compare different solutions until an optimum or acceptable solution is reached. Various optimization methods include continuous, bound constrained, constrained without derivatives, discrete, global, linear programming, and nondifferentiable optimization, among others, with ongoing research work in these areas.

Al-Janabi and Alkaim introduced a novel approach called DRFLLS to optimize the imputation of missing values, building on the random forest algorithm and defining seven categories of similarity measures, including Pearson coefficient, simple, and fuzzy similarity (M1-M5). Another work by Al-Janabi and Madi involves using intelligent computation to conduct a deep analysis of five predictive data mining techniques to identify which provides optimal results in biomedical analysis. Their findings suggest that optimal solutions are not solely a result of mathematical computation; rather, the nature of the data plays a crucial role in determining the best approach.

Further development in the field includes the enhancement of the Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA), where the core search mechanism of LOA is augmented with intelligent features such as spiral searching and bubble net searching to improve accuracy and reduce execution time in achieving the intended goal.
