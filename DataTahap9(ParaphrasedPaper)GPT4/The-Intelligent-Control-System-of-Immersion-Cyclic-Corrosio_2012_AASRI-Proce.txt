To address the issue at hand, this paper proposes an intelligent control system tailor-made for evaluating the corrosion of weathering steel. The system is composed of a temperature control module based on expert knowledge and a humidity control module that utilizes fuzzy logic improved by a correction factor method. This innovative approach has been effectively applied to corrosion testing of weathering steel, yielding impressive results.

The system manages the humidity within the testing chamber using a pulse-type humidifier. This device operates by emitting pulses to generate steam, which humidifies the environment. However, the resulting humidity levels within the chamber can be irregular due to this pulse operation. Additionally, various external factors contribute to the unpredictability of humidity conditions. Owing to these complexities and uncertainties, it is infeasible to develop a precise mathematical model for humidity control.
