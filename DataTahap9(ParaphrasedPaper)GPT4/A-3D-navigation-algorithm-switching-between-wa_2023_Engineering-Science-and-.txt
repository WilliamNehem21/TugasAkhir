The project aims to create advanced 3D path planning, navigation, localization, and mapping algorithms for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), allowing for autonomous operation. New local planning methods utilizing waypoint and Bezier curves have been devised to aid in maneuvering MAVs across diverse settings. The approach proposed involves dynamically switching between local planners by evaluating environmental complexity.

A significant hurdle for MAVs is their limited computing and memory capabilities, thus necessitating low-complexity processing for their algorithms. Various path planning techniques have been explored, with emphasis on selecting effective waypoints and evaluating paths through a Bayesian framework. Numerous studies have also employed the A* algorithm to navigate while avoiding obstacles, often assuming pre-existing knowledge of the environment through different map representations.

Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which constructs environmental maps while navigating, is frequently combined with localization and mapping studies since MAVs require knowledge about the surroundings, their own position, and the destination.

The research includes various active SLAM methods catering to different robotic platforms. Three-dimensional mapping is vital for robot navigation, with the implementation of SLAM algorithms using singular cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs), including techniques like those discussed in the survey for mapping and feature extraction.

For path tracking in MAVs, the study applies Bezier curve-based planning to avoid increasing the search space, leading to faster route execution despite potential small delays in path calculation.

Octomap serves as the 3D mapping technique, supplemented by the development of costmap extraction and global and local route planning within the ROS/Gazebo framework. The navigation algorithm generates global costmaps from Octomap data and local costmaps using MAV depth sensors, with the A* algorithm creating a global path with multiple directional options in each 3D matrix cell.

Further research focuses on enhancing these methods, where low-level MAV controls are divided into waypoint-oriented and trajectory-oriented strategies. Bezier curves are not always suitable for planning a single continuous path, prompting investigations into multi-hop paths with predetermined intermediate waypoints.

Via the RViz visualization tool, users direct the MAV by picking navigation points onscreen. The path continually adapts to avoid obstacles and maintain a correct course, leveraging global and local costmaps for efficient routing.

Test scenarios demonstrate that multi-hop paths can outperform traditional methods like Dijkstra and A* in terms of time to reach a destination, with significant time savings noted when appropriate hop numbers are chosen.

Efficient battery usage is critical, and the proposed method's ability to select between local planners on the fly has shown to reduce the total route time by 16%.

Future research may include heuristic-based optimizations to streamline Bezier curve selection and reduce flight time, while improved techniques for calculating environmental complexity and intermediate hop positions would further advance the field.
