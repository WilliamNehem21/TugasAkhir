This paper has two primary goals. The first is to define and advocate for the use of Cost Recurrence Systems (CRSs) as a universal language for cost analysis. CRSs abstract from specific programming language features, creating an instrumented version of a program that allows for estimating its cost. The paper outlines what makes a CRS accurate and introduces an evaluation mechanism for CRSs. Crucially, CRSs can be defined without reference to the original programming language, thus serving as a general tool for cost analysis across different languages.

The second goal is to discuss the unique characteristics and challenges associated with CRSs. Although similar to Recurrence Relation Systems (RRSs), the paper distinguishes between the two and highlights the inadequacies of existing computer algebra systems in dealing with CRSs. Applications of CRSs in performance debugging and code certification showcase their practical value.

Key contributions of the research include the analysis of different kinds of resources, such as memory heap allocation and the number of execution steps in Java bytecode, without needing to execute the program. These estimations are useful for approximating the cost of a program based on input data.

The paper accommodates non-deterministic programming languages by recognizing that an initial state can lead to multiple possible program executions, each associated with its own cost.

Further, CRSs are versatile enough to capture various complexity classes and bound solutions using functions like max and min, offering a language-independent definition of CRSs.

Despite the potential of CRSs, obtaining practical solutions or bounds is challenging due to the impracticality of solving them when there are infinite possible evaluations or multiple relations.

Finally, the paper underscores that CRSs are valuable tools for deriving upper and lower bounds on execution costs and play a crucial role in performance debugging and validation through cost analysis. These analyses can either verify or contest assertions made by the programmer regarding the program's efficiency, emphasizing the critical nature of CRSs in performance inference.
