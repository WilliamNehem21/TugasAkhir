The paper discusses a crucial aspect of resource-constrained embedded systems: ensuring they provide strong guarantees about their runtime behavior to ensure reliability. One essential guarantee is establishing an upper bound on live memory usage during execution to prevent heap overflow errors.

The authors propose a semi-automatic method for inferring the space complexity of ML-like programming languages that incorporate explicit region management. This method combines elements from different formalisms to achieve a consistent framework for evaluating the space complexity of both imperative and purely functional programs.

Key to this work is a new programming language influenced by ML, which blends both functional and imperative features, coupled with a novel system of explicit memory region management. The language includes a static type and effect system that facilitates memory errors prevention at compile-time, and it also allows programmers to manually manage memory through primitives associated with memory regions.

The central goal of the paper is to outline a framework that unifies various analyses of memory consumption, tailored to the programming style used for individual functions. This approach aims to provide compile-time upper bounds on live memory, inclusive of reclaimed memory.

The authors begin by presenting related works (Section 2), detailing the language and its type and effect system (Section 3), and explaining how it handles functional and imperative features (Sections 4, 5, and 6). They provide an example in Section 7 and conclude with a discussion on the method's limitations and potential enhancements.

The historical context is provided, noting that resource consumption analysis began in the 1970s and has since evolved to account for memory reclamation. They reference RAML, a pure ML language, and RAJA, a subset of the Java language, as projects that aim to infer polynomial bounds on live memory, considering side effects without needing user annotations. Another approach is Jconsume, which targets Java language by using invariants over iteration spaces to derive space complexity.

In this language model, memory management is mainly a programmer's responsibility, where safety is ensured at compile time. Memory consumption in programs is analyzed differently depending on whether functions exhibit purely functional or imperative styles, as indicated by an effect system.

The paper contributes a comprehensive solution for memory management in hybrid functional/imperative programming, leveraging region mechanisms alongside static analysis to forecast memory requirements and ensure safe execution without the risks associated with dynamic memory management strategies such as garbage collection.
