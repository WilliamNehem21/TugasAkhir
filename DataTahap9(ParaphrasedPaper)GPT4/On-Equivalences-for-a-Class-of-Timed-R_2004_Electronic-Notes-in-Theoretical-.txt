The notation we have adopted offers the convenience of more naturally defining and concatenating words, which simplifies the development of theory in this study. While Asarin, Caspi, and Maler use a different notation system, the advantage of ours is highlighted in terms of ease and natural behavior, particularly with respect to theory development.

Remark 3.1 acknowledges that our approach deviates from typical literature by allowing interval bounds 'I' to take on real values instead of being strictly integers. Later in the section, this flexibility proves crucial in defining a concept of differentiation for timed regular expressions.

Unresolved questions linger, notably the extendability of Theorem 6.2. The first uncertainty concerns whether this theorem is applicable to intervals with real bounds. Although early examinations suggest the possibility, a comprehensive resolution is yet to be detailed. The second question examines whether Theorem 6.2 maintains validity when associated with timed regular expressions featuring various types of integer-bounded intervals. A modified version of the proof for Theorem 6.2 shows promise for interval-bounded, left-open and right-closed intervals, but the applicability to assorted interval combinations, such as those both left- and right-open, remains uncertain.

Furthermore, we have yet to determine if our approach can be generalized to encompass the extensive forms of timed regular expressions outlined in Section 3, which are capable of emulating the entire spectrum of languages recognized by Alur and Dill's timed automata. There is significant existing research on bisimulation in timed processes within the framework of timed process algebras. It would therefore be intriguing to examine how this body of work intersects with the findings presented in our paper, particularly given that timed processes do not usually adhere to distributivity.
