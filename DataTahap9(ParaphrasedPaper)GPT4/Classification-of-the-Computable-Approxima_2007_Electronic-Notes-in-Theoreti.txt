In this section, we present the detailed definitions for the key concepts explored in the paper. Initially, we define the broad concept of (f, e, d)-effective computability. We then describe how to simplify this concept to a more straightforward notion of f-effective computability through two stages. As a result, our further investigation will focus solely on f-effective computability.

We also impose a natural condition on the modulus and distance functions, requiring them to be nondecreasing. In our study, we only consider modulus functions e and distance functions d that are unbounded and nondecreasing. Even with this limitation, an (e, d)-divergence degree v may exhibit non-monotonic behavior. However, our primary interest lies in the bounding function f, which constrains the function v. Hence, when examining the (f, e, d)-effective computability of real numbers, we also assume the bounding function f to be nondecreasing.
