The Visitor design pattern is utilized in programming tasks that involve traversing abstract syntax trees (ASTs). It involves creating a Visitor object with a visit method that is called for each AST node. Programmers can control the traversal order, which is crucial for computations that create side effects. However, sharing results across different traversal passes is prone to mistakes.

Attribute Grammars (AGs) present an alternative for multi-traversal algorithms. An attribute evaluator annotates ASTs with attributes during one or more traversals, acting as a conduit for passing results between passes. AGs help ensure attributes are defined before use, though they discourage using side effects, limiting their applicability in certain scenarios such as web development.

In this paper, the authors introduce Ruler-Front, a language that blends the Visitor pattern and AGs. It can be converted to multiple programming languages, including JavaScript.

The authors underline the significance of tree traversal abstractions seen in compilers and other applications, with AGs prominently applied in educational projects and large-scale compilers. Despite their utility, AGs pose restrictions, including disallowing side effects and sometimes lacking support for various programming languages.

The paper addresses two main challenges. The first is related to implementing traversal algorithms in imperative languages like JavaScript, where the usual practice involves recursive functions or structured approaches like the Visitor pattern. The authors discuss how the lack of “define-before-use” guarantees makes the management of side effects and visit schedules error-prone when using visitors.

AGs inherently provide scheduling and ensure “define-before-use”, but they limit side effects which could be useful in dynamic applications like web content manipulation.

To solve these issues and make this approach more widely applicable, the authors propose Ruler-Front, a language devised for tree traversal that separates language-dependent components into a subset called Ruler-Core. This subset can be translated into JavaScript, covering a broad spectrum of programming languages.

The paper proceeds to examine these challenges and presents Ruler-Core, including a translation mechanism to JavaScript. The authors discuss tree traversal examples using Visitor patterns, attribute grammars, and Ruler-Front, highlighting their respective benefits and drawbacks.

In summary, the paper promotes Ruler-Front as a methodology that facilitates tree traversals in multiple programming languages, marrying the benefits of explicit control in the Visitor pattern with the automatic scheduling and “define-before-use” advantages of AGs while overcoming their respective limitations.
