An electric vehicle (EV) is becoming an increasingly attractive option for car buyers, mainly due to zero emissions and a smooth driving experience. Majumder notes that EVs are mechanically more efficient, between 60-70%, compared to the 18-22% efficiency of internal combustion engine vehicles. However, the limited range of EVs, approximately 110 miles, and charging infrastructure issues deter some individuals from making the switch, especially when gasoline vehicles average about 300 miles on a full tank.

A group of scholars points out that wealthier households typically show more interest in EVs, as they are more expensive than traditional vehicles. Those with annual incomes exceeding 90,000 euros prioritize features like fuel efficiency, technical reliability, and safety, while those with less than 10,000 euros focus on cost savings. Lower-income households also consider the availability and speed of public charging facilities when choosing an EV.

The paper outlines a study designed to predict electric vehicle ownership based on income levels in the United States using classification machine learning models such as SVM, logistic regression, decision trees, and naive Bayesian. The dataset, initially imbalanced with 93% BEV (battery electric vehicle) owners and 7% FCV (fuel cell vehicle) owners, was balanced through sampling.

The researchers delve into the relationship between age, household size, and EV ownership. According to Sovacool, Kester, Noel, and Rubens, the trend of EV ownership is growing among older age groups, such as government officials and retirees, across all income levels. Larger households tend to be more experienced with EVs but show less interest in owning them compared to smaller ones.

The study predominantly uses explainable machine learning methods, intentionally avoiding complex approaches like neural networks. Results indicate that commuting distance is the most critical factor in EV selection for various income levels. However, the study acknowledges certain limitations, such as local infrastructure, cultural norms, and climate conditions, and suggests future research with broader datasets.
