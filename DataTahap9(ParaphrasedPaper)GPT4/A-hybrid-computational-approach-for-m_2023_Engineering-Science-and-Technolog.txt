The academic paper discusses advanced computational techniques to model the deposition process in cold spray (CS) technology. Traditionally, substrate domains were described using normal and sliding contact methods, but recent advancements have shown traction separation laws to be more effective. Using a Lagrangian finite element (FE) method, the paper demonstrates that this computational approach can closely match experimental data, like rebound velocities and bond strength during the spraying of Cu onto Cu substrates. Nearly 99% of the particles' kinetic energy is converted into plastic deformation.

For adhering a Ti6Al-4 V Grade 23 coating to a Ti-6Al-4 V Grade 5 substrate, the paper outlines the FE technique with considerations for boundary effects on simulationsâ€”assumptions include an ambient temperature and a stationary substrate while particles have predefined initial velocities and varying temperatures. The contact behavior is controlled by a penalty formulation with a friction coefficient and a finite sliding scheme to accommodate contact surface motion. The study measures inelastic heat dissipation with an index of 0.9.

Innovatively, the study forges a hybrid computational method, combining smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and Lagrangian FE models, to simulate the thermo-mechanical deformation of cold sprayed Ni particles onto SS304 steel substrates across various conditions, verifying results against experiments and FE simulations.

The modeling outcomes indicate temperature limits when preheating Ni particles before impact, emphasizing that dynamic recrystallization, not included in current simulations, may affect bonding by changing grain size or phase.

Particle shape affects impact deformation: hollow spheres deform drastically, bulk spheres show substantial substrate deformation and potential for strong mechanical interlocking, while oblate particles have less penetration depth, and angular particles show uneven deformation and spreading challenges.

Despite the hybrid SPH-FE approach's benefits, such as reduced simulation times compared to conventional FE methods (for instance, ALE and CEL), and mitigation of common numerical challenges, it still faces issues like increased computing time for complex depositions, tensile instability at high velocities, and potential inaccuracies in capturing interfacial deformation.

The hybrid method shows promise in selecting CS parameters and modeling materials behavior, but future research could address the outlined limitations.

Finally, it is noted that spherical particles tend to flatten and adhere better to the substrate due to their deformation, while angular particles do not flatten as much, leading to a more complex deformation, and rod-like and flake-like particles are less likely to adhere since they undergo less plastic deformation.
