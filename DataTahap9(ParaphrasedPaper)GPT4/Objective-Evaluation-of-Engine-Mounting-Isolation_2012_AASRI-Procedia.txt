The paper examines vibration acceleration curves at the suspension points of a powertrain system during steady states of engine operation. It was observed that as the engine speed increased, the acceleration at each suspension point rose notably, with the trend becoming particularly pronounced at speeds around 2000 rpm. However, the increase in vibration acceleration as engine speed varied was generally mild and the root mean square (RMS) values of vibration remained stable and low, not showing significant fluctuations throughout the measurement range.

The study found that the left front hydraulic suspension had a stronger vibration response than the right front, likely due to the offset center of mass of the powertrain towards the left. Additionally, hydraulic mounts were found to have higher levels of vibration compared to rubber mounts, as hydraulic mounts supported about 80% of the powertrain's mass due to the offset in the system's center of mass.

The research compares the vibration response of hydraulic and rubber powertrain suspension systems under different conditions, including steady state and startup. By analyzing the vibration response spectrum, the study offers a detailed evaluation of the vibration isolation capabilities of the powertrain mounting system. The experiments demonstrated that hydraulic mount systems have a distinctly better isolation effect than rubber mounting systems, suggesting they are more suitable for improving vehicle comfort in terms of vibration isolation.
