When an RFID tag enters the reading range of a reader device, the reader prompts the tag to transmit its stored information. Once the reader has received this information, it conveys the data over a network link such as Ethernet or mobile IP to the RFID system's controller. The controller then processes this incoming data based on its content, which may involve recording it in a database or updating the status of an item within an inventory system.
