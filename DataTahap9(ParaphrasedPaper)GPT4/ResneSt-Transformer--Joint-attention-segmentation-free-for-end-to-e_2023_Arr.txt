The paper discusses the limitations of traditional two-stage handwriting recognition methods, which involve text segmentation followed by text recognition. These stages often depend on costly manual annotations and are prone to segmentation errors that affect recognition accuracy.

The authors conducted experiments on public datasets, including RIMES, READ 2016, and IAM, and achieved competitive results with models using annotated paragraph segmentation. The paper's structure covers related work, the proposed model, experiment results, and comparisons with other methods.

The proposed approach draws from modular techniques that recognize handwritten text without line-level segmentation, inspired by object recognition methods. It processes paragraph images end-to-end, bypassing the typical image-text segmentation issues by not relying on heuristics. This allows for training directly on unsegmented paragraph images, confronting challenges like slanted or merged lines and interspersed text.

The neural network employs an encoder and decoder with multi-head self-attention and positional encoding, allowing it to implicitly perform line segmentation while focusing on relevant features at each time step. It uses CNNs for feature extraction and a transformer for encoding and decoding, supplemented with ResNeSt50 for extracting 2D feature representations. The 2D positional encodings are added before the transformer encoder, containing four encoder layers and six decoder layers with self-attention and feedforward networks.

ResNeSt50 is used for feature extraction with a divided attention mechanism, and the transformer architecture captures dependencies within the input data. The model is trained end-to-end, using paragraph images as input, and learns the textual structure via supervised learning.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end model that tackles handwriting recognition by combining a CNN for feature extraction with a transformer network for translating visual features into text, avoiding issues related to segmentation and manual annotation inherent in traditional methods.
