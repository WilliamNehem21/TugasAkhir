This paper presents a formal policy-based approach to model and verify self-adaptive systems. By separating policies - the rules guiding behavioral choices - from the system's functionality, the authors aim to change system behavior without altering the actual code. They particularly focus on behavioral adaptation, using an approach that supports both behavioral and structural changes, although structural adaptation is not the main subject of this paper.

The paper introduces the POBSAM model, a modular system that employs policy-based self-managed modules (SMMs) that operate autonomously in line with predefined policies. Three example SMMs - light control, temperature control, and door/window control - illustrate the application in a smart home environment. The authors define the syntax and semantics of POBSAM and compare it to existing approaches, arguing that their model supports independent verification of the adaptation layer by decoupling it from the functional layer.

Despite the promising methodology, the authors acknowledge the vast field of dynamic adaptation and note that their paper limits itself to formal modeling rather than verification due to space constraints. Further research is suggested in the areas of tool implementation, verification of various properties of adaptation and functional layers, specificity of structural adaptations, and extending the model to self-organizing systems.
