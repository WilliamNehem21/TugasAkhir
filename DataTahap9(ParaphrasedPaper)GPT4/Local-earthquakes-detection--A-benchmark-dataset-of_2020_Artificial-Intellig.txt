Our study offers a valuable collection of time-series data aimed at benefiting a wide range of experts, including data scientists and seismologists, by providing informative seismic recordings. Following a description of the automated waveform labeling process (Section 2), we detail the properties of the assembled dataset (Section 3). Section 4 demonstrates an application of supervised machine learning to differentiate earthquake signals from noise using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on our single-station recording dataset.

We describe a simple signal classification task capitalizing on our dataset, where a CNN is designed to distinguish earthquake recordings from non-earthquake noise, effectively operating as a local earthquake detection tool for individual seismic stations.

The architecture of the CNN employs a ReLU activation function across all layers with the exception of the final layer, which uses a fully-connected neuron and a sigmoid activation to classify waveforms. Cross-entropy and the Adam optimizer have been utilized as the loss function and optimization algorithm, respectively.

Our analysis demonstrates the model's capability to detect minor earthquakes in areas not represented in the training set, achieving high accuracy rates (96.7% on the training set, 95.3% on the validation set, and 93.2% on the test set). This supports the potential for applying the model to real-time earthquake detection at individual stations via continuous data streams. To further enhance the algorithm, we suggest exploring the inclusion of recurrent layers to capture temporal relationships in seismic data.

This technology is particularly valuable in enriching current earthquake catalogues by identifying smaller, localized quakes that conventional methods may miss, and is especially beneficial in regions with sparse seismic networks. The geographic and tectonic diversity of our dataset underscores the generalization potential of our detection algorithm. Focusing on a dataset subset may improve catalogue completeness in specific locations by adapting the machine learning model to local geographical characteristics, thus potentially increasing detection accuracy. Moreover, the data collection might enable effective simulation of seismic ambient noise and facilitate analysis of noise distribution.
