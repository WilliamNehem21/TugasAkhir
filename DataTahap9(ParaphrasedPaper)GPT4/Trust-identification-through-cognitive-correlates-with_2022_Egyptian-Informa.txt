Utilizing cloud infrastructure and its associated IoT protocols, resources can support the operation of robots and automation systems, which rely on consistent data transfer. Enhancing robotic and automation systems with cloud technologies can involve providing access to data resources like datasheets, manufacturing protocols, benchmarks, simulation tools, and encouraging open-source contributions through competitions and collaborative projects.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature, Section 3 describes the methodology of the research, Section 4 presents and discusses the results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

When it comes to robotic applications in medicine and healthcare, such as surgery, rehabilitation, telepresence, and sanitation, safety is of paramount importance. The paper discusses the safe use of robots, especially in wrist and elbow rehabilitation, and introduces an innovative fuzzy logic-based risk assessment method. This method was successfully tested for safety on 18 patients.

The authors developed a robust motion detection algorithm for robots that utilizes background subtraction. A static image serves as the reference, and any changes in the scene trigger a comparison between the current and previous images to detect movement.

The use of fuzzy logic in achieving robotic autonomy has become widespread in recent decades across many aspects of robotics, such as behavioral design and coordination. While fuzzy logic's influence peaked in the late 1990s with the focus on basic robot behaviors, the trend has shifted towards building robots capable of operating independently in natural environments. Although fuzzy methods are not as prominent now in the robotics community as they once were, they remain relevant, particularly in emerging areas of complex interactions like human-humanoid communication and established areas such as perception, hinting at potential future applications.
