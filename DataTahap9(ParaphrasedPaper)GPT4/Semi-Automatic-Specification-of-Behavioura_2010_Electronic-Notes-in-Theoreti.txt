This academic paper discusses the challenge of achieving interoperability among web services, especially when it comes to service composition. Several levels of interoperability are identified, such as signature, behavioral, quality of service, and semantic levels. The paper highlights the significance of the behavioral level, noting that even when services have compatible signatures, the way they interact (their execution flows) can cause issues like erroneous behaviors or deadlocks if not properly considered during system design. This need has led to the incorporation of behavioral descriptions into interface models and programming environments such as BPEL and Windows Workflow Foundation.

The paper is structured to present a service model, a contract specification language, and a case study. The main focus is on the automatic generation of contracts that ensure proper behavioral interaction between services, acknowledging that while this is effective for behavioral compatibility, it doesn't address semantic constraints. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a semi-automatic approach that combines automated generation with an interactive environment for more nuanced contract specification.

The proposed solution includes a heuristic function that assesses the compatibility of operations and arguments to guide contract suitability for service adaptation. Additionally, the authors present automated techniques such as simulation and trace-checking to evaluate system execution and detect potential deadlocks or infinite loops.

The paper also reports on an experimental study that involved volunteers with varying expertise, comparing three methods for contract specification: manual, interactive, and semi-automatic. The findings indicate that the semi-automatic approach presented in the paper can improve development effort and contract accuracy.

Finally, the paper reviews related work, acknowledging other methodologies for automatic adaptor generation and for guaranteeing system behaviors such as liveness and safety. The paper contrasts these approaches with its own, emphasizing the greater versatility in reconciling mismatches provided by the semi-automatic approach advocated by the authors.

Overall, the paper addresses a crucial aspect of web services interoperability by proposing a novel semi-automatic approach to adapt contracts, improving upon previous methods and providing a more flexible and user-friendly solution for service composition.
