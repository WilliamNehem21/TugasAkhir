This case-control study examined the expression of the apoptosis-associated proteins Fas (CD95) and Bcl-2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and schistosomiasis to understand their roles in disease progression. Using flow cytometry, the researchers measured Fas and Bcl-2 expression in 85 subjects, including 40 with chronic HCV, 25 with schistosomiasis, and 20 healthy controls. The study found a higher expression of Fas leading to increased apoptotic levels in PBMCs of patients with HCV compared to schistosomiasis and control groups. However, there was no significant difference in Bcl-2 expression among the groups. Fas expression was strongly correlated with the severity of the disease in HCV patients, indicating a potential mechanism for the virus to evade the host's immune response. Persistent HCV infection may upregulate Fas expression in PBMCs, enhancing cell apoptosis and contributing to the decline in PBMC numbers seen in chronic HCV patients. On the contrary, the absence of Bcl-2 expression suggests it doesn't protect against apoptosis in these patients. These findings suggest that targeting Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways might present therapeutic opportunities for managing chronic HCV.

Please note that this paraphrasing maintains the main findings and conclusions of the study but does not include the detailed methodology or statistical analysis procedures. It also omits the background information on apoptosis pathways and the specific role of HCV in immune modulation present in the original paper. The summary aims to capture the essence of the study's results and their implications for HCV and schistosomiasis infections.
