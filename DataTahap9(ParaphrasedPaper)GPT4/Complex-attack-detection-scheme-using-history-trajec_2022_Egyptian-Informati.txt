The academic paper discusses advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly focusing on how the development of internet and computer technologies allows various modern services, making life easier for people. One such application of IoT includes the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which provides conveniences to drivers through connectivity and communication between vehicles and road infrastructure.

However, the paper notes that IoV faces security challenges due to its reliance on wireless communication, which can be targeted by malicious attackers to disrupt traffic and potentially cause accidents. The attackers use various means to exploit vulnerabilities in vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs), such as Sybil attacks or manipulating traffic information. While security schemes like VECURE, CUSUM, and SEAD exist to detect single types of attacks, they fall short when dealing with complex, simultaneous attacks.

To address these shortcomings, the paper introduces a new proposed scheme that combines a road model and a cloud computing model to enhance security in the IoV. The scheme collects and analyzes road situation information, leveraging a history trajectory as a key component for detecting complex attacks. The information collected is classified, stored, and analyzed for abnormalities to identify an attack.

The proposed scheme is tested using the DEVS-ObjC programming tool, based on DEVS formalism, which simulates a real-world scenario. The experimental setup includes a road with RSUs placed every 2 km and four autonomous vehicles that communicate with these RSUs to detect various types of attacks, including complex ones like simultaneous Sybil and False Data Injection (FDI) or Replay and Blackhole attacks.

Results of the experiment demonstrate that by using history trajectories in detection, the scheme can not only detect complex attacks that are missed by existing schemes but also reduce network overhead, which helps in minimizing packet loss and improves the overall reliability of real-time traffic information collection.

While promising, the paper acknowledges that the management of a large amount of security knowledge and the increasing detection times as more scenarios are identified remain challenges. Future research aims to address these issues by developing a rule-based security system using temporal logic rules to enable a more adaptable and effective response to the ever-increasing complexity of attacks in the IoV. This system would be designed to not only detect but also respond appropriately to security threats.
