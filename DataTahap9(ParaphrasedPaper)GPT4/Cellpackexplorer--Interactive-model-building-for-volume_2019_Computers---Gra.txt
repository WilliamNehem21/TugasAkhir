In the paper, the authors introduce CellPACKExplorer, a tool created to assist CellPACK developers in identifying and rectifying errors in their algorithms and enhancing their models. CellPACKExplorer enables users to visualize how the parameters of the CellPACK recipe impact the packing results. Notably, the tool caters to different types of users—those with a numerical background and those with a visual inclination—by offering a flexible and adaptable interface.

The authors conducted a study in which they provided CellPACKExplorer to both novice and expert users. Novice users successfully generated cell models using CellPACK and experimented with various parameters, while expert users were able to quickly locate a bug in the code with the assistance of the tool. The study indicated that CellPACKExplorer not only streamlines the setup and analysis of large-scale experiments, significantly reducing the time required, but also facilitates better collaboration and sharing among researchers. 

An important aspect of the tool is its ability to visually present the influence of parameters, which is beneficial when the parameter space is extensive or the optimization is more qualitative in nature. This approach combines debugging and model building, aiding developers in understanding the impact of new or existing parameters on generating realistic output.

The researchers also addressed the issue of how to effectively present the variety of model outputs. While clustering and manual adjustment methods are commonly used, CellPACKExplorer took a different approach that allows for a more tailored examination without predefined clustering.

CellPACKExplorer was developed over ten months using design study methodology, starting with an initial characterization of users, tasks, and data, and ending with a prototype evaluation. The developers continually improved the algorithm over time, and the flexibility offered by CellPACKExplorer played a crucial role in adapting to these iterative changes.

The results of the study demonstrated that CellPACKExplorer improved the efficiency of the CellPACK developers' workflow, and the tool's web-based design made it easily accessible. Lastly, the paper suggests that the potential uses for CellPACKExplorer might extend to other domains, such as meteorology or bioengineering, where it can help in the analysis of simulation results, regardless of whether they have a visual component or not. The successful application of CellPACKExplorer also points to the broader implications for the field of visualization in supporting complex model development and analysis.
