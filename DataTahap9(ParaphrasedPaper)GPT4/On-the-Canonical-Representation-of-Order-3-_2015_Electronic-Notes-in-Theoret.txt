In an earlier paper, canonical forms for discrete phase-type (DPH) distributions of order 3 were established for all eigenvalue structures except one, known as the PNP case, for which a conjecture was proposed. However, it was discovered that the proposed conjecture was incorrect. This current document reiterates the previously confirmed results for third-order DPH distributions and focuses on the PNP case.

The paper is structured as follows: The initial section offers a brief overview of DPH distributions. The subsequent section recaps the earlier work on canonical representations for third-order DPH distributions excluding the PNP case. The main contributions of this study are in the fourth section, detailing the canonical representation for third-order DPH distributions with the PNP eigenvalue structure. This case presents challenges because the methods used to establish canonical forms for other third-order DPH distributions are ineffective for the PNP scenario.

The authors attempted to validate their findings for different arrangements of six zero elements within the matrix representation but faced difficulties due to the vast number of such distributions (over 300 plausible structures after discarding meaningless ones such as lower rank matrices). This abundance of zero element distributions prevented them from conclusively proving one of their observations through this approach.

Instead, they employed a general transformation method applied to these 300+ structures, conducting numerical calculations to determine which combinations yield Markovian properties given certain parameters. Through numerical analysis, the researchers confirmed their observation along with several theorems. They found that outside of specific Markovian zones for PNP representations, none of the alternative structures exhibited Markov behavior. Conversely, within these zones, multiple structures were often Markovian, with at least one of the PNP representations always being among them.
