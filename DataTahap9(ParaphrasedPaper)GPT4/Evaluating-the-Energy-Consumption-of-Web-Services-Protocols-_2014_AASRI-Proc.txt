The paper discusses the complex challenge of locating web services in ad hoc networks, which is exacerbated by dynamic topologies and the absence of a centralized service directory. Although various strategies have been suggested to address this issue, they typically depend on keywords or identifiers for the desired services or on a predefined discovery scenario, with the aim of accommodating ad hoc network constraints such as limited energy and bandwidth.

The authors observe that existing methods for discovery generally do not fully adhere to these constraints, leading to considerable energy usage. They noticed that most approaches depend on identifiers, names, and types of services, requiring the user to choose a service that meets their needs.

To address this problem, the paper proposes a new model to quantify the overall energy cost in ad hoc networks based on the mechanisms and protocols used for service discovery. The authors introduce a formula that incorporates various parameters (denoted as "ci") derived from their comparative analysis of different service discovery methods. This formula is intended to evaluate the energy efficiency of various web service discovery protocols in the ad hoc network context.
