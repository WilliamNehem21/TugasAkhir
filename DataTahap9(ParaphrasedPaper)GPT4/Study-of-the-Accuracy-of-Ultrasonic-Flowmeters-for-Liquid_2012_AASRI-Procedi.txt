Accurately estimating the differential time of flight presents a significant challenge in ultrasonic flow measurement, especially when dealing with environments where the tube diameter is small and the path for sound travel is short, requiring high time resolution due to the rapid speed of sound in liquid, measured in nanoseconds. A new technique leveraging a spline-based algorithm has been developed to determine this time more precisely. While the spline-based algorithm has shown to be more accurate than the more traditional cross-correlation method, it entails a greater computational load.

To address the computational intensity of the spline algorithm, an enhancement is suggested that combines the spline approach with elements of the cross-correlation algorithm, allowing for a reduction in calculation requirements without compromising accuracy. This paper details the effectiveness of this hybrid algorithm through testing and also considers the vital role that the separation distance between transducers plays in the accuracy of ultrasonic flow measurements. Experiments confirm that improper transducer spacing can significantly impact measurement outcomes.

The transducers' installation must ensure a specific separation distance, where the transducer's material (assumed as organic glass), the wall material (steel), and the fluid (water) are known variables. Given these materials, the acoustic path is arranged in a V-shape, dependent on specific angles of incidence and refraction at both the organic glass-steel and steel-water interfaces, with corresponding sound speeds indicated for each material.

By assuming an angle of 37 degrees for ultrasonic waves entering through the organic glass and onto the steel, and given the respective sound velocities, the angles of refraction are calculable, finally determining the differential distance between two transducers, designated X and Y.

For signal analysis, a scenario is given where each signal comprises 2048 data points, with defined sections of these points representing kernel signals for comparison. The improved algorithm is noted to perform the same calculations with significantly fewer computations (300 less), suggesting a marked improvement in efficiency over the pure spline-based algorithm.

In summary, this paper showcases an algorithmic advancement for determining the differential time of flight in ultrasonic flow measurement that promises to maintain high precision while easing computational demands, and it emphasizes the critical nature of transducer placement in achieving accurate measurements.
