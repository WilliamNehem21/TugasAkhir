Section 3 of the academic paper surveys current methodologies while Section 4 introduces an innovative algorithm called the Least and Most Significant Bit Arbitration Algorithm. The simulation setup is elaborated on in Section 5, and Section 6 discusses the use of the M/G/1 queueing model to verify the simulation results. Section 7 compares the outcomes from simulations of both existing and new algorithms, and the study concludes in Section 8.

Ryu et al. integrated the QT algorithm with a slotted random back-off mechanism and also introduced an improved HQT algorithm, merging the slotted back-off with the AQS algorithm. Shin et al. suggested a combination of the QT and Framed Aloha protocols to form two distinct algorithms.

The proposed algorithm combines a slotted Aloha CDMA approach with tag set partitioning, leveraging different power levels emitted by an RFID reader to power-up and differentiate passive tags. Implementing SPSC increases both system bandwidth and complexity.

When an RFID reader starts a cycle, it prompts tags in the proximity to backscatter their IDs sequentially. Based on this, the reader generates a tag response query. The Least and Most Significant Bit Arbitration Algorithm identifies common prefix patterns, thus optimizing energy consumption and identification times.

Assuming the reader functions continuously until all tags are detected, with no breakdowns, and considering retrial rates from inactive states, the new algorithm shows a significant reduction in energy usage. Compared to the AQS, LAMSBA reduced the energy required for scanning by 58.68%, with the reader consuming 556.01 millijoules.

The introduction of LAMSBA marks an improvement over traditional query tree algorithms. By instructing tags to respond simultaneously from both ends of a collided bit, this new method has effectively enhanced the efficiency of tag identification, as validated by extensive simulations. These simulations also demonstrate that LAMSBA reduces idle responses, thereby decreasing both identification delays and energy usage. For a scenario with 1000 tags, LAMSBA experienced 945 collisions, transmitted 3,073,812 bits, and used 2612.26 millijoules of energy, achieving an identification process 74.20% more efficient compared to AQS.
