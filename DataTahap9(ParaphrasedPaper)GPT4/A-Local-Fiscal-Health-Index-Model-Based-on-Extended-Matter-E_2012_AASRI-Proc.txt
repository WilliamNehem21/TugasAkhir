This paper discusses the increasing focus on the financial health of local governments due to fiscal crises. It introduces a new method for assessing local fiscal health by creating an index model that employs the concepts and mechanism of extenics and matter-element models. The extended matter-element evaluation model is the centerpiece for assessing this fiscal health index. Through expert surveys and the entropy weight method, the authors select and weigh various indicators that impact the health of regional finances. The model and chosen indicators are then applied using the extended matter-element approach to evaluate the local fiscal health, which the authors claim to be effective.

The paper references existing methods of assessing local fiscal health, such as expert research and data mining, and acknowledges prior works like the Polackova matrix and indicators developed by Lifeng Liu. However, it critiques these methods as being somewhat arbitrary and fragmented. Instead, the paper introduces a range of fiscal health indicators, including tax elasticity, budgetary ratios, deficit metrics, and debt indicators, to provide a more comprehensive fiscal risk assessment framework.

The authors elaborate on their methodology, detailing how different indicators (labeled as C1 to C14) correspond to various financial health aspects like elasticity, budgetary proportions, and debt ratios. They categorize the fiscal health into levels, such as warning, conservative, and safety, and use classical and segment domains to assess indicator values.

An example evaluation using their method shows a result classified as a "conservative level," which, despite not being risky, still demands attention for improved fiscal safety. The paper concludes that the local fiscal health index model based on extenics theory offers a formalized approach to resolving complex, uncertain fiscal issues, noting its clarity, simplicity, and high-resolution results.
