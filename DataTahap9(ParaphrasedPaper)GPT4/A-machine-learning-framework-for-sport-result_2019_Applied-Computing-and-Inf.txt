The paper discusses the role of machine learning (ML), specifically artificial neural networks (ANNs), in sports result prediction, an area of growing interest due to its implications for betting, club management, and strategy formulation. The authors review literature on ANN applications for predicting sports outcomes, addressing the methodologies used, data sources, model evaluation techniques, and the unique challenges faced in this field. They propose a new framework for sport prediction akin to CRISP-DM, aimed at guiding future research efforts in this domain.

The study provides a synthesis of prior work, which predominantly applied ANN for predictions in sports, and highlights a need for critical discussion and adjustments in evaluating model performance. An example from the literature includes Purucker's study, which used ANN to predict NFL game outcomes with features like yards gained and turnover margin, achieving a 61% accuracy rate. The paper also mentions research on javelin throw predictions and PGA golf score predictions, using various machine learning techniques and statistical measurements for model evaluation.

Data collection for sports prediction often comes from publicly accessible online sources and might involve automated scripting for extraction. Expert opinion also plays a role, either as part of feature selection or for comparative analysis with model predictions.

The paper suggests that performance evaluation should account for common phenomena such as home advantage, recommending accuracy measures or ROC curves depending on the balance of the data set. They emphasize the significance of updating training data match-by-match rather than round-by-round to maintain relevance, which is crucial in sports where team compositions and strengths fluctuate yearly.

Finally, the authors advocate for a specific round-by-round approach within each season to assess model performance, even though it may be more resource-intensive, to ensure the reliability and applicability of ANNs in sports predictions. This framework serves as a guide for sports enthusiasts, managers, bookmakers, and researchers interested in applying ML for predicting sports results.
