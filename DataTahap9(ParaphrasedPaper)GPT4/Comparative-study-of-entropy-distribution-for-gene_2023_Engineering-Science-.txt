The paper discusses thermal analysis in the context of fluid dynamics for porous surfaces, emphasizing the Brinkman fluid model. Researchers Hayat et al. focused on the Cattaneo-Christov (C-C) thermal and mass relaxation in magnetized flow involving nanomaterials, investigating the effects of both thermal variance and magnetism. Meanwhile, the studies conducted by Ali and Sandeep centered on the non-linear radiation effects in Casson nanoliquid over a heated surface and implemented the C-C heat law for their analysis.

Entropy production is highlighted as an essential measure of system disorder, particularly in the conversion of thermal energy to mechanical work. The concept of entropy, as first pondered by Rudolf Clausius in the mid-19th century, quantifies the unpredictability at a molecular level for closed systems, deeply intertwined with the second law of thermodynamics. Bejan provided insights into minimizing irreversibility in convective thermal flow, while Mahesh et al. investigated entropy optimization in a rotating disc model involving both non-Fourier heat flux and nanomaterial flow with radiation impact. Work by Reddy et al. further explored these themes.

One key characteristic of nanofluids is their enhanced thermal conductivity, mainly attributed to the presence of nanoparticles that have a high surface area and can therefore carry heat more effectively than bulk fluids. This increase in thermal conductivity is facilitated by various factors such as the shape, size, and distribution of the nanoparticles. Studies by Naseem et al. and Tarakanmu et al. addressed heat and mass transport phenomena involving variable thermal conductivity, while Ajibade and Umar examined the effects of thermal conductivity and viscosity on mixed convection flow and heat transmission in vertical channels. Other researchers have also looked into fluid flow and heat transfer considering the variability of thermal conductivity.

The paper touches upon several applications of fluid dynamics, including manufacturing operations related to polymers, medical equipment preparation, and transport phenomena in physiological systems such as blood flow through arteries and capillaries. It references the Jeffery-Hamel flow to describe viscous, incompressible flows.

Additionally, the document discusses the Carreau model for characterizing both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, with studies by Khan et al. focusing on the effects of velocity slip and thermal radiation for Carreau nanofluids flowing over a wedge. Hayat et al. researched the flow of Carreau nanofluids past a heated surface, and Khan et al. used the shooting method to investigate the impact of C-C heat flow in a magnetic hydrodynamic stagnation point stream.

Furthermore, the Bejan number is used to determine the balance between conductive and convective heat transfer modes in a system, which varies with the system's parameters such as permeability (k1) and Darcy parameter (k2). The document concludes with a discussion on how changes in k1 and k2 affect frictional resistance, fluid flow strength, kinetic energy, and, consequently, entropy generation (eg) and the Bejan number (be) in both convergent and divergent channels.
