The original study explores the concept of graph construction and properties, specifically focusing on clique-width. In graph theory, the clique-width of a graph is defined by how it can be constructed using four operations: creating vertices with labels, creating edges between vertices with the same label, creating edges between vertices with distinct labels, and relabelling of vertices. The 'k' in k-expression refers to the number of distinct labels used during this construction process. This builds graphs that possess a definitive structureâ€”clique-width. Clique-width, like tree-width, is a parameter for measuring the complexity of a graph, but it's broader, as it applies to a wider range of graph classes.

The original paper discusses how Courcelle and Olariu established clique-width as an extension of the tree-width concept, showing that graphs with bounded tree-width also possess bounded clique-width. This extends the applicability of decomposition techniques to a wider variety of graphs, while still retaining useful algorithmic properties for tackling computational problems.

The paper also outlines a method for calculating the clique-width of a graph 'G' using labeling. Assume labels 'a' and 'b' denote labels of the root and other vertices in a tree. Labels 'c' and 'd' are additional labels available for use. Starting with a vertex 'v' as the root and assigning it label 'c', the authors detail how to construct the k-expression for a clique 'cn'.

Regarding time complexity, the main contribution of the academic paper is algorithm 2. Its efficiency is determined by analyzing two internal loops, referred to in lines 5 and 6 of the pseudocode, as well as its interactions with another algorithm, algorithm 1, called within lines 7 and 11. The paper specifically examines the time complexity of algorithm 2 and determines that the first loop outside these internal loops, indicated in line 2, has separate complexity considerations.
