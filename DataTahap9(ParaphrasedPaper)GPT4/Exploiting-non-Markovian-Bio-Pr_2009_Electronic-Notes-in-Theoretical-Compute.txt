The academic paper discusses the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), which is fundamental to modeling biological systems through stochastic simulations. The SSA is premised on the assumption that the time until the next biochemical reaction occurs is an exponentially distributed random variable. However, this hypothesis is often challenging to satisfy, leading to limitations when assuming exponential distributions for reactions outside its intended range. Exploring the use of generally distributed reaction times offers a valuable avenue for research.

The paper is structured into several sections. Section 2 provides an overview of BlenX, a programming language inspired by process calculi tailored for modeling biological systems, including how it handles general distributions. Section 3 explores the consequences of modeling abstract reactions with exponential distributions using several biological examples of varying complexity. Section 4 demonstrates the power of models that incorporate generally distributed reaction times.

BlenX is complemented by the BetaWB framework, which is a computational platform that accommodates both textual and visual BlenX programming. BetaWB functions as a virtual laboratory, allowing the design, simulation, and analysis of experiments. Stochasticity in BlenX is based on continuous-time Markov processes. The article introduces BlenX's visual version and the formal tools for managing non-Markovian processes.

The paper presents BlenX's language primitives for signaling and interaction, replication, and type-changing actions. It introduces the idea of events to handle complex transitions beyond elementary reactions, with "join" and "split" as two kinds of events. It showcases how these primitives work with elementary reactions and then discusses the extension within BlenX to handle general distributions, vital for accurate modeling of biological systems.

Process calculi theory, which BlenX is rooted in, has approached the inclusion of general distributions through methods like counters, ST semantics, and enhanced operational semantics. The paper adopts the latter, as it facilitates the management of causality and enables discipline in modeling.

The authors extend BlenX's stochastic simulation engine to include general distribution support, inspiring a richer representation of biological phenomena by moving beyond pure exponential distributions. This advancement allows experimenting with different hypotheses regarding biological pathways, as illustrated with examples.

The impact of assuming all reactions are elementary is quantified through a few case studies. These examples demonstrate the sensitivity of complex biological systems to variances in event occurrence times and the limitations this imposes on building accurate models. By employing general distributions, researchers can better match models to experimental data.

The paper argues for improved modeling of competition among reactions, such as transcription, by considering the multi-stage nature of such biochemical processes within a framework that allows deviations from the assumption of elemental reactions.

The SSA is the standard for simulating stochastic reactions, but the paper emphasizes the inadequacy of describing complex biological systems only with elementary reactions, highlighting the mismatch between qualitative abstract reactions and the quantitative assumptions in SSA-based simulation algorithms.

The paper concludes by advocating for the use of general distributions within BlenX and the BetaWB framework. It contends that this extension could lead to more accurate in-silico predictions that better align with empirical data, especially as systems' non-linearity and complexity grow.
