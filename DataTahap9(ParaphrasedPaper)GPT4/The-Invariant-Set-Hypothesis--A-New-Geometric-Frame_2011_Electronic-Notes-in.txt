The Invariant Set Hypothesis (ISH) presents a different way to comprehend contextuality by examining the unique properties of the set 'I,' which is sparse (having measure zero and being nowhere dense). In a hypothetical scenario, imagine a 'world state' that exists within this set 'I,' representing a real physical state. If we tweak just one variable while keeping everything else constant, akin to creating counterfactuals (like pondering what might have been measured differently), such a change will likely shift the world state out of 'I,' moving it into a realm of physical non-reality.

Furthermore, the ISH suggests that Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem's implications do not necessarily force the descriptor 'D' to reject local causality, thanks to an aspect recognized even by Bell himself. From the ISH viewpoint, experimental parameters like polarizer orientations are not entirely free to vary on their own.

In quantum physics, the wave-like behavior of coherent quantum entities can also be explained by the ISH's fractal characteristics. As is apparent in loops of images zooming into the Mandelbrot set, where repeating patterns emerge due to the self-similar structure of 'I,' demonstrating periodicity. In essence, coherent structures are observed at certain points as a result of the recursive partitioning that is dynamically defined within the invariant set.

The ISH proposes that there is nothing inherently special about the act of measurement; it's a process that both uncovers the nature of 'I' to us and influences the definition of 'I.' The underlying principle of the invariant set is timeless; measurements taken after a certain event help determine if the corresponding point lies within 'I.' This perspective helps demystify the seemingly paradoxical delayed-choice experiments, in which the timing of a measurement seems to affect the outcome.

Lastly, the instruments used in experiments are not just tools for human observers to learn about 'I,' but they actively define 'I.' Consequently, the ISH indicates the notion of a quantum particle possessing intrinsic properties, separate from the devices measuring them, is not tenable. This resonates with one of the core ideas of the Copenhagen interpretation, where the quantum system's properties are not predetermined but established through interactions with measuring apparatuses.
