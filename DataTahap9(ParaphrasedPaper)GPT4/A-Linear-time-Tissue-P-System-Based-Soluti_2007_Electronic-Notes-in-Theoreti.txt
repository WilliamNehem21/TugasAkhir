This paper falls within the domain of natural computing, specifically exploring cell structures and their ability to process and generate information. Two main disciplines related to this field are membrane computing and brane calculi.

Recent years have seen the proposal of various P system models, with a focus on those resembling cellular membranes, whereby information transfer occurs between adjacent membranes within a tree-like structure.

The research is dedicated to understanding the computational capabilities and efficiency of P systems, particularly how these systems can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time by leveraging exponential workspace generation and parallel processingâ€”methods influenced by biological mechanisms such as mitosis and autopoiesis, leading to P system models based on membrane division or creation.

These models are computationally universal, though they differ technically and currently lack theoretical proof of directly simulating one another in polynomial time. The paper considers tissue P systems, which differ from hierarchical models by organizing membranes on graph nodes, inspired by intercellular communication and neuronal cooperation. Such systems communicate via symport and antiport rules, facilitating the transfer of objects across membranes.

The authors discuss the evolution of tissue P systems, noting a particularly interesting variant that combines tissue P systems with active membranes to enable cell division. The usage of rules in membrane computing is outlined, emphasizing maximally parallel application and the singular use of an object for a rule in one step, except during cell division, when no other rules are applied to the dividing cell.
