Over the past decade, Mexico's education system has faced many challenges, highlighting the necessity for reforms to enhance education quality. From 2004, Mexico began adopting the competency-based education (CBE) model in accordance with OECD standards, slowly integrating it across educational levels. This model aligns with PISA's focus on student competencies.

In response to the need to motivate STEM education, our study assessed XR technology—comprising AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality)—for its effects on student motivation and learning in a physics course, leveraging XR's visual and interactive strengths to aid in a traditionally challenging subject. Our web-based XR learning application works across various devices, supporting AR and VR functions with proper peripherals.

Literature on immersive XR tech in STEM is growing, with AR and VR shown to boost learning outcomes and engagement in subjects like math, physics, and chemistry. Johnson-Glenberg et al. (2021) highlighted the crucial role of agency and interactivity in immersive learning. Lee et al. (2022) found that XR-enhanced STEM education in engineering encouraged problem-solving abilities and creativity, and advocated for active, student-centered learning environments. Smith et al. (2023) and Alkhabra et al. (2023) also observed benefits in engagement and critical thinking from VR and AR use, respectively. However, implementing XR tech still presents challenges such as equipment availability, teacher training for techno-pedagogical methods, and the generation of suitable digital content, which are also influenced by the socio-economic and cultural context.

In Mexico, attempts to integrate XR into school curriculums include Olivas Castellanos et al.'s (2022) VR-based remote education lab and Rocha Estrada et al.'s (2021) virtual campus user experience study.

Our study is unique in examining the motivational effects of XR on Mexican university students and compares AR and VR modalities to traditional methods. We also analyze how these experiences, differentiated by their interfaces (touchscreen for AR, peripheral devices for VR), environments (overlay vs. full virtual), and platform compatibility, resonate with students.

We used the "PhysXR" web app, a simulator for physics experiments, and divided students into control and experimental groups to compare learning outcomes. Students interacted with demonstrative XR content, while controls used traditional digital documents and slides. A stats analysis confirmed significant learning gains in groups using XR, particularly AR, supporting experiential learning's efficacy over passive methods. XR environments using the ARCS model positively affected motivation through engaging content. Our emphasis on web-based AR for mobiles allows users to interact with virtual elements in the real world, facilitated by an intuitive GUI.

Limitations include internet dependency, device compatibility issues, limited topic coverage by PhysXR, and the need for teacher training to author new content. The absence of VR headsets also reduced the immersive experience for VR condition group.

The study confirmed XR's positive role in newtonian mechanics education within the Mexican context, showing potential to foster self-learning and enhance understanding of complex concepts. These outcomes align with findings from similar research on XR in education.
