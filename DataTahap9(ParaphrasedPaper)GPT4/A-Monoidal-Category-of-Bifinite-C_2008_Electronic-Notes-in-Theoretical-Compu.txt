The paper discusses properties of tensor products within different subcategories of a category C. It states that the tensor product of two monomorphisms (monics) in C might not necessarily result in a monomorphism. Additionally, the behavior of the tensor product can vary between subcategories of C. For instance, within the subcategory IE, taking the tensor product of two extensional Chu spaces results in an extensional Chu space, and it's established in Proposition 2.2 that the tensor product of two monics in this context is also a monic. On the other hand, when dealing with the subcategory B, the tensor product of two biextensional Chu spaces does not necessarily yield a biextensional Chu space. This is illustrated by an example where the set of attributes for the tensor product could be empty, indicating a change in the structural properties of the spaces.
