Having observed the presence of additive structure within the homsets of the Kleisli categories, we are now positioned to deduce that these categories exhibit traced monoidal characteristics. However, before proceeding, we revisit Section 3 to reinterpret the iteration of a coalgebra 'c', denoted as 'c#', by employing the additive structures recently identified. This reinterpretation will subsequently be utilized in the demonstration (as part of the proof for Theorem 5.2) to establish that the emergent traced monoidal structure is consistent with the trace defined through coalgebraic methods.
