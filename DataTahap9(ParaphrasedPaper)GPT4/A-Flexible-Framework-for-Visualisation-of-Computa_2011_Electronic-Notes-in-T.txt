The paper introduces an upgraded version of SUBSEXPL, termed SUBSEXPL 2.0. This enhanced tool permits users to swiftly create new calculi using either de Bruijn or named notations. This feature enables users to explore their own calculi, conduct simulations of reductions and normalisations, export to LaTeX, and access additional functionalities not present in the former version.

Although many challenges related to explicit substitutions calculi have been addressed, there remains a lack of complete understanding in the field due to unknown qualities of these calculi. For instance, it is still unclear whether the suspension calculus conserves strong normalisation (PSN). Furthermore, it is practically relevant to develop an explicit substitution calculus in de Bruijn notation that upholds all the outlined properties, a goal which has only been met by a recent calculus that achieves the necessary computational traits.

The structure of the paper is as follows: A thorough exposition of SUBSEXPL 2.0 is provided in Section 2. Within this section, subsection 2.1 demonstrates the process of defining a new calculus in named notation, whereas subsection 2.2 discusses a de Bruijn notation calculus and references Melli√®s' noted counterexample. Section 2.3 outlines how the system can be applied for educational purposes. The paper concludes with Section 4.
