This academic paper examines the security challenges associated with live Virtual Machine (VM) migration across different planes: data, control, and migration. It highlights the risk of passive and active attacks that can compromise performance and security, emphasizing the increased complexity of cloud adoption for organizations. The authors note that previously secure network perimeters are now vulnerable to new threats due to cloud solutions, necessitating shared responsibility for data and application security.

Through research, they identify a gap in securing live VM migration and propose a novel framework to address this. The framework integrates various components like a Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) agent to enhance the security during real-time VM migration. It aims to optimize performance by reducing total migration time, minimizing service interruptions, and bolstering migration security.

The paper discusses attack vectors such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) and the importance of mutual authentication, encrypted networks, and resistance to replay attacks during VM migration. It underscores the role of public key certificates in maintaining non-repudiation of VM migration activities.

The authors present an algorithm to improve I/O storage performance during wide-area VM migrations by scheduling data transfers based on VM workload characteristics. They also explore secure VM migration strategies and the use of vTPMs to protect guest operating systems by generating and storing private keys, reducing attack exposure.

An experiment using Kali Linux outlines a three-step attack process on a VM host: enumeration, gaining access, and privilege escalation. The paper discusses various cloud migration performance parameters and the authors' backgrounds in internet security and next-generation networks.
