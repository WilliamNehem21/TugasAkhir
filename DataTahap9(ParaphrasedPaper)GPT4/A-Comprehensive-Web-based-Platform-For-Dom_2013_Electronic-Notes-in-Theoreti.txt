The paper discusses the launch of a project called "e-cyanobacterium/e-photosynthesis 1" designed to address specific issues in the field by leveraging the combined resources of databases and data repositories. This integration allows for the generation of complex links between models, simulation and analysis types, and the incorporation of these models into a specialized context.

The authors have adopted a strategy where biological models are aligned with a standardized framework of biological entities, serving as the fundamental components for these models. This is based on the Comprehensive Modeling Space (CMS) concept, which offers a formal method for the representation of simplified models focused on oxygenic photosynthesis. The CMS aims to streamline the model creation process, simplifying notation to be easily understood by both biologists and modelers. The accessibility of these models widely across the internet and their translation into a standardized format with consistent annotations enables their comparison and integration with laboratory experiments.

Currently, the platform is utilized to model processes in the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. The goal is to define a biochemical space endorsed by a consortium that consolidates current knowledge about these processes. Additionally, the CMS fosters a collaborative modeling environment for those studying various aspects of cyanobacteria, representing an essential step towards developing an integrated model for the organism.

While there are several tools available for simulation, model management, annotation, and comparison with experimental data, they generally focus on dynamic mathematical models and lack domain-specific features and systematically organized biological background information.

The paper also identifies the importance of annotations in understanding Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models, noting that inconsistency and incompleteness of annotations remain challenges. Annotations play a critical role in situating models within an organized biological and biochemical context, aligned with existing ontologies such as KEGG, ChEBI, or GeneOntology.

To manage the complexity of biochemical space, the authors propose a module for graphical representation of this space, establishing a hierarchical arrangement and maintaining visualization across different abstraction levels and biological structures, allowing for user interaction.

The first uses of the CMS are on the e-photosynthesis.org and e-cyanobacterium.org websites, with the former site already complete, focusing on photosynthetic models, and the latter still in development under the Cyanonetwork consortium, featuring all characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Future goals include an offline annotation tool to assist annotators and an online model editor that supports those with less expertise. The platform is undergoing testing within a consortium dedicated to cyanobacteria modeling, with the intention of validating the platform's effectiveness and ease of use for future system biology projects related to various organisms.
