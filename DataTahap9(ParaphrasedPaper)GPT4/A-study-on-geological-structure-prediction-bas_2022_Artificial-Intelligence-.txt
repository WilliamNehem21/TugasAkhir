The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is an extensive accretionary orogenic system situated between the Tarim, Siberian, and North China plates, and it ranks among the Phanerozoic's most pronounced accretionary regions globally. The Xingmeng Orogenic Belt, part of the CAOB's eastern section, plays a critical role as a junction between the North China and Siberian plates, primarily stretching across Inner Mongolia and northeastern China. The region has experienced a complex geological history since the Early Paleozoic, involving processes such as subduction, closure, and collisional orogeny related to the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The Carboniferous period marks a time of intense tectonic activity in this area. Understanding the geological processes during this period is crucial to grasping the evolution of the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt. Conventional geochemical approaches to elucidate the origins of basalts often yield multiple interpretations due to factors like the magma source's nature, the degree of partial melting, and the modifications caused by crustal contamination. Previous studies, relying on a limited set of geochemical markers, have arrived at divergent conclusions when analyzing the tectonic backdrops. Consequently, there's a need for more comprehensive methods to accurately deduce the tectonic setting of basalts.

With widespread application in the earth sciences, machine learning has outpaced traditional geological methods. This computational approach involves training models on a global database to prognosticate the tectonic settings of samples from specific study areas. The advantages of machine learning include considering a broader array of variables and providing quantitative probabilities for what were once qualitative assessments of tectonic environments.

To that end, a database of Carboniferous basic rock samples from the Xingmeng region was assembled and a training model developed. Findings based on 31 samples from Inner Mongolia suggest that most of these rocks are indicative of an island arc setting, with a probability range of 0.65 to 1. This supports the hypothesis of a trench-arc-basin system existing during the Carboniferous in the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt.

The structural evolution of the region is complicated due to the interaction of the Paleo-Asian, Mongol-Okhotsk, and Paleo-Pacific tectonic domains, leading to considerable debate regarding the timing of the Paleo-Asian Ocean's closure. Two theories prevail: one proposes a two-branch ocean with the north branch closing by the late Carboniferous and the south undergoing bidirectional subduction until the end of the Late Paleozoic; the other suggests continuous south-to-north subduction until the Early Triassic, culminating in the formation of the Sauron-Sylamulun suture zone. Despite these differences, both theories support the existence of a trench-arc-basin configuration in the Paleo-Asian Ocean during the Carboniferous.

This study trained a deep neural network (DNN) on a comprehensive geochemical dataset, including major and trace elements from thousands of basalt samples representing both island arcs and continental rift valleys. The model's prediction across samples from various locales of the CAOB and Xingmeng Belt leans toward a high island arc probability, suggesting extensive subduction during the Carboniferous. This is further corroborated by evidence of Carboniferous-Early Permian ophiolites and adakite patterns, pointing to ongoing subduction at the time.

Geographically, from the Beishan area in the southern CAOB to the Inner Mongolia region, there appears to be a longitudinal disparity in subduction intensity, with an island arc probability decreasing from the Early to Late Carboniferous. This indicates varying fluid influence in magmatism and suggests the potential for temporal and spatial gradation in the subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, transitioning from active subduction to a collisional or even early rifting stage.

As a result, the study infers that the Carboniferous Xingmeng Orogenic Belt was situated in an active continental margin environment and fits within an island arc tectonic setting, based on the high island arc probabilities observed in most samples.
