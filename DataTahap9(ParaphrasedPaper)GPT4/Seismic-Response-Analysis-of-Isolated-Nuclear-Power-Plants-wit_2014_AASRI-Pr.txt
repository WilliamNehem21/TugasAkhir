This paper introduces a novel Friction Damper Isolation System (FDIS) designed to enhance the seismic resilience of Isolated Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). Using finite element modeling to simulate seismic responses, the study evaluates the FDIS's performance in comparison to traditional isolation methods and fixed structures. When subjected to mild earthquakes, the new system behaves similar to a fixed structure, while under strong seismic events, it performs akin to conventional isolated structures. The friction damper's yield force emerges as a critical factor in the system's responsiveness and energy absorption capabilities. Higher yield forces correlate with increased response in superstructures but result in a significant reduction in displacement at the isolation layer.

Despite the potential benefits of seismic isolation in safeguarding nuclear power plants, traditional isolated structures run the risk of damaging pipelines and service networks due to excessive movement. The FDIS, comprising a friction damper and rubber bearing, addresses this by remaining rigid under low seismic activity and activating its isolation features under high-intensity earthquakes to dissipate energy. This dual behavior not only protects the reactor but also preserves the integrity of crucial connections by limiting their motion during minor tremors.

The paper ultimately validates the proposed FDIS as an effective solution to mitigate excessive displacements commonly associated with seismic isolation in NPPs. Finite Element Method (FEM) analyses support these findings, demonstrating the system's ability to control displacement effectively. Notably, in a scenario simulating a 12% increase in seismic force with a 0.05g earthquake input, the isolation displacement was maintained below 5 mm, with the FDIS acting as a rigid system.
