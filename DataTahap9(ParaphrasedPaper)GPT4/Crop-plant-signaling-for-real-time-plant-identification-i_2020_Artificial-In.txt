Over the past years, researchers have been exploring the potential of crop signaling methods. However, as of now, there is no comprehensive review of this technology as it pertains to plant identification. This paper introduces the innovative concept of crop planting signaling. It outlines the challenges faced by current non-contact approaches, such as spectroscopy and imaging techniques (including hyperspectral and multispectral imaging), in accurately differentiating between crops and weeds, discussed in the second section. The third section focuses on recent studies into cutting-edge crop plant signaling utilizing physical, biological, and chemical markers to streamline and enhance the precision of crop and weed detection. The paper considers the benefits, obstacles, and future outlook of crop planting signaling for real-time applications.

The study has successfully distinguished between canola and tomato plants from various weeds under different sunlight conditions, achieving high accuracy rates (88% to 94%). However, the process of eliminating excessive redundant data within the full wavelength range is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which is necessary to simplify the model and increase the efficiency of online detection systems.
