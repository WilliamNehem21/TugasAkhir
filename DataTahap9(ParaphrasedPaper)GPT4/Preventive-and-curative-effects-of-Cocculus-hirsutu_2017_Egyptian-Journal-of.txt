This study investigates the potential protective and healing effects of an ethanol extract from Cocculus hirsutus (EECH) leaves against liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in rats, focusing on its antioxidant properties. Various liver enzyme markers and oxidative stress markers were measured using spectrophotometry, and liver tissue was examined through histopathological studies using hematoxylin and eosin staining.

Rats administered with CCl4 in olive oil showed significantly increased liver enzyme levels and oxidative damage, indicating liver toxicity. The study tested different oral doses of EECH and monitored the rats for any behavioral changes, toxicity, or mortality.

Results showed that EECH could effectively reduce enzyme levels and oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner, improving markers like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, vitamin C, and vitamin E to nearly normal levels.

Histopathological examination supported these findings, with less liver cell structure disruption observed in rats treated with EECH compared to those exposed to CCl4 alone.

In conclusion, EECH demonstrates strong hepatoprotective properties and antioxidative action against CCl4-induced liver damage in rats, suggesting C. hirsutus could potentially be developed as a treatment for liver disorders. Further research is needed to identify the active components responsible for its antihepatotoxic effects.
