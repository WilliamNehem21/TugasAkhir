This paper investigates the polarizing properties of laser light as it reflects off metal targets, a topic not extensively explored in current domestic research, which tends to focus on remote sensing, medical imaging, and similar fields rather than on short-range ground object detection. The authors have developed a model to describe and analyze the laser polarization characteristics on metal surfaces and have simulated these properties for several typical metals.

The research shows that upon reflection, the reflectivity and phase of the light's s and p polarization components are altered. The result is that an incident linearly polarized laser beam typically becomes elliptically polarized after it reflects off a metallic surface. These changes in polarization can be quantitatively described using Stokes parameters and the Mueller matrix, a mathematical construct that represents the reflection process. The paper posits that if an incident light beam has a Stokes vector represented as [Si; Si; Si; Si], then the Stokes vector of the reflected light can be represented as [Sr; Sr; Sr; Sr]. The paper deduces the specific form of the Mueller matrix by combining equations relevant to reflection characteristics on the metal surface.
