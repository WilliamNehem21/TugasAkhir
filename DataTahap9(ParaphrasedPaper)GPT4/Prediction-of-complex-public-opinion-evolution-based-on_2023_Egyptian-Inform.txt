In times of crisis, it is crucial for governments to predict the direction of online public opinion to manage outcomes and maintain social stability. Traditional models for predicting public opinion trends suffer from being time-consuming, limited in the types of public opinion they can predict, and offering low-accuracy results. To address these issues, the paper proposes an Improved Multiobjective Gray Wolf Optimizer (IMOGWO), which enhances the predictive capabilities for complex public opinion trends.

IMOGWO employs logistic and Lotka-Volterra models to initialize its wolf population for better population validity. It also uses a nonlinear function to adjust the population update factor, which bolsters the wolves' exploration, exploitation, and local search capabilities. An elite retention policy and a set of Pareto-optimal solutions are introduced to facilitate multiobjective optimization based on the concept of nondominated solution sets.

Simulation experiments involving various online emergencies demonstrate that IMOGWO outperforms other methods in predicting the evolution of complex public opinion with improved accuracy and generality.

The paper describes the background of the issue, outlining the importance of effectively guiding online public opinion in Chinese society following emergencies. Various research methods have been analyzed, including statistical models, machine learning, and algorithms like genetic algorithms, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and neural network models. Despite these efforts, current research is still in the exploratory phase, with a lack of models capable of predicting the complex, nonlinear characteristics of public opinion evolution, especially when dealing with simultaneous public opinion information and intervention information.

The IMOGWO proposed by the paper aims to overcome these limitations by optimizing the Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), known for its strong convergence performance. The paper uses evolutionary patterns of public opinion that include butterfly effects and collective reactions to develop and adjust a mathematical model for predicting public opinion trends. The growth of opinion versus intervention information is modeled by an extended Lotka-Volterra model.

The GWO simulates grey wolf social structures and hunting strategies to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation in search scenarios. The paper employs multiobjective optimization to address multiple conflicting goals, resorting to a set of Pareto-optimal solutions rather than a single optimum.

The results confirm the effectiveness of the IMOGWO, showing high convergence accuracy and speed, demonstrating its strong predictive capability in handling single-opinion information events. Overall, the research suggests that IMOGWO could be a valuable tool for better forecasting complex public opinion dynamics during emergencies.
