In the field of signature recognition, accurately dividing a line of text into individual characters is a crucial challenge, particularly due to the common overlap and interconnection between characters that often result in non-linear separation boundaries. Traditional clustering techniques struggle with this issue, leading to ineffective character segmentation.

To address this, the paper introduces an innovative segmentation method that more effectively isolates characters with non-linear separation. This method begins by breaking down a signature into its constituent strokes and calculating a similarity matrix based on the positions of these strokes. A non-linear clustering technique called Normalized Cut (NCut) is then applied to this matrix, yielding cluster labels for the strokes, which can then be aggregated to form distinct characters.

Various methods for handwritten Chinese signature segmentation have been suggested in the past, including those based on recognition and probabilistic models, dynamic programming, and knowledge-based merging operations. However, these often struggle with non-linear character separations as well.

The paper presents a thorough comparison between the proposed NCut-based segmentation method and five other recognized methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and time efficiency, using four distinct databases for testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is both effective and efficient, outperforming the other methods in handling non-linearly separable characters in the tested scenarios.

Overall, the paper is structured to introduce the foundational concepts of this novel approach, provide a detailed methodology, present the results of experiments, and finally conclude with the findings of the study. This new algorithm could significantly advance the field of signature recognition by improving the accuracy of character segmentation in signatures.
