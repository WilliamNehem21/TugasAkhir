Coordination models and languages have gained a new direction within multiagent systems (MAS) by aligning with agent-oriented concepts, thereby broadening the application of coordination strategies beyond their initial purposes. Recasting coordination mediums as coordination artifacts within MAS has been particularly insightful.

However, the foundational concepts of MAS are still evolving due to diverse influences from fields like distributed computing, programming languages, software engineering, AI, and others that are increasingly adopting an agent-centric perspective. One notable framework, called agents & artifacts (A&A), reinterprets MAS with two key constructs: agents, which are autonomous entities managing tasks and driving the collective behavior of the system; and artifacts, which are passive elements that provide services and structure to facilitate the cooperation of agents within MAS.

The paper highlights the A&A meta-model's profound effect on how MAS are developed, programmed, and simulated, viewing coordination artifacts as a general extension of coordination media designed to offer MAS-specific coordination services.

The RESPECT language, initially developed for programming tuple centers in the TuCSoN model, is reassessed from the A&A perspective. The article examines the revised syntax and semantics of RESPECT within the A&A framework, offering examples and demonstrating how the language now aligns with the A&A meta-model.

Complex social interactions observed in human systems and distributed cognition are similar to the dynamics within MAS, warranting interdisciplinary study to understand and construct social activities in MAS better, particularly regarding the artifacts that mediate these activities.

TuCSoN's concept of tuple centers, essential coordination models and infrastructures, fits naturally with the A&A approach. Tuple centers enable agent interaction and are programmed using the logic-based language RESPECT. Key features such as generative communication, associative access, and suspensive semantics facilitate uncoupled and data-driven coordination in MAS.

The A&A-oriented version of RESPECT distinguishes tuple centers as both a theory of communication (ordinary tuples) and coordination (specification tuples), enabling agents to comprehend and influence collaboration dynamics. The representation of knowledge and control within coordination artifacts is uniform and encapsulated.

While the original RESPECT lacked linkability and situatedness, extensions to the language incorporated these concepts, with a focus on tuple center composition and time-dependent coordination. Additionally, the revised A&A RESPECT model accommodates the broad concept of linkability, permitting any tuple center operation to be triggered either internally or on other tuple centers, thus recognizing the general issue of artifact situatedness, including time-sensitive artifacts.

Comparison with other coordination models and languages like Reo and Linda-based approaches reveals differences in how they handle agent autonomy and tuple center composition.
