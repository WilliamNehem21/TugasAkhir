The study investigates the chemopreventive effects of combining cisplatin and celecoxib on early-stage colorectal cancer lesions called aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in mice. ACF are morphologically visible as altered crypts and represent early stages of cancer development, featuring a range of histological changes from mild to severe dysplasia.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is commonly overexpressed in various cancers, and inhibitors of COX-2 like celecoxib may serve as effective chemopreventive agents. Celecoxib and cisplatin were tested in mice with colon ACF induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). The study measured the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3, Bcl2, and Bax) and cell proliferation using PCNA immunostaining to understand the effects of the drug treatments.

Cisplatin was sourced from EIMC United Pharmaceuticals and celecoxib from Amoun Pharmaceutical Company. Mice were treated according to protocols approved by the Suez Canal University Ethics Committee.

Mice in the study were divided into groups receiving: DMH only; DMH and cisplatin; DMH and celecoxib; and DMH with both cisplatin and celecoxib. After 15 weeks, the mice were euthanized, and their colons examined for ACF. The severity of lesions was scored based on inflammatory reaction and the presence of dysplasia or hyperplasia.

The study found that combination therapy with celecoxib and cisplatin was more effective than monotherapy in reducing ACF size and improving histological scores. Celecoxib alone appeared to upregulate caspase-3, a key player in apoptosis. Cisplatin alone slightly suppressed Bcl2 but did not affect Bax expression. The combination treatment had the most substantial pro-apoptotic impact, indicated by high caspase-3 expression and a low Bcl2/Bax ratio. Additionally, PCNA immunoreactivity was halved in the combination treatment group, suggesting reduced cell proliferation.

In conclusion, the combination of celecoxib and cisplatin not only suppresses tumor growth but also enhances the antitumor effect of cisplatin through apoptosis induction and cell proliferation suppression. Celecoxib shows promise as a supplementary drug alongside cisplatin for treating colon cancer.
