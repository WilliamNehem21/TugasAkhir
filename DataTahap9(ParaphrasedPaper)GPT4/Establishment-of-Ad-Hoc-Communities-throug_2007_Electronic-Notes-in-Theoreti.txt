This paper presents a scheme for encrypting messages based on policy-based encryption, which uses credentials to define who can decrypt a message. The encryption relies on a set of rules, called a policy, written in monotone boolean expressions which dictate the combination of credentials needed for decryption.

The new policy-based encryption scheme proposed in this paper, which uses bilinear pairings, offers a smaller ciphertext size compared to previous schemes while maintaining computational efficiency. The paper also provides a formal security argument for the new encryption scheme, with detailed proofs found in the appendix.

An application of this encryption is shown in ad-hoc networks, which are networks where devices operate without centralized administration. These networks can benefit from the policy-based encryption to establish a secure and private method for forming communities within the network.

The paper revisits the foundations of policy-based encryption, describes the improved encryption scheme, and illustrates how it can be used in practical scenarios like ad-hoc networks. One goal is to ensure privacy, where only minimum necessary data is shared. This avoids revealing sensitive information such as organization affiliations, unless it's strictly necessary for the task at hand.

In conclusion, the paper highlights the potential of policy-based encryption in providing security and privacy in open networking environments, offering both theoretical improvements to existing methods and practical applications that enhance user privacy.
