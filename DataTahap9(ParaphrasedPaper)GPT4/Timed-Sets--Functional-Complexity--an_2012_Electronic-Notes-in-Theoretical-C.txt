The academic paper discusses the relationship between the complexity of computational processes and categorical theory, with a focus on splitting idempotents in categories. When idempotents are split in a certain category, the resulting "total maps" are precisely those that fall within a given complexity class, such as polynomial time (P) when complexity order c equals P.

Surprisingly, this demonstrates a clear link between the abstract notion of complexity and the practical aspect of computability. The paper emphasizes that the total maps derived from this method do not coincide with the polynomial time maps as traditionally understood in complexity theory, because the category of timed sets considers all theoretical timings for partial maps, whereas P-time maps require realization by a machine.

The authors explain how to construct a restriction category that correctly represents the total maps with complexity restricted by the order c, providing a direct connection between complexity and partiality. They describe the necessary steps to prove the properties of this restriction category, including being cartesian, distributive, and having discrete properties.

The paper also notes that categories of timed sets may exhibit multiple traces, illustrating with an example involving natural numbers ordered linearly with addition, or as a size monoid with operation replaced by maximum. Different traces can emerge based on these operations, showing that categories can have multiple traces and the choice of iteration can vary.

The authors mention that the argument laid out cannot be directly applied to linear time computations because of logarithmic overhead in simulating Turing machines. Nonetheless, for complexity orders that include time complexity n log n or greater, they show that the category effectively represents total maps for low time complexity tasks.

In conclusion, the paper provides models of computability that fit within specific functional complexity classes, such as P-time and logspace, by using turing categories. These models align with standard methods in complexity theory, offering the prospect that complexity theory results might be mapped into categorical theory.
