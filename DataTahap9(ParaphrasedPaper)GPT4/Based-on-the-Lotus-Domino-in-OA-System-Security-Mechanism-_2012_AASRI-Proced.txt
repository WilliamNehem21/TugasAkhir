The study focuses on the application and effectiveness of office automation systems, particularly emphasizing the positive outcomes when applied in real-world settings. These systems have been shown to significantly enhance internal management and office productivity, incorporating features such as email, process management, information dissemination, project management, and remote work capabilities. Their potential for widespread adoption is evident, with their prominence arising not only from the systems' robust workflow and might database replication but also from their sophisticated security measures. The research highlights the Lotus Domino/Notes security technologies specifically.

The paper describes an office management information system implemented at a collegiate level, built on the B/A/S three-tier architecture. This design utilizes a browser interface, like IE 6.0, for the front end, while the application layer is powered by Lotus Domino/Notes R5.0.8 and integrates technologies such as LotusScript, Java, SQL, and JavaScript. SQL Server 2000 forms the backbone of the database service layer. The system's business logic is structured into three layers: data management, application control, and user interface.

Administrative permissions within the system are clearly delineated; for instance, the Secretary of the General Administration Office has the authority to modify documents, control access, urgency, and distribution, while print room staff have similar document management privileges.

The paper discusses a two-way design approach within the workflow, which ensures flexibility in document management. Procedures are reversible, allowing for iteration and adaptation to unanticipated changes. In this workflow, the Secretary of the General Administration Office plays a crucial role, maintaining the ability to manage document issuance and handle any arising issues, adapting as needed to meet work requirements.
