The Chinese writing system includes 33 letters and four additional phonetic markers. There exist ten combinatorial rules that allow for the creation of 1,383 distinct hand gestures using these elements. By employing the Chinese characters as a guide, individuals can manipulate these gestures to seek out specific 'consciousness passwords', which may be connected to particular digits on the hands. These numerous hand gestures could potentially be protected as intellectual property in the form of patents.

The paper has outlined the framework of Chinese character-based 'passwords' along with their integration rules. By adjusting hand gestures according to the Chinese alphabet, one can decipher these 'consciousness passwords' via the gestures. These consciousness-related passwords hold greater potential for application than the basic Chinese character arrangements, and the paper attempts to demonstrate their importance through practical examples.
