Web scripting languages like PHP and JavaScript are popular due to their dynamic qualities that allow for flexibility but also increase the chance for errors. Effective static analysis tools are crucial for identifying and preventing issues in web applications. This study explores the potential of abstract interpretation as a method for conducting precise value analysis and generating detailed type information, which could enhance the reliability of these tools.

These scripting languages owe much of their success to their dynamic features, which grant great adaptability at the cost of increased susceptibility to mistakes. One key feature is the ability for operations to work with any type of operand, with the languages performing automatic type conversions as necessary. This practice, known as "type juggling" in PHP, is a focal point of our examination.

The concept of "type juggling" is well-accounted for in our analysis framework, as most domain definitions already contain sufficient data to handle it. For instance, determining the boolean value of an abstract quantity through the "tobool" function relies on understanding specific numerical sets. To ensure an accurate abstraction for "tobool," one must carefully avoid any precision loss during the conversion process. Although some elements in our lattice, like certain numerical representations, may be unnecessary and could be refined to boost efficiency without losing precision, we chose to leave this optimization for future research.
