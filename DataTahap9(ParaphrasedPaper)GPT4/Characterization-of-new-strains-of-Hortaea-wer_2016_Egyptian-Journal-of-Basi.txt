The research paper outlines the discovery and characterization of Hortaea werneckii, an extremely salt-tolerant fungus from the black yeast group, which was found in various marine environments. H. werneckii is classified under the Capnodiales order within the Ascomycota phylum. The reproduction of this fungus involves multiple modes including the formation of annellidic endoconidia and budding, with both processes ending with a complete separation at a developed abscission line. The number of rings or collars on the mother cell correlates with the number of released buds or conidia. H. werneckii's conidia are predominantly single-celled, with occasional two-celled variants noted for having a dark dividing wall.

In this study, strains of H. werneckii were identified for the first time in Egypt. These strains were studied through molecular, biochemical, and morphological methods to distinguish between the newly isolated strains and other previously identified strains of H. werneckii.

The researchers carried out several biochemical tests to assess enzyme activity. An effervescence in the catalase test, a clearance zone in the protease test, a reaction with iodine in the amylase test, and a color change following dye application in the cellulase test were all indicative of positive enzyme activity.

The study resulted in the isolation and characterization of new strains of H. werneckii. Among the new strains, EgyNDA08 and EgyNDA16 were similar ecotypes, while EgyNDA90 was distinct, representing a separate branch. This is reported to be the first documentation of H. werneckii's presence in Egypt. Morphological examination and enzyme assay revealed differences among the isolates. Further research is planned to understand how these strains have adapted to their saline habitats.
