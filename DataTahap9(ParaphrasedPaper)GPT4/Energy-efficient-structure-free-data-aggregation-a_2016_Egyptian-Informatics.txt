The paper presents a protocol called Energy-Efficient Structure-Free Data Aggregation and Delivery (ESDAD) that focuses on conserving energy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) by optimizing data transmission. The protocol reduces energy consumption by aggregating duplicate data at intermediate nodes instead of sending all sensor data directly to the base station. ESDAD calculates optimized waiting times for packet handling at nodes to promote effective data aggregation. It also includes mechanisms for node selection, congestion control, and fair data delivery, with the goal of enhancing energy efficiency, reliability, and timely data transmission. Simulations demonstrate that ESDAD surpasses existing protocols in these aspects. The paper also covers related work, the specifics of the protocol, and simulation results, concluding with the protocol's advantages in real-world WSN applications.
