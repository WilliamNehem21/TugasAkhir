The increasing importance of environmental pollution and depletion of traditional fuel reserves has made compressed natural gas (CNG) an attractive alternative fuel option due to its abundance and clean combustion properties. Its benefits, such as resistance to engine knocking, lower carbon dioxide emissions, improved fuel mixing, and fewer emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons, have garnered significant attention for CNG-powered engines.

One of the primary features of spark ignition (SI) natural gas engines is cyclic combustion variability. If this variability can be eliminated, engine power output could potentially increase by 10%. However, effectively reducing cyclic variability remains a challenge. Hence, understanding and addressing the generation mechanisms, pinpointing the sources, and mitigating cyclic combustion variability are crucial in the research and development of SI engine technology. J.B. Heywood has recognized three major factors influencing cyclic combustion variability: the aerodynamics within the combustion chamber, the mixture composition near the spark plug, and the quantity of fuel, air, and recirculated exhaust gases entering the cylinder.
