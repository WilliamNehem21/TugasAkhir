This paper investigates the effective utilization of underused radio frequency bands by employing cognitive radio (CR) technology, introduced by Joseph Mitola. The fundamental idea behind CR is to enable non-licensed users, referred to as secondary users (SUs) or CR nodes, to opportunistically use spectrum "holes" when the licensed users, known as primary users (PUs), are not occupying them. PUs have the highest priority for spectrum access, while SUs act like guests, using the spectrum only when it is available.

The authors focus on implementing a tree routing protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks (C-TRP), which is similar to tree-based routing methods used in large-scale wireless networks, such as IEEE 802.16j in Japan, 2.4 GHz wireless LANs, and Zigbee sensor networks.

Their proposed C-TRP involves nodes broadcasting Root Announcement (RANN) messages, allowing other nodes to identify potential parent nodes for creating a routing tree. Nodes select the best parent based on a path metric, guiding data towards a root node.

The paper introduces two decision-making schemes for link metric computation: a global decision schema, which evaluates route selection from end to end, and a local decision schema, which selects the best transmission interface based on the least loaded one.

C-TRP allows networked nodes to communicate on a selected spectrum band. Nodes rely on information exchanged with neighbors to construct routes to a reference point. When encountering redundant paths, the algorithm selects a channel for message forwarding and blocks others to prevent interference and ensure fair spectrum distribution among SUs.

The protocol constructs a tree that connects all nodes within a spectrum band, with redundant channels being blocked to avoid data forwarding conflicts. If an active channel fails or is taken by a PU or another SU, the algorithm recalculates the tree to enable the use of previously blocked channels through channel switching.

Each node in the spectrum tree is assigned a unique node ID, which helps in identifying the spectrum band and maintaining hop count information. The node ID of the root also represents the spectrum band number.

The performance of the C-TRP protocol is evaluated through simulations using NS-2, a network simulator capable of multi-hop, multi-channel CR environments. The simulations examine various network configurations and conditions, like channel states and the number of CR nodes.

C-TRP aims to balance traffic by either opening new channels or utilizing the current ones, considering the trade-offs between switching delays and queuing delays to minimize end-to-end delay (ETED). In contrast, other protocols mentioned (CTBR and STOD-RP) might use the same channel throughout the entire route.
