Recently, formal techniques originating in computer science, such as process algebras and Petri nets, have been applied to model complex biological processes. These techniques enable composing models in an incremental fashion, avoiding the complete reconstruction of existing models when adding new data. They allow levels of abstraction that can reduce model size, sometimes at the expense of losing some information. The models are transformed into lower-level descriptions, often automatically, through transition systems or directly into high-level stochastic simulations.

In the realm of biochemical reactions, process calculi decompose networks into individual processes representing molecules that function like state machines with distinct behaviors and states. For instance, an enzyme might be free, complex-bound, or degenerate. Molecular interactions are represented through synchronized parallel processes or communication channels, making quantitative analysis challenging since reactions depend on varying species populations.

The paper outlines its structure with preliminary definitions and model description in sections 2 and 3, the Stochastic Automata Network (SAN) representation in section 4, concluding remarks, and future research directions in section 5.

The model focuses on the state transitions representing chemical reactions and their temporal interactions. By associating reaction rates with transitions, the model forms a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) where only the present state affects future developments, disregarding historical process data.

Due to mostly having just a few transitions, the biochemical network's generator matrix is sparse, with all rows summing to zero and negative exit rates on the diagonal. This matrix layout lends itself well to matrix operation-based analytical treatment.

SANs consist of individual stochastic automata for each chemical species, independently tracking molecule counts. An automaton's counter increases at rates that are determined locally and contribute to the overall reaction rate. SAN design is modular, akin to process calculi, directly indicating species populations through automata states. SANs maintain a compact representation even with large state spaces, using a Kronecker product of smaller matrices, reflecting the biochemical network structure within.

Various numerical and simulation analysis techniques exist for tackling SANs, particularly those employing decision diagrams to leverage the sparse nature of the component matrices. The paper proposes future research using Kronecker-based tools to analyze gene expression and cell signaling.
