In the study, laying hens were separated into three categories: the control group, which consumed standard commercial feed with additives such as biobantox, BMD, and formaldehyde; the first experimental group, which received the standard feed with the addition of an AEM (effective microorganisms) solution at a rate of 5 liters per ton; and the second experimental group, which got both AEM-treated feed at the same ratio and AEM-treated water at 2 liters per 1000 liters.

The research found that the second experimental group exhibited improved outcomes, such as increased egg production, heavier eggs, lower mortality rates, and reduced egg wastage. Measurements of eggshell weight and thickness, yolk weight, yolk index, and Haugh unit (an indicator of egg quality) were higher in the eggs from the second experimental group. Moreover, tests showed that these eggs contained higher levels of essential nutrients, such as calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and proteins.

Furthermore, there was a notable decrease in total cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats in the eggs from both experimental groups, while monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat levels were higher compared to the control group. These changes in fat composition could be attributed to the inhibition of certain enzymes within the gastrointestinal tract due to the treatment.

The cost analysis highlighted a strong economic benefit, with the total costs of treatments being significantly lower in the experimental groups (38 and 52.50 Indian Rupees for groups 2 and 3 respectively) compared to the control group (110.80 Indian Rupees). Thus, the addition of AEM to the feed and water of laying hens not only improved the quality of their eggs but also provided cost savings due to the reduced usage of chemicals.

Hens produce eggs, which are one of the most nutritious and balanced foods available. A standard egg composition includes albumin (58%), egg yolk (31%), and eggshell (11%). The albumin provides about half of the egg's protein content, while the yolk carries most of the vitamins and lipids. Quality eggs generally meet the needs of consumers, and enhancing the quality further can start with the feed and treatment of the laying hens.
