Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) systems offer reciprocal advantages to both electricity grid operators and electric vehicle (EV) owners. These systems allow grid operators to draw upon the unused energy in EV batteries, while EV owners can use their vehicle's battery to power their homes. Using EV batteries to discharge during times of high electricity demand can significantly diminish the need for additional power drawn from the grid. However, as EV adoption increases and a large number of vehicles connect to the grid simultaneously, grid operators might have to invest in additional power plants to manage peak demand.

To address this, research is being conducted into charge and discharge control strategies for EVs to both meet the vehicles' energy requirements and to contribute energy back to the grid during times of high demand. Another approach to managing peak demand is through Real-Time Pricing (RTP), a strategy where electricity prices fluctuate based on demand levels. With RTP, EV owners are incentivized to sell electricity back to the grid at higher prices during peak times. Such a strategy is also anticipated to decrease household energy costs by promoting a more aggressive discharge of power from EVs to the grid when it is most financially rewarding for the consumer.
