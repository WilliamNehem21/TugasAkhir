This academic paper discusses the Creol language, a model for distributed systems featuring concurrent objects that communicate through asynchronous method calls and have processor release points to efficiently manage their internal control flow. The language aims to improve interactions in distributed environments by allowing objects to be either active or reactive.

The paper is structured as follows:

1. Section 2 briefly introduces Creol, explaining its concepts informally.
2. Section 3 introduces class invariants which define the observable behavior of objects.
3. Section 4 delves into the semantics of the language.
4. Section 5 presents proof rules that are derived from the languageâ€™s features.
6. Section 6 provides an example to illustrate the language's use.
7. Section 7 reviews related work in the field.
8. Section 8 summarizes the paper's contributions and conclusions.

The object instances in Creol are tied to a class that includes parameters and attributes which define the object's state, with only read-only access permitted to class parameters. Object behaviors are triggered both passively and actively by the `init` and `run` methods and other methods that respond to environmental interactions. Creol object identifiers are unique and the history of method invocations must reflect a correct sequence of events.

The paper highlights the challenge of using preconditions and postconditions in interactive and unending systems. Instead, class invariants are used to maintain consistent behavior and fulfill a "contract" between the object's processes, ensuring that the internal state aligns with the observable behavior throughout the object's lifecycle.

In asynchronous systems, objects can send messages independently, potentially resulting in messages arriving out of order. The class invariant must account for these possibilities, allowing for messages to be seen by an object in any order, with the completion messages clarifying their corresponding invocations.

The paper also discusses the proof system where variables capture the execution of remote methods and how local method invocations ensure the maintenance of the class invariant. In the future, the authors plan to extend this approach to include features like multiple inheritance and aim to adapt the KeY tool to support the proof systems for active objects in asynchronous communication environments.
