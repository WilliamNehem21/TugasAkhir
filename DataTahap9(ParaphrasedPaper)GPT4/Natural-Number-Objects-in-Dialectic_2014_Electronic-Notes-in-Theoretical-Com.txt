The academic paper explores the idea of delineating a natural numbers object (NNO) within the framework of Dialectica categories, specifically in Dial2(Sets). Deciding which monoidal structure to use is crucial, and while there are multiple choices available, such as the Cartesian structure or various tensor structures within Dial2(Sets), the authors must determine the most suitable context for defining the NNO.

Dial2(Sets) encompasses numerous tensor products, which, unlike Cartesian products, do not have a unique isomorphic representation. Among these tensor products, as indicated in Definition 3 of the paper, they share a universal element, typically the object (1, 1, =). This shared unit could be leveraged to create an NNO as seen in the generalized monoidal definition (Definition 1).

However, rather than examining every potential tensor product in Dial2(Sets) to establish the NNO, the paper takes an alternative approach by revisiting the concept of a Peano-Lawvere category, a notion initially introduced by Burroni. This approach is aimed at narrowing the focus and providing a clearer path to understanding how NNOs operate within the context of Dialectica categories.
