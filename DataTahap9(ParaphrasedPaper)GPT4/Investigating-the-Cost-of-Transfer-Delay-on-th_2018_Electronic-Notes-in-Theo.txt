The current study assesses the performance of dividing work processes across hybrid cloud environments with an emphasis on the costs and delays associated with data transfer. Building upon prior research on the expenses related to cloud computing security via a multi-tier security framework, the paper aims to forecast the performance of different deployment strategies within public and private clouds, factoring in computational and communication expenses. The study employs the Markovian Process Algebra PEPA to model and analyze system behavior across various scenarios.

The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 reviews background information and related studies. Section 3 provides an overview of the multi-level security model, and Section 4 introduces the PEPA model that addresses communication cost. Section 5 displays and discusses the results from experiments, and Section 6 concludes the paper, proposing future research directions.

The paper recognizes the benefits of federated clouds, such as cost reduction, but also acknowledges potential security risks from data flow between private and public cloud spaces. Access control methodologies for dynamic security are discussed, including the Bell-LaPadula model, which enforces no-read-up and no-write-down policies. This research shares similarities with existing strategies by adopting a multi-level security model and formal workflow analysis but focuses more on the performance costs of cloud security.

Through experiments conducted using parameters like the number and sizes of workflows and observational assumptions about data transfer delays, the study examines different deployment scenarios. The behavior of a publicly deployed cloud option (Option 1) is analyzed in depth against various communication costs to understand their impact on performance. Comparison of public (Option 1) and private (Option 4) options revealed that at a smaller scale, Option 1 is as cost-effective as Option 4, despite higher data transfer costs. However, as the system scales up, Option 4 outperforms Option 1 with lower transfer rates due to these costs. Increasing the data transfer rate in Option 1 improves performance and aligns it closer to Option 4. The models offer predictions for system behavior while accounting for varying communication rates.

Despite these insights, limitations exist, such as the lack of real-world validation and the omission of network contention effects, which may influence the data transfer costs in a practical environment. Future models might include such factors to further understand the impact on data transfer costs when combining public and private cloud use, potentially endorsing different workflow strategies like data compression.
