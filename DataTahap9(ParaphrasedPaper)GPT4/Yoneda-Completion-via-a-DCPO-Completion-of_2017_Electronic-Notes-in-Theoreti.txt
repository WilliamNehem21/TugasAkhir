The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out the foundational concepts required for understanding the content. Section 3 deals with a specific challenge inherent to the subject matter and introduces tools for achieving the targeted framework. The paper presupposes the reader's familiarity with quasimetric spaces, domain theory, and category theory, suggesting references for a comprehensive understanding of these topics. Notations are used consistently throughout the paper.

The authors subsequently address a concept in quasimetric spaces, pointing to literature for various characterizations in this space and highlighting the critical Kostanek-Waszkiewicz theorem for their main result, which allows the option of applying a dcpo completion on formal balls' posets rather than a direct Yoneda completion within quasimetric spaces.

The intrinsic issue the paper discusses is the discrepancy between the convergence of directed sets and Cauchy nets in the space of formal balls. To resolve this, the authors propose the concept of translationally complete directed families within this space.

The paper also revisits mappings between quasimetric spaces that preserve d-limits of Cauchy nets and are non-expansive (y-continuous maps). The authors outline the categories formed by quasimetric spaces with y-continuous mappings and note that Yoneda complete quasimetric spaces form a full subcategory. They discuss the reflection property of Yoneda completion in these categories.

The technicalities of idempotent Yoneda completion are acknowledged, and the authors offer a proof outline to facilitate understanding before diving into the complex details in the following subsection.

In section 3.4.3, the authors define Yoneda closed sets, and in subsection (ZF4), they describe how to achieve the Yoneda completion by taking the Yoneda closure of the embedded image of a space (X, d).

The paper defines Yoneda closed subsets, wherein a subset A of space X is Yoneda closed if any Cauchy net within A has its d-limit (if it exists) within A. These Yoneda closed subsets create the closed sets of the so-called Yoneda topology.

Throughout the theoretical exploration, the authors also examine quasi-metric spaces (X, d) through the lens of specific directed families (translational complete ones) and consider the properties of these spaces concerning the d-limits of Cauchy nets, with an interest in additional properties that may be deduced from the newly introduced g-topology and Yoneda topology.
