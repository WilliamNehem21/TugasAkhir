Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) has established itself as a key model for distributed computing and electronic commerce, opening up prospects for service providers and developers to use services as essential components in their application creation processes. SOC enables the design of applications that are service-oriented, bridging various organizations and computing systems by utilizing and assembling network-available services. An increasing number of businesses are focusing on their primary operations and incorporating additional online services to fulfill their peripheral needs. These services are independent of platforms and networks, facilitating the rapid and economical development of distributed applications through their flexible composition.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) aims to provide an accessible framework for service integration. Meanwhile, Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL) targets the definition of service compositions, anticipating the workflow and service connections. Despite these initiatives, service composition remains complex, and automating this process is particularly challenging. Current methods are not fully adopting the principles of Component-Based Software Development (CBSD) for custom service compositions.

Most existing methods emphasize how to interact with a service (syntax) rather than the outcomes of such interactions (semantics). As a result, service descriptions mainly offer the operations' signatures without detailing the effects of invoking these operations.

The paper begins by reviewing the concepts of interfaces, contracts, and services. It proceeds to discuss how contracts and services can be combined to form more sophisticated contracts and services, and explores the relationship between services, including bisimulation and bisimulation up to natural transformation. It also examines the refinement relations for contracts and services, introduces a set of service composition operators, and concludes with final remarks.

Within service-oriented applications, interfaces model the connections between different services. An interface, specifying a service's intended behavioral type, provides limited access to the service's operations while remaining implementation-independent.

Three aspects define an interface: the type feature (state-independent information setting the service's data context), the variable feature (a collection of state-dependent variables), and the value feature (the potential observations and actions of the service).

Contracts, seen as unambiguous interface specifications, are crucial for collaborative development across different services. They allow developers to work independently by clearly outlining the interfaces' essential properties.

When constructing complex applications through service composition, formal tools from category theory are used, viewing service units as coalgebras that can be combined into cohesive applications. The paper delves into morphisms between these coalgebras to form categories that represent services with varying interfaces.

Service specifications often comprise a set of actions governed by contracts within a shared state space. Grouping these services yields an aggregated service characterized by an additive interface and predictable behavior derived from its components.

Contract refinement involves abstract and concrete contracts, with the latter adding implementation specifics to the former's broader framework. Rather than considering the entire system for refinement, it's more practical to refine services locally, thanks to the favorable nature of behavioral refinement.

Service composition, which involves rearranging pre-existing services into new composites, is detailed. These composites can be reused directly or become part of larger applications. This process supports the architectural deconstruction of applications into their constitutive services, allowing for a clearer understanding of the application structure.

The paper outlines a formal framework centered on interfaces, contracts, and services, as well as their corresponding morphisms, to aid in developing service-oriented applications. Services are described as coalgebras based on signatures from their interfaces, adhering to contract-stipulated axioms. This framework unifies various notions within SOA development and adopts a categorical approach for service composition, with initial work traced back to Goguen and colleagues. This categorical approach forms a cofibration over the category of interfaces, setting the base for combinators that manipulate services.
