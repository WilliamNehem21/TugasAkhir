The complexity of the shapes of spatial objects complicates the creation of an intuitive measure for spatial proximity within their data space. However, establishing such a measure is essential for analytical work in transformation-based multidimensional spatial access methods, which hinge on maintaining the 'local feel' of data (locality preservation) and processing distance-based spatial queries. This study delves into the Hausdorff distance, applied to the space of multidimensional polytopes, demonstrating a strong correlation between this metric in the space of k-dimensional hyperrectangles and the conventional p-norm metric in a transformed space of 2k-dimensional points achieved through corner transformation. This finding supports the effectiveness of the transformation-based approach in preserving spatial locality.

For handling spatial objects with simpler geometric forms in spatial data spaces, like line segments or hyperrectangles, methods like the corner transformation elegantly map these objects' spatial features to a higher-dimensional point space, aligning with existing point access methods. For instance, in transforming 2-dimensional rectangles to 4-dimensional points, the corner transformation relies on the coordinates of diametrically opposite corners, whereas the center transformation uses the centroid and spatial dimensions. Transforming a spatial object database into higher-dimensional points, when paired with a point access method, equips the original space with spatial access. The study primarily focuses on corner transformation, but the concepts are applicable to other similar methods.

Challenges emerge when assessing the locality preservation and clustering in transformation-based spatial access methods due to the lack of an intuitive metric for spatial proximity in objects with complex geometries. Even if such a metric existed, the analysis of spatial access methods would be constrained by the underlying point access method and the specifics of the adopted modifications or transformations. Simple transformation techniques may encounter issues due to the presence or absence of metrics for complex spatial objects, locality preservation of transformations, non-uniform distribution in the transformed space, and the ability to support complex spatial operations efficiently. Recent advances have addressed the latter two challenges, but the first two can be addressed by developing intuitive and flexible metrics for multidimensional spatial objects.
