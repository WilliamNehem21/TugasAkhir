This paper discusses performance limitations when booting a Raspberry Pi 4 (Rpi4) from slow storage media, such as an SD card, and explores the performance improvements possible with SSDs via USB 3.0. As of October 2020, the Rpi4 lacked native support for USB 3.0 boot, but workarounds existed. The official MoodleBox platform, which typically supports 20-30 users, was originally based on a 32-bit OS running on an SD card via Wi-Fi.

In the study, the researchers developed a 64-bit LAMP stack on an Ubuntu OS, dubbed Rpi64Box, while maintaining the MoodleBox environment, marking the first time MoodleBox has been ported to a 64-bit Linux system. They tested Rpi64Box both on an SD card and an SSD to compare performance.

Four tests were conducted to assess Rpi4 performance: storage device speed, LAMP stack performance, webpage response time, and server resource usage. They used standard commands and scripts like hdparm, dd, fio, and iozone, as well as a benchmark script by James Chambers, to measure disk I/O performance.

The paper mentions methods to gauge network latency and CPU and database performance, including a system benchmark tool provided by Moodle that, while not definitive, offers a broad overview of server capabilities.

Results showed that the CPU was the system bottleneck, indicating that future performance could be improved by optimizing CPU-intensive processes. The study confirmed that the Rpi4, when overclocked, could support 50 to 100 users for medium-sized courses, although the user experience might suffer.

The paper provides insights into how the use of SSDs via the USB 3.0 bus enhances overall web server performance and offers a method to assess and compare storage devices. Additionally, it confirms that the real limitation lies within the CPU. The complete web server setup, as a disk image, is available for cloning to other disks and booting on Rpi or similar IoT devices, providing a benchmark for comparing different devices' performance as a 3-tier web server against the Rpi4.
