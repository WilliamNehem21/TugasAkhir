This paper discusses the integrated nature of embedded systems, which are components within products that users do not interact with directly, such as in automotive systems and nuclear power plants. These systems are often critical for safety and rely on software support.

Embedded systems frequently utilize finite state machines (FSMs) for managing control flow. However, FSMs have limitations in handling data flow, prompting the use of extended finite state machines (EFSMs) to overcome these limitations by incorporating additional state variables and interaction parameters. Despite the enhancements, test generation remains difficult for EFSMs.

The paper introduces a framework for addressing testing challenges of embedded systems modeled as predicated extended finite state machines (P-EFSMs), a specific type of EFSM. It outlines the essential components of embedded systems, their interactions, and the specific difficulties in testing based on P-EFSMs, proposing solutions for these issues.

The structure of the paper includes a review of FSM and EFSM models, with a comparison between them, the modeling of embedded systems with P-EFSMs, and an exploration of the main properties of embedded systems that require testing. The paper explains the principles of testing and concludes with a summary of its findings.

The Estelle formal description technique is mentioned, which utilizes structured communicating extended state automata and Pascal language elements, focusing on complex, distributed, and communicating systems.

A pivotal element of an embedded system is the controller, which interfaces with sensors and actuators through events or signals, which are declared as global variables to be recognized by all components of adjacent P-EFSMs. The paper discusses the requirement that input events from sensors trigger the appropriate controller transitions, assuming predicates related to transitions are satisfied by the current context.

The paper also distinguishes between two types of testing: general, which verifies properties like consistency, livelock and deadlock absence, and special, which examines properties defined by the system's semantics.

Lastly, the paper addresses the decision problem of P-EFSM completeness by focusing on the possibility of detecting incomplete states within a given P-EFSM and ensuring that specified input events are consistent with the potential input events at each state.
