Robust optimization methods have been effectively applied to complex decision-making scenarios, such as multi-stage inventory management, planning and scheduling (Ning and You, 2017), and optimizing the duration of radiation therapy treatments. These methods are particularly useful when dealing with uncertain data, and have been explored in contexts where the uncertainty is modeled using complex shapes such as the intersection of two ellipsoids with a non-linear and irregular quadratic function. While the S-lemma offers a valuable tool for dealing with non-convex quadratic systems, it tends to be limited in its application to systems with more than two quadratic functions, unless those systems display some underlying convex properties (refer to Example 2.1). Reviews of the S-lemma and its extended forms are available in works by Polik (2007), Jeyakumar et al. (2009a), and Derinkuyu and Pinar (2006).

However, it has been found that the results akin to the S-lemma for diagonal matrix systems cannot be directly derived from the methods presented in Jeyakumar et al. (2009b), as those approaches are predicated on the homogenization of non-homogeneous systems. Contrastingly, more straightforward S-lemma outcomes are recognized for homogenous systems that involve diagonal matrices, as seen in the research by Ben-Tal et al. (2009) and Polik (2007).
