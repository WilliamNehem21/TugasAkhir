This academic paper presents the development of a Cranfield University Urban Observatory designed to facilitate the monitoring, characterizing, and comparing of a wide range of urban and infrastructure systems such as water distribution networks and power grids. Building upon Real-time Town Centre (RTTC) project foundations, this observatory enables the creation of user interfaces for various environmental assessments and infrastructure behavior analyses. Furthermore, the paper introduces the Data and Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure (DAFNI), a high-performance cloud-based computing cluster that stores, processes, and presents large datasets to sophisticated analytical and visualization tools. 

The paper discusses the proliferation of affordable sensing technologies for environmental and physical parameters, propelled by advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless communication, including GPRS, GPS, and emergent mobile networks up to 5G. These technologies have vastly increased the ability to collect and transmit geospatially and temporally referenced data on an unprecedented scale. 

The framework examined in the paper concerns network architectures for environmental sensing, exploring aspects of network design, operation, and data pipelines, including case studies emphasizing application-specific and broader network considerations. It delves into issues of data ownership and intellectual property, highlighting the importance of defining these rights at the design stage of the network due to the legal and compliance implications of processed measurements. 

Data legacy strategies are proposed within the network design, focusing on maintaining raw and processed data, ensuring metadata quality to enable data discoverability and complying with standards like ISO19115 and Dublin Core.

The paper also describes the functionality of local and dispersed mesh networks, which include data storage and management strategies to ensure reliable record keeping and facilitate remote access, analysis, and presentation. Cloud-based NoSQL architecture is recommended for robust and efficient data handling.

The Cranfield University Urban Observatory is part of the UK Collaboration for Research in Infrastructure and Cities (UKCRIC), offering a unique setting for experimenting with complex city systems, supporting research by providing a common data platform with analytical and dissemination tools. This observatory is integral to Cranfield's living laboratory initiative, which aims to apply emerging technologies to address urban design, transport, sanitation, and integrated infrastructure development challenges.

The observatory assists in framing research questions and fostering collaboration across various stakeholders, while DAFNI aims to enhance infrastructure efficiency, reliability, and sustainability through effective data management, simulation, and optimization techniques, coupled with stakeholder engagement through visualization.
