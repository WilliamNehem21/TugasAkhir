Static analysis is a technique for verifying program behavior without running the code, which is particularly effective for identifying errors during the design phase before actual implementation. This early error detection is beneficial, as it significantly reduces the costs associated with fixing the errors later in the development cycle. Several methods have been developed for static analysis.

However, these static analysis methods tend to be highly sensitive to the complexity and size of the programs being analyzed, especially concerning the use of concurrency and the count of asynchronous processes. Reachability analysis, for instance, can suffer from the "state space explosion" problem because it attempts to explore all possible states to find errors, which becomes impractical for large systems. Despite efforts to address this with state space reductions, compositional techniques, and abstraction, the problem remains a key barrier to the practical application of this research.

Contemporary concurrent systems are often modeled using discrete event system models, which are appropriate for capturing system concurrency but can also lead to state space explosion when model checkers attempt to exhaustively analyze all reachable states for property violations. A potential solution to overcome this issue is to transition from discrete to continuous system models, using analytic expressions for system descriptions, which would allow for analysis based on solutions to these expressions rather than state counting.

Petri nets are proposed as a suitable bridge between discrete event systems and continuous systems. They are widely used for modeling, analyzing, and synthesizing discrete event systems and have advantages over finite automata in handling complex and concurrent processes. By approximating continuous systems using Petri nets, as suggested by Lunze and others, the model serves as a discrete event representation of continuous systems.

In the realm of architecture verification, two example specifications are mentioned: preventing critical races in transactions (e.g., at a gas station) and ensuring that no customer receives a product (gas) without payment. The need for modularity and hierarchy in Petri nets is recognized, as complex systems typically comprise components and connectors that are effectively represented as submodules. This modular approach extends to the Petri net model by mapping system components to Petri net modules and integrating them using the provided Input/Output-net concept, enabling comprehensive system modeling.

The research paper converts CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) operators into Petri net transitions, establishing a set of rules to maintain the properties of the architecture, such as avoiding deadlocks. In a discrete Petri net representation, transitions are enabled and fire based on integer tokens within places, which affects the state of the net.

The paper also discusses the concept of a place/transition chain and cycle within a net, referring to specific structures connecting places and transitions. Moreover, it presents a method for measuring states as continuous variables between 0 and 1, indicating whether a program is entirely within a state or not.

The paper suggests that future research will focus on the efficiency of these methods when applied to systems with a large number of similar processes, like those found in a gas station scenario with multiple customer, pump, and cashier processes. The aim is to explore how well these modeling techniques complement discrete event-based models typically used to manage a large number of processes.
