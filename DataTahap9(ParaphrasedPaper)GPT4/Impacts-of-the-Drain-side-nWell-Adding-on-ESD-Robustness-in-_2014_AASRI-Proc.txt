In recent times, advancements in microelectronics have led to the widespread use of silicon-based technologies in everyday devices like personal computers, laptops, mobile phones, the internet, digital cameras, and other gadgets. However, the increasing occurrence of electrostatic discharge (ESD) events poses a significant risk to the reliability of integrated circuits (ICs). As the manufacturing process of ICs becomes more refined, components such as the gate oxide become thinner, and the source/drain areas have shallower junction depths with smaller contact windows. This miniaturization makes ICs more susceptible to damage from ESD incidents, causing concerns for ESD resilience, particularly in electronics employing ultra-deep submicron or nanoscale processes.

ESD damage in ICs typically results from the high current associated with ESD coupled with the heat generated during the event. During an ESD event, characterized by nanosecond-scale rise times and potential voltage spikes reaching thousands of volts (as per the human body model or HBM), a concentrated power surge can occur in the high-resistance regions of a depleted MOSFET's drain. The localized heating can lead to spiking of the aluminum or via-plug material in the contact window, which can then lead to the formation of an alloy with the silicon substrate. This process often results in the destruction of the semiconductor device's p/n junction, leading to electrical shorts and abnormal junction performance. Spiking typically occurs on the drain or source side p/n junction and is particularly likely when the drain is under reverse bias, due to the higher resistance and subsequent higher temperature in that area, promoting the spiking phenomenon.
