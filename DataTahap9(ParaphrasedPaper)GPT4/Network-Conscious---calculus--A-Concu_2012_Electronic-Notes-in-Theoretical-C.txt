In the paper, a distinction is made between two types of identifiers within network models: 'sites,' which represent individual nodes, and 'links,' which are the connections between pairs of sites. Sites are considered as single entities (e.g., 'a'), while links are denoted by a label (e.g., 'lab') indicating a connection between two nodes (e.g., 'a' and 'b').

The authors suggest that by adopting a concurrent semantics framework, one can maintain equivalence (congruence) in the behavior of distributed systems, while keeping the concept of bisimilarity close to its traditional definition. They argue that interleaving semantics, which simplifies the modeling by allowing only one action at a time, is not a natural fit for distributed systems where multiple actions can occur simultaneously.

The paper introduces criteria for processes within the Name Creation with Pairing and Interaction (NCPI) framework to be considered well-formed. A process is well-formed if every link that is bound within it is explicitly stated, rather than inferred through the binding of a site. Additionally, it is necessary to prevent the occurrence of the same link label between different pairs of endpoints appearing unbound within any subprocess. The authors provide examples of processes that would not be considered well-formed due to violations of these rules.

The calculus presented in the paper only accounts for direct, point-to-point communications within a network. However, the paper notes that future developments could introduce more complex interactions, such as multicast communications. The authors also suggest incorporating various Quality of Service (QoS) constraintsâ€”for example, limiting bandwidth or imposing cost considerations. They mention the possibility of expanding the calculus to include asynchronous communications, which would better represent the step-by-step behavior found in software-defined networks (SDNs).
