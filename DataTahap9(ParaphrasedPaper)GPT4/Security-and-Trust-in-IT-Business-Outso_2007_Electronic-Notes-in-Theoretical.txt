When a firm takes on the role of orchestrator, it manages and coordinates a business process to achieve results. This process may be either pre-planned and unchanging, as seen in traditional outsourcing agreements, or adaptable, as with emerging models such as virtual organizations, where partners and services can be selected on-demand.

The System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM) assesses a company's security management process by assigning a maturity level on a scale from 1 to 5, reflecting how comprehensively the organization implements all foundational practices.

Risk analysis is a key method in evaluating security systems, often using annual financial loss as the main metric. However, if other variables like downtime or reputation are considered, non-monetary losses must undergo normalization for proper measurement.

To ensure that service levels are as promised, specific metrics are needed. Traditional Service Level Agreement (SLA) metrics track aspects of the process, reflecting service quality and alignment with business goals. Selecting relevant metrics is vital during SLA negotiations to assure a client's objectives are fully covered, including those for protection quality.

For instance, an SLA might specify a minimum internet connection speed of 256 bits/s, with no issue if speeds are higher. Conversely, the number of successful virus attacks should not exceed a specified threshold, e.g., 10 per month, with fewer attacks, of course, being preferable.

If outsourcing focuses on transferring security services, an SLA should be tailored to those activities, recognizing when security is the primary service versus when it safeguards the service object, which would require a Protection Level Agreement (PLA). For example, outsourcing key generation for identity-based encryption would necessitate an SLA specifying a minimum key size, while a PLA would be used to secure personal identities or private keys.

Yet, external metrics focusing on risk analysis and financial outcomes are typically not recommended for evaluating the Quality of Protection; they lack precision, have multiple limitations, and can't easily be monitored jointly by the client and contractor. While risk analysis can help identify a suitable PLA, its results, like annualized loss expectancy, should not become the PLA itself.

Security level estimation commonly involves assessing compliance with standards across different protection domains, such as cryptography or networking, and breaking it down further into threat domains, like virus protection or defense against password sniffing. This process helps align internal parameters with external metrics by understanding each technique's impact on threat mitigation. For example, knowing a firewall's efficacy in reducing trojan horses can guide the selection of internal parameters to meet the desired external metrics.

Early discussions regarding security SLAs in major enterprises suggested verifying system compliance across multiple security domains and incorporating this assessment into the SLA without considering task outsourcing. Extensions of this approach involve comparing SLAs or identifying the one closest to a desired security profile. A similar divide-and-conquer strategy has been applied to evaluating the security of web services.
