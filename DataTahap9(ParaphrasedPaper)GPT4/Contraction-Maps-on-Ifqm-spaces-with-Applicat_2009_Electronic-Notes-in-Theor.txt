Recently, various researchers have explored different types of contraction mappings and the corresponding theorems about fixed points within the context of intuitionistic fuzzy metric spaces and fuzzy quasi-metric spaces, as evidenced by numerous studies (refer to sources listed). We intend to introduce some novel findings within this area that we expect to be beneficial for future discussions.
