In the academic paper, the authors discuss the conceptual framework for understanding how quantum networks function with respect to different schedules of operations conducted by agents. They explain that an agent, such as Alice, can be regarded as a piece of code that operates on a specific processor, executing programs that manipulate quantum bits (qubits).

The paper introduces notations where "i" represents a set of input qubits and "o" represents output qubits. The corresponding Hilbert spaces for these qubits are denoted as D(Hi) for quantum input space and D(Ho) for quantum output space. The network's behavior connects quantum states within the input space, along with any classical inputs, to quantum states in the output space and classical outputs, with certain probabilities.

The authors detail that in their model, they abstract away all aspects related to distribution, such as the types of qubits (quantum bits) and communication events, resulting in a simple quantum operation. Despite computations in quantum networks being asynchronous and thus having multiple possible execution orders (schedules), the paper clarifies that the sequence of quantum operations doesn't affect the outcome, because local events act on separate sets of qubits. This leads to the conclusion that any schedule results in the same quantum operation.

The authors separate classical outputs of a network into two types: "signal outputs," which are results of measurements, and "external outputs," which are classical values initially provided as input and circulated within the network. External outputs depend only on classical inputs. On the other hand, signal outputs result from quantum operations and their associated measurements.

The paper emphasizes the benefits of denotational semantics, an abstract mathematical representation of the behavior of programs, highlighting that it abstracts away scheduling concerns. Classical inputs remain constant across all schedules, and because the overall operation is schedule-independent, classical outputs that depend on both the classical inputs and measurement outcomes have consistent probabilities across all schedules.

In essence, the key takeaway is that despite different possible sequences of operation execution due to asynchronicity, the overall quantum operation is the same irrespective of the schedule, and this schedule-independence simplifies the understanding of classical outputs in quantum networks. The authors assert that this will be proven formally in a later section of their work and that it holds true in other situations discussed therein. They conclude that denotational semantics provides a convenient and advantageous framework for analyzing quantum networks by abstracting certain details, such as the scheduling of operations, and focusing on the relationships between inputs and outputs.
