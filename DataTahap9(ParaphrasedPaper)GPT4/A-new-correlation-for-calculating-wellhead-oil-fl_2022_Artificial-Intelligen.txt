The academic paper discusses an analysis of around 210 oil wells in Iraq, taking into account factors like the gas-to-liquid ratio, pressures at various points, choke size, production rates, and the API gravity of the oil. The author conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the most accurate correlation for predicting production rates. According to the findings, Gilbert's correlation provided a relatively accurate estimate of wellhead production rates, whereas Achong's correlation tended to underestimate these rates. Economides et al. (2011) have pointed out that the multi-phase fluid flow theory through chokes is not fully understood. There was a mention of a proposed study by Ghareeb and Shedid (2007), but the sentence ends prematurely.

Additionally, a neural network model was introduced by Zhong-Bao et al. (2011), which employs a backpropagation learning algorithm for forecasting surface oil rates. This model incorporates a single hidden layer with 10 neurons, receiving input data such as the well number, well coordinates, cumulative production and its derivative, shut-in duration, and average proximity to adjacent wells.

In a separate study, Elmabrouk et al. (2010) developed a neural network model to estimate reservoir average pressure without shutting in the wells. Elshafiei et al. (2011) also proposed a neural network model, this time for predicting crude oil production rates from multi-stage oil separators based on the initial and final temperatures of each stage, as well as the oil composition.
