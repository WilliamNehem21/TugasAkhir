The paper describes a technique for enhancing the nonlinearity of S-box structures in cryptographic systems through a random selection process, particularly from a chaos-based entropy source. The central aim is to boost the nonlinearity of the S-boxes, a key metric of their effectiveness, by applying new post-processing strategies.

The paper's structure is as follows: after the introduction, it outlines the proposed method's rationale, presents an analysis of the method across three scenarios, applies the method in a real-world situation, and finally, discusses the results and suggests avenues for future research.

The proposed method is portrayed as both simpler and quicker than traditional optimization algorithms, focusing on enhancing the nonlinearity of the S-boxes without compromising on simplicity and speed. This is achieved through a novel mixing of row and column structures within the S-boxes. Performance improvements have previously been demonstrated by altering the positions of individual cells within an S-box.

The novel post-processing technique introduced in this study involves further development using DES S-box structures. The methodology allows for the generation of new, improved S-box structures from each original S-box by employing this post-processing technique. This provides a significant advantage over traditional uses of cryptographic algorithms.

While modern encryption algorithms are theoretically secure, application attacks have exposed various vulnerabilities, particularly in the S-box structures. The study's method exhibits significant enhancements in performance for S-box structures that initially displayed subpar characteristics. Specifically, performance improvements of 81.25% for row transformations, 91.6% for column transformations, and 75% for combined row-column transformations were observed, with column mixing showing the most effectiveness.

The findings suggest that there is potential to further advance the success of random selection-based S-box generation by integrating additional techniques and methods in future research endeavors.
