A key motivation for exploring propositional modal logics is to isolate and understand the fundamental logical elements of specific concepts, such as time, certainty, knowledge, or the outcomes of imperative programming commands. In addition, the development of effective methods for logical reasoning and practical application is also a primary objective. For the latter aim, ensuring that the logic is decidable and computationally feasible is crucial, although this is not as important for the conceptual understanding. The integration of program quantifiers into Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) is appealing because it offers a robust theoretical model; nonetheless, its complexity is comparable to that of full second-order logic, making it significantly more complex than other propositional logic frameworks.
