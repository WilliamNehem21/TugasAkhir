This study explores the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, microbial, and immune factors in the progression of ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. The disease is characterized by an abnormal mucosal immune response, with T cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa triggering the release of proinflammatory agents such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, leading to the recruitment of neutrophils and an excessive release of various pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These events culminate in tissue damage central to the disease's pathogenesis.

Due to limitations and side effects of current pharmaceutical treatments, and the fact that many patients do not positively respond to them, there is increasing interest in complementary medicine, particularly in treatments derived from medicinal plants. The need for new, effective agents with potentially fewer side effects is clear.

In the context of this quest, the study investigates the effects of an aqueous extract from Ocimum gratissimum leaves. The leaves were collected, cleaned, air-dried, ground into powder, and then extracted in distilled water using an electric shaker. After filtration, the resultant extract was administered to rats at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day for 20 days. Following the treatment, the rats were euthanized, and samples were collected for analysis, including hematological tests and evaluation of antioxidant status and histological changes in the colon and rectum.

The results showed that rats treated with acetic acid, to induce colitis, had significant weight loss, increased diarrhea, disrupted hematological parameters, and elevated tissue nitric oxide, indicative of inflammation. Conversely, treatment with the Ocimum gratissimum extract resulted in weight gain, improved diarrhea scoring, and positive changes in the intestines, such as increased villi and larger goblet cells, which could increase nutrient absorption and thus potentially alleviate diarrhea.

Furthermore, the study found that the extract had normalized hematological parameters, reducing elevated white blood cell counts, and importantly, replenished reduced glutathione levels in the colon. Reduced glutathione is a crucial antioxidant that protects the intestinal mucosa from damage.

In conclusion, the study suggests that the Ocimum gratissimum leaf extract has therapeutic potential in improving colitis by modulating the immune response, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and improving gastrointestinal health, indicating the need for further exploration into its potential as a complementary treatment for ulcerative colitis.
