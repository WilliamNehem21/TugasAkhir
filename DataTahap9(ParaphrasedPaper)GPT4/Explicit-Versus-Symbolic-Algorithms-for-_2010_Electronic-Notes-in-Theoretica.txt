Static analysis can be understood as a dual-step procedure. Initially, the analysis challenge is translated into a series of constraints. Subsequently, these constraints are solved to yield the desired result. The constraint representation could be specific to the issue, or a general language may be utilized. In this research, we focus on the general language called Alternation-Free Least Fixed Point Logic (ALFP), an expansion of Datalog. ALFP has been effectively applied to complex analyses across various programming languages and for model checking.

However, not all analysis problems benefit equally from a single solver technique, as certain techniques may perform better with specific types of input formulas based on their use of unique data structures. It's beneficial to explore varying data structures and algorithms to resolve the constraints.

The paper is organized by first outlining the background on ALFP, followed by a description of an overarching algorithm shared across two solver strategies. The data structures and specifics of both the differential and binary decision diagram (BDD) based algorithms are elaborated upon. Experiments conducted for model checking are then discussed, with results indicating the differential algorithm's efficiency over the BDD approach due to its method of propagating only the differences when resuming calculations, unlike the BDD's reprocessing of entire clauses.

The paper also addresses the treatment of assertions, conjunctions, implications, and universal quantifications in the context of static analysis, highlighting that the handling of these logical structures can differ between algorithms. The differential worklist algorithm is presented, which effectively avoids issues with negations by computing relations based on their ranking and utilizes propagation of differences, an optimization technique beneficial in certain frameworks.

The abstract actions in a program model are also considered, with assignment statements translated to modification actions and all others as usage actions. The research encapsulates the translation of certain formulae into ALFP and conducts experiments that demonstrate the interplay between algorithm complexity, formula length, and quantifier nesting, particularly for modalities in static analysis. The results show a notable performance advantage of the differential algorithm over its BDD counterpart.
