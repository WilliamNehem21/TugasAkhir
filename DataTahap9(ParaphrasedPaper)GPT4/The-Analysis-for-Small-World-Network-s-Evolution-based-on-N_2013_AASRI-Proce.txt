This academic paper addresses the study of complex networks, particularly focusing on the metabolic processes of system components (nodes) and system structure (connections/edges). It utilizes the concept of network entropy as a measure of these processes, examining changes in the network as it evolves. By implementing a proposed algorithm for analyzing the Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world network model, the paper investigates how network entropy changes during network formation, influenced by various parameters such as n (number of nodes), k (the mean degree of nodes), and p (probability of rewiring).

Key findings include a U-shaped trend in the change of network entropy in WS networks, with the parameter p influencing the steepness of the entropy curve and k affecting when the curve transitions from a decline to an increase. These insights are beneficial for researchers looking to address gaps in the field, such as a lack of understanding regarding the precise mechanisms and effects that lead to small-world and scale-free networks and a need for more sophisticated models that incorporate dynamics and other factors.

The paper's ultimate aim is to enhance our understanding of network modeling algorithms and to provide groundwork for the development of new complex network models by observing and controlling the system through network entropy. Further research could explore the network entropy trends of scale-free networks and design new modeling algorithms from the perspective of network entropy.
