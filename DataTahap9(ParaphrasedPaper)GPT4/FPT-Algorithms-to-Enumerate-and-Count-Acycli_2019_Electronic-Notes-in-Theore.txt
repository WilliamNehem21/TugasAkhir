This paper discusses the development of algorithms for enumerating and counting acyclic and totally cyclic orientations of undirected graphs, with a focus on parameters related to the graph's path-width and branch-width. Acyclic orientations are orientations that result in a directed acyclic graph, while totally cyclic orientations are ones where every connected component is strongly connected. There is an established bijection between acyclic orientations of planar graphs and totally cyclic orientations of their dual graphs.

Reverse search is a common method used to enumerate objects in graph theory, and it can be adapted to enumerate acyclic and totally cyclic orientations of graphs. Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are highlighted for their ability to manage Boolean operations on compressed data without decompression. BDDs have been used to solve various combinatorial problems, such as computing the Tutte polynomial and solving graph optimization and enumeration tasks.

The paper points out that the size of the BDD and, notably, its width (the largest number of nodes at any level) depends on the edge ordering, which is generally a difficult problem to optimize (CO-NP-complete). A path-width ordering derived from path decompositions is suggested to help bound the BDD width.

In the context of totally cyclic orientations, the authors discuss the potential to perform vertex identification on mutually reachable subsets of vertices within the elimination front, building on earlier research that analyzed reachability relations.

Branch-width is also considered as a parameter, where for a fixed k, the authors provide a linear-time algorithm to determine if a graph's branch-width is bounded by k, and if so, to output a branch decomposition with the minimum branch-width.

Finally, the paper acknowledges some avenues for future research, including improving the running time of algorithms parameterized by path-width and branch-width, exploring the computation of BDDs associated with graph orientations, and developing algorithms that are robust against dense graphs by employing other structural graph parameters as their basis.
