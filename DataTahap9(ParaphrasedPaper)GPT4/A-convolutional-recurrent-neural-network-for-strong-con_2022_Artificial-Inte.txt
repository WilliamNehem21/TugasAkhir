Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enhanced the capability to predict complex events by integrating with traditional numerical models. Machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, have become integral tools in this endeavor. An illustrative case is in meteorology, where convolutional neural networks are utilized to forecast weather patterns.

The study at hand introduces a deep learning approach, using weather radar data, for the immediate forecasting (nowcasting) of heavy rainfall events, which typically range up to 6 hours ahead. Due to their unpredictable nature and spatial-temporal fluctuations, these events present challenges for conventional forecast models. Weather radars provide a continuous flow of data captured as image sequences, which can be analyzed by a machine learning model, in this instance, a convolutional recurrent neural network featuring Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells.

The research focuses on Campinas, a city in southeastern Brazil, and its vicinity. Processed weather radar data generate a series of 2D images representing the precipitation rate over time. A key element of the model, named M5Images, is designed to forecast rainfall rates exceeding a set threshold – selected based on prior studies (Mason and Graham, 1999) – for grid pixels, with a specific emphasis on training the network using only data from heavy rainfall episodes. Moreover, the team introduces an innovative correction factor to enhance forecast accuracy.

To address underestimations in rainfall predictions observed during testing, the researchers developed a correction mechanism. This process involves computing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) between the initial observed data and the first 10-minute forecast across all pixels, which then informs the correction factor applied to subsequent predictions at the 20 and 30-minute marks.

The study utilized the R programming language, incorporating various packages such as Keras, TensorFlow, and others related to metrics and machine learning. The dataset comprises twelve severe rainfall events, split into training (nine events) and testing stages (three events), with a 95% to 5% ratio for training versus validation. Validation was conducted to fine-tune hyperparameters like the loss function, batch size, and number of epochs. The training and validation employed 133 hours or 798 images with 10-minute intervals.

Analysis revealed that prediction accuracy diminished as the forecast time increased. While 10-minute forecasts closely matched observed data, longer forecasts struggled to capture the precise location and intensity of rainfall.

Future work intends to extend this forecasting approach beyond 30 minutes, enhancing its application for early warning systems. Moreover, the performance of the method will be evaluated using various improvements such as ensembles derived from dropout techniques and varying neural network architectures or initial weights.
