The paper discusses a mobile LiDAR system composed of various sensors including a GPS for positioning, INS for attitude, a laser scanner for measuring distance and angles, and a camera for capturing textures. The primary focus is on data acquisition, a critical aspect often handled by software provided by individual sensor manufacturers, which leads to operational complexity and integration issues.

To address these challenges, the authors developed a multi-sensor integrated data acquisition system for mobile 3D laser scanning, leveraging the QT multithreading mechanism and serial programming techniques. This system, which is adaptable across different platforms, simplifies setting scanner parameters and collecting and saving data from multiple sensors.

The system architecture connects GPS and INS to the acquisition computer through RS-232 to USB and RS-485 to USB converters, respectively, with the laser scanner connected via USB. It utilizes GPS synchronization signals for both INS synchronization and to automatically trigger the camera.

The paper highlights the use of multi-threading technology to enable concurrent data acquisition from multiple sensors, enhancing the use of multi-core processing power. The QT framework 4.7.2 and QT Creator 2.1.0 are utilized, with third-party QextSerialPort class filling the absence of QT's native serial control features. Thread synchronization is managed using QMutex for safe access across threads, with QMutexLocker facilitating the locking and unlocking process.

The authors also detail the execution process of their system, emphasizing the need to subclass QThread and reimplement its run() function, which is then activated using the start() function. For the laser scanner data acquisition, manufacturer-provided APIs are utilized, ensuring proper scanner range and parameter settings.
