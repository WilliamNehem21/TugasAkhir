The paper discusses the development of a theoretical framework for modeling and simulating extravehicular activities (EVA) based on complex system theory. It describes the astronaut in a spacesuit with a backpack using a complex system model. Furthermore, it introduces a coupled forward-inverse dynamics model designed to dynamically calculate the motions of both individual subsystems and the entire system for EVA without the need for additional variables to address multiple result scenarios. Additionally, a sensor-actor model is developed to analyze the torques acting on the joints caused by the spacesuit, enhancing the analytical perspective from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional space.

The paper also highlights the challenges of conducting EVA, noting that it's a demanding and costly task due to the constraints of time, workspace, energy, and the burden of the spacesuit and backpack in a microgravity environment. Each EVA task requires specific pre-mission design and entails extensive training for astronauts—sometimes hundreds of hours—before they are launched into space. The preparations rely on findings from studies of suited astronaut motion in microgravity conditions. Modeling and simulation (M&S) are advocated as useful approaches because physical microgravity simulators currently cannot perfectly replicate the conditions of space, leading to potential loss of critical data when simulating EVAs on Earth.

In the following section, the paper discusses a novel M&S methodology for analyzing astronaut motions during EVA in detail. Section 3 presents applications of this method in preparing for space station missions, demonstrating its utility. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results and provides recommendations for future research.
