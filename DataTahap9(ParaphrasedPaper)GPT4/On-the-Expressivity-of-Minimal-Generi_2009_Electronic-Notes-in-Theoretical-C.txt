The paper discusses limitations in a current system that lacks flexibility due to overly strict constraints in its foundation. Particularly, the construction of induction rules is challenging and results in restricted expressivity, causing intuitively true theorems to be unprovable within the system.

The system's automation capabilities are currently minimal, essentially relying on a proof-search tactic. Although it is capable of handling fixed points as outlined, it cannot deduce invariants and relies on unfolding fixed points instead. However, there is hope that future advancements will enable greater automation. For instance, property instances that this paper proves could be automatically validated using simple heuristics, which would infer invariants from the conclusions already reached. Presently, the user must deal with cumbersome lemmas and nuances, but with improvements, these tasks could be carried out by the system, removing the difficulties associated with minimal generic quantification.

The approach suggested in the paper introduces new branches in the proof process. Nonetheless, these can be easily resolved, and they do not complicate the proof as a whole. In fact, this method yields a stronger theorem by allowing for more complex contextual information than traditional methods permit.
