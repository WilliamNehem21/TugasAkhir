The ability to maintain the integrity of information online is currently a significant challenge. This paper's preliminary analysis indicates that digital versions of the Quran found on the internet may be susceptible to undetected tampering or forgery. Given that all physical copies of the Quran around the world are identical, featuring the exact same words and structure across its 114 chapters, any alteration in the electronic versions is a notable issue. To address this, the researchers have developed a model and tool that can verify the integrity of Quranic text in e-versions by generating metadata for each word, including counts and locations. This metadata functions similarly to hash algorithms used in data security, where any slight data alteration results in a distinct hash value.

Online credibility issues arise from the unrestricted nature of information upload, which often lacks reliable checks on the credibility of the hosting website and author. Document control techniques, including digital signatures, are vital for ensuring that documents remain unchanged post-publishing, but these are challenging to implement over the many multilingual online versions of the Quran. Arabic translations vary, and translations into other languages can alter the meanings of verses.

The researchers clarify that their focus is not on encryption but on maintaining data integrity, especially since the relationship between information providers and readers of Quranic documents doesn't follow a typical e-commerce model. They describe this system's development and the experiments they carried out to assess its performance. Also included is a discussion on the challenges of dealing with diacritic marks (harakat and tashkeel) in Arabic text, which are essential for clarity but complicate text parsing.

The system is tested using various hashing algorithms, with experiments revealing that different algorithm implementations can yield different hash values for the same text. The system, therefore, uses a consistent algorithm implementation for verification. Results indicate that while hashing functions are sensitive to alterations in text, their effectiveness requires consistent treatment of diacritics across all verses.

Though this study focused on Quranic verses, the authors suggest similar methods could be used for authenticating Hadiths. However, authenticating Hadiths might be more complex due to variations in their recorded wordings, as opposed to the virtually identical nature of Quranic verses.
