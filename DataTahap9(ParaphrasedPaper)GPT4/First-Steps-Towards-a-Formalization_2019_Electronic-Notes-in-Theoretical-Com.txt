The paper discusses the significance of formalizing mathematics, starting with the utility of enhancing the reliability of mathematical results and proofs. A key driver of this process was Voevodsky, who promoted the formalization of homotopy type theory with the aid of the Coq proof assistant. Other landmark formalization efforts include the verification of the Four Color Theorem by Gonthier and the comprehensive Flyspeck project led by Hales.

The paper's focus is on formalizing forcing and set theory, which the authors consider mature techniques not requiring formalization to boost confidence, but benefiting from detailed formalization in terms of explicit understanding, such as determining which axioms are crucial for defining and applying forcing. The authors embrace the idea that a growing collection of formal mathematics could provide a valuable resource for future mathematicians, and cite Paulson's ongoing work in organizing this material.

Regarding automation in theorem proving, the paper mentions B. Zhan's development of the tool auto2 for untyped set theory in Isabelle/ZF, noting that it takes a different approach and that proofs generated by it do not conform to the standard Isar proof language.

The authors explain the use of locales in Isabelle to define contexts that establish the parameters and assumptions underpinning theorems and results. Locales can be merged and expanded, thus allowing the formalization to be structured and assumptions of key results to be clarified. The Isabelle environment is described, highlighting the jEdit IDE as well as tools and utilities provided for managing theory files and aiding proof development.

Finally, the paper indicates that while there may be some deviations in the presentation order of material compared to the dependencies in the source files, these are intentional. The authors conclude by demonstrating that the generic extension satisfies the pairing axiom of ZFC, leveraging assumptions stated in the locale m_extra_assms and using relativized versions of the axioms.
