The academic paper suggests that for a given continuous function chosen at random, its range (image) is both perfect (closed with no isolated points) and infinite in size (has the same cardinality as the continuum). The paper raises several interesting questions regarding the characteristics of the range of a randomly selected continuous function. Specifically, it asks:

1. Does the range of such a function qualify as a random closed set?
2. What is the size of the range in terms of measure theory?
3. Is it possible for the function to be surjective, mapping every point in its domain to a point in its codomain?

The paper promises to provide some answers to these questions, though it indicates that these answers may be partial, implying that a full understanding of these properties may require further research.
