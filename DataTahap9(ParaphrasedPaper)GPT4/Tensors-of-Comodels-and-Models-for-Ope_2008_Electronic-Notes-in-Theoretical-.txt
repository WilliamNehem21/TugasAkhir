Based on Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 3.5, the ultimate LS-coalgebra is characterized by a collection of states endowed with their intrinsic lookup and update functions. Corollary 3.5 implies straightforward enrichment, provided one uses the clearly defined notion of enriched(loc,v)array.

This section presents calculations of the tensor for additional instances, namely global state and monoid actions. Similar to the examination of read-only state, the focus lies on integrating with other theories through the tensor operation, and with exceptions via the summation process. These calculations are also found to be enriched seamlessly.

Previous discussions have revolved around coalgebras corresponding to three key theories: LS, LR, and LM. However, it is possible for multiple theories to operate simultaneously, such as by leveraging a combination of a state (S), a timeline (T), and a monoidal term (M), represented as triples(S, T, M). Therefore, in this section, we explore the combined tensor of various coalgebras and their interactions with the tensor operation involving models.
