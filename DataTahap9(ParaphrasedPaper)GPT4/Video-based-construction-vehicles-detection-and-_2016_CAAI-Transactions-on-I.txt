This paper discusses the development of an intelligent monitoring system designed for detecting hydraulic excavators and dump trucks on state-owned land, a subject that has received limited research attention previously. Utilizing video-based algorithms, the authors developed techniques for identifying these vehicles through video processing, adapting a frame difference algorithm for foreground detection and focusing on the mechanical arm of excavators and the structure of dump trucks for identification.

The impetus for this research is the growing issue of illegal land occupation in China, particularly in Shenzhen. To preemptively address illegal construction, the proposed system detects construction vehicles early in the process, during foundational activities. Traditional supervision methods, such as satellite imagery and on-site patrols, are limited by detail, timeliness, or cost. An intelligent video monitoring system provides a more suitable alternative.

Foreground detection algorithms are adapted differently for excavators and dump trucks due to their varying speeds. The proposed method incorporates spatial-temporal reasoning and inverse valley features to detect excavators and combines structured component projection with spatial relationships for dump trucks.

Experimental results from real-world monitoring sites demonstrate the system's effectiveness, suggesting its potential for practical application in preempting illegal construction on state-owned land. The paper concludes with a summary of the contribution and references to related work by researchers and affiliations with academic institutions in China and France.
