The study of how we reason about knowledge and belief, known as epistemic reasoning, is a key area in computer science and AI. Many researchers have focused on modal logics within formal epistemology over recent years. Various computer programs now assist with reasoning using these logics.

Recent work has advanced the field by incorporating the concept of justification into modal epistemic logic. This enhancement allows us to consider the reasons behind agents' knowledge and beliefs, identifying relevant and sufficient justifications for epistemic conclusions. Consequently, the study of evidence has become more precise.

In implementing this logic, a significant challenge was managing the evaluation of box families, which are simple in theory but complex in practice. Each "box" - representing a unit of reasoning - received a unique identifier. As proofs branch and box families expand, maintaining sets of related box identifiers is crucial. The process involves substituting each box with an identifier and then tracking how these identifiers are grouped as families through a proof tree. It is vital to monitor how each rule transforms the formulas in the proof.

When applying standard epistemic logic to a puzzle, inconsistencies can arise. Consider a scenario with n children labeled with propositional variables, where each variable indicates whether a child is muddy. Modifying the logic to assign a variable "j" for commonly known facts can resolve certain issues. Adjustments are made to ensure that knowledge spreads correctly among children over time, but complexity remains an issue.

When dealing with disjunctions, the proof system MetaPRL can find solutions if everything is fully expressed. However, in fully automatic mode, it struggles to do so quickly, unlike with simpler puzzles such as the "Muddy Children Puzzle" for four children. This difficulty arises because all "j-boxed" assumptions in the reasoning must be used twice, and the proof system exhausts possibilities with single uses before expanding the search. This necessary expansion results in a large search space, delaying the finding of a solution. Despite similar expansion needs for the Muddy Children Puzzle, reasons for quicker solutions there are not fully understood.
