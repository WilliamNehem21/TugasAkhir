Creating verified compilers, which must ensure that programs are translated correctly from high-level code to machine code, is challenging. This difficulty is heightened when the compiler must perform advanced analyses such as type checking and data-flow analysis. Within the research community, significant progress has been made in developing techniques for verifying both the correctness of type systems and program optimizations that rely on these analyses. However, integrating these techniques into a single framework is complicated since they typically operate on different forms of program representationsâ€”type checking is usually associated with abstract syntax trees (ASTs), whereas optimizations that involve data flow analysis are often related to control flow graphs (CFGs) or program dependency graphs.

The paper introduces an attribute grammar-based specification language specifically designed to facilitate both type checking and data-flow analysis. It accomplishes this by allowing attribute labelling on control flow graphs and the use of temporal logic formulas to specify data-flow analyses. The language integrates verified type rules and data-flow analyses, which can be derived from manual or automated proof methods, within a unified declarative attribute grammar framework. This unified approach is intended to bolster the confidence in language implementations.

The specification language also provides the flexibility to support new constructs and expand its capabilities to accommodate various temporal logics. This extensibility ensures that alternative logics and model checkers can be employed to express data-flow analyses within the framework.

In the context of building a verified compiler, it is necessary to draft a comprehensive specification that can be subjected to rigorous correctness analyses. The paper addresses the challenge posed by having to use different notations for different compiler aspects due to their natural inclination towards specific program representations.

As part of demonstrating its practical application, the paper describes how the extended attribute grammars in their framework can be used to perform optimizations, like dead code elimination, during compilation. The optimized program is constructed through higher-order attributes, and the model checker's results are propagated through inherited attributes to relevant parts of the grammar.

The authors underscore the extensibility of their system, named Silver, and detail how new language features and semantic analyses can be integrated seamlessly. They illustrate this by extending Silver to incorporate data-flow analysis based on distinct temporal logics and suggesting that it can accommodate further extensions with relative ease.

Moreover, Silver is implemented by translating its attribute grammar specifications into Haskell code. Impressively, the Silver-to-Haskell translator is built using Silver itself, exemplifying the language's robustness and efficacy.

The extensions to Silver were developed to allow researchers to create high-level language specifications capable of combining syntax-directed and control-flow-based analyses in a single framework. Silver has been used to specify extensible host languages, language extensions with new constructs, semantic analyses, and optimizations (often informed by data-flow analysis).

Lastly, the paper envisions the use of Silver by domain-specific experts, rather than language implementation specialists, to specify data-flow properties for optimizing domain-specific constructs. Temporal logics are highlighted as a high-level formalism that can facilitate such specifications. The language extensions that Silver could support may range from integrating SQL into an extensible Java host to adding specialized types for computational geometry, thereby accommodating high-level formalism for domain-driven optimizations.
