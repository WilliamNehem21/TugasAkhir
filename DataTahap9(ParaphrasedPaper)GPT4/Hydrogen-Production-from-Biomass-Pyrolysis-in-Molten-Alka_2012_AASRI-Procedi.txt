This study examines the viability of generating hydrogen-rich gas using biomass pyrolysis in a molten alkali environment within a stainless steel reactor. Employing molten alkali as the heat transfer medium for thermal pyrolysis, six types of biomass were investigated under normal atmospheric pressure and temperatures ranging from 350 to 550 degrees Celsius. The resultant pyrolysis gases were analyzed by gas chromatography to understand the influence of biomass variety, addition of additives, and varying conditions such as temperature and nitrogen flow rate on hydrogen concentration and yield.

The pressing global challenges of energy sustainability and reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuel use underscore the necessity to transition towards a hydrogen energy system. Hydrogen production is considered environmentally benign if derived from biomass rather than coal, petroleum, or natural gas.

Hydrogen from biomass can be generated through two main methods: thermo-chemical and bio-chemical processes. Thermo-chemical methods, which include gasification, bio-oil pyrolysis, steam reforming of biomass-driven alkanes and alcohols, and aqueous phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons, are capable of rapid hydrogen production from continuous biomass feed.

Following previous research utilizing molten salts (ZnCl2-KCl) to create bio-oil, this study seeks to generate hydrogen-rich gas through the pyrolysis of biomass in molten sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The impact of the type of biomass, reaction conditions, and additives on the yield and hydrogen content of the final gas product was explored.

Agricultural and forestry residues, including various kinds of sawdust (fir, birch, and redwood), rice stalks, cole stalks, and rice husks, served as the biomass feedstocks, while a Vario elemental analyzer determined their constituent elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur). Before experiments, the biomass was dried at 105 degrees Celsius and sieved to a size of 60-100 mesh.

The experimental conclusions indicate that the type of biomass, reaction temperature, and the presence of additives, particularly nickel chloride (NiCl), substantially affect hydrogen yield. Higher temperatures enhance hydrogen production, and the addition of certain additives can further increase yields.
