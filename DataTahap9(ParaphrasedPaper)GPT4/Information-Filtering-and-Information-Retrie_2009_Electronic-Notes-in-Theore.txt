The internet has become the primary source of information globally, with estimates suggesting there are between 15 to 30 billion web pages hosting a vast array of content on virtually every subject imaginable. Unlike centralized databases, each website is independently managed, making it challenging to categorize the extensive array of information online. Consequently, locating specific information on the internet stands as a critical issue.

Search engines are commonly used tools to navigate this expansive digital landscape, yet, there is a paucity of scientific resources dedicated to improving the specificity of information retrieval directly from an individual web page. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for extracting pertinent information from web pages by employing a user-defined filtering criterion. Our proposed approach generates a newly tailored web page containing only content relevant to the specified search terms. To the best of our understanding, this represents the inaugural tool capable of creating such focused extractions from web pages. The subsequent sections delineate how this method functions, its implementation, and its distribution.

We demonstrate the value of a web filtering tool using an example in Section 3. The filtering process itself is detailed in Section 4, along with an introduction to the web filtering toolbar, which operationalizes our methodology. Section 5 examines similar pre-existing work. Finally, the paper concludes in Section 6 with findings and directions for future research.

The filtering algorithm initially fabricates a hierarchical tree-like data structure encapsulating the entirety of the web page's content in document order. This structure is essentially an object outfitted with query methods to navigate the tree. Consequently, the web page is transmuted into a query-able data structure.

When utilizing the filter tool, the user simply inputs keywords that define their search interest, optionally tweaking certain flag settings that typically remain at default values. These keywords guide the filtering process to craft a new web page displaying only the nodes related to the search terms, a determination made through comparing the keywords with node attribute contents.

Furthermore, web pages are dynamically resized to fit the content of the slices. This is especially relevant for iframes, which often have scrollable areas that exceed their visual bounds. By resizing iframes according to filtered content, the tool avoids leaving empty, scroll-induced spaces, thus refining the presentation of the carved-out information slice.
