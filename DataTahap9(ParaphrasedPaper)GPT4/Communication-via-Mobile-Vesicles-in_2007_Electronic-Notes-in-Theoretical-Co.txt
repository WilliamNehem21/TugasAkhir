In the basic version of P systems, objects change according to rules within specific regions that convert groups of symbols into other groups of symbols. These rules enable objects to move between connected regions or membranes and are typically applied in a way that is both non-deterministic and fully parallel. This means all objects that can change must do so simultaneously, with the rules and objects chosen at random.

The paper discusses various important findings about the computing potential of two basic brane calculi, a parallel approach to brane calculi emulating the parallelism of P systems, and two variants of P systems influenced by brane calculi.

The paper is structured into sections that build upon each other. Section 2 lays out the foundational concepts that will be used throughout the paper. Section 3 describes how to model the interaction and communication of mobile membranes through actions similar to biological processes like phagocytosis and exocytosis. Section 4 concludes the paper with remarks and potential directions for future research.

Both P systems and brane calculi use the concept of biological membranes to separate processes and resources. These membranes can be represented in various forms, such as tree structures or nested parentheses, and the depth of the nesting can vary.

Biological membranes, consisting of a lipid bilayer, allow both structural components and molecules to move freely within the space they enclose. This fluid and dynamic nature is reflected in the structure of brane calculi, which consist of two operative groups and a replication function.

The phago/exo/pino (PEP) brane calculus is a model defined by three actions that mirror biological processes. Phagocytosis (phago) involves a cell engulfing one external membrane, pinocytosis (pino) involves the intake of external fluid without membranes, and exocytosis (exo) is the opposite of endocytosis, where an internal membrane merges with an external one and expels its contents.
