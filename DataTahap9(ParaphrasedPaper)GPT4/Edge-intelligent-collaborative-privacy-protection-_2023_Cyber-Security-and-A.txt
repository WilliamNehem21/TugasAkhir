Smart healthcare solutions are crucial in addressing the challenges of ongoing care and diagnostic processes. The integration of wearable technology and smartphones with cutting-edge innovations like artificial intelligence enables capabilities such as continuous health tracking and virtual consultations. In practice, using a federated learning model that's structured around an end-edge-cloud architecture ensures that sensitive patient data is not centralized, significantly reducing the risk of privacy breaches.

To further protect privacy, the model employs differential privacy techniques when uploading information to cloud data centers and distributing it to edge servers. This approach thwarts potential inference attacks by ensuring attackers cannot extract individual training data details. Differential privacy is generally achieved by introducing controlled random noise into the data, with the Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms being common methods. These mechanisms adhere to specific formulas to maintain the effectiveness of data privacy.

Regarding data centers, cloud-based facilities are a centralized option for gathering data from multiple healthcare institutions. They offer robust security measures and possess ample computational and storage capacities. Nevertheless, due to their remote nature, there are communication inefficiencies with end-users.

As for the effectiveness of different federated learning strategies, the paper observes the performance on a breast cancer dataset. The Enhanced Iterative Converging Parallel Processing (EICPP) model displays a higher rate of accuracy improvement in comparison to both FedAvg and FedMA. EICPP approaches near convergence by the 14th iteration, FedMA by the 20th, and FedAvg takes until approximately the 24th iteration to reach a similar level of convergence. Looking at the final accuracy rates achieved, EICPP tops with 95.47%, while FedMA reaches a lower 82.56%.
