This paper introduces a probabilistic model for eukaryotic cell cycle regulation, using a formal framework based on stochastic process algebras tailored for systems with components that can change location or configuration (mobile systems). Simulations are performed utilizing the BioSpi tool. This method is contrasted with traditional approaches that use ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

The activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are key regulators of the cell cycle, can be controlled in three ways: through the availability of cyclin proteins, by binding with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), and by phosphorylation events on the CDK molecule. While CDK levels are relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, cyclin concentration varies according to regulated synthesis and degradation rates. CKI levels are also dynamically regulated, influencing the binding with cyclin-CDK complexes. Lastly, CDK activity can be inhibited by phosphorylating a specific tyrosine residue, a modification governed by the interplay between Wee1 kinase (phosphorylating enzyme) and Cdc25 phosphatase (dephosphorylating enzyme).

The computing model used in the framework operates on the principle that at any given point, all spontaneously occurring activities within the state of the system are in competition, and the activity with the fastest rate wins. The use of exponential distributions in this model ensures that the probability of two activities completing at the exact same time is essentially zero.

Respecting the lifecycle of cyclins, the paper details the dynamics of the cyclin-CDK complex, which can undergo several processes: the degradation of the cyclin unit, binding with a CKI to form a trimer complex consisting of cyclin-CDK-CKI, and degradation of the CKI part. Moreover, the activator CDH1 can promote the degradation of cyclins, can be inactivated by phosphorylation, or can be re-activated by Cdc14, which removes the phosphate group. Finally, the larger trimer complex can revert to the cyclin-CDK dimer or remain unchanged.

In summary, this study provides a stochastic representation of cell cycle control mechanisms, offering a different perspective compared to classical deterministic models, and potentially yielding insights into the variability and dynamics of the cell cycle process.
