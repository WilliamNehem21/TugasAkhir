Artifacts in seismic data migration can arise from various sources, including the data collection pattern, noise, unwanted wave reflections, the migration algorithm, or inaccuracies in modeling the subsurface speed. Abma and colleagues (2007) examined the artifacts produced by the Kirchhoff migration routine, particularly noting the impacts of nonuniform directional sampling and gaps in the data collection. Artifacts can also stem from aliasing and uneven data sampling. On the subject of seismic data errors, Ongkiehong and Huizer (1987) identified binning errors, which refer to adjustments for uneven data sampling, as particularly critical. While Kirchhoff migration can handle data with irregular spacing, artifacts can still appear if the sampling lacks regularity across various dimensions. Gathering more data can mitigate this issue, but it's not always feasible due to practical and economic constraints. Németh and Schuster (1999) proposed that least-squares migration could alleviate some artifacts stemming from uneven sampling, although historically this has been a costly remedy.

Beyond these high-cost solutions (such as enhanced data gathering or least-squares migration), there are more economical data processing methods to eliminate migration artifacts. Hale (2011) recommended a structure-oriented bilateral filter specifically for migration noise. Meanwhile, Masjukov and Shlyonkin (2015) introduced a six-dimensional filtering technique that uses a dip decomposition within common offset volumes, along with computing a semblance-type measure across offsets for all uniform dip gatherings, to suppress migration artifacts. In VSP migration, Lou and Simpson (2019) detailed a dip filter that aligns with local velocity models, allowing genuine dip structures to remain while filtering out migration artifacts.

The practical application of deep learning methodologies, such as the segmentation-focused U-Net, originally intended for biomedical imaging, has expanded into geophysical tasks like salt segmentation, first break picking, diffraction recognition, and reflection-diffraction separation, as highlighted by Dumoulin and Visin (2018) as well as Markovic et al. (2022) and Zwartjes and Yoo (2022).

In our process, we apply a workflow to migrated common offset sections or pre/post-stack migrated stacks. Here, reflections represent local geology while migration artifacts exhibit a distinct upward convex hyperbolic shape. Our objective is to train a neural network that can identify these hyperbolic migration artifacts, enabling it to extract and reduce them while preserving the smooth varying background reflectivity. This strategy mirrors the approach of Fomel et al. (2007), who removed smooth reflection data using plane-wave destruction filters to separate diffractions in migrated common offset sections. The benefit of deep neural networks over these traditional filters is their superior ability to perform such tasks, assuming an adequately diverse training dataset is created. A unique aspect of our method is that we also focus on synthesizing events that networks commonly mistake as migration artifacts (or "smiles"), even when they are genuine reflections. To counter this, we incorporate additional attributes into the synthetic data that characterize migration smiles—particularly, a weak amplitude relative to reflections and an apex location tangent to the reflection. Our hypothesis suggests that a true migration smile is defined by these characteristics alongside the tell-tale upward convex shape. The amplitude and aperture of the migration smiles in our training set are randomly varied but conform to these criteria.

Traditional techniques used to differentiate between migration artifacts and true geological features can be costly and complex to parameterize. Utilizing deep learning workflows offers a simpler, faster alternative, but ensuring these networks can generalize beyond their training data remains a challenge. Traditional training methods might employ physical-based modeling followed by migration to produce migration smiles that are physically accurate, yet this strategy limits variation and therefore generalization. Such conventional modeling workflows are also computationally intense, limiting the ability to develop a diverse training set, negating the supposed speed and simplicity benefits of deep learning.

By training the neural network with hyperbolic shapes featuring a range of wavelets, amplitudes, and frequencies, we've equipped the model to handle migration smiles across various offsets. Incorporating a mix of narrow and wide hyperbolic shapes within single training samples deviates from physical realism yet positively influences network generalization. Similar strategies are used in other machine vision applications, where introducing non-physical distortions, such as blending images, geometric transformations, and random sample erasion, effectively improves the neural network's predictive capabilities on unseen data.
