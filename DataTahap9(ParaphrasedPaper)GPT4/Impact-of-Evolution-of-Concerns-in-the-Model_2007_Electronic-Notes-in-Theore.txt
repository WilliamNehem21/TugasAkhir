The principle of concern separation is critical for designing robust software and is a fundamental aspect of both Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) and Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD). AOSD and MDA techniques complement each other; AOSD typically deals with crosscutting concerns—those that affect multiple parts of a system—while MDA focuses on separating concerns related to platform independence from platform-specific details and facilitating system generation via models. This paper proposes a systematic examination of how crosscutting concerns are managed within MDA by outlining a three-step analysis. Initially, it offers a generic MDA transformation model based on concern transformation patterns, which characterize transformations and help identify core issues. Next, it details certain evolutionary scenarios aligned with selected crosscutting concerns, applied through a case study involving a versioning system developed under MDA practices. Finally, it scrutinizes the MDA model transformations with reference to the abstract model, the evolution scenarios, and the pertinent crosscutting concerns to define primary challenges associated with integrating and evolving crosscutting concerns within MDA. The paper culminates in providing recommendations for enhancing the languages and processes employed in MDA.

Moreover, the paper illustrates how MDA differentiates Platform Independent Models (PIMs) from Platform Specific Models (PSMs) and how they are transformed into code. This approach not only aids in separation but also improves systems' reusability, portability, and interoperability. However, the paper recognizes the complexity added by crosscutting concerns such as distribution, persistence, synchronization, and error detection, which are also crucial aspects handled separately by AOSD. By abstracting these crosscutting concerns into "aspects" and composing them with other system components, AOSD mitigates the complexity they introduce.

By analyzing the impact of crosscutting concerns on model transformations, the paper also highlights the importance of the order in which concerns are introduced, the expressiveness of target models, and the visibility of crosscutting in the resultant system. The findings emphasize that while each level of transformation in MDA—CIM to PIM, PIM to PSM, PSM to code—brings with it some degree of crosscutting behavior, such challenges can be better managed with well-understood concern domains and transformation processes that consider ordering semantics.

Finally, the paper suggests that an aspect modeling language for different MDA stages could help maintain separation of concerns more effectively. The nature of crosscutting varies depending on the implementation platform and the target language of transformation, indicating that crosscutting should be more finely categorized to provide deeper insights into the issue.

In conclusion, the paper presents a comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing the complexities introduced by crosscutting concerns in the MDA process, urging further integration of the principles of AOSD into MDA to improve software design quality.
