The developed algorithm can be incorporated into existing query languages, allowing for the use of non-aggregate functions. This integration simplifies the complexity of queries, leading to more efficient query processing in both computation and time. Sections III and IV of the paper detail the algorithm and provide a working example to illustrate its implementation.

The algorithm's key goal is to enhance pattern matching by shifting the search pattern by a distance greater than the pattern length itself, which is an improvement over existing methods. This increased efficiency is evident in the reduced number of movements required by the search pattern.

During the pre-processing stage, the algorithm calculates failure functions. If a mismatch occurs during the search, the algorithm employs the values of three specific attributes from the input data. These attributes immediately follow the pattern currently being aligned and are known as look-ahead elements. This strategy helps in quickly redirecting the search in the case of a mismatch, contributing to the overall efficiency of the pattern matching process.
