In the section discussing the inductive step from k to k+1, the original paper posits that a tree t_k exists for which conditions (i) through (v) labeled with subscript k are true. The objective is to demonstrate that these conditions also apply when advancing to the next level, for k+1, which would be labeled as (i)_{k+1} through (v)_{k+1}.

For Theorem 4.7, which pertains to the completeness of the system, the proof of one direction was straightforward. The proof only required the presence of first representative trees, the existence of which is assured for every finitary functor. However, proving the system's soundness—essentially, the correctness of its deductive processes—demanded more rigorous proof. This proof hinged significantly upon Propositions 4.1 and 4.6, which are instrumental for the simplified logic presented in Section 4.3. These propositions rely on the precondition that the functor in question upholds the integrity of preimages. The subsequent portion of the paper will address and validate the essential nature of this precondition for Theorem 4.7 to hold true.
