The paper discusses a computation model inspired by chemistry, where computations are likened to molecules in a solution that react according to specific rules. In these models, a multiset serves as the fundamental data structure, and computation is realized through multiset rewriting, where some elements are consumed, and new ones are produced following reaction rules. This approach was originated with Gamma in the 1980s and has since seen various other formulations like CHAM, P-systems, and higher-order models. The primary goal of the paper is to pinpoint the core calculus that distills the essence of this chemical-inspired computational paradigm, providing a foundational basis upon which other chemical computation models can be built and compared. The paper aims to delineate the underlying principles common across different chemical computation models, each with distinct features and computational capabilities.
