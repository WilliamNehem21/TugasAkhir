The paper examines the effectiveness of program animation visualizations (PAVs) in pedagogy and finds that outcomes are mixed. Hundhausen and colleagues highlight that student effort in visualization tasks matters more than the visuals themselves, while also noting the gaps in existing research.

Building upon the active use of PAVs, Naps and colleagues created an "engagement levels taxonomy" that categorizes different types of interactions with PAVs, suggesting that higher engagement correlates with better educational outcomes.

The paper is structured to first describe the conducted study, the types of papers reviewed, and their features. It then details successful case studies by engagement levels and analyzes these cases from multiple perspectives. Conclusions and future directions close the paper.

Evaluating published experiments suggests that visualization alone may not suffice for educational gains. Significant studies show that the manner in which students engage with visualizations is key. Enhanced experiences include high-quality content, interactive tools, and integrating visualization sessions into regular curriculum.

Kann and colleagues' comparative study found that significant improvements occurred only when comparing students who viewed visualizations with those who did not, in the absence of text or narrative content.

Three studies comparing response level with no viewing level show knowledge improvements, supported by additional narrative content. One study revealed better knowledge acquisition without added features.

Lawrence's research on altering animation input data versus no viewing and viewing levels found knowledge gains, with animations featuring narrative content and an additional lab session.

Urquiza-Fuentes' long-term study of the construction approach showed improvements in attitude and knowledge when compared to no viewing levels.

The paper concludes that PAVs can enhance learning, with 75% (18/24) of the case studies reporting knowledge gains, over 20% (5/24) showing improvements in attitude, and over 8% (2/24) indicating better programming skills.

The research spectrum spans various engagement levels, with "changing" being most studied (37.5%, or 9/24) and "presenting" least (12.5%, or 3/24). "Responding" accounts for 20.8% (5/24) of studies, with "viewing" and "constructing" also represented.

Encouraging students to create their own animations and narratives appears to enhance attitudes and materials engagement. Progressing from no PAVs (“no viewing level”) to incorporating PAVs (“viewing level”) can improve knowledge, especially when supplemented with quality narrative and text.

Advancing to the "constructing" level may boost both attitude and knowledge, especially when integrated with narrative content. Students should have access to well-designed interfaces or choose their own construction kits, potentially combined with the "presenting" level for greater knowledge outcomes.
