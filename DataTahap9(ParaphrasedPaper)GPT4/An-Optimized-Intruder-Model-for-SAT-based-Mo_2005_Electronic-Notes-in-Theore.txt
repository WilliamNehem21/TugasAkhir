Paraphrasing of the requested academic paper:

In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the efficiency of SAT solvers, enabling the resolution of complex problems with thousands of variables in milliseconds. This progression has catalyzed substantial progress in fields such as planning and model-checking. Building on these outcomes, previous work [1,2,3] introduced a methodology for transforming the challenge of detecting security breaches in protocols into propositional logic satisfiability issues, which can then be resolved to uncover protocol vulnerabilities. The model-checker SATMC stems from this initiative.

The paper is structured as follows:

- Section 2 introduces our modeling approach using a well-established authentication protocol as an example, highlighting an optimized model of a malicious intruder that uses axioms.
- Section 3 outlines the definition of protocol insecurity in relation to axioms.
- Section 4 describes the process of converting protocol insecurity issues with axioms into a series of propositional SAT problems.
- Section 5 presents experimental outcomes and details regarding the implementation.
- Section 6 concludes with final thoughts and a discourse on potential future research.

In terms of assumptions, the research adopts the Dolev-Yao intruder model, where an adversary can eavesdrop, reroute messages, compose and deconstruct messages, encrypt and decrypt (assuming they have the correct keys), and impersonate identities in the network. Additionally, it assumes perfect cryptography (decryption is only possible with the right key) and strong typing (agents only accept messages that are type-correct, thus avoiding type confusion).

The paper discusses a template of the NSPK protocol (referred to as nspk(a, b, ka, kb, na, nb)), consisting of roles (a and b), their public keys (ka and kb), and unique nonces (na and nb). It also provides an illustration of how a malevolent actor could exploit the protocol to deceive one participant into believing they are communicating with the intended party.

Initial conditions, or 'facts,' are defined including the state of honest agents at the start, the freshness of nonces, and the intruder's knowledge base. It notes that these initial states determine what is true or false in the network environment.

The paper further expounds on the use of labeled rewrite rules that represent the actions of both honest agents (protocol rules) and the intruder (intruder rules), which are vital for simulating the evolution of the system.

For validation, it applies the SATMC tool to analyze several known vulnerable security protocols, converting them into two sets of protocol insecurity problems. These problems model scenarios with a limited number of sessions and an adversarial presence, comparing an unoptimized Dolev-Yao intruder model to an optimized one that uses axioms instead of rules.

Lastly, two encoding strategies are implemented in SATMC for increased efficiency, which includes a linear approach as well as a more complex graphplan-based method. The encodings and the SAT solver combine to identify satisfiable formulas, which are then interpreted into attack vectors and presented to the user.
