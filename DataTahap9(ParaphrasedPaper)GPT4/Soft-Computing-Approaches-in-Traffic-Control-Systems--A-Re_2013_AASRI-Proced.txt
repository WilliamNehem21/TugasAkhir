Handling urban traffic congestion with advanced AI techniques is a crucial research field where several soft computing methods have been utilized. Key techniques include fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, Petri nets, and other methods, with multi-agent systems also playing a significant role. This study reviews these techniques to enhance modern traffic control systems.

The study is divided into six main parts. Section 2 explores the use of fuzzy logic in traffic management. Section 3 updates simulation-based methods, and Section 4 engages with cognitive and learning-based techniques. Section 5 discusses alternative approaches.

Current traffic signal systems are ineffective for managing congestion. The study proposes a three-tiered, model-based multi-agent fuzzy system. Key parameters considered include traffic density, neighboring intersection suggestions, and comprehensive data from a knowledge base. A traffic observer relays real-time data to a decision-making layer.

To decrease commuter wait times, traffic signals between adjacent intersections are synchronized. Coordination is achieved using the Recursive Modeling Method for multi-agent systems. Bayesian learning helps to refine the knowledge base and select appropriate models for other agents.

A decentralized control strategy employs local agents at each intersection as individual traffic controllers. Two models are presented: one uses a multistage online learning process for knowledge updating and decision-making, and the other employs the Perturbation Stochastic Approximation Theorem alongside fuzzy neural networks. The models' effectiveness is demonstrated using the PARAMICS simulation software.

Multi-agent systems can apply online reinforcement learning to calculate appropriate green light durations. Sensors at each intersection gather data to determine green times based on historical traffic data and input from neighboring agents, leading to a reduction in average delay times.

Traffic operators require prediction tools for making optimal control decisions based on real-time traffic conditions. The paper suggests a multi-agent simulation method that allows for an on-the-spot evaluation of traffic scenarios.

Finally, a hierarchical multi-agent system architecture is proposed, with each agent specializing in tasks like data collection, preprocessing, or decision-making. To aid inter-agent coordination, a policy management model is introduced, aiming to reduce queue lengths, waiting times, and overall travel times.
