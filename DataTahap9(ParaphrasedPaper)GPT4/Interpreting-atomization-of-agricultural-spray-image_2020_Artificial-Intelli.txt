Flat-fan and air-induction hydraulic nozzles attached to spray booms are commonly used for applying agrochemicals. These nozzles, essential for both ground-based and aerial spraying systems, create a fanning liquid sheet that eventually breaks into droplets—a process known as spray atomization.

With growing concerns over environmental protection, legal risks, and off-target impacts, the study of agrochemical spray drift has become crucial. The drop size is a critical factor in the successful delivery of chemicals to the intended target, with the final droplet size affecting both the effectiveness and risk of drift.

The paper also discusses the application of unsupervised learning techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to analyze spray patterns in multiphase emulsions. Unlike deep learning, LDA is a generative statistical model that identifies unseen groups within data, which helps explain similarities in the data. This method was first used in natural language processing.

Image data is analyzed by comparing objects within natural scenes—such as stones, mountains, and trees—to "visual words" that form the image's "vocabulary." Using various sampling methods, local image regions are clustered to create this vocabulary, then each image, akin to a document, is represented as a "bag of these visual words."

LDA is then employed to uncover topic distributions that define classes without supervision. Topic proportions can be used to create supervised models, and linear discriminant analysis is leveraged for classification. In the dataset of spray atomization videos, a division into training and testing sets led to an 85.9% accuracy in classifying video segments.

For regression tasks, feature vectors derived from the video data—specifically atomization drop size distributions represented by d10, d50, and d90 values—were used. A high R-squared value of 99.5% in a 3-fold cross-validation demonstrates the model's performance. Additionally, a deep learning regression model is mentioned for comparison.
