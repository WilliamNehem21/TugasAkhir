Theorem 4.19 suggests that you can achieve a compact representation of a step-by-step transition system 't' within the coalgebraic framework by dividing the difference hierarchy 'dif(t)' by 'd-bisimilarity'. This method offers an appealing alternative to the more traditional approach of computing a system's minimal representation. Typically, this traditional approach involves normalizing the transition system '[t]' and then taking the quotient with respect to 's-bisimilarity' to obtain the minimal form.

Despite this alternative, it is recommended that practical applications should rely on the minimal realization of '[t]' for implementing step-by-step transition systems 't'. This is because any outputs derived directly from 'dif(t)' would have to go through a reduction process in the free group to exhibit the correct behavior.

An example is provided to demonstrate the distinctions between the two approaches to getting the minimal realization of a transition system.
