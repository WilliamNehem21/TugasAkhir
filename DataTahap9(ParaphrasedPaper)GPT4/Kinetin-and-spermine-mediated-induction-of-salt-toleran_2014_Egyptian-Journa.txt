This study investigates the beneficial effects of spermine and kinetin, two exogenous phytohormones, on alleviating the harm caused by salt stress to wheat plants. Salt stress commonly reduces plant growth through its negative impact on photosynthetic pigment levels, including chlorophylls and carotenoids. This stress leads to structural changes in the chloroplasts, disrupting the organization of membranes and ultimately hindering photosynthesis. To assess the impact of phytohormones on salt stress, wheat grains were pre-treated with solutions of either hormone, alone or in combination, before being subjected to saline conditions. The results demonstrated that pre-soaking grains in either spermine or kinetin, and particularly when combined, boosted pigment production in wheat leaves under both normal and saline conditions. These treatments appeared to preserve chlorophyll, enhance chloroplast integrity, and promote starch grain accumulation within chloroplasts. Notably, exogenously applied spermine may protect photosynthetic pigments from degradation and maintain chloroplast structure, possibly by influencing endogenous polyamine levels and aiding the stability of chloroplast membranes. Moreover, kinetin treatment seemed to foster chloroplast division and ameliorate salt-induced damage to photosynthetic apparatus. Consequently, the application of exogenous kinetin, spermine, or their combined use led to the expansion of leaf area, higher pigment content, and improved photosynthetic performance in salt-stressed wheat plants. This eventually contributed to the overall growth and productivity of the plants. The study then emphasizes the potential these phytohormones hold in mitigating the adverse effects of salt stress on plant growth, underscoring their role in enhancing major agricultural crops in saline conditions.
