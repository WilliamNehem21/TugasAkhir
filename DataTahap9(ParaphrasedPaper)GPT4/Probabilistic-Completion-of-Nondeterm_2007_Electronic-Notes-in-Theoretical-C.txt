In this academic paper, we have organized the content into four sections. The introductory section provides a concise review of the categorical concepts employed and summarizes key notations. The second section offers a brief discussion on the integration of various choice theories. In the third section, we present our principal findings on how to extend arbitrary nondeterministic models by integrating suitably distributive probabilistic operations. This section also details the theoretical foundation necessary for creating the convex completions functor and examines its adjunction structure thoroughly. The concluding section illustrates methods for elevating our functors to determine posetal (partially ordered set) models.

Contrasting the traditional methodology, which constructs mixed choice models in a category C by first calculating LP (lattice polynomial) models and then incorporating distributive nondeterministic operators into these models, our alternate strategy focuses on calculating TMC (topological mixture choice) models directly from TND (topological nondeterministic) models within category C. Therefore, our approach efficiently broadens any given unconventional nondeterministic choice model in C to embrace mixed choice, thereby facilitating the construction of mixed choice models starting from TND models.
