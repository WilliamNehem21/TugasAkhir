Background and Objectives: Despite advancements in antibiotics and hospital care, mortality from spontaneous peritonitis (SP) in cirrhotic patients remains high. Spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP), often overlooked, presents a challenge for early diagnosis due to limitations in conventional culture-based detection methods. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of fungal infections in cirrhotic patients with peritonitis unresponsive to standard treatment, and its link to in-hospital mortality, via a PCR-based diagnostic approach.

Results: A significant portion of the hospitalized patients (42%) died even after receiving treatment adhering to guidelines. No substantial differences were observed between the deceased and the survivors regarding demographic, clinical, hematological, and biochemical data. Notably, the occurrence of fungal infections was markedly higher in the group that did not survive (30% vs. 0%, p=0.0012). These infections were strongly associated with resistance to drugs used for treating SP (p=0.007). All fungal infections were identified using PCR, with only 57% detectable by culture, suggesting the superior sensitivity of PCR.

Antibiotic resistance, specifically to third-generation cephalosporins, is a known primary cause of SP mortality. This is evident from higher death rates in patients with cephalosporin-resistant infections. Mechanisms for antibiotic resistance include the rise of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and concurrent fungal infections. Candida albicans, the most frequently identified fungus in ascitic fluid, often serves as an agent of SP. However, distinguishing SFP from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is difficult based on symptoms and early culture-based diagnosis is challenging.

Such challenges underscore the need for precise early detection of SFP. Recent diagnostic advancements, such as assays for fungal cell wall components and PCR for fungal DNA, could improve detection and raise clinical awareness of SFP. Yet, studies evaluating these techniques in cirrhotic patients are limited.

In this study, data on fungal infections' prevalence were gathered using a PCR-based method in cirrhotic patients with peritonitis not responding to antibiotic therapy. The goal was to better understand SFP's clinical characteristics and prognosis in these patients.

Patient Evaluation Methods: Blood and ascitic fluid were sampled and tested for various parameters, including liver function indicators, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, using commercial kits. PCR procedures included a blank reagent control, and the amplification products were analyzed via gel electrophoresis.

Conclusion: This study suggests a need to focus on patients with SFP and compare their clinical outcomes with those having other types of ascites-related infections. A substantial number of cases were culture-negative, showing high white blood cell counts without bacterial growth in cultures. However, a PCR-based approach has the potential to improve SFP diagnosis in this patient group, potentially impacting their treatment and survival.
