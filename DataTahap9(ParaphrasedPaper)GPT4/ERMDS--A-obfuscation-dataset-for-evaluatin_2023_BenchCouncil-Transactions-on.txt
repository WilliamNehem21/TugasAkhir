The paper introduces the ERMDs dataset, a new resource created to address the challenge of assessing the robustness of Lightweight Binary Malware Detection Systems (LB-MDs) against diverse and evolving malware features. By utilizing an array of obfuscation techniques spread across three obfuscation spaces—binary, source code, and packing—the dataset generates a theoretically infinite number of malware variations, presenting more realistic and diverse threat scenarios than previous datasets.

Despite the growing complexity of malware, traditional signature-based detection is becoming less effective, pushing commercial antivirus providers towards integrating machine learning algorithms to enhance detection accuracy. ERMDs is designed to offer a wide variety of model-agnostic adversarial examples to replicate real-world conditions, rather than simply focusing on worst-case scenarios, making it a more effective tool for gauging the resilience of malware detectors.

In contrast to other datasets like BODMAS, which are limited in scope and fail to represent the latest malware features, ERMDs includes samples collected recently and provides a broader perspective on threats. Obfuscation techniques such as variable splitting are shared as examples of the dataset's capabilities in complicating program analysis, highlighting the complexity of the adversarial samples it can produce.

The findings demonstrate that using ERMDs significantly reduces the accuracy of both LB-MDs and commercial antivirus software, which confirms its effectiveness in challenging the current malware detection strategies. Moreover, it suggests that commercial antivirus software may require dynamic detection methods, especially in confronting packed malware, since static detection methods struggle with encrypted content that hides malicious features.

In future work, the researchers plan to expand the adversarial sample generation methods beyond obfuscation, incorporating additional techniques like those used in DeepMal, which can deceive CNN-based malware detection systems by introducing minor but critical changes to malware code. They aim to develop the EDMDR dataset further by incorporating these new attack methodologies to bolster its utility in evaluating malware detection robustness.
