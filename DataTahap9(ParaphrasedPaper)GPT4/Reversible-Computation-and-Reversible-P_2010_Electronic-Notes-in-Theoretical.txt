The paper discusses a reversible programming language known as Janus, which supports deterministic computation in both forward and backward directions. Unlike traditional computing models, which lose information at each step, reversible computing retains all past information, which is a principle based on Landauer's theory that any irreversible computation can be converted into a reversible one with enough memory to record computation history. 

The paper presents a Janus procedure to compute Fibonacci pairs, illustrating how reversible assignment works, with constraints on variable usage to ensure reversibility. Additionally, parameters in Janus functions are passed by reference, prohibiting aliasing where the same reference is passed to multiple parameters to avoid issues.

An important aspect of reversible languages highlighted in the paper is the concept of inverting inputs and outputs for reversible constructs, which is seen as a promising semantic technique. The paper also touches on the methodology specific to reversible programming, such as the ability to create a reversible Janus interpreter, which can form a hierarchy of self-interpreting programs that are reversible.

The article briefly references foundational work and studies in reversible computing across various models and systems, from reversible Turing machines to reversible Boolean logic circuits. Moreover, it relates reversible programming languages to the concept of program inversion, where semi-inversed programs can be generated to determine missing inputs or outputs, as well as to bidirectional languages, which are designed for managing updates in database views.
