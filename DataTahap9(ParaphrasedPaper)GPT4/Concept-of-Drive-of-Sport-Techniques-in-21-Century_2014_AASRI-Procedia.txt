Contemporary sports machinery such as cars, motorcycles, and bicycles incorporate transmissions with a controlled and variable transfer ratio to enable motion. These transmissions adjust the speed according to the external load, and modern variants may possess up to 45 discrete ratios. Within each step, the transfer ratio remains fixed, and movement speed is modulated by altering engine output. However, to reach the peak movement speed, optimal management of step shifting and engine thrust is crucial.

Often, step switching control—whether manual or automatic—is suboptimal, with shifts occurring too early or too late compared to the ideal timing that matches engine power output. Thus, achieving top movement speed heavily depends on the driver's skill level, although even extensive experience does not guarantee the best possible results.

Gear systems with teeth are known for their reliability and longevity but they do not offer a seamless transition between ratios. While automatic transmissions can shift steps automatically, they do not optimize this process. Moreover, they are too heavy and bulky to fit onto lighter vehicles like motorcycles or bicycles.

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive gear transmission based on a gear differential mechanism with a closed-loop design as an optimal control alternative for sports transport. This adaptive gear setup independently adjusts the vehicle speed to counteract movement resistance continuously and without the need for a control system, leading to maximum speed attainment. By excluding manual control, it eliminates subjective decision-making and ideally adapts to changing movement conditions.

The paper also includes interactive content: by pressing the 'W' key, readers can observe the movement of cogwheels under increasing external load, and by pressing the 'Q' key, they can see the cogwheel motion with diminishing external load. Despite the constant engine shaft rotation speed, the output shaft speed varies with the load.
