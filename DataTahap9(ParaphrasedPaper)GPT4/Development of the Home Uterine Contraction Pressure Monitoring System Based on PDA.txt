A new home monitoring system for tracking uterine contractions in pregnant women has been developed to simplify periodic check-ups at the hospital. The system is composed of a unit for collecting uterine contraction pressure signals, a wireless transmission unit, and a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) module. This setup is based on the MCU (Microcontroller Unit) chip, specifically the dsPIC33FJ128MC706. The contraction pressure is measured using a Honeywell load cell sensor, the FSL1500N2C, which allows for the data to be wirelessly sent to a PDA via Bluetooth technology. On the PDA, the signals are analyzed in real-time, which enables the early diagnosis of premature labor or the risk of miscarriage, aiming to effectively prevent these occurrences.

Monitoring uterine contractions is of utmost importance because they play a critical role in cases of premature labor and the threat of miscarriage. Early detection of uterine contractions indicative of these conditions is crucial for timely intervention. The advancements in wireless and communication technology in recent years have significantly propelled the field of medical instrument signal transmission and processing forward.
