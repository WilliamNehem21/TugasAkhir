The paper discusses the challenge of efficiently processing and summarizing the vast amounts of textual information available due to the advancement of computer technologies. Text summarization techniques, including statistical methods, graph sorting, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, have been developed to condense text effectively, but they often struggle with semantic richness and redundancy.

To overcome these issues, the authors introduce a novel model called Multi-Features Maximal Marginal Relevance BERT (MFMMR-BERTSum) for extractive summarization. This model leverages the popular pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, renowned for its excellent language understanding capabilities, and introduces a classification layer specifically for summarization. Additionally, they incorporate a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm to minimize information redundancy, thus optimizing the summary output.

Empirical testing on the CNN/DailyMail dataset demonstrates that the MFMMR-BERTSum model outperforms standard sentence-level summarization methods, establishing its effectiveness in producing coherent and concise summaries. The paper also suggests that hybrid models, combining extractive and abstractive summarization, show promising potential for future research and applications in the field.
