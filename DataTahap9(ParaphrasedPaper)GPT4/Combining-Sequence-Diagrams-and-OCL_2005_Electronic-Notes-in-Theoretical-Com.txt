This academic paper discusses Live Sequence Charts (LSCs), which are a formalism used to model the behavior of systems, including their possible, mandatory, and forbidden behaviors. LSCs can capture both scenarios that a system should exhibit (positive scenarios) and those it should avoid (anti-scenarios). The paper focuses on basic LSCs that incorporate assignments, conditions, subcharts, and forbidden elements, without considering advanced features like time, symbolic instances, and classes. Information on LSCs and their implementation in the Play Engine tool is available elsewhere.

The paper explains synchronization mechanisms in LSCs, such as the coordination between a prechart and a main chart, and within subcharts. It also discusses how events and conditions within an LSC are not necessarily ordered, but synchronization can occur when multiple instances must evaluate a condition before progressing.

Anti-scenarios are defined in LSCs using universal charts, where executing the unwanted scenario leads to the evaluation of a hot condition that is guaranteed to fail, indicating a violation.

Communication between instances in LSCs occurs through messages, characterized by sender and receiver events. These events are arranged in sequence, respecting the order within individual components while allowing for flexibility across different lifelines from different components.

The paper points out ambiguities and inconsistencies in the description of operators like 'alt' and 'neg' and suggests the introduction of new operators in UML 2.0 to better capture anti-scenarios, akin to LSCs.

An example interaction diagram illustrates how messages and condition evaluation guide the permissible sequence of events in the system. The paper also touches on Object Constraint Language (OCL) 2.0 and its use of message expressions.

The paper further addresses liveness constraints, which are conditions that must be met at specific points in an instance's lifeline. These include message events, conditions, assignments, and state invariants. It emphasizes the importance of synchronization when entering or exiting interaction fragments.

The paper concludes by describing constraints that manage the sequence of events, such as preconditions for entering assert fragments and the requirement that certain messages be received before an instance can enter a particular state. It offers approaches like using OCL or enclosing messages and state invariants within strict combined fragments to handle these constraints.
