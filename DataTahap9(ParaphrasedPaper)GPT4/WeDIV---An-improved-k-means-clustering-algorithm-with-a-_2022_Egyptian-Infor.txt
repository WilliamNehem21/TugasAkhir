This study presents an enhanced k-means clustering algorithm that incorporates a weighted distance measure, EP Dis, balancing the contributions of Euclidean and Pearson distances. The method captures global spatial correlation and local variation trends in high-dimensional data. Additionally, the study introduces a novel internal validation index, WEDIV, drawing inspiration from the Calinski-Harabasz index and analysis of variance, to automatically ascertain the optimal cluster count. Testing on simulated datasets validated the reliability of EP Dis mathematically and the effectiveness of the RCH index for determining cluster numbers.

Four simulated datasets with various characteristics were employed to evaluate RCH, and the performance of WEDIV was benchmarked against 12 existing clustering algorithms on 16 UCI datasets, showing superior performance whether or not cluster numbers were predefined.

The paper also reviews other approaches in clustering, like robust clustering algorithms that automatically determine cluster numbers (e.g., X-means, R-EM, and C-FS) and algorithms introducing new distance metrics (e.g., AHCM, AFCM, KM-M+, and IMWK-means). Each has its benefits and challenges, such as dealing with initialization issues or selecting proper parameters.

WEDIV uses a weight parameter, W, within the range [0, 1], with a smaller EP Dis indicating greater similarity. When W equals 1, EP Dis matches the Euclidean distance; when W equals 0, it represents the Pearson distance.

The study underscores the superiority of the CH index in cluster estimation from a comprehensive comparison of 30 internal validation indices.
