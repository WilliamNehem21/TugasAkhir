Identifying a potential rule requires verification that any initial configuration set against an array of zeros either contracts to extinction or expands indefinitely, ultimately populating the space with a uniform layer of ones or a less dense, repeating motif of ones. Our investigations have yielded a number of rules that, based on empirical evidence, seem to possess these characteristics. Nonetheless, we remain uncertain as to whether these rules truly exemplify the described behavior.
