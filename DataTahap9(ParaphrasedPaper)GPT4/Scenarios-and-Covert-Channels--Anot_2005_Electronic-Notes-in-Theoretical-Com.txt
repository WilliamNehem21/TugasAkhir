This paper discusses the risks posed by covert channels within information systems, including security breaches, economic concerns, and performance degradation. It examines the concept of non-interference in a system, whereby tight controls prevent information from being accessed or transmitted between varying security levels.

The paper introduces a game-theoretic model to describe and analyze covert channels, where the information system's users and protocols are treated as opposing players in a game. Covert channel users attempt to secretly pass on information, while the protocol tries to prevent this from happening. It elaborates on strategies for transmission of data through covert channels and how to calculate zones within a model where covert channels may successfully or unsuccessfully transmit data.

The document progresses to describe an algorithm for defining "winning zones", which are conditions under which covert channels can either pass on data without being detected or be prevented from doing so by the protocol. It outlines a specific strategy that leverages such winning zones to ensure data encoding nodes are utilized effectively.

The paper also discusses the concept of maximal winning strategies for creating and managing covert channels. These strategies are crucial in determining how states are visited within a model, impacting the effectiveness and efficiency of covert communication.

In conclusion, the study touches on the complexity of determining an optimal strategy for covert channel operation and suggests that an approach based on the study of positional strategies could lead to more efficient outcomes. It hints at ongoing research using information theory to understand the capacity of noisy covert channels, highlighting the challenge of variable encoding times in asynchronous systems and suggesting that a more cost-effective strategy may be uncovered by focusing on the set of visited nodes instead of their visitation sequence.
