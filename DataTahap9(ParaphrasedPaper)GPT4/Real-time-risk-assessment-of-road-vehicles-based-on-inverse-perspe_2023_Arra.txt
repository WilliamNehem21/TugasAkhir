Smart traffic monitoring systems are increasingly being implemented in various traffic environments such as highways, urban streets, and bridges, thanks to advancements in technologies like pattern recognition, video processing, and networking. However, they face challenges in complex traffic conditions and various weather scenarios.

Despite the benefits of these systems, their analytical methods are typically reactive and can't quickly adapt to unexpected traffic events. This paper introduces a novel real-time method for assessing vehicle risk using camera inverse perspective mapping to better handle complex traffic situations. This involves calibrating cameras and applying inverse perspective transformations to determine vehicle positions from camera images projected onto the road surface. Vehicle risk is then assessed in real-time by analyzing velocities and distances over multiple frames, offering a more proactive approach to traffic monitoring.

This research discusses essential traffic elements: flow rate, speed, and density. Flow rate is the number of vehicles passing a point in a given time; speed is divided into spot and section speeds (instantaneous and average over a distance, respectively); density measures the number of vehicles per road length. Speed is evaluated by averaging instantaneous speeds over multiple frames, then compared with the actual driving speed for accuracy.

Road safety is assessed by combining vehicle risks across road segments. For instance, when objects are left on roads, drivers react to avoid them, often reducing speed sharply. These reactions are visible in vehicle trajectories and risk statistics, which highlight safety concerns and allow for real-time monitoring and forecasting.

Advanced detection algorithms, like YOLO for deep learning and optical flow for tracking, enhance the detection and calibration processes. These methods are accurately applied to traffic scenes by adjusting focal length until calibration errors are minimized, thus providing a foundation for traffic control and monitoring.

The paper also notes that a single camera's field of view is limited to roughly 200 meters. For more comprehensive risk monitoring, it's necessary to link vehicle trajectories across multiple cameras for a complete safety assessment. This real-time monitoring and predictive ability could help traffic authorities develop more informed and effective strategies to prevent accidents.
