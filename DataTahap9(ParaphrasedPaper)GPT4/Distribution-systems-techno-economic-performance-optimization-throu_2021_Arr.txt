The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) draws inspiration from the unique hunting methods of humpback whales. These intelligent marine mammals generally hunt smaller fish close to the ocean's surface using a sophisticated technique known as bubble net feeding, where they create bubbles in circular or '9'-shaped patterns around their prey.

In WOA, the movement of whales is mimicked through a 50% chance of employing either a shrinking encircling system or a spiral movement to adjust the positions of the whales, analogous to adjusting the variables in an optimization problem such as type, location, size, and operating power. The best solution so far is considered the target prey, and other search agents (whales) update their positions towards it. WOA simulates whale behavior in three phases: encircling prey, bubble-net feeding in a spiral pattern, and searching for new prey.

Seyedali M. and colleagues developed the Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), a separate optimization algorithm based on the Big Bang theory of cosmology and the concept of multiple universes. Each universe could potentially have different physical laws, and these universes may interact or collide as described by multiverse theory. MVO's simulation includes wormholes that function as conduits for object exchange within or between universes, using a roulette wheel process to construct these tunnels based on travel distance and wormhole probability.

Voltage stability is a crucial aspect in the study of electrical distribution systems. This paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining voltage stability to avoid system collapse due to fluctuations in power generation.

The IEEE 118-bus system, a complex power system comprising 118 buses, 54 generators, and 186 branches, was chosen for case studies to test the proposed optimization techniques on a larger scale. This system, with substantial active and reactive loads, illustrates the application of these techniques to sophisticated networks.

Different Distributed Generator (DG) types were examined using three optimization algorithms (WOA, MVO, and SCA) in various case studies. The optimal operating power factor for the third and fourth types of DGs was also determined. Results from WOA, MVO, and SCA were compared, revealing that MVO performed best in terms of the objective function (OF) values across the three networks studied. Additionally, the results from MVO and WOA were symmetrical in the IEEE 33-bus network case study, and results from MVO and SCA showed congruence in the realistic system scenario.
