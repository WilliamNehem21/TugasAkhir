This academic paper discusses teaching strategies and online educational theory with respect to online courses. To effectively convey factual knowledge in the course, behavioral strategies are employed, demonstrating formulas, algorithms, or mathematical expressions relevant to the course material. For teaching processes or procedural knowledge, cognitivist strategies are adopted, guiding learners on the steps necessary for developing and applying numerical methods covered in the course. Constructivist strategies, on the other hand, are aimed at fostering higher-level critical thinking skills.

The paper also highlights three fundamental functions of a robust online educational theory. Firstly, it enables the exploration of new conceptual realms, broadening the learner's intellectual horizon. Secondly, a sound theory should facilitate practical application, meaning that it should aid in the practical implementation of methodological suggestions. Lastly, a valid theory should be able to guide the creation of honest academic work.

Furthermore, the paper underscores the flexibility of online courses in comparison to traditional campus education; they are not restricted by time and space. The internet enhances the accessibility of educational content, improving both the quality and quantity of materials available to learners. The paper recognizes that asynchronous interaction, which is prevalent in text-based online environments, is a defining characteristic of online education. It concludes by emphasizing the need for a theory of online education that prepares educators to make informed decisions about which technological tools are best suited for their teaching goals.
