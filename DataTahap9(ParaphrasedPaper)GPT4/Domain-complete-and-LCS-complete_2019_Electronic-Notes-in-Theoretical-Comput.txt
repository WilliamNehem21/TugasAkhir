The proof of our result has been postponed to Section 18, where we establish the measure extension theorem for a category of spaces that includes both the continuous directed complete partial orders (dcpos) from domain theory and the Polish spaces from topological measure theory. We have named these spaces LCS-complete, acknowledging that this may not be the ideal term. While 'topologically complete' would have been more suitable, unfortunately, this term is already in use.

We define a space as a continuous complete quasi-metric space if its associated function space, B(X, D), forms a continuous dcpo. It's important to note that this was originally a proven theorem, not a definition, with the more intricate original formulation credited to Mateusz Kostanek and Paweł Waszkiewicz.

We reference a theorem used by Keimel and Lawson, which is originally due to Wilker, establishing that every KT4 space—a space in which all compact subspaces satisfy the T4 separation axiom—is a Wilker space. This implies that every Hausdorff space is also a Wilker space.

A space is defined as completely Baire if all its closed subspaces have the Baire property. This condition is a more stringent requirement than simply possessing the Baire property. Proposition 10.3, along with Corollary 10.1, lead to a broader principle. This principle expands upon the notion that every quasi-Polish space is completely Baire, as noted at the start of Section 5 in reference [8].
