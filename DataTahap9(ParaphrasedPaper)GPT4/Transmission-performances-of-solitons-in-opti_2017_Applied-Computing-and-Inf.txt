Chaotic signal generation using microring resonators (MRRs) is an area of study that has gained interest due to the ability to produce wide bandwidth and high-speed pulses, which are beneficial for optical communications. In this work, two Gaussian beams, each with a 1.5 Âµm spectral profile and 600 mW power, are introduced into an MRR system. By exploiting nonlinear conditions within the MRRs, chaotic signals are generated and can travel through the ring medium. The research demonstrates that these chaotic signals can be manipulated by adding an extra Gaussian source into the system's add port. To create effective soliton pulses, which are known for their self-reinforcing solitary wave properties, there must be a careful balance between the dispersion and nonlinear effects in the propagation medium.

The study shows that chaotic outputs from the MRR can be transformed into logic codes, which are then transmitted through an optical fiber link stretching 180 km. Such a system could achieve high data-rate transmission over both short and long distances. Thanks to the soliton pulses' resistance to attenuation, they are preferable over traditional laser pulses for transmission. The transmitted signals, maintained as spatial and temporal solitons, are detectable at the end of the fiber link.

Overall, this paper focuses on the generation and control of chaotic signals in MRRs, their application in creating soliton pulses for optical communication, and the superior performance of these pulses in long-distance transmission compared to conventional laser pulses. It demonstrates that the MRR system can effectively shape soliton signals, which are important for various optical communication applications, and emphasizes that soliton pulses with a narrower Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) can enhance system performance.
