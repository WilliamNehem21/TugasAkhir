The paper proposes modeling bisimulation using coalgebra maps connected by spans, a method originally utilized in earlier research. These models operate under certain conditions, which if met, assure that the semantics derived from the final coalgebra are fully abstract. Furthermore, the largest bisimulation which also serves as a congruence is identified under the stipulation that kernel pairs are formed and weak kernel pairs retain their structure under certain transformations.

Alternatively, the paper suggests forming a general theory applicable to locally ordered categories, particularly those enriched by cppo structures. Within this framework, the author defines simulations or ordered bisimulations through spans that include both lax and oplax coalgebra maps. This approach encompasses partial bisimulations, often termed prebisimulations, expanding the original theory. However, this modified theory necessitates the existence of insertors and the preservation of weak insertors, a condition that, regrettably, is not universally upheld.

Looking ahead, the paper identifies significant opportunities for future research, such as integrating recursion with value-passing mechanisms, a concept explored in previous studies. One immediate focus could be the exploration of additional computational models beyond GSOS, with the paper highlighting probabilistic computation as a particularly challenging field due to its dependency on continuous domain theories.
