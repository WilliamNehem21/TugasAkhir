In this research, we address the challenge of recovering a set of real objects in a two-dimensional space, after they've undergone rigid transformations, ensuring that their digital representation in a grid (Z^n) remains unchanged. This issue is relevant in medical imaging, specifically in cancer therapy where the goal is to target a tumor with radiation. Dosimetry methods are used to determine the necessary energy level of the radiation beam to effectively treat the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. Multi-leaf collimators shape the beam to match the tumor's profile.

Our approach involves applying a previously described algorithm to manipulate the object's edges. As we apply the transformation T to the edges of a starting polygon, we calculate a feasible region R_i and its parameters post-transformation. These modified edges align with points (a_i, b_i) in the parameter space defined by axes a and b. The transformation T is deemed acceptable if and only if each point (a_i, b_i) lies within its corresponding feasible region R_i.

Looking ahead, we could expand this methodology to accommodate general curved objects by approximating their shapes with internal and external polygonal lines. A further area of study could investigate the application of these concepts to three-dimensional objects, focusing on polyhedral shapes.
