This academic work posits that while infrared spectroscopy can identify specific absorption patterns associated with different chemical bonds under controlled conditions, real-world soil analysis is more complex. This complexity arises when soil components like potassium exchangeable (Kex) are present in lower concentrations and are detected by their association with predominant soil components. Research thus focuses on several key areas: developing accurate models by selecting significant wavenumbers, improving understanding of model outputs, enhancing knowledge of soil processes, and increasing user trust in machine learning technologies for tasks such as radioactive decontamination in agriculture.

The study evaluates models that can predict Kex levels in soil using a vast MIR spectral library, aiming for accuracy in nuclear remediation efforts. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) is a baseline, with the goal to see how domain experts can use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) interpretability algorithms to gain insights into soil processes and make informed remediation decisions.

The robustness of PLSR and CNN models is appraised, and potential issues caused by small sample sizes in soil orders like Oxisols, Vertisols, Gelisols, and Histosols are addressed. The models are tested across randomly split datasets to determine performance baselines.

Metrics including the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) and Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) gauge the models' success, alongside the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). These help understand the predictions, especially given the skewed distribution of Kex values.

The study employs the GradientSHAP interpretability algorithm to identify important spectral features, correlating these across different soil orders and improving the understanding of the prediction models.

Results show that with datasets of less than 5,000 samples, both PLSR and CNN models have limited success, but at 10,000 samples, CNN models improve significantly, not seen with PLSR. Notably, the performance varies across soil orders, with Mollisols performing best, likely due to high representation in the dataset.

The study finds that machine learning algorithms, such as those using MIR spectroscopy data preprocessed by Standard Normal Variate (SNV), focus on spectra deformation patterns to estimate values. The differences in GradientSHAP correlations between soil orders suggest varied algorithm learning across spectrums.

Analysis indicates that, while Mollisols and Alfisols drive validation loss improvements, other soil orders, such as Gelisols, Spodosols, and Ultisols, do not improve after a certain point in training, suggesting a need for training adjustments.

The debate on stratifying MIR spectroscopy modeling by soil taxonomy continues, but this research suggests that pooling data from all soil orders can be advantageous, though not uniformly across all soil types. The findings advocate for tailored analyses for predicting other important soil properties as well.
