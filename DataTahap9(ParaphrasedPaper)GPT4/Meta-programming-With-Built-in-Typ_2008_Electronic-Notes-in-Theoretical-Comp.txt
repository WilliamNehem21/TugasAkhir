This example showcases transformations that maintain the original type of language structure during the conversion of programs within a programming language. The rest of the paper will focus on developing substitution as a specific form of this transformation. Additionally, a properly executed substitution mechanism can be the foundation for creating additional program conversions. The paper will present an implementation of comprehensive operational semantics that relies on substitution for its operation.
