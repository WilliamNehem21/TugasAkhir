The field of smart grids is receiving considerable research attention with major players like the European Union, the United States, China, and Taiwan developing smart grid architectures centered around smart meters and testing them through pilot projects. Literature has highlighted various aspects significant for smart grid development, with Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) being identified as a critical foundational element for their evolution, as it facilitates automated data measurement and management relating to energy usage.

Smart grids leverage AMI for enabling bidirectional communication between consumers and energy providers. Utilizing smart meters allows providers to modify pricing dynamically to influence energy usage during peak hours. Despite this, strategies for effectively managing appliance consumption remain underexplored. Some researchers have suggested centralizing control through a smart device within the home network to manage all appliances, but this may neglect individual appliance characteristics, leading to suboptimal energy usage decisions. Addressing this concern, this paper introduces a distributed and more nuanced approach that draws upon the concept of intelligent products to inform system design.

Intelligent products integrate knowledge from two sources: theoretical perspectives and frameworks in the field, plus practical insights derived from developing and testing an architecture for intelligent products. Using this dual knowledge base, intelligent products are defined as physical items with a digital informational counterpart stored in databases and equipped with an autonomous decision-making agent, often linked to the physical product via sensors.

This paper extends the intelligent products concept to electrical devices, creating "smart devices" that have dedicated decision-making agents controlling their power consumption. Agents operate on three levels of intelligence—information handling, problem detection, and decision making—as proposed by Meyer et al. Agents use a utility function considering device-specific parameters, owner's constraints, and current energy prices to decide on power use, balancing urgency against cost.

The paper describes a generic system enabling devices to autonomously manage their power usage and illustrates its application and potential through scenarios involving home appliances and electric vehicles in a parking lot. To validate the system's practicality and assess its effectiveness, the authors are developing a prototype for experimental and simulation work. Future research aims to refine the decision-making capabilities of the agents, potentially allowing negotiations between devices regarding their energy consumption.
