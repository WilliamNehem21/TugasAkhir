This academic paper discusses the collaboration between Motorola Inc. and CIN-UFPE, acknowledging the support and feedback received from colleagues and Joabe Jesus for tool development. The work explores the CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) formalism, used for modeling the concurrent and dynamic aspects of computer systems, and highlights the ability to prove system properties and refinements with the FDR (Failure Divergence Refinement) checker. The paper identifies CSP's lack of graphical representation as a barrier for non-specialists, making it error-prone and challenging during the design phase.

Graphical modeling is contrasted with CSP, with UML (Unified Modeling Language) and ROOM (Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling) emphasized for their structure and visualization advantages, although they fall short in formal reasoning support. Initiatives to formalize UML with CSP, Z, and Circus are mentioned, though limited in coverage.

UML-RT (UML for Real-Time Systems) is introduced as an extension of UML, drawing from ROOM concepts, accommodating real-time, event-driven systems through elements like 'capsules' and communication protocols. These capsules interact via ports using both synchronous and asynchronous messaging, with protocols defining the message types and order.

The paper provides an overview of CSP and UML-RT, and then establishes a translation strategy from CSP specifications to UML-RT models, focusing on incremental concreteness while maintaining a formal basis. The translation involves mapping CSP processes into UML-RT capsules and protocols while also accounting for practical considerations such as environmental interactions and control flow.

The paper culminates by discussing the benefits of the proposed translation rules in creating more intuitive, diagrammatic representations of concurrent systems and facilitating code generation. The shortcomings of UML's ambiguities are acknowledged, motivating the use of UML-RT over UML 2. Future work on formal proofs and adaptations to UML 2 are anticipated, with the intent to streamline representation and improve existing methodologies.
