The academic paper discusses the category Z which includes two familiar versions of the innocent arena game model: the well-bracketed and the non-well-bracketed types. It describes how there are two specific structure-preserving functors, named F and G. Functor F is used for mapping the category consisting of arena games and well-bracketed innocent strategies into category Z, while functor G does the same for the category with non-well-bracketed innocent strategies. The main distinction between functors F and G lies in their respective characteristics.

In the acknowledgments, the authors acknowledge that a significant portion of Section 3 was a collaborative effort with Peter Selinger in the winter of 2000-2001. They also mention that Robin Cockett and Robert Seely have explored similar research themes concerning polarized categories and modules. The authors express an interest in understanding the relationship between Cockett and Seely's research and the findings presented in their own work.
