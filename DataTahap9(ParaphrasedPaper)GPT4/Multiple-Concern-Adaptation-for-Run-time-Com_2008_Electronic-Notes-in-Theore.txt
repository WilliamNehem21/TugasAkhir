The paper discusses the importance of context-aware computing in mobile systems and pervasive computing environments, where it is critical to consider context information, such as user location, network resources, and time, for system functionality. The authors address the challenges of composing systems from pre-existing software components, known as COTS, and the need for adaptive composition to ensure interoperability and the ability to handle runtime environmental changes that can affect component behavior.

The proposed approach focuses on the dynamic composition of behavioral interfaces, which may not initially match, in systems that must respond to changes in context information during execution. The method emphasizes real-time composition adjustments based on context shifts and simplifies the specification of these changes by maintaining a separation of concerns, allowing the system to handle context-triggered adaptation policies efficiently.

To enable interoperability between mismatched software components, the field of software adaptation employs adaptors, which are generated from an abstract specification that describes how to resolve interface mismatches based on the components' interfaces' behavioral protocols. This ensures the correctness and termination of interactions between components. This is particularly important in mobile and pervasive computing, where execution conditions can rapidly change.

The paper presents a new way to flexibly interact with multiple components depending on the system's execution state. This includes handling component incompatibilities and adapting to changing environmental conditions in real-time. The approach builds on existing research in runtime composition and adaptation, enhancing it by avoiding the full adaptor generation and allowing for recomputation when system changes occur (e.g., adding a new service).

The authors propose an incremental mapping specification process that handles different concerns in the composition. This involves breaking down the adaptation into multiple context facets, with transitions between states triggered by messages or signals within a vector. An informed search algorithm like A* is utilized to efficiently identify potential solutions, using a heuristic function that guarantees optimal solutions if they exist.

In the event of a potential deadlock, the runtime composition checks the component states and selects an appropriate vector that could lead to a correct global termination state. This processing involves receiving emissions, updating component states, and matching vector expressions with the current context facets to reflect environmental signals.

The paper highlights the need for developing systems that can manage the composition and adaptation of software entities within a context-aware environment. The authors envision implementing the proposal as a composition engine using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). AOP allows systems to be modified without changing the base code by specifying aspects separately. These aspects are then woven into the base code at various development stages, including runtime, allowing for dynamic adjustments to be applied transparently to the system.
