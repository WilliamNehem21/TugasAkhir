The paper describes improvements in the simulation of certain processes by employing efficient data structures to generate events. An optimised dependency manager (DM) uses a dependency graph to reduce unnecessary rate recalculations.

The authors implemented a technique referred to as "k-skip," setting the error parameter to the smallest value (0.01) used in the original study, aiming to compare results. One point noted is the use of a single random number to generate a full trajectory, which wasn’t thoroughly addressed in the original paper.

The paper is structured as follows: introductory concepts in section 2, theoretical details in sections 3 and 4, implementation issues in section 5, experimental results in section 6, and conclusions in section 7.

The authors’ method estimates individual transition durations within a trajectory, contrasting with the "k-skip" which estimates the duration of "k" transitions combined. Despite "k-skip's" better performance prospect, the new method provides detailed trajectories comparable to original Markov chains, boasting efficiency by generating fewer random numbers.

A popular random number generator, the Mersenne Twister (MT), known for high-quality random number generation and performance, was utilized in Java alongside open-source libraries (Apache Commons, CERN Colt, James II, and SSJ) to implement the authors' algorithm.

Experiments conducted on two bio-chemical models showed the new method (referred to as TSS) to be approximately 15-20% faster than the original DM. Notably, setting "p" to 0.1 in the geometric distribution was nearly as efficient as using "p" = 1, suggesting no need to increase "p" beyond 0.1.

Efficiency comparisons showed "k-skip" to be more efficient than TSS due to its approach of sampling from a gamma distribution to determine durations. However, the "k-skip" speedups were not as substantial as expected, attributed to using the MT generator, which is more efficient than the "ran2" algorithm used in the referenced Cai & Wen paper.

In simulating two different bio-chemical models, the proposed method demonstrated to be faster than OD by 15-20% with negligible errors. While "k-skip" showed greater efficiency, it sometimes sacrificed accuracy, positioning TSS as a preferable alternative in scenarios where "k-skip" may be inappropriate.
