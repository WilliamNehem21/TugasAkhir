This academic paper discusses the expansion of a strict intersection type assignment system, ensuring that lambda terms typable in the original system retain their types when translated to x-nets. The expanded system incorporates intersection, union types, and the type constant 't' to the basic implicative system used for classical logic. The paper outlines two primary findings: the enhanced type assignment system is stable under both subject-reduction and subject-expansion.

In this work, the authors introduce an intersection type assignment for x, augmenting the basic system with more complex type constructs. Future research directions include integrating this type assignment notion with existing systems cited in the literature. This integration aims to explore issues related to termination, semantics, and the approximation properties of the system.
