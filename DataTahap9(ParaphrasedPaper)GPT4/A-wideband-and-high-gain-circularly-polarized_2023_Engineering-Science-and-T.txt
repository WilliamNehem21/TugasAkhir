The study highlights an antenna array that exhibits impressive performance in terms of impedance bandwidth, encompassing 61.9% within the frequency range of 3.17 to 6.01 GHz, and axial ratio (AR) bandwidth, covering 40.2% between 4.01 and 6.03 GHz for two circularly polarized (CP) states. The peak gain recorded is 11.68 dBic.

Traditional technologies aiming to improve antenna bandwidth often lead to increased antenna size, presenting a limitation. The research paper proposes a novel design approach that leverages Spoof Surface Plasmon Polariton (SSPP) technology, an emerging interest in the field of microwaves. SSPPs are particular electromagnetic waves that travel along a textured metallic surface, in this case, via two chamfered triangles with one triangle connecting to the rest of the polygonal structure. The antenna's critical dimensions are provided: L1= 40 mm, D1= 20 mm, D2= 10.7 mm, D3= 9.3 mm, D4= 0.7 mm, H1= 42.6% with a frequency range of 3.45 to 4.48 GHz and 4.68 to 5.57 GHz. The antenna maintains a peak gain of 11.68 dBic.

The antenna design introduced in the paper holds promise for application in systems requiring broad bandwidth and multiple polarizations, such as wireless platforms, enhancing channel capacity and reducing the impact of polarization mismatches in complex communication environments.
