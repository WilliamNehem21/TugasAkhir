The increasing financial impact of cyber-attacks has intensified the need for a sophisticated and accessible security assessment method. This paper introduces a novel stochastic approach for security assessment, leveraging attack-defense tree (ADTree) models for scenario representation and stochastic models for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. A practical example is used to demonstrate the method.

The current ADTree analysis lacks qualitative foundations. The paper remedies this by applying Petri nets' qualitative traits within the security context. A direct correlation between finite Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) and bounded Stochastic Petri Nets allows for both qualitative and quantitative security analyses. Qualitative aspects are examined using Petri nets' structural and behavioral analysis, whereas quantitative aspects are evaluated using CTMCs derived from the corresponding Petri net model.

The paper also presents a new type of parallel refinement operator, conceived to illustrate actions occurring concurrently within ADTrees. Additionally, a novel class of countermeasures called "blocking-type" is proposed, complementing the existing "delayed-type" countermeasures.

The author suggests a formal framework for ADTrees, details the qualitative and quantitative analyses' outcomes through an example, and compares the work with existing literature, concluding with a summary of the research findings.

The study identifies the necessity for representing parallel actions in security scenarios, which are essential in large-scale cyber-attacksâ€”a gap not filled by traditional ADTree refinement operators. The current disjunctive refinement tends to imply mutually exclusive actions, which do not capture the parallel nature of certain security events.

To rectify this, the paper introduces the "parallel disjunction refinement" operator to allow an attacker/defender to execute multiple actions simultaneously. Graphical dots illustrate this concept in representations.

Overall, the paper offers an operational framework based on stochastic Petri nets for ADTrees, facilitating comprehensive security analysis. The authors recognize the prototype's potential for improvement and future expansion, with the ultimate aim of creating an all-encompassing security assessment tool.
