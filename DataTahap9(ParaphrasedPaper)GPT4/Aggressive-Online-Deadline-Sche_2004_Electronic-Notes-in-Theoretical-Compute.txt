This paper examines online job scheduling algorithms that work with deadlines on single processor systems, where jobs can be preempted. It acknowledges that no online algorithm can match the optimal offline algorithm (be 1-competitive) without being underloaded. However, it has been found that online algorithms with a modestly faster processor or more processors can perform much better and even achieve 1-competitiveness.

The focus of this paper is on the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) strategy, enhanced with admission control (EDF-AC), and its performance with added resources. Prior research has shown that by increasing the processor speed, online algorithms can improve competitiveness. Specifically, results have demonstrated that EDF-AC with a processor twice as fast as the standard can be 1-competitive, proving its effectiveness.

In this study, the authors explore the concept of 'aggressiveness'—a measure of performance where an algorithm aggressively fulfills jobs. They confirm that EDF-AC can be considered 'k-aggressive'—attaining an even higher level of performance—for any number k, provided it is paired with a processor that is (k+1) times faster than the standard.

The paper also details how EDF-AC incorporates a simplified form of admission control to determine job acceptance based on deadline feasibility and describes a proof that EDF-AC maintains k-aggressiveness across disjoint busy periods.

Ultimately, the paper discusses the tight relationship between processor speed, decision timing, and algorithm aggressiveness, pointing out open problems in the field, particularly the potential for k-aggressive scheduling with additional unit-speed processors and its application in multiprocessor contexts.
