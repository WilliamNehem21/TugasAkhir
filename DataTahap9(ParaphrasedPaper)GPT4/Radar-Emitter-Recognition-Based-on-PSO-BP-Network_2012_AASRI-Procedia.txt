An innovative emitter identification approach utilizing a hybrid PSO-BP neural network is introduced to tackle the difficulty of identifying emitters with interval-based characteristic parameters. This method involves training a neural network with strategically structured samples that address the inherent variability in the parametersâ€™ ranges to determine the network architecture and accurately identify the emitter type by its characteristics. The BP neural network is fine-tuned using particle swarm optimization (PSO) for superior performance. Through simulations, the study examines how the output encoding, training data volume, and deviation rate affect identification accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique.

Other conventional methods, such as Bayesian theory, fuzzy pattern recognition, rough set theory, evidence theory, and artificial neural networks, typically focus on scalar-based parameters and are designed to account for measurement errors in radar emitter recognition. However, they fall short in addressing interval-based parameters.

The proposed PSO-BP approach substantially differs from these methods in how it constructs sample data, incorporating a deviation rate to gauge the variation of parameters from their central values and examining its impact on the recognition rate in simulations. The application of PSO significantly improves the BP neural network, overcoming its limitations. Simulated experiments also consider output coding and sample size's influence on the system's accuracy. The results affirm the method's practicality, although the current model does not account for discrete characteristic parameters such as modulation information (MOP), which is slated for future research to develop a more universally applicable model without sacrificing practicality.
