This paper introduced a method named CO-SRL, which utilizes convex optimization to pinpoint sensor locations in wireless sensor networks, specifically focusing on identification and localization of both friend and malicious nodes using anchors. CO-SRL uses a convex optimization approach for estimating the positions of malicious nodes and has demonstrated both security and robustness through simulations. In environments without collusion, CO-SRL was able to detect more than half of the malicious nodes, and in colluding scenarios, fewer than 15% could evade detection.

The paper addresses the rise in internet usage for work, study, and entertainment via wireless networks, also acknowledging the security risks present due to the openness of these networks. Accurate localization techniques are emphasized as critical for security purposes and in aiding the investigation of computer-related crimes.

The paper differentiates between range-based and range-free localization methods. Range-based methods rely on precise measurement properties for localization, whereas range-free methods do not. The paper further discusses the importance of robust and high-performing access in wireless sensor networks.

The structure of the paper is as follows: it begins by explaining basic localization principles and discussing the CO-SRL method. Then, it presents the results from CO-SRL simulations. In the end, it offers a conclusion.

An enhanced protocol called Advanced Distance Bounding (AAD) is introduced to protect against network attacks like wormhole, Sybil, and distance reduction attacks by immediately detecting malicious nodes with false positions.

The CO-SRL method is implemented using MATLAB, creating an overlay application on physical networks composed of nodes and internet segments they can access. Each node has a functional module for traffic transfer and registration, a calculation engine for trust value computation, a friends list, and an evaluation engine.

The paper explored the efficiency of CO-SRL with varying 'lp' values and found that without measurement errors, CO-SRL had a 100% success rate in localizing malicious nodes across hundreds of iterations, given the number of malicious nodes did not exceed a threshold 'm.' These results were aligned with theoretical expectations and therefore not detailed in the paper.
