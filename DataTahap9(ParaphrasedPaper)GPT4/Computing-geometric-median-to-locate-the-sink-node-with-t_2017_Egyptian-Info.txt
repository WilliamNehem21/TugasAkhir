This paper examines the importance of strategically positioning the sink node (base station) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to reduce total energy consumption and improve throughput. The goal is to locate the sink such that the aggregate distance from all sensor nodes to it is minimized, enhancing network lifetime. The optimal sink placement is determined by computing the geometric median of the sensors' locations, which is the point with the smallest total distance to all other points. However, calculating the geometric median is not straightforward and poses a challenge. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work and solutions; Section 3 presents the authors' strategy and algorithm for finding the sink's optimal position; Section 4 outlines the network model and parameters used in simulations; Section 5 assesses the performance and results of the algorithm's implementation; Section 6 offers the paper's conclusion.

This study shows that centering the sink node in the network or near the densest cluster of nodes is advantageous. Previous approaches have tackled this optimization problem, which resembles the p-median problem, and suggest central placement of the sink. Other investigations have fixed the sink location considering nodes that forward data through a neighbor close to the sink, while recommendations for base station placement in two-tiered WSNs have focused on network lifetime, data rate, and power efficiency gains. Utilizing various algorithms can further improve these aspects. The geometric median, a fundamental concept in statistics and facility location, is employed to minimize transportation costs and effectively address the problem presented in this context. The paper delves into a process to determine the geometric median by exploring neighboring points around a proposed location and iteratively refining to a better position based on calculated distances.
