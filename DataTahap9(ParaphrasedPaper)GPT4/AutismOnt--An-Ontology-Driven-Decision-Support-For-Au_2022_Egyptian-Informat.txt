The paper discusses the significance of biomedical ontology in medical informatics, emphasizing its role in knowledge management, data integration, and decision support. It highlights how biomedical ontologies offer vocabularies for tasks such as data annotation, information retrieval, and inter-ontology mapping. These ontologies are vital for enabling semantic interoperability and standardizing clinical data, and contribute to reasoning in areas like data selection and natural language processing.

Specifically, Tu et al. developed an ontology for autism research that adheres to Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry principles and Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) standards. This ontology, which aims to enhance querying and inference capabilities regarding autism phenotypes, comprises various classes and diagnostic instrument descriptions, along with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules enabling inference based on patient data. Following its creation, a project utilizing this ontology sought to improve access to clinical data from the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR).

In a separate effort, McCray et al. devised an ontology based on 24 widely used autism diagnostic tools, such as interviews, assessments, and questionnaires. Their objective was to facilitate retrieval of autism data and provide an accurate comparison of autism diagnostic instruments. To define ontology concepts, they evaluated these instruments for phenotype data. By using and developing specific metrics, they could detect structural issues within the ontology and suggest enhancements.

Regarding the generation of SWRL rules for a machine learning model, data was sourced from the NDAR repository, including medical history and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2) scores for 1,534 subjects, with a gender and age distribution noted. These data attributes were divided into 13 categories for effective categorization.

The ontology uses a hierarchical structure to manage autism knowledge and relies on object and datatype properties for coherence. SWRL rules, derived from machine learning model relationships, are incorporated to improve expressiveness. A decision tree algorithm is employed as the machine learning model, with each path representing a SWRL rule.

Furthermore, the paper mentions a "Treatments" class, cataloging various strategies to alleviate autistic symptoms and improve life quality. These range from behavioral therapies like ABA to complementary and educational approaches. The "Profile" class comprises demographic and health history details, including comorbid conditions, which are crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

Lastly, the paper states that the ontology supports the reuse of knowledge across studies and aids in diagnosis processes. However, it acknowledges limitations, including the lack of a graphical user interface. It is also noted that the manuscript's data come from the NDAR, an NIH-supported resource for autism research. The authors clarify that the views expressed are their own and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the NIH or the data contributors to NDAR.
