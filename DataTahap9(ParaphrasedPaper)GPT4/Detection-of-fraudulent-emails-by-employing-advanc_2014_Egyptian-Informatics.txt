The paper discusses the pervasive role of email in modern communication, highlighting its convenience and efficiency, but also noting its exploitation by malicious actors. Due to the internet's expansion, there has been a surge in both email users and spam emails, stoking concerns about fraudulent email detectionâ€”a matter that is generally treated as a classification problem. Emails can be sorted into various categories, such as legitimate or illegitimate, based on their purpose.

Research related to this paper is categorized into different themes, emphasizing the detection of fraudulent emails among other types of illicit emails, including spam, suspicious emails, and phishing attempts. Additionally, researchers are investigating the identification of email authors, particularly in cases involving anonymous communications.

Previous studies have introduced various methods for filtering and detecting illicit emails. Youn and McLeod put forward an ontology-based spam filtering approach employing the J48 algorithm, while Renuka and Hamsapriya suggested using word stemming for more effective spam detection, as spammers often insert misspellings to bypass keyword detection.

Suspicious emails, distinguished by content that may suggest unlawful activities or imminent threats, pose challenges for law enforcement investigation and are sometimes tied to serious events, as seen in communications prior to the 9/11 attacks. Appavu et al. employed association rule mining to flag emails for future suspicious activities.

Phishing, which aims to steal sensitive information through emails that mimic legitimate sources, remains a significant security issue. Phishers create convincing email content, prompting immediate responses from victims who might then inadvertently disclose confidential information.

This paper treats fraudulent email detection as a problem of classification, which involves determining the right feature set and a classification algorithm. It details an architecture comprising a content extractor (to retrieve email subject and body), a feature construction engine (to build feature sets based on typical attributes found in fraudulent emails), and a fraudulent email detector (employing various algorithms like SVM, J48, Naive Bayes, and a Cluster Based Classification Model using the machine learning tool WEKA).

The paper touches on using SVM, which is effective for text classification, especially with high-dimensional feature sets, due to its capability to handle non-linear separable data.

Experiments were conducted with a dataset of 8000 emails, balanced between fraudulent and normal communications. The fraudulent emails predominantly originated from Nigeria. Following preprocessing, emails were represented as feature vectors for classification. Initial experiments focused on features commonly found in fraudulent emails, such as appeals to emotion or financial gain used to deceive recipients.
