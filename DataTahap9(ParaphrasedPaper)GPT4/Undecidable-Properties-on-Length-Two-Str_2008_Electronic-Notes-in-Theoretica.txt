This paper discusses the complexity of determining certain properties in length-two string rewriting systems, which are a specific type of string rewriting systems where each rule replaces one pair of symbols with another pair, hence preserving the length of the string. The undecidability of four properties—confluence, termination, left-most termination, and right-most termination—is established for these systems. The implications extend to linear term rewriting systems with depth-two variable allowance in rules.

Although confluence and termination issues are usually undecidable in term and string rewriting systems, some specific classes have been identified where these problems are indeed decidable. However, this paper reveals that for the subclass of length-preserving string rewriting systems with rules that only manipulate strings of length two, the decidable status of confluence and termination cannot be assumed. The research also suggests that the issues regarding the (un)decidability of certain rewriting properties invite further investigation, especially in classes of systems defined by limiting the number of available rules.
