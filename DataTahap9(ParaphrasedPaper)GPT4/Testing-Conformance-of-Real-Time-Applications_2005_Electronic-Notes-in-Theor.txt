This paper presents a novel approach for dynamic testing of real-time systems, with a specific focus on robotic platforms such as NASA's K9 Martian Rover. The authors describe a process that begins with a high-level plan which is then converted into a network of timed automata (TA). Using this network, the researchers can create observers that monitor the activities of the system under test (SUT). The SUT is modified to emit observed events and time-stamps that the observer can use for runtime verification, either in real-time or post-execution analysis, to ensure that the SUT's behavior aligns with the original specification.

The methodology is designed to be fully automated, with the potential to automate even the traditionally manual process of SUT instrumentation. The paper outlines the approach's practical application through the case study of NASA's K9 Rover, where the plans for the rover's actions are automatically translated into TA models. These models are then utilized to generate observers for testing and verification purposes. This method represents a significant advancement in dynamic testing and provides a concrete example of its effectiveness. The research also discusses extending the technique with future work on the representation of observers as finite automata and challenges related to the non-determinizability of timed automata.
