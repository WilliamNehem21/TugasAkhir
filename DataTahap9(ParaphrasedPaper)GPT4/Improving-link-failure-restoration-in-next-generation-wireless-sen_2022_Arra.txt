Advanced wireless communication technologies, such as 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), pledge to deliver exceptional speed, immense capacity, low latency, and unparalleled reliability. While Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are not new, they continue to evolve with innovative designs and deployments to support the ambitious objectives of next-generation (XG) wireless communications. These updated versions of WSNs, termed Next-Generation Wireless Sensor Networks (XWSNs), align with XG tech to facilitate applications in smart cities, direct device-to-device communication (including machine-to-machine and vehicle-to-vehicle), e-health, e-agriculture, e-transportation, e-education, and numerous other contexts that rely on sensors within XG networks.

Still, potential setbacks such as network failures can arise as a result of sensor node constraints, complex network functionalities, challenging deployment environments, or unpredictable factors. These failures threaten the XWSNs' ability to deliver on the promise of high reliability within XG network applications. To mitigate such issues, it's essential to incorporate robust network restoration strategies within XWSN designs. These strategies should preemptively address potential failures and muster immediate responses for backup or recovery. Developing these restoration models is a critical focus of current telecommunications research.

Early studies exist on XWSNs with applications in technologies like cognitive radio sensor networks and have looked into network restoration for such emerging networks. Research has recognized the significance of using 'p-cycles' – an advanced network restoration technique – within the context of XWSNs and other XG networks. P-cycles offer rapid recovery akin to ring-based systems and high capacity akin to mesh topologies. They provide robust protection against both link and node failures, employing only spare network capacities, enhancing overall efficiency. P-cycles excel in safeguarding both encompassing and interconnected network links, making them particularly suited for XWSNs and other emerging networks.

Considering practical XWSNs deployed for device-to-device communications, the architecture incorporates sensor nodes that communicate either in a single-hop (direct communication between two nodes) or multi-hop (communication through relay nodes) fashion. This direct approach, avoiding base stations or core networks, and leveraging a distributed architecture, presents benefits such as cost-effectiveness, ease of recovery from network failures, and scalable networking.

To optimize network restoration with p-cycles, a selection process entails assigning and minimizing costs for potential p-cycles. The resulting choice of p-cycles aims to balance cost-efficiency with restoration effectiveness. Shifting network load, particularly on bottleneck 'limiting' links within p-cycles, can free up capacity, improve overall performance and ensure restoration efforts don't interfere with original network traffic.

The study further introduces strategies for mitigating double link failures and demonstrates the effectiveness of the restoration model in a simulated XWSN scenario, comprising 100 randomly placed sensor nodes connected by 250 links. The simulation uses packet-switched traffic appropriate for internet-based communication and machine-to-machine contexts, offering scalability to represent larger practical applications.

Results are measured in terms of average path length, representing the hop count for restoration, and total capacity cost, summing up the costs of working paths (WPs) known in advance and the extra costs of restoration paths (RPs). The outcomes exhibit XWSN's potential and the effectiveness of p-cycle-based restoration strategies for optimizing network performance while keeping costs manageable.
