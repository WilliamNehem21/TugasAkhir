We define a function as locally constant at a specific location if there is a surrounding area where the function's value does not change. Considering a particular characteristic, P, and a specific location, Y, we state that P(Y') is true for some Y' that can be chosen arbitrarily near to Y. This means that for any chosen area surrounding Y, there exists a Y' for which P(Y') is valid. Additionally, we remember that a space is said to be locally connected if every point within it has a base of connected neighborhoods around it.
