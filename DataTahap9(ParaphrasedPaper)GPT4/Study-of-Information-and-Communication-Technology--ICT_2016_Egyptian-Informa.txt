This study utilized a quasi-experimental approach and engaged with 72 service companies on the Nigerian Stock Exchange for research participation. Out of these, 28 agreed, with ultimately 23 service firms actively contributing data through completed questionnaires during a data collection phase from April 14 to May 15, 2015. The participating companies included a variety of firms, predominantly from the banking sector, which represented 45.51% of the total, and from various managerial levels, with operational-level managers constituting 43.59% of respondents.

The research discovered a negative and weak correlation between the maturity of information and communication technology (ICT) and the value derived from it within the Nigerian service industry. The findings suggest that the level of ICT maturity does not necessarily lead to a higher or lower value from ICT, indicating that the benefits of ICT adoption are not solely dependent on the extent of its maturity.

A key contribution of this study is the clarification it provides regarding the relationship between ICT value and maturity. It demonstrates to policymakers, managers, and IT professionals that the benefits associated with ICT usage cannot be directly linked to the firm's level of ICT development. This insight has implications for understanding the deployment and effectiveness of ICT in service firms.
