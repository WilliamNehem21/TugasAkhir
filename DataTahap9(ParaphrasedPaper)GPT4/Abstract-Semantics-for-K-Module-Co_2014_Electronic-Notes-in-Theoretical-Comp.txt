This paper suggests that structuring definitions within the K framework in a modular way is more advantageous than having them in a monolithic single module. Modularity enhances readability, simplifies debugging, and promotes code reuse among definitions with common elements. To leverage these benefits, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of module composition and the properties of modules throughout the composition process. The paper introduces a theoretical framework for modular systems within the K framework, based on institution-based model theory by Goguen and Burstall, to define K modules and module transformations.

Historically, the first modular system for specification languages was outlined by Bergstra and colleagues, which, though not institution-based, influenced subsequent institution-based systems. Their system didn't support parameterization and provided only rudimentary signature visibility control through hiding.

Diaconescu and others later proposed an abstract modular system rooted in institution-based model theory, where a module was essentially a collection of symbols and assertions defined within a given institution, including operations like sum, renaming, and hiding, and properties of these operations were studied.

Goguen's proposal introduced a more complex modular system that allowed modules to specify imports and expose a partial signature to other modules, defining the concept of an implementation module for a given specification module. This system also defined operations for modifying modules, such as hiding, enriching, renaming, and aggregation.

The CASL specification language's modular system supported operations like hiding and revealing types within a specification. This inspired similar functionalities in the proposed modular system with hiding being one operation and a special form of enriching as another. Additionally, CASL's 'free' operation, which alters a module's semantics to an initial/free model, is also acknowledged.

In practice, a hiding operation reduces the external visibility of a signature's part. For example, to define natural numbers using integers, one might start by hiding the subtraction operation, then proceed to rename and add a total order on numbers along with associated properties. This sequence effectively demonstrates a hide-rename-enrich process within modular system operations.
