The academic paper reviews the historical efforts to study the outbreak and spread of epidemics through various models that help understand and predict the course of disease outbreaks, as well as evaluate control strategies. Emphasizing the importance of predicting disease evolution, the paper introduces the use of process algebras in epidemiological modeling. Specifically, the paper focuses on using a variant of the process algebra language, Bio-PEPA, to model avian influenza.

Bio-PEPA, initially used for biochemical system modeling, is adapted here to support epidemiological studies. This language allows individual components within a population to be defined and their interactions specified, facilitating a component-based approach to understanding disease spread. The paper presents the application of Bio-PEPA to avian influenza models, considering different spatial distributions and treatment approaches, such as prophylaxis and drug introduction.

Three avian influenza models are described: a simple SIISR model that divides the population into susceptible, asymptomatic infective, and symptomatic recoverable individuals; a spatially structured model that considers patch locations and migration between them; and a treatment-aware model that takes into account prophylaxis and drug resistance.

The paper highlights the use of Bio-PEPA for its high level of abstraction and ability to represent features such as dynamic laws, abstract spatial structures, and responses to triggering conditions. These analyses can help discover errors and choose appropriate methods to study particular models. The paper concludes by discussing the use of traditional ODE-based models alongside process algebras for epidemiological modeling, offering potential for future exploration of other models and analysis techniques.
