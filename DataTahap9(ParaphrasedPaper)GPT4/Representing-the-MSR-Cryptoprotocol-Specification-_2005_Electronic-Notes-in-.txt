This paper discusses the development of a method for specifying complex cryptographic protocols, which may consist of various subprotocols. The method utilizes a formal specification language called Multiset Rewriting (MSR), which employs strongly-typed multiset rewriting rules on first-order atomic formulas to delineate protocol actions. MSR also incorporates a form of existential quantification for modeling the generation of fresh data like nonces.

One of the distinctive features of MSR is its support for dependent types, which allows for more expressive type relationships, such as associating public/private keys with their respective owners at the type level. This capability is not typically available in other specification languages. Additionally, MSR offers a range of static checks including type-checking and data access verification.

The paper outlines the groundwork for a prototype of MSR that will operate on top of an existing system called Maude. The relationship between MSR and another system, called Rewriting Logic with Dependent Types (RWLDT), is leveraged for a simpler construction of MSR compared to a direct implementation, or mapping it into CAPSL Intermediate Language (CIL), which has less sophisticated typing capabilities.

The paper is structured into several sections:
- Section 3 introduces MSR, and Section 4 presents RWLDT.
- Section 5 elaborates on how MSR is mapped onto RWLDT, including key properties and optimizations.
- Section 6 demonstrates the application of these methods to the Otway-Rees protocol, a known security protocol.

The authors use standard notations for lists and variables and assume that MSR specifications will not use certain names from the initial context to remain unambiguous and avoid issues like renaming and capturing.

A key concept explained is the translation of MSR roles into RWLDT rewrite axioms, which ensures that the rules of active roles are executed only once. Freshness invariance is used to maintain unique elements within the protocol execution, and certain optimizations are suggested to improve efficiency.

The RWLDT specification is confirmed to be type-correct using the OCC type checker, suggesting the same for the original MSR specification. The authors propose that the OCC prototype can help investigate the dynamic behavior of cryptographic protocols.

The paper concludes with discussions on the embedding of MSR into RWLDT, potential user interfaces for interactions with the translation, and the possibility of extending the work to symbolic search and model checking.

Finally, the paper acknowledges certain simplifications and assumptions, such as ignoring name clashes by using an explicit substitution calculus called CINNI. The authors also mention that the current paper does not fully address the data access specifications in MSR, as it is still an open area for research. They suggest using predicates within type theory for future work to formalize data access specifications more concisely and flexibly, hoping to better utilize the logical nature of RWLDT.
