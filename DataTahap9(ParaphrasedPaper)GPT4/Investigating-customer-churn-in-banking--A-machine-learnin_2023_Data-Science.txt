The article discusses the issue of customer attrition in the banking sector, where customers cease using a bank's services and eventually terminate their relationship with the institution. Because the banking environment is fiercely competitive, customer retention is critical. A strong customer base not only retains business but also helps attract new customers through trust and referrals.

In an effort to mitigate customer attrition, the authors examine bank data to predict which customers are at risk of leaving. They employ various machine learning (ML) techniques for data analysis and provide a comparative performance evaluation of these methods. Additionally, they develop an RShiny app for data visualization to aid in understanding and managing customer churn.

The study's main focus is the importance of maintaining customers and analyzing their behavior patterns to tackle the issue of customer churn. Prior research is discussed, highlighting the role of postpurchase evaluations, satisfaction surveys, and continuous satisfaction tracking in customer retention.

Key contributions of the study include a detailed preprocessing method for data accuracy in churn analysis, a thorough examination of different ML methods for predicting customer attrition, and the creation of a user-friendly visualization tool for presenting churn-related data.

The research employs core ML approaches—logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)—to the dataset, providing a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to understand various data aspects.

The findings reveal that the random forest model excelled in accuracy and sensitivity, with important churn indicators being factors like nationality, gender, product ownership, and account balance. For instance, the research found that customers of German nationality, women, those with three bank products, and those with account balances above 85,000 are more prone to churn.

The developed RShiny app enables stakeholders to visualize and comprehend churn trends, customer behavior, and retention efficacy, leading to informed decision-making and better resource allocation to enhance customer loyalty.

Lastly, the study’s insights and methodologies extend beyond banking, being relevant for industries like insurance, telecommunications, subscription services, and e-commerce. The approach ensures data analysis accuracy and consistency, while ML algorithm application to predict churn can optimize customer retention and marketing strategies. The data visualization app supports decisions in CRM, marketing, resource allocation, and product development, with the study’s findings offering actionable guidance for various sectors to advance data-driven decision-making and client retention tactics.
