The paper introduces a proposed standard proof format for SAT/SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers, utilizing the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF). The main challenges addressed by the paper are managing the verification of large proofs and ensuring proof compactness when dealing with complex rule side conditions. LF's flexibility and support for higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) make it well-suited for encoding the varying logical theories and algorithms employed by SMT solvers. 

Traditional LF checking processes involve parsing textual input into an abstract syntax tree (AST), but this is inefficient for large proofs which may not fit in memory or could cause stack overflow due to deep nesting. Large proofs become more problematic when inferences include proofs of side conditions, such as those required for propositional resolution with factoring. 

To tackle these issues, the paper presents LF with Side Conditions (LFSC), an approach where encoded inference rules define side conditions through a simple functional programming language. This allows for a range of methods from purely declarative to computational proof checking. Proof checking and parsing are performed incrementally to avoid constructing large in-memory representations. LFSC can check side conditions by executing specified code, thus offering a scalable and more efficient method for proof verification in SMT solvers.

A common proof format following these principles could potentially ease the implementation of proof production in SMT solvers, facilitating a common ground for interfacing with theorem provers by serving as an intermediate language.
