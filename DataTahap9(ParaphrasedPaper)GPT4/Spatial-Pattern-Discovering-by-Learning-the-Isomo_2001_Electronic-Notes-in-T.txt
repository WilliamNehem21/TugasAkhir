This paper addresses the challenge of automatically constructing a model or reference for inexact graph matching when relating objects or scenes in images to a counterpart model. It introduces a method for automatically learning a parametric pattern Attributed Relational Graph (ARG) model from multiple ARG samples. These ARGs represent a pattern as observed under different conditions. The model is developed using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the maximum likelihood parameters, specifically deriving analytic expressions for Gaussian attributed and relational density distributions, thus leading to what is termed the Contextual Gaussian Mixture Model (CGM).

The paper outlines the application of this theory and methodology to unsupervised spatial pattern extraction from multiple images, which can help with data summarization, graph matching, and pattern detection, and has potential use in digital image and video libraries for information summarization and retrieval.

The authors discuss previous work, which utilized ARG for sample representation and graph matching for retrieval; however, they note limitations such as not considering contextual information or facing high computational complexity due to pixel-level operations.

The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of learning a parametric pattern ARG model from a set of sample ARGs rather than using one ARG as a model. This model can accommodate the variance in relationships and attributes across samples due to factors like noise and transformations.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 defines the problem of automatic contextual pattern modeling. Section 3 details parameter estimation for the pattern ARG using the EM algorithm, and Section 4 provides analytical expressions for a special caseâ€”the CGM model. Section 5 explores using the model for pattern detection, Section 6 addresses implementation, Section 7 presents experimental results, and the paper concludes with a summary in Section 8.

It also highlights the challenges of manually specifying node and relation correspondences due to the laborious nature of the task and the presence of patterns mixed with backgrounds in observed images.

In applications, a Gaussian distribution is commonly assumed for both attributes and relationships, and the paper elaborates on deriving estimates for these parameters within the CGM model using the EM algorithm. It further details the steps for initializing the pattern ARG model, a crucial aspect of the learning process, and how to set up additional components within the model.

In summary, this work contributes a theoretical and methodological framework for creating a learned parametric pattern ARG model from multiple samples to facilitate graph matching and pattern recognition tasks in image and video analysis.
