This academic paper discusses the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which reportedly began in December 2019 and has led to 6.9 million deaths by July 2, 2023. It emphasizes the transmission of the virus through airborne droplets from coughs or sneezes that can linger for three hours, causing respiratory infections.

The paper reviews the use of deep learning technology in the rapid detection of COVID-19 through chest x-rays (CXR). AI, particularly deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has become integral to medicine, with applications including cancer diagnosis through automated image analysis. However, while various machine learning algorithms show promise in diagnosing COVID-19 from CXRs, their performance in precision and error rates still needs improvement.

The paper presents a machine learning system called COVIDetector, which leverages transfer learning and InceptionV3, a deep learning model, for early diagnosis of COVID-19 via CXRs. This system is designed for an Android platform with a user interface built using React Native, enabling users to upload CXR images for analysis, with results displayed on-screen. The COVIDetector app aims to facilitate quick, accurate COVID-19 diagnosis for both healthcare professionals and patients.

The study references various efforts in the development of CNN models for COVID-19 detection. A study by Azemin et al. using ResNet101 achieved an accuracy of 71.9%. Another by Ozturk et al. developed DarkCovidNet and recorded a 98.08% accuracy. Khan et al. achieved 99.3% accuracy with VGG16 and VGG19 models. Loey et al. explored transfer learning with pre-trained models like AlexNet, reaching 85.20% accuracy. Tabik et al. created the COVID-SDNet, which had a 97.72% success rate, while Taresh et al. reported a 98.72% accuracy rate using VGG16.

The paper also details network architecture, including VGG19's 13 convolution layers and 5 max pooling layers. VGG19's architecture is an extension of VGG16, offering refined performance. Pre-trained on ImageNet, the network can categorize thousands of common objects.

Data clustering is covered as a method for analyzing and organizing data into similar groups. The paper mentions the use of the k-means algorithm for creating dissimilar clusters of closely related data points.

The researchers conducted experiments using various datasets. They describe the compilation and classification efforts to build these CXR datasets with multiple classes for model testing and validation.

Lastly, the paper discusses the potential integration of deep learning algorithms into embedded IoT devices, such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino, proposing a smart X-ray-based COVID-19 detection system. The combination of COVIDetector with IoT and other technologies like ChatGPT could enhance and expedite patient care, with the potential to significantly impact future medical practices.
