This study investigates a variety of symmetric encryption algorithms, including DES, Triple DES, IDEA, Blowfish, CAST-128, and stream ciphers like RC2 and RC5, along with the performance of a proposed EMDs algorithm. The paper presents simulation results of various performance metrics to evaluate existing and new symmetric cryptographic solutions, using a Java implementation specifically for EMDs.

Most current symmetric encryption approaches use a Feistel network, which cycles through several rounds of bit shuffling, S-box substitutions, and XOR operations. The paper briefly discusses several Feistel network-based cryptographic algorithms:

- Tuchman developed Triple DES to improve privacy and integrate data security during transmission or storage. It became a part of the ANSI X9.17 financial standard, using the DES scheme at each of its three levels to resist brute force attacks without creating an entirely new block cipher. While Triple DES is secure and recommended by federal agencies, it is also slower compared to DES. It takes a 64-bit plaintext and a 168-bit key, running through 48 rounds to output a 64-bit ciphertext.

- The IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) was created as a possible DES replacement by Xuejia Lai and James Massey in 1991. It encrypts a 64-bit block of plaintext with a 128-bit key to produce a 64-bit block of ciphertext and relies on XOR, binary addition, and 16-bit integer binary multiplication.

- CAST-128, introduced by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares in 1996, resists various cryptanalytic attacks and works with keys ranging from 40 to 128 bits. It encrypts in 16 rounds, taking a 64-bit block of plaintext and outputting 64-bit ciphertext. Each round uses two distinct subkeys and an f-function that depends on the round.

- Developed by Ron Rivest, RC5 is a standard encryption algorithm with easy implementation on 16-bit microprocessors. It accepts 64-bit inputs divided into 16-bit words and produces a 64-bit output, having a versatile key size from one to 128 bytes.

The paper also considers static dictionaries, which are encrypted tools available for both sender and recipient only accessible by authorized users, and dynamic dictionaries, which are generated at runtime and not transmitted to save bandwidth.

Finally, when discussing key length in block ciphers, the term refers to the number of bits in the key; for example, a key '1010' has a length of 4 bits.
