This paper aims to establish a connection between logical relations and the principles of predicate logic, particularly concerning type theory. It starts by examining the prerequisites for predicates in a predicate logic to reflect the corresponding type theory's architecture. The paper demonstrates that this structure, applied to unary predicates (predicates involving a single variable), extends to binary and more complex n-ary relations (those involving two or more variables).

The paper incorporates category theory tools to explore predicate logic formally as a fibration—a type of mathematical structure—above a type theoretical base category. The base represents contexts of variable-type assignments, while the morphisms correspond to variable substitutions. The research primarily addresses structures defined by adjunctions, such as products, function spaces, and sums, before transitioning to those defined by monads.

The author mentions that challenges in analysing these structures can be somewhat lessened because they are stable under products, meaning they can be integrated into a single framework. The paper begins an exploration of monadic types, with plans to elaborate in subsequent work.

The paper offers an exemplary case of semantic fibration called Pred. In this instance, the underlying category C represents a category of mathematical objects, like Set, and the fiber over an object A in C is a collection of maps that enter into A. With Pred, these maps correspond to the inclusion of subsets.

Then the paper examines the decomposition of adjoints, noting that right adjoints entail two parts: a cartesian lift that substitutes terms into a predicate, and an adjunction between fibrations over the same base that relies on the existence of specific logical structures.

An example involving adjunctions in categories shows a commutative square with horizontal arrows possessing right adjoints, which do not necessarily coincide even though they are closely related through a canonical natural transformation.

The paper extends this discussion to coproducts, paralleling the analysis given for products but applying it to opposite categories, resulting in left adjoints.

Lastly, the paper touches on monads as an alternative framework for defining structures, pointing out that no overarching method exists to extend a monad on a category representing types to one on a category representing predicate logic for those types, although there are successful approaches under certain circumstances.

The paper signals that it does not delve into the presence of algebraic operations within these monads, indicating that this topic will be addressed separately in a subsequent article.
