The paper discusses working with a minimal structure where the diagrams of a mathematical entity labeled 'S' are consistent. This is achieved by simplifying the morphisms from the category generated by the free category 'Cat(S)' using the graph of the structure 'G' as per Proposition 2.2. 

Further, the paper suggests that a similar theorem or property could also apply to finite decidable Lawvere-tierney^exact sketches inside a mathematical framework called an arithmetic universe, by creating more complex tree structures. It posits that for a broader range of finite product sketches within an arithmetic universe—or similar frameworks—a correspondence might still exist. The authors speculate that in a specific subset of the arithmetic universe, known as a locally closed arithmetic universe, this correspondence property should likely be extendable to general internal finite product sketches because, in the current paper, the crucial factor for the sketches' workability was simply their decidable finiteness, which was only used to make certain calculations about a subset of the sketch's arrows.
