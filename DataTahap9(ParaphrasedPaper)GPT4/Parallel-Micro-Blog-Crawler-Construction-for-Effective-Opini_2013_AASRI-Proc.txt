Here's a paraphrased version of the academic paper:

Investigating and identifying key influencers has become critical due to the exponential growth of microblogging platforms worldwide that affect our daily lives. Governments across different nations recognize the pivotal role of analyzing and managing the spread of messages on microblogs and other social networks. This is because opinion leaders are instrumental in propagating information on these platforms, highlighting the importance of accurately pinpointing these individuals. In this study, we have developed a tool for crawling and analyzing microblogs based on Sina Microblog APIs. Additionally, our research introduces a new methodology using MapReduce for more efficiently crawling microblogs and approximating node betweenness, thus improving the identification of central opinion leaders in microblog networks with greater accuracy and reduced computation time.

The following sections of the article are organized as follows: Section II provides an in-depth review of existing research on the complexity of networks, focusing on algorithms for computing centrality and betweenness, as well as the implementation of parallel computing. Here we also discuss three crucial centralities relevant to social network analysis when it comes to detecting significant opinion leaders. Section III describes our crawler built upon Sina APIs in detail. Section IV outlines the parallel construction of our Sina microblog crawler, while Section V presents a novel betweenness approximation algorithm tailored for large-scale networks, which has been validated through experiments using real Sina Microblog user data. The final section, Section VI, offers the conclusions of our paper.

Additionally, through the application of MPI and Hadoop, researchers have enhanced the efficiency of algorithm execution through parallel programming. Nevertheless, the complexity of MPI programming and theories pose challenges for developers. Current methods have been inadequate in formulating a betweenness approximation algorithm encompassing entire social networks, particularly on a large scale and within the MapReduce framework. Addressing this gap is essential to simplify the computational process.

We have suggested an approximate computation method to be used in large-scale social graphs to quickly respond to emergencies, such as severe rainstorms. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves greater precision with lower computing time. This algorithm is valuable in identifying significant influencers within extensive social networks, and for parallel data mining applications.
