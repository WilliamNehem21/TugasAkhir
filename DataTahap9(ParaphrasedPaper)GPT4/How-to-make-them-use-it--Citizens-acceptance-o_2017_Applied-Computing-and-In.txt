Data were randomly gathered from 468 individuals who either utilized mobile government services or expressed an interest in doing so. The researcher performed reliability tests on each construct to evaluate the quality of the measures and ensure precise measurement. The questionnaire was divided into seven parts, with the first section capturing demographic information, and the subsequent sections gathering details about the factors included in the research model. Details on the questionnaire items can be found in the appendix.
