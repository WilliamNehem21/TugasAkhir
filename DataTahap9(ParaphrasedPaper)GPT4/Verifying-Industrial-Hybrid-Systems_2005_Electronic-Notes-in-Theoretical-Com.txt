In the paper, the authors introduce a method for determining bounded reachability within linear hybrid automata by transforming the problem into one solvable by the MathSAT solverâ€”a tool used for satisfying Boolean combinations of propositional variables and mathematical constraints. This technique offers a practical solution by using MathSAT's efficient integration of propositional satisfiability (SAT) with mathematical reasoning. While the proposed method has its limitations, such as being ineffective for non-linear dynamics, it has proven useful in real-world scenarios for system analysis and debugging.

The technique's closest comparator is bounded model checking, which involves seeking counterexamples within a fixed number of steps. Though the method is incomplete due to the undecidability inherent in hybrid automata, it remains a useful tool when seeking specific trace lengths. An industry-related illustration of this methodology is applied to the SPS model, which shows the method's potential for debugging and simulation. Despite HyTech's broader capabilities in analyzing hybrid systems without being limited to bounded cases, the approach in this paper demonstrates a practical alternative for systems that HyTech cannot manage.

The paper also describes the possibility of extending the validation and application scope by comparing more tools and case studies and refining the MathSAT solver for these specialized problems. Future work includes looking at more complex and abstract models of industrial systems and exploring optimizations and encoding variations.

Lastly, the paper acknowledges funding support from various projects and institutions, indicating the collaborative nature and financial backing from both European projects and private entities such as Intel Corporation.
