This academic paper discusses a type of preconditioner called diagonal or Jacobi preconditioning, which is utilized in the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) algorithm. The PCG algorithm comprises two main phases that are iteratively performed. Convergence of the PCG method is determined by evaluating the error, specifically by ensuring that the Euclidean norms of the residual vector meet particular criteria.
