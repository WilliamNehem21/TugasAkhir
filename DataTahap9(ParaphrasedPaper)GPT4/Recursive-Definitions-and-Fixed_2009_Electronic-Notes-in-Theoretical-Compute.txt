An implicit definition stipulates a particular set of models, more precisely, a p-determined set of models concerning a relation symbol p (refer to definition 2.1). Within the model group for a theory that implicitly defines a language symbol, should two models share an identical domain and interpret the remaining symbols similarly, they will also assign the same interpretation to the symbol that is being implicitly defined.
