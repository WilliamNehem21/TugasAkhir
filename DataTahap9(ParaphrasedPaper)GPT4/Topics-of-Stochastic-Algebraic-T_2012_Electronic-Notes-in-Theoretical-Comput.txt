The study of higher-dimensional random simplicial complexes has been advanced through a model introduced by Linial, Meshulam, and Wallach. Research on this model has shown that the fundamental groups of random 2-complexes can be seen as a broad class of random groups. Significant strides in comprehending these random groups have been made by Babson, Hoffman, and Kahle.
