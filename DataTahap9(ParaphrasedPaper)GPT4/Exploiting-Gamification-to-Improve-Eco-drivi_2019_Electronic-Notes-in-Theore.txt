GameCar is an innovative platform that implements serious gaming principles to encourage users to drive in an eco-friendlier manner. By integrating gaming into daily driving without compromising safety, GameCar offers an engaging, multiplayer experience using mobile devices, and integrates the car and driver's physical actions into the game. As part of the immersive experience, GameCar collects a variety of data through an OBD sensor that monitors driving performance metrics related to eco-driving. This data is supplemented by environmental and physiological measurements to comprehensively understand both the car's and driver's conditions.

The GameCar platform gauges driving aggression based on parameters such as the variance in engine RPM, the intensity of braking, and the magnitude of acceleration. Large swings in engine RPM, for example, suggest nervous driving and inefficient vehicle control, which lead to reduced fuel economy and safety. To ensure aggression scores are relevant across different driving speeds, lateral and directional accelerations are also considered for scoring in faster driving segments. 

Players are categorized into three groups – Casual Cruiser, Safety Enthusiast, and Smart Saver – to tailor in-game missions and rewards to their driving style. Players are challenged appropriately according to their category, with missions focusing on safe and eco-friendly practices or highlighting the benefits of eco-driving.

The player's journey through GameCar is structured into distinct phases:

1. **Discovery Phase (Levels 1-4):** Occurs after 90-120 minutes of driving; players learn the game's elements, scoring, and receive basic driving statistics.
2. **On-Boarding (Levels 5-14):** Occurring over 6-8 hours of driving across 9-16 days; players explore advanced features such as leaderboards, daily missions, and knowledge cards.
3. **Scaffolding (Levels 15-39):** In a span of 45-57 hours of driving over 2.5-4 months; focuses on habit formation and allows players to form crews for collaborative gameplay.
4. **Mastery (Final Stage):** Players receive personalized feedback on their driving, access advanced data visualizations, and are motivated to remain active to maintain their status, which decays with inactivity.

Driving skill scores reflect individual driving behaviours like fuel consumption, acceleration, braking, gear changing, and aggressiveness. These scores, along with live feedback, guide users in improving their driving. Knowledge cards and missions also gamify the learning experience, presenting drivers with challenges and objectives that go beyond just improving scores, fostering continuous engagement with the platform.
