Graph-based rule transformations play a crucial role across various computer science domains, such as software development, defining visual languages, and programming language implementation. Interaction, a type of graph transformation, helps model concurrency, provides semantics to logic proofs, informs programming approaches, and supports functional language implementation, with each application featuring its own syntax and rules.

The use of higher-order syntax in graph-based programs (like interaction nets) enhances their structure and modularization. Hierarchical graph programs benefit from this syntax, which also allows for composing interaction nets into more complex ones. This mimics function application in functional programming, evolving from a meta-operation to be expressible within the language itself, enabling modular programming and recursive net definitions.

The academic paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of graph rewriting systems and interaction nets. Section 3 discusses the syntax of higher-order systems. Section 4 demonstrates how different graph and term-graph rewriting systems, as well as interaction nets and their various forms, can be represented. Section 5 proposes a set of higher-order rules. Section 6 illustrates these concepts with a practical example. The paper concludes in Section 7.

The paper also addresses metaterms, where metavariables represent placeholders within rules that define how terms can be reduced or transformed through substitution.

Contextual rules can also use patterns within the left-hand side of rules, where a metavariable can be paired with a term, enabling the writing of context-sensitive reduction systems.

For linear logic proof nets, the paper discusses two main encoding methods in interaction nets: using agents to encapsulate proof nets, requiring infinite agents, or utilizing a finite number of agents to first-order encode binders and content.

The paper introduces a higher-order rewrite framework enabling various graph reduction systems, particularly for interaction nets where programming and evaluation coexist in the same language. This framework has two primary uses: as a means to design and implement graphical languages with unified syntax, semantics, and metaoperations, and also as a method to introduce structure into graphical programs by leveraging higher-order features for hierarchical designs and reusability.
