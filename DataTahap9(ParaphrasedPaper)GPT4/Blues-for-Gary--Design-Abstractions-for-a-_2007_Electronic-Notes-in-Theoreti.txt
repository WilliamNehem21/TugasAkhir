This paper presents a learning tool designed to assist students in mastering jazz improvisation. The tool combines database technology, artificial intelligence that generates melodies, and user interface design. The authors expound on the approach of using several coordinated mini-languages, allowing users to specify details such as melody and chord structures, styles, and other music-related knowledge.

Improvisation may not come naturally to everyone, and strategies to teach this skill vary. One method recommends transcribing solos from renowned musicians, while another suggests writing out original solos. The authors posit that the latter approach has additional benefits.

For those new to music, understanding which notes harmonize well is challenging. This understanding is rooted in physics and psychoacoustics, but jazz musicians work with more abstract concepts developed through years of empirical learning, which cannot be automatically derived from physics.

The authors chose to use S-expressions, rather than XML, for their simplicity to define musical abstractions, accommodating the less tech-savvy user. The implementation uses the Polya library, providing Lisp-like data structures in Java, to represent these abstractions.

Scales and chords are tied together within the system, with each scale type having a specified set of notes. The system can transpose these scales and chords to different keys, focusing on fourteen key centers usually relevant in jazz.

Chord substitutions and extensions are described, with the latter implying a hierarchy amongst chords. By default, note durations are eight notes, but the paper outlines symbols for other note lengths like quarter, sixteenth, half, and whole notes, as well as modifiers like dots and pluses to adjust note duration.

Textual notation is designed for ease of use by musicians. For clarity, chords start with uppercase letters, while notes start with lowercase. Chords and notes can be defined in a mixed manner, with the software separating them appropriately. The duration of chords is indicated through the use of vertical bars to divide measures.

In paraphrase, the paper details a sophisticated software tool that helps learners develop jazz improvisation skills by combining elements of database management, AI-driven melody creation, and intuitive user interfaces, all specified through user-friendly mini-languages.
