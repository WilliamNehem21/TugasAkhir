The paper discusses the implementation of rewriters in the mCRL2 toolset, which are crucial for generating labeled transition systems from system specifications. These rewriters handle open terms and utilize non-linear match trees. The authors compare their rewriters with other efficient ones commonly in use.

The mCRL2 data language relevant to rewriting and the architecture of the implementations are addressed in Section 2. Section 3 explains the matching algorithm, while Sections 4 and 5 describe the innermost and jitty rewriters, respectively. Benchmarks are analyzed in Section 6.

Match trees are explained as a decision-making structure to guide term matching, with each node representing an instruction on how to proceed. Various optimizations are employed in the matching process to make the algorithm more efficient.

For a function symbol 'f', a specialized function using the match tree determines whether any rule can be applied, and either the rule's right-hand side is built, or the original term is returned. An optimization to avoid redundant traversal of normal forms is highlighted, wherein function arguments are assumed to be already in normal form.

To handle applicative term rewriting, additional specific rewrite functions are generated based on the allowed number of arguments. The paper also mentions how strategies for rewriting are automatically generated from the rewrite rules to avoid overburdening users.

Further optimizations include annotated function symbols and rules, and a focus on producing normal forms without annotations to simplify matching.

The paper identifies that memory usage is a significant factor in the rewriter performance, with benchmarks supporting the efficiency of the innermost rewriter compared to the jitty rewriter. Nevertheless, both rewriters show competitive performance with the fastest rewriters for functional languages, hinting at the feasibility of adapting such languages for open term rewriting essential for labeled transition system (LTS) generation.

Adapting functional language rewriters for LTS generation could potentially benefit the process behavior and theorem proving communities by providing access to the functional programming expertise.
