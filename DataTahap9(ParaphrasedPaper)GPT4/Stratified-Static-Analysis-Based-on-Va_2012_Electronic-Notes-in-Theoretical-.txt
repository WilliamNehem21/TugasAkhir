Widening operators are known to introduce imprecision in program analysis. They may result in a loop invariant that is less precise than the smallest element in the abstract domain capable of being an inductive invariant. The article proposes a method to mitigate some of the inaccuracies caused by widening.

It's possible for a more detailed abstraction of one program to yield less precise analysis results compared to a less detailed abstraction, highlighting the nonmonotonic nature of analysis with widening operators. The standard widening operation applied to polyhedra tends to overlook constraints in the second polyhedron that are absent in the first one. However, the actual implementation of this operator is more complex and was subject to correction in the past.

The paper acknowledges that the combination of widening and reduction, even when used iteratively, does not always guarantee analytical termination. This issue is known from prior research.

Lastly, the article references LAO Kernels, a benchmark suite used to evaluate compiler code generation and optimizations. Comprising small computational kernels relevant for embedded systems, such as audio and video processing, the suite includes functions that benefit from precise invariants. The proposed method identifies more precise invariants for a subset of these functions, maintaining the importance of the loop properties for the method's effectiveness.
