Our group's extensive expertise in testing and verification of avionics controllers has led us to witness numerous faults, errors, and anomalies. Following these observations, we undertook classification of these faults, applying commonly used semiconductor fault diagnostic models and methods to devise a comprehensive fault localization strategy for distributed embedded systems.

To monitor inter-controller communications during integration testing, we utilized network monitors like AFDX and ARINC 429 to capture data exchanges, although some communication, such as between redundant fault-tolerant controllers, remained unobservable.

We constructed a fault tree, following established techniques, outlining possible error hypotheses and necessary boundary conditions for a hypothetical cause to result in an observed failure. We excluded the possibility of an external intruder due to the closed nature of the system.

Testing involved stimulating specific variables to confirm or refute fault hypotheses. Successfully executing a test that marks corresponding sensors as failed confirms the presence of a fault within the system. For instance, in our tests, by altering the states of sensors and observing the system response, we could validate the expected behaviour and identify faults, such as a stuck-at-0 error in a process method through additional unit testing.

Our methodologies, built upon prior investigations, have proven effective for locating various types of faults. While such strategies are commonplace in semiconductor error diagnostics, they are not yet widespread in the distributed embedded systems field. By integrating these procedures with our tool chain—which includes RT-Tester, its user interface RTT-UI, and the Interval Analyzer—alongside fault analysis tools like Relex FTA or Isograph FaultTree+, we offer a reliable and efficient testing approach.
