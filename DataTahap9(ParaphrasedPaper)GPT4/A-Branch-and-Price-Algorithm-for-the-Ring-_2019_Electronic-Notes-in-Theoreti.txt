The study explores a variant of the ring-tree capacitated problem known as the ring-tree facility location problem, which factors in additional facility costs and capacities. This problem is pertinent to the strategic layout of hierarchical telecommunications networks. The researchers delve into an augmented integer programming model and various strategies to manage the NP-hard nature of the associated pricing challenge within a branch-and-price resolution framework.

To tackle the complex pricing issue, a relaxation technique that permits repetition of vertices within ring-trees is proposed, drawing inspiration from the successful use of ng-routes and q-arbs in management of vehicle routing problems. Furthermore, the researchers proffer a primal heuristic to seed the initial solution and a heuristic tailored to the pricing challenge.

The paper is structured into main sections: a formal delineation of the problem along with additional definitions and notation; algorithmic approaches including the primal heuristic and heuristics and relaxations for the pricing problem. The methods undergo evaluation through computational tests, employing literature-based instances, and the results are discussed subsequently.

For the pricing problem relaxation, vertex repetition is allowed, merging ng-route and qarb relaxations, previously applied effectively to routing and spanning tree issues, respectively. During the solution process, a two-tier strategy randomly joins arborescences to form ring-trees and iteratively includes customers until reaching capacity. Local search involving a 2-opt heuristic further refines the solution.

Comparative evaluation indicates that using the relaxed pricing approach only marginally reduces the lower bound quality by 3%, as opposed to using a multi-commodity flow-based approach that worsens it by 32%. In testing larger instances, only certain implementations managed to solve a minimal percentage at optimality, with one not solving any. However, they are capable of computing a duality gap for most cases, with a significantly lower average gap for one implementation over the other.

The paper concludes with a discussion and proposes directions for future research.
