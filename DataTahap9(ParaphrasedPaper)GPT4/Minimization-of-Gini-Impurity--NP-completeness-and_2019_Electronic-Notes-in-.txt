We demonstrate that the Partitioning around Medoids with Gini Purity (PMWGP) task is APX-hard for any arbitrary number of clusters (k), yet it yields a randomized Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) when k is fixed. These findings considerably enhance our understanding of the PMWGP problem. To achieve these discoveries, we examined the relationship between PMWGP and geometric k-means clustering.

An impurity measure converts a vector u=(u1,..., ud), which quantifies how many instances of each class are present in a tree node, into a non-negative scalar. A widely used impurity measure is the Gini impurity (iGini), which evaluates the likelihood of incorrect classification if an entity is assigned to class i with probability ui.

Since the Gini impurity is utilized in the CART software for constructing classification and regression trees, comprehending the difficulty of optimizing partitions according to Gini impurity is crucial, as is developing heuristics and algorithms for this aim.

The difficulty in solving PMWGP stems from using a reduction from hard problems like the vertex cover in triangle-free graphs to k-means, shown by Awasthi et al. Our randomized PTAS for PMWGP modifies the one for k-means given by Kumar et al. and explored further by Ackermann et al.

Previous research delves into computing optimal splits for impurity measures like Gini impurity. Breiman formulated a straightforward algorithm to find the best binary partition in O(n log n) time for specific impurity measures, including Gini, with the algorithm's correctness based on a theorem that has been generalized for any values of d and k. These theorems provide essential criteria for the partitions with minimal impurity.

We also touch upon the similarity between Gini impurity and the squared L2 distance used in k-means, hinting at their connection which we investigate here, mentioned by Chou et al.

The research presented is part of the primary author's project and his team, aiming to better understand clustering from the angle of approximation algorithms based on impurity measures/Bregman divergences. This includes new splitting techniques that reach near-optimal impurity for binary partitions with measures that incorporate Gini impurity and entropy impurity. Additionally, approximation algorithms for these measures that handle more complex k-ary partitions are outlined.

It is proposed that given an instance of k-means where all vectors have an identical L1 norm, any optimal partition for instances of k-means will also be optimal for instances of k-PWGP.
