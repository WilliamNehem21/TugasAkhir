This paper introduces and explores the concept of the complex argument error function (CAEF) in relation to terminal voltage phasors within electrical systems. Section II presents both the definition of the two-dimensional CAEF and a methodology for its measurement, placing special emphasis on the normal CAEF (NCAEF) which is applicable in the steady-state operation of a power plant. Furthermore, this section details the computation methodologies for determining the differential CAEF at terminal voltage phasors using Wirtinger calculus.

In Section III, the focus shifts to the application of CAEF within the context of excitation control for synchronous machines, highlighting how CAEF is employed in this aspect of electrical engineering to improve system performance.

Section IV provides a practical example to demonstrate how the aforementioned excitation control method, which incorporates CAEF, can be utilized to analyze and enhance small-signal stability in electrical power systems.

Finally, the paper culminates with a summary of its findings and conclusions, emphasizing the significance of the introduced concepts and methods for advanced excitation control and stability analysis in modern electrical power systems.
