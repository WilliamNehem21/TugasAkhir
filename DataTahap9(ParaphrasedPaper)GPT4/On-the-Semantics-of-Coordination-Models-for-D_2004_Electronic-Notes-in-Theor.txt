LogOp is a coordination model that builds upon the Linda coordination language, enabling the coordination of operations across multiple and possibly distributed tuple spaces simultaneously. This capability adds expressiveness and flexibility to the traditional Linda model, allowing for complex coordination strategies to be implemented. LogOp's approach addresses key challenges in distributed systems, such as synchronicity, atomicity, interaction locality, and the holistic interpretation of coordination rules.

The LogOp model introduces the notion of extended visibility scopes, which transiently bring together various tuple spaces to form a single coordination domain. This extension of Linda's model is not merely a technical enhancement but also highlights critical issues concerning managing interactions in distributed systems, which are of broader interest in the fields of coordination and distributed systems engineering.

Linda, recognized for its pioneering role and success as a coordination model, strikes a balance between simplicity and expressiveness via its concise set of primitives. Linda has served as the foundation for numerous extensions aimed at addressing the evolving requirements of modern applications, including programmable behavior, transactions, expiring tuples, enhanced scalability, and support for mobile computing.

LogOp introduces operators like XOR and AND to refine the coordination language. The XOR operator ensures that a tuple is inserted, read, or removed from only one of the specified tuple spaces, adding a level of non-determinism. The AND operator allows a process to simultaneously interact with all tuple spaces in a list with a single operation, which is more efficient compared to the multiple operations needed in Linda for multiple tuple spaces.

The paper positions coordination in distributed systems within a framework that comprises three distinct spaces: the coordinated space (housing the entities to be coordinated), the interaction space (where communication events that depict coordination dynamics occur), and the coordination space (where coordination media like tuple spaces reside and interact to facilitate coordination). This conceptual framework suggests viewing coordination models not merely as languages with primitives but as interactive services provided by coordination media.

In summary, LogOp advances the Linda coordination model by adding multi-tuple-space interaction capabilities, addressing core concerns for distributed system coordination such as synchronization, atomic operations, interaction localization, and comprehensive rule interpretation.
