The research paper discusses the use of neural networks for detecting defects in olive leaves. Initially, 500 images from various cameras were compiled and labeled as healthy or defective, then split with 80% used for training and 20% for validation. Data augmentation techniques, such as zooming, rotation, and mirroring, expanded the dataset to 1000 samples. Multiple shuffled and randomized training/validation sets yielded consistent results.

The effectiveness of artificial intelligence in detecting faulty olive leaves was demonstrated, with the Visual Transformer (ViT) model and VGG-16 network achieving 97% accuracy, and ResNet101 achieving 91.8% accuracy. For olive leaf detection, the Faster R-CNN Inception V2 network was employed, and for segmenting the images, the Mask R-CNN R-50-FPN-3x from Detectron 2 was utilized. Both networks were trained on datasets containing both healthy and diseased leaves, and the Inception V3 convolutional neural network was later used for classifying the detected leaves into categories, showing promising results in leaf disease classification.

To further evaluate the tree's health, another network was retrained using a dataset of 3000 leaves (healthy, defective, and unclassifiable), with an augmented dataset of 4500 samples. The training-validation split remained consistent at 80/20, and shuffling was done to check for training inconsistencies.

Initially, the study explored the ability of CNNs to detect defects in leaves. Two networks were then retrained to sample leaves from trees, enabling the assessment of a tree's disease state. A classifier was retrained to distinguish between healthy, sick, and unclassifiable leaves. Both the Mask R-CNN and the Fast R-CNN could detect leaves but also occasionally misidentified other objects like fruits and flowers, which the classifier then had to dismiss. Out-of-focus leaves were deemed unclassifiable.

The latter part of the paper focused on employing neural networks to assess the disease level in an olive tree. Detection and segmentation networks were successful in collecting samples for classification, determining the tree's health. This system was adapted for an embedded system for field use by an operator.

Future work includes improving disease detection in other parts of the olive tree and integrating the device into an autonomous quadricycle to eliminate the need for manual operation and enhance disease mapping over large areas. The ultimate goal is to develop an autonomous fumigation system guided by the detection system's data.
