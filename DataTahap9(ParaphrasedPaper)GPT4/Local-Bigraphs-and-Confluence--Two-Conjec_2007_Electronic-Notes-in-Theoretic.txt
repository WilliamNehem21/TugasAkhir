This paper explores the concept of confluence within the framework of bigraphs, a structure that is seen as potentially significant in representing complex natural and artificial systems including those in biology and pervasive computing. Bigraphs are utilized in this context due to their capacity to handle names with multiple localities, which facilitates the representation of the lambda calculus incorporating explicit substitutions. The study is ongoing, and it aims to identify criteria for bigraphical reactive systems to guarantee confluence. The focus is on addressing the complexity arising from the intertwining of bigraphical reduction pairs (redexes). The aim is to establish conditions that not only ensure confluence within the bigraphical context but also apply to the lambda calculus. The paper concludes by presenting two hypotheses related to the study's goals.
