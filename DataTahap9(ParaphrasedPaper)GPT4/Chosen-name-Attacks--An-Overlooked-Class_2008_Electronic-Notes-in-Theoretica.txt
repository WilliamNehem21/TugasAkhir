In the paper, the authors examine a previously neglected aspect of security protocol analysis called dynamic agent naming, which allows an intruder to assign names to agents within the context of a Dolev-Yao style adversary model. Unlike traditional type-flaw attacks, where agent names are fixed, this capability enables adversaries to create new types of attacks, classified as chosen-name type-flaw attacks.

The paper highlights the difference between two kinds of chosen-name attacks: selected-name and assigned-name. In selected-name attacks, intruders choose arbitrary names for compromised agents, while in assigned-name attacks, intruders can also assign names to honest agents. These differ in their targets and implications; the former focuses on malicious agents manipulating their identities to attack others, while the latter additionally allows the manipulation of honest agentsâ€™ identities and can impact the victims of these honest agents.

One attack scenario demonstrates how an intruder can leverage dynamic naming to gain access to a shared key by tricking honest agents. The authors argue that this new class of attacks, which had not been thoroughly investigated before, could occur alongside more traditional ones like impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.

The authors also review existing methods to detect and prevent simple and complex type flaws, mentioning the challenge of extending current formal models and verification tools to incorporate chosen-name attacks due to the potential infinite domain of agent names. The paper implies a need for updated verification techniques that can deal with the dynamic naming of agents to ensure accurate security protocol analysis.
