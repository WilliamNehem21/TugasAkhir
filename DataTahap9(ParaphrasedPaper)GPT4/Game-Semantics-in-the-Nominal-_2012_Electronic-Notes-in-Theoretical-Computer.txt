The authors of the conference paper acknowledge that it is not feasible to reproduce all the definitions and proofs from the two referenced extensive papers within the constraints of their current publication. They nevertheless assert that the method they have presented should clearly demonstrate how this could be achieved. They make no claim to have rendered the previous work trivial. However, they do contend that their approach to game semantics renders the process faster, more precise, and more transparent.

The paper emphasizes the practical significance of this improved formulation. The authors postulate that their methodology simplifies the implementation and mechanization of game semantics proofs, which can be more readily verified using proof assistants like Isabelle. They believe their definitions are more user-friendly than the originals, facilitating work involving program verification and hardware synthesis, where manual approaches must be supplemented by machine-verified proofs for reasons of scale or safety.

Moving to a specific example, the paper addresses how the deletion operation affects the legality conditions within a certain definition (2.15). It states that while legality is not maintained by arbitrary deletions, deletions are commonly executed in such a manner that legality is preservedâ€”for instance, removing entire sub-trees within an arena. The paper implies that similar strategies can manage other types of deletions.

The paper then critiques the way pointers are conventionally discussed in English in related literature, as seen in the work of Hyland and Ong. As an alternative, the authors suggest using nominal techniques to manage pointers more swiftly and elegantly.

Lastly, the paper serves as a commentary on semantic theories, pointing out that the issues of dangling pointers and compositionality have yet to be fully addressed in the realm of game semantics. The real potential of the nominal model, which is connected to broader concepts such as nominal sets, substitution models, and complex semantic and logical theories, is yet to be uncovered. The true value of applying this theory to domains such as trees with pointers remains to be seen.
