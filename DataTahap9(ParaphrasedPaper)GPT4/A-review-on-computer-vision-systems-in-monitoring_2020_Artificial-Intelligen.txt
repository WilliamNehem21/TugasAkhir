The paper discusses the development and application of computer vision systems in monitoring chicken welfare on farms. The systems consist of camera sensors (using visual light, thermal, and infrared depth-based technologies), image processing boards (digitizers), software (for image analysis with various programming frameworks), and the hardware that includes the various system components. These systems aim to observe chickens and assess welfare by identifying abnormal or disturbed behaviors, which can vary due to the complex individual and time-dependent nature of animals. Current challenges in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) include inconsistent marketing, a lack of cooperation among stakeholders, a focus gap on data interpretation, a technological gap, and the complexity of animal behaviors.

Research has shown that various visual features, such as weight, lameness, and behavior, can be monitored using computer vision. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have been adopted for this purpose, employing algorithms under categories like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Feature selection is crucial for performance, eliminating irrelevant and redundant features. Modeling using regression and classification tasks helps predict outcomes like weight and health status.

Deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recursive neural networks, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and deep belief networks (DBNs) have been applied to tasks such as behavior classification and disease detection. Despite progress, there are still challenges like variable lighting, camera positioning, occlusion, and understanding environmental effects on behavior.

Computer vision systems have also been utilized for weight estimation and locomotor analysis. Weight systems use 2D and 3D imaging to correlate physical features with weight, while monitoring animal mobility helps detect infections and assess wellbeing. However, challenges remain in adapting these systems to complex farm environments and handling varied lighting conditions.

In tracking and behavior analysis, digital systems outperform analog ones, allowing for pattern recognition and behavioral measurements. Advanced algorithms are improving detection in challenging conditions like low resolution and occlusion. Finally, activity levels are measured through pixel changes to infer behavior, with software like EthoVision XT and EyeNamic offering direct monitoring solutions.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the potential of computer vision for improving chicken welfare monitoring but acknowledges that significant challenges and research opportunities persist.
