In simple terms, the academic paper discusses how non-symmetric mathematical spaces, particularly "quasi-uniformities," can be derived from symmetrical spaces known as "uniformities," by removing the requirement of symmetry. This idea is similar to how "quasi-pseudo-metrics" are derived from "pseudo metrics." These spaces have been analyzed in connection with topological groups and have recently become of interest in computer science, following foundational research by Smyth and Sunderhauf.

The paper addresses the challenge of constructing a sound theoretical framework for non-symmetric spaces and their convergence properties. It suggests that comparing these spaces to "enriched categories," which are inherently non-symmetric constructs, might be beneficial. To support this, the paper establishes a link that allows for the application of the concept of Cauchy completion, commonly used in category theory, to topological spaces.

While acknowledging some recent advancements in related research, the paper suggests that these previous works may not fully capture the concept of Cauchy completion as well as the current one does.

The paper then outlines the task of defining appropriate "change of base functors," which are needed to construct a 2-category of enrichments over different bases that can accommodate Cauchy completion. The determination of these functors was accomplished by examining how quasi-uniformly continuous maps influence change of base.

The paper is structured to unite enriched category theory with topology. It begins by exploring the theory of enriched categories and then progresses to discuss quasi-uniformities, with the theoretical meeting point being "canonical" abstract quasi-uniformities.

In one chapter, the authors define a 2-category of enrichments over varying bases with a focus on base monoidal categories that are partial orders. They explore super monoidal functors and their role in defining the 2-category "Enr(H)."

The paper also recaps basic elements of enriched category theory, and presents well-known results to establish a consistent notation and framework. This includes the Cauchy completion of categories enriched over monoidal closed partial orders, which the paper notes can be understood without deep knowledge of enriched category theory.

Finally, the paper proposes a new development of a 2-category of enrichments that captures quasi-uniform spaces and their morphisms, restricting its attention to enrichments over monoidal closed complete partial orders without diving into the specifics of the base monoidal categories. A proof is provided to show that a particular mapping defines an abstract quasi-uniformity and confirms that the Cauchy-completion in this setup aligns with the expected theoretical behavior.
