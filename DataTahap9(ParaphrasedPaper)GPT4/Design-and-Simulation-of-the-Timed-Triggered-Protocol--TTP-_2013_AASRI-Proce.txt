This paper introduces an agent-based approach for the design and simulation of core services associated with the Time-Triggered Protocol (TTP), targeted at automotive distributed embedded systems. These services include the startup algorithm, membership services, message transmission and reception, and the detection and correction of errors. The proposed system is built as a multi-agent system on the JADE platform, utilizing the Organization-based Multi-agent Systems Engineering (O-MASE) methodology. The authors developed an ontology within JADE to enable automatic interpretation of frame fields, which streamlines communication among agents.

The development of TTP emerged from the need for reliable real-time control applications within the automotive sector. TTP itself belongs to a set of field bus protocols emanating from the Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA), which aids in designing fault-tolerant, distributed real-time applications. TTA functions as a logical bus and provides services for organizing applications. Each computer within the network is connected through a TTA controller.

The paper also reviews relevant literature on TTP modeling and simulation, identifying a research gap in using the agent paradigm for simulating TTP services. The authors explore how utilizing this paradigm can effectively model and simulate TTP services.

The TTA consists of clusters with nodes interconnected via a replicated shared media. Communication is managed through gateways, with each node running a portion of the distributed application using the TTP protocol.

Furthermore, due to TTP's complexities, functional and object-oriented methods struggle to address all aspects of the protocol. Therefore, the researchers applied the O-MASE methodology, which extends traditional MASE to support the design of multi-agent organizations. This involved creating goal, organization, role, plan, and protocol models for the agent system.

The implementation employed the JADE platform, selected for its alignment with O-MASE. It facilitated agent behaviors, establishing novel communication protocols, and defining new ontologies. The integration of JADE with Java Eclipse enabled the creation of a graphical interface and implementation of TTP cluster organization, with JADE containers orchestrating the node organization. This approach introduced a new ontology that supported the automatic interpretation of frame fields and automatic message format conversion between agents.

The paper concludes by affirming the effectiveness of using agent-based models to simulate TTP services within a Time-Triggered Architecture and outlines future work to model other automotive protocols like CAN (Controller Area Network) using agent paradigms, including those based on Event-Triggered Architecture (ETA) and hybrid architectures like FlexRay.
