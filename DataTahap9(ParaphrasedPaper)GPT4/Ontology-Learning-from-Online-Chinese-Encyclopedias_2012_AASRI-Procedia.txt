This paper discusses a method for automated ontology creation using Chinese web encyclopedias. Ontologies are crucial for knowledge representation and sharing but manual construction is resource-intensive, requiring experts and is prone to errors. Existing systems like WordNet, Cyc, and Gene Ontology are cited, but in the Chinese context, resources like HowNet have limitations such as size and accessibility.

The authors focus on ontology learning using online Chinese encyclopedias, notably Wikipedia, Baidu Baike, and Hudong Baike, leveraging the vast amount of semi-structured data available as a result of Web 2.0 developments. They differentiate ontology learning based on data structure, targeting semi-structured data.

The proposed method involves downloading articles from the encyclopedias, extracting terms from category systems, resolving synonyms, and creating taxonomies from Chinese Wikipedia and Hudong Baike. For categories not initially included, they form directed graphs using set-theory methods and apply a maximum-spanning-tree algorithm to integrate the results into the taxonomy.

Article titles are used as instances, categorized based on labels contained within. Attributes for concepts and instances are harvested from infobox modules, which are present in a significant portion of articles, especially those about plants.

Experiments validate the methodology, illustrating high precision and extensive coverage for the automatically generated ontologies, offering a much-needed resource for the Chinese language where large-scale free ontologies were previously unavailable.
