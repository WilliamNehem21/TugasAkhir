Meta-variables and their constraints within proof planning can create dependencies among goals. For example, if two goals, j and j', both include the same meta-variable mv, and multi, a system for creating proof plans, assigns mv a value in solving j that inadvertently renders j' unsolvable, the standard response would be to remove j'. However, the more nuanced issue is finding a suitable value for mv. The solution may require modifying part of the subplan for j to provide an alternative value for mv, aligning with a common meta-reasoning approach in handling such dependencies.

Despite its demonstrated value, the adoption of proof planning is slow, attributed to the complexity of knowledge engineering within this domain. Nonetheless, successful applications across different mathematical problems indicate the necessity of this type of reasoning, such as the case of Clam, another proof planner that applies similar failure analysis methods in different mathematical settings, like inducing case splits during inductive theorem proofs.

The strategic element of multi allows for flexibility in addressing failures by employing control rules embodying heuristics that respond to failures, rather than resorting to rigid systematic backtracking. These meta-reasoning patterns offer solutions to overcoming failures and are essential in crafting effective proof plans. Experimentation has shown these patterns to be generally applicable, and their efficacy demonstrates the need for further exploration of strategies that utilize the dynamic control capabilities of multi.

Criticisms of the technical and conceptual aspects of failure reasoning in proof planning systems are addressed by separating control rules from particular methods. These rules are declarative and independent, assessing the proof plan and other contextual information without being tethered to specific steps or strategies. They guide the application of methods and strategies to amend failures without being embedded within specific procedures.

The idea of control reasoning in multi also aligns with practices found in sophisticated blackboard systems, where when a coveted knowledge source is blocked, failure reasoning can trigger other knowledge sources that enable the initial desired action.

In summary, proof planning requires a flexible handling of failures through a meta-reasoning approach, which involves adapting plans in response to constraints on shared meta-variables. The system's ability to analyze failures through control rules without predetermined systematic backtracking is a critical feature that enables it to identify and suggest strategic modifications to overcome such failures.
