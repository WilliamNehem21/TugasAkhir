Our methodology adopts a similar foundation but enhances player identification in soccer by incorporating domain-specific knowledge to bypass the intensive sliding-window strategy. Drawing inspiration from the Aspogamo concept, we infuse our observation model with more adaptable attributes like the HOG detector, while eliminating the need for manual initialization. Our approach is akin to a previously proposed technique that focuses only on player detection without considering temporal tracking.

We autonomously generate color templates guided by FIFA regulations which ensure the clear distinction between jerseys of opposing teams, referees, and goalkeepers. This is realized by initially crafting outfit-specific color templates through color histogram analysis.

For tracking, we predict the object's location and seek the position of highest confidence. If a higher confidence value is found elsewhere, the search iterates from that optimal location. If not, the search concludes, accepting the current position as the endpoint. This time-efficient, greedy method typically halts within 2-3 cycles and has proven to yield effective results.

We employ multi-target tracking utilizing individual Kalman filters for each bounding box. These filters are updated using a new measurement that is derived through an optimization process oriented by a confidence map, which begins from the projected Kalman position. Additionally, we introduce and remove targets using deterministic heuristics reliant on the confidence map.
