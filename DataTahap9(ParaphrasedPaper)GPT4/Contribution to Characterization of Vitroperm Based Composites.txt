The research investigates the physical, mechanical, and electrical properties of composites made from Vitroperm (Fe73Cu1Nb3Si16B7) flaky powder mixed with phenol-formaldehyde resin. The Vitroperm powder particles exhibited flaky shapes with an average size of about 200 micrometers and a thickness around 20 micrometers. Researchers prepared two variants of the composite by incorporating different amounts and types of resin: dry-mixed Vitroperm powder with phenol-formaldehyde resin, further treated with acetone homogenization (VPM/ATM), and Vitroperm powder mixed with a modified resin solution of phenol-formaldehyde, glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO), and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in tetrahydrofuran (VPM/PFRGT).

Optical microscopy, using a combination of normal and polarized light, helped distinguish between pores, resin, and Vitroperm particles in the composite. The study found that resin distribution was more even in composites with higher resin content and that the angular shape of the particles contributed to micro-heterogeneity. The best resin particle distribution and lowest porosity were seen in the VPM/PFRGT composite with 3% modified resin.

Mechanical property analysis showed an improvement with increasing resin content. The VPM/PFRGT sample displayed the best mechanical properties, attributed to the chemical stabilization provided by the addition of GLYMO and TEOS, which performed better than using a dispersed solid filler, which tends to reduce mechanical properties and requires a longer curing cycle.

The study also measured volume resistivity and found that it increased with resin content. This is due to reduced porosity and better bonding of particles, which act as insulators, resulting in the correspondence between improved mechanical properties and increased resistivity. Higher resistivity was associated with reduced eddy current losses, although hysteresis losses increased with porosity and resin volume in the composite.

The research concludes that composite physical properties depend on both the resin content and the filler used or the in-situ modification of the resin during the compaction process. While high resin content enhances electrical resistivity and mechanical strength, it may also lead to increased hysteresis losses. To optimize the physical properties of soft magnetic composites (SMCs), a balance is necessary between the composite's resin and filler content, chemical modification of the resin, and optimization of the curing cycle.
