This academic paper discusses the verification of Abstract State Machine (ASM) refinements using generalized forward simulations. The key contribution of the paper is the demonstration that a completeness proof for ASM refinement is possible, even though standard techniques like adding history information or using the powerset construction are not applicable since these methods do not preserve termination or may introduce infinite runs.

The paper introduces a method for forecasting nondeterministic choices to streamline the verification process. This is accomplished by transferring all nondeterministic aspects of a concrete operation to its initial state, either semantically through a "prophecy automaton" or syntactically by removing the 'choose' construct in ASMs and replacing it with choice functions.

A rundown of the foundational concepts related to ASM refinement is provided, detailing how a higher-order variant of dynamic logic is employed in the KIV system to express proof obligations. The paper also presents an improved criterion for generalized forward simulations.

The main result of the paper is that generalized forward simulation can verify any ASM refinement without the need for backward simulation â€“ a technique that was previously believed to be necessary for completeness proofs but does not preserve termination. The authors demonstrate that it is possible to verify ASM refinements with arbitrary mappings from abstract operations to concrete operations by predicting the outcomes of nondeterministic decisions.

Overall, the paper extends the theoretical framework for ASM refinements, making it more versatile and pragmatically useful for verifying complex systems where nondeterminism and infinite executions need to be considered.
