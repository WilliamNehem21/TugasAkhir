This academic paper presents the use of an event algebra to define complex triggering conditions in embedded systems. The algebra has straightforward declarative semantics and documented algebraic properties, enabling both formal and informal reasoning while ensuring efficient implementation in resource-constrained environments. The paper proposes incorporating this algebra within a component model, automating the detection of complex event patterns and generating detection code at compile-time, which is particularly useful when the source code of components is not accessible.

The paper is structured as follows:
- Section 2 reviews related work.
- Section 3 introduces SAVECCM, the context for the proposed extension.
- Section 4 offers an informal explanation of the event algebra and its integration into SAVECCM.
- Section 5 delves into a formal presentation of the event algebra and discusses its impact on the extended component model.
- Section 6 concludes the paper.

Furthermore, the paper compares the proposed method with other technologies, such as Philips' Koala, a component model improved in the RoboCOP project, and PECOS, a project aimed at creating technology suited for field devices. It also describes different triggering mechanisms used in both component-based architectures and broader applications, including distributed systems' event-driven architectures with publisher-subscriber models.

A detailed description of the system's execution process is provided, explaining how activation and data transmission through components occur and ensuring the preservation of triggering conditions, precedence relations, and communication during task allocation for compile-time analysis.

The paper advocates for extended triggering mechanisms through the event algebra, reducing the need for creating new components each time a new triggering condition arises. The formal semantics of this new event element are yet to be fully developed, but the proposed method is expected to result in minimal overhead and more efficient code generation.

The authors indicate ongoing work to refine the semantics for the event element and adjust the prototype tool accordingly. Case studies are also planned to assess the effectiveness of the method and identify potential enhancements.
