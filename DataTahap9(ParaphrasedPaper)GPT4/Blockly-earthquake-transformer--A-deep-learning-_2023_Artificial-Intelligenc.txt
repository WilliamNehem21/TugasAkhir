This academic paper discusses the importance of validation in developing a reliable phase picker model for seismic data analysis. The standard practice is to hold back 20% of the data from the training process to use as a validation set. The validation set helps determine the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. The outcomes of validation can lead to a model being accepted, fine-tuned, or rejected. If a model is rejected, the training process is revisited, and the model's architecture or parameters are revised. This cycle of training and validation continues until a satisfactory model is established, which also tends to speed up convergence during model training.

The paper mentions a feature in the phase picker channels that allows users to either utilize default P and S pickers or to select additional channel identifiers based on the available labels in the training metadata. BET, the tool referenced in the paper, automatically adjusts the output channels according to the chosen identifications. Users also have the option to repurpose the default labels to train models for differentiating between man-made and natural seismic events.

An experiment cited in the paper demonstrated that the deep learning (DL) model accurately predicted high probabilities for the correct timing of P and S wave arrivals based on data from a specific seismic event. This event was cataloged by the NEDB at station CN.BTB.

The paper also emphasizes the growth of DL applications in seismology, highlighting the BET platform as a user-friendly tool that enables a broader audience, including non-experts, to employ DL pickers without the need for extensive computational resources or technical expertise. BET is expected to enhance model performance and refine earthquake catalogs. It could serve as a prototype for creating similar packages for other seismological tasks, especially where labeled data is scarce, and synthetic data augmentation is vital. The potential of BET extends to distinguishing between natural earthquakes and man-made events, by developing specialized training datasets for each type.
