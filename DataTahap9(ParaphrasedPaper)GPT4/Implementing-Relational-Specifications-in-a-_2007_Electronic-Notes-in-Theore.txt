Relation algebra has been extensively used in mathematics and computer science to address a range of problems due to its effective modeling capabilities for various data structures, such as graphs and databases. Examples and references on its application are well-documented in the literature.

The programming language Curry combines multiple declarative programming styles, enhancing Haskell with additional features like partial data structures and a unique evaluation strategy. It uses lazy evaluation, augmented by nondeterministic variable instantiation, and supports both narrowing and residuation strategies, which are dependent on the function's intended use.

The library CLPB in Curry includes numerous functions geared towards boolean constraints. A subset of these functions for Boolean lattice structures is straightforward, whereas others represent comparison relations between boolean values, with 'false' being deemed less than 'true'.

This paper outlines the implementation of relation algebra for finite binary relations in Curry using boolean matrices. This representation seamlessly integrates into Curry's functional logic, taking advantage of its higher-order capabilities to elegantly define operations, predicates, and constants.

The paper specifies relation types as boolean matrix-based datatypes, allowing the use of an efficient constraint solver to address relational problems. Key features include functions for relational inclusion, list creation with 'replicate', and the powerful 'find' function that enables nondeterministic searches for relations meeting specific conditions.

Examples and practical experiments with Curry, conducted on a PowerPC G4 processor with 768 MB of memory (though limited to 256 MB by the system), illustrate the concepts. In one example, Curry's logic capabilities are left unused in implementing relational specification for finding the least element in a set. Other examples highlight the usage of nondeterministic features in Curry for solving scheduling problems in computer science.

Although not intended to outperform dedicated algorithms in efficiency, the approach prioritizes ease of relational specification execution with reasonable performance for small-scale problems, showing a clear advantage when using a constraint solver as opposed to a narrowing-based implementation without such a solver.

In conclusion, this study showcases how Curry can facilitate relation algebra implementation and relational specification prototyping, combining the strengths of functional programming and constraint solving. The use of higher-order functions and algebraic datatypes in functional logic languages allows for a high level of constraint generation abstraction, merging it with nondeterministic constraint solving for an elegant, efficient, and declarative coding approach.
