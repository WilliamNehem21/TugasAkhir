The paper presents innovative methods for quantifying cybersecurity risks to inform decisions on mitigating vulnerabilities. These methods utilize data gathered from various online cybersecurity databases. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repository is highlighted as a key source that lists vulnerability reports enhanced by Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores. Additionally, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides more analytical information; however, relying solely on CVE or NVD might introduce bias, as they may disregard evolving vulnerability properties over time and across different deployment environments. To overcome this, data from manufacturers, security reviews, and online forums can be integrated to enhance CVSS scores.

The paper introduces a machine learning (ML) algorithm developed to compute vulnerability severity scores, which are then compared to those found in repositories like NVD and SecurityFocus. Multiple data sources, such as the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), are utilized to ensure a comprehensive severity assessment.

A novel ML-based structure is proposed for automating vulnerability assessments, which adjusts compatibility issues with CVSS scores using a majority voting system. This allows for consistency in vulnerability evaluation across different CVSS versions.

The paper is structured into several sections, starting with background information, then discussing vulnerability data sources and the existing CVSS assessment process. A prototype for assessing vulnerabilities reconciles CVSS scores with other security alerts and text-mining techniques to understand vulnerability reports.

The methodology is evaluated using case studies on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) vulnerabilities. Sources like NVD and Shodan (targeting CPS and IoT security) provide data for these studies. An example involving a Siemens PLC product demonstrates how vulnerabilities can be assessed using CVSS scores.

The paper acknowledges potential biases in NVD-based assessments and suggests leveraging various perspectives from vendors and third-party security analysts. The classification of CVSS metrics and a case study on prominent CPS components illustrate the proposed method's ability to streamline vulnerability-severity scoring.

The results of this work, including a case study focusing on CPS vulnerabilities, confirm that different cybersecurity data sources reveal diverse vulnerability patterns. These differences could mislead cybersecurity decision-making regarding patch prioritization and budget allocation. Therefore, an approach that correlates multiple data sources is necessary to enhance overall cybersecurity awareness and effectiveness.
