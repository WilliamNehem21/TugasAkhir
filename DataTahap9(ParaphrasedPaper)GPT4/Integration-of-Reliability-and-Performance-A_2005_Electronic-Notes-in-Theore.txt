In the paper, the authors discuss a novel strategy to maintain consistency when specifying various aspects of a system that requires analysis, particularly in the context of telecom software. The burgeoning number of tools for modeling and analyzing telecom software prompts an investigation into semi-automatic integration methods, seeking to minimize the end-user's workload. The ideal scenario described entails a designer providing only one description in a familiar language, from which specific specifications for analyzing different aspects, such as reliability and performance, can be automatically generated.

The paper highlights the potential of leveraging recent advancements in Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) and XML technology to automate the construction of these integrated toolsets. Demonstrating the method's effectiveness, the authors apply it within the development of new services using the active network paradigm, focusing on integrating capabilities from the model checker SPIN and the network simulator NS2.

The authors acknowledge the traditional formal methods community's challenge of handling disparate system descriptions tailored to varied tasks like safety analysis, performance evaluation, or code generation. While a universal formal description for all tasks is ideal, it imposes the demand for specialized algorithms and tools, potentially complicating the matter for non-experts.

To address this, the authors explore intermediate representation languages as a method of integration, which serve as a common denominator for a majority of existing tools and methods. Such intermediate languages facilitate communication among different tools by abstracting common tasks like model checking and automatic code generation.

The paper outlines how XML technologies can aid in the development of tools like parsers or code generators, specifically in the realm of telecom services and active network analysis. The authors then describe their methodology, which leans on MDA and XML, to seamlessly generate tool-specific code for users.

The document is structured into five sections, covering the authors' past experiences with active networks analysis, insights into MDA and XML for tool integration, a comparison with related work, and finally, a summary of conclusions and planning for future work.

In the context of active network services development, the current practice involves implementing services in Java without prior in-depth analysis, with real network testing used to verify functional and timing properties. The authors aim to create a flexible exchange language to conduct different types of analysis using various tools.

The paper concludes by indicating that future work will involve broadening the behavior metamodel to integrate additional analysis tools, enhancing the metamodel's flexibility, and establishing mapping rules for the generation of verification tools. The intention is to continue expanding on using formal methods to ensure reliability and performance modeling in active networks, as well as to improve the integration of various formal method tools into a cohesive and robust methodology for systems analysis.
