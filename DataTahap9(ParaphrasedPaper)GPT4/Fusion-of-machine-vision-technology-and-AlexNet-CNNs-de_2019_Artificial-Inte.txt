The production of apples is significant globally, with their output being the second highest according to FAO data in 2013. While the application of pesticides can boost apple yields, it introduces concerns about food safety due to potential pesticide residue, which has been a major focus in the food safety sector. A novel and efficient method utilizing hyperspectral imaging and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been developed for detecting pesticide residues on apples, leveraging the multiple spectral bands available in hyperspectral technology.

The study involved classifying four types of pesticide residues (chlorpyrifos, two mixed pesticides, carbendazim, and an inactive control) across samples with rich spectral data. To enhance the diversity of hyperspectral images, gaussian white noise was added, increasing the dataset's size. These samples were split into training and testing sets using the bootstrap sampling method, ensuring distinct datasets for model validation.

The chosen CNN architecture, mostly inspired by AlexNet, consisted of five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers, supplemented by max-pooling layers to effectively utilize feature information. A softmax function with four perceptrons was used for categorization, corresponding to the four distinct pesticide residue types being examined.

The effectiveness of this CNN-based approach was compared to traditional image classification methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Despite the challenge of classifying apples with similar appearances in the same spectral band, it was found that the CNN model, particularly when employing increased feature detail in the convolutional layers, outperformed traditional methods both in accuracy and time efficiency.

The study suggests potential improvements, such as increasing the specificity of the convolutional neural network's kernel features for better accuracy, especially for similar spectral images in the same band. Finally, all authors involved in the study declared no conflicts of interest.
