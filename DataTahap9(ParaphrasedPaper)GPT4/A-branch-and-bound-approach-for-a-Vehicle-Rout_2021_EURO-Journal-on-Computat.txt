The paper addresses a crucial aspect of railway maintenanceâ€”the scheduling of tamping operations to optimize travel costs for crews and machinery, and to reduce costs related to poor track conditions. This scheduling challenge is formulated as a special kind of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with additional time-dependent customer costs that penalize service limitations (VRP-CC).

Conventional methods struggle to solve this unique objective function, so the authors present a new branch-and-bound approach tailored to this problem. They propose two branching strategies: one that appends a job at the end of a route, and another that includes a job within a route. Additionally, they establish different lower bounds for customer and travel costs and assess their effectiveness.

One trick presented is the use of the lower bounds technique to prune the solution space. By calculating lower bounds that are tighter than known solutions, subsets of the solution space can be discarded. A strong set of lower bounds makes this approach efficient and improves the overall computation time.

Branch-and-bound methods of related problems are reviewed, highlighting approaches like depth-first search branching, Lagrangian techniques for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), and relaxations that produce bounds that can be calculated in polynomial time.

The authors discuss computational performance in detail, including the various lower bounds and branching strategies. They compare these strategies through computational experiments. The branches are explored both in terms of their search tree properties and their practical computation performance. 

The paper reveals that the branch-and-bound strategies proposed outperform commercial solvers like CPLEX for the specific VRP-CC instance, notably when customer costs heavily influence the solution structure. The authors suggest that future improvements could come from developing better bounds, particularly for customer costs, and examining whether alternative bounds could further enhance branch-and-bound performance.

They conclude that a more refined understanding of the lower bounds as they pertain to both customer and travel costs could yield even more successful branch-and-bound approaches for this class of vehicle routing problems.
