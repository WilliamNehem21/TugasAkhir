This academic paper investigates a subset of irreversible cellular automata (CA) that possess multiple single-length cycle attractors and their application in creating efficient CA-based solutions for various real-world applications. The primary focus is on characterizing 1-dimensional cellular automata with point states, which are single-length cycle attractors, for such purposes.

The authors introduce a method known as the reachability tree, utilized to identify the pertinent properties of these attractors and the so-called pseudo-exhaustive (PE) bits that define them. By establishing a theoretical framework, the paper outlines strategies for constructing cellular automata with a specific set of PE bits that correspond to having only single-length cycle attractors.

This research not only presents a linear time solution for synthesizing a CA with given attractors and PE bits but also demonstrates its practical effectiveness through experiments, particularly in the development of pattern classifiers for a wide array of applications.

Stephen Wolfram's pioneering work in the early 1980s on simple 1-dimensional cellular automata capable of exhibiting complex behavior is acknowledged, alongside a discussion of the existing research into linear/additive CA which offered the groundwork for this study. The current work expands on this foundation to deal with nonlinear cellular automata.

The paper outlines the procedure for identification and synthesis of these CA systems, including a linear time algorithm for determining the number of attractors, PE bits identification, and more. The authors also elaborate on the application of their findings in pattern classification tasks, providing a step-by-step guide to designing an effective pattern classifier inspired by the synthesized CA.

In summary, the paper contributes a novel characterization of single-length cycle attractors within the CA state space and suggests a practical methodology for CA synthesis that can be utilized in various applications, with a focus on improving the efficiency of pattern classification systems.
