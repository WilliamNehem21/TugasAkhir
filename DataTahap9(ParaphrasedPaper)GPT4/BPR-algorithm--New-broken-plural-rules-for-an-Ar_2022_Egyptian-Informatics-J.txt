Stemming, a vital process in natural language systems, significantly affects their performance, especially in complex languages like Arabic, known for its intricate inflection and derivation. This study introduces an advanced stemmer for Arabic, integrating a novel Broken Plural Rule (BPR) algorithm with extra rules and a subset rule mechanism. It also adds a new pre-processing stage for removing Arabized words.

The paper is structured into various sections that include reviews of relevant literature, a discussion on prior ISRI contributions, and an explanation of the methods this research employs. The findings from experiments are detailed to validate the new algorithm, followed by an analysis that compares the new stemmer with two existing Arabic stemmers. The conclusion outlines the results.

The work also addresses the use of stopwords, which are inconsequential from a content perspective but can impact processes like information retrieval and ontology construction. Adjustments to previous stemming algorithms by Al-Lahham et al. and Alshalabi et al. are acknowledged for their improvements in precision. Taghva et al.'s research is mentioned in reference to affix sets, while Syarief et al.'s work is noted for enhancing the ISRI stemmer's handling of two-letter words, resulting in a 7.3% increase in performance.

The paper presents a rule-based development utilizing the new BPR within an enhanced ISRI stemmer, named ISRI+ BPR. This development entails steps such as normalization, stopword and Arabized words removal, followed by the application of BPR. The BPR rules, informed by Arabic grammar accuracy, are devised to tackle issues with stemming broken plural formsâ€”a historical weakness in root-based approaches. Experimental evidence shows that the ISRI+ BPR stemmer outperforms existing stemmers, as indicated by improved metrics such as precision, recall, and f-measure.
