In this academic paper, the authors develop an extension of classical fixed-point logic by incorporating relations instead of operators, with the goal of representing nondeterminism in logical systems. They argue that a loop in a relation can serve as a fixed-point for nondeterminism, whereby x is a fixed-point of a relation R if the pair (x, x) is in R.

The paper introduces the concept of the initial fixed-point of an inflationary relation (R), along with the RIFP operator, which signifies the first-order logic with the inflationary relational fixed-point operator. The authors present that RIFP is powerful enough to express the entire polynomial hierarchy by providing a translation to second-order logic.

Furthermore, the authors examine a restricted version of RIFP, termed RIFP_1, where the RIFP operator can be used only once. They prove that RIFP_1 captures the complexity class NP and offer a comparison between their logic and the nondeterministic fixed-point logic previously proposed by Abiteboul, Vianu, and Vardi.

The paper emphasizes how this connection between logic and computational complexity serves as a bridge between finite model theory and complexity theory, suggesting that techniques from one domain can potentially solve problems in the other. This is particularly relevant in areas where logical resources (like quantification or fixed-point operators) are related to computational resources (such as nondeterminism or processing time).

The relational database model, which is central to both database theory and finite model theory, is used to illustrate the practical significance of logical languages for database queries. The authors address the question of the complexity associated with decision problems defined by sets of finite models of logical sentences, highlighting the relevance of logics like first-order logic to complexity classes such as the logarithmic-time hierarchy.

The main focus of the paper is on inflationary relations, which the authors treat as an analogue to inflationary fixed-point logic. They review fixed-point theory and logic basics before defining important concepts within relational fixed-point theory. They then introduce the relational inflationary fixed-point logic (RIFP), describing its syntax, semantics, and concrete problem expressions.

Further sections demonstrate that RIFP encompasses the polynomial hierarchy and that its fragment RIFP_1 captures NP. The authors compare RIFP with the previously mentioned NIFP logic and conclude by suggesting future research directions.
