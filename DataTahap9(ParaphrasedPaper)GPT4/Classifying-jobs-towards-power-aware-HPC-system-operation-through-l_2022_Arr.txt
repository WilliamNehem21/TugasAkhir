This academic paper is structured as follows:

- Section 2 presents an overview of the K computer, its file I/O subsystems, and electricity use metrics.
- Section 3 analyzes correlations using log data from past jobs.
- Section 4 proposes a machine learning-based model for prediction.
- Section 5 reviews related works.
- The conclusion and future work are discussed in section 6.

Main points from the paper:

- The K computer has two levels of storage: Local File System (LFS) for temporary high-performance storage during computations and Global File System (GFS) for storing data and programs with higher redundancy, both constructed using an enhanced Fujitsu Exabyte File System (FEFS) based on Lustre version 1.8.
- The ratio of disk utilization to allocated space provides insights into the file I/O activity and is inversely related to the electric power consumption, which is higher for compute-intensive jobs.
- Analyses of the K computer's job statistics can reveal patterns in electric power use, aiding in more power-efficient High-Performance Computing (HPC) operations.
- Python and SciPy modules were used to evaluate the correlation between file I/O activities and electric power consumption.
- The paper describes a methodology where 75% of data is used for training and the balance for testing, ensuring the data distribution characteristics are consistent between them.

Results and analysis:

- The Random Forest Classifier (RFC) performed best in classification with scores of roughly 0.945, 0.832, and 0.944 for jobs with high power levels in one-dimensional, malleable three-dimensional, and all cases, respectively.
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNC) scored highest at 0.942 in the fixed three-dimensional case, but RFC was close with 0.929.
- Job classifications might benefit from being performed separately per node layout due to variations in the results between different cases.
- At a threshold of 30 watts, high classification scores were reported. However, distinguishing jobs at thresholds of 50 or 40 watts was less successful, except in cases of three-dimensional node layout with layout changes.
- RFC was identified as the superior model for classifying HPC jobs by electric power levels per compute node, particularly at threshold levels such as 60 or 30 watts.

The paper concludes with these findings and hints at potential directions for future research.
