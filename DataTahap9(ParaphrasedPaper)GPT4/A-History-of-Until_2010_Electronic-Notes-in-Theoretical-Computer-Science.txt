This academic paper discusses the development and use of a labeled natural deduction system for linear-time logic that includes a new history operator. This system allows for the formalization of deduction systems for temporal logics with the until operator. By using labeled deduction, the authors provide an explicit way to encode semantic or proof-theoretical information directly within the formulas. For example, a labeled formula 'b: a' indicates that the proposition 'a' is true at the time instant labeled 'b' in the corresponding Kripke semanticsâ€”a framework commonly used for modeling modal and temporal logics.

The labels serve not only to mark when formulas are considered true but also to track relationships between different time instants, like 'bRc', which suggests a temporal accessibility from instant 'b' to instant 'c'. The paper argues that this labeled approach results in deduction systems with desirable proof-theoretical characteristics and can effectively manage the modalities found in non-classical logics.

Furthermore, the authors show that their labeled natural deduction system, when combined with a proper translation, is sound and complete with respect to linear temporal logic (LTL) that includes the until operator. The paper promises full proofs, which due to space constraints, are not provided in full within the text itself but are available in an external resource.

In the final section of the paper, the authors conclude their findings and offer insights into ongoing and future research directions aimed at expanding and refining this approach to temporal logic deduction.
