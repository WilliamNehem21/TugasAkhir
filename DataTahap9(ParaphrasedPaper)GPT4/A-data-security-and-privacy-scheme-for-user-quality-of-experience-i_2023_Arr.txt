This paper discusses enhancing privacy and security within a network infrastructure, specifically focusing on ensuring an excellent user Quality of Experience (QoE) by maintaining secure and private communication. The authors aim to improve the security of the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) architecture they previously proposed and provide a proof of concept for their security scheme. 

The paper is structured as follows: 

- Section 2 offers a review of existing literature on security and data privacy in MEC infrastructures.
- Section 3 details the proposed solution for enhancing data security and privacy in MEC.
- Section 4 describes the simulation results that support the effectiveness of the proposed security scheme.
- Section 5 concludes the study.

To assess the security scheme, the authors employed the AVISPA tool, which is known for validating secure internet protocols and applications. The tool can identify various security threats, including man-in-the-middle attacks, through a range of back-end analysis techniques. 

After evaluating existing security schemes, the authors conclude that their approach provides superior security. The paperâ€™s primary objective is to introduce a secure data and privacy scheme that improves user QoE in an MEC-based Autonomous Vehicular Network (AVNet) by leveraging technologies such as SDN, NFV, SFC, and NS. 

The authors proposed an architecture for AVNET that utilizes current technologies, devised a security scheme to protect data and user privacy, and then explored the security properties their scheme provides. In proving the scheme's effectiveness, the AVISPA tool was used, while simulation results highlighted the benefits of the scheme in terms of computational cost, albeit showing a less favorable outcome for the communication aspect. Nevertheless, the findings recommend the newly-designed security scheme for its realistic approach and lack of reliance on a pre-existing secure channel for admitting vehicles and mobile stations to the network, making it more appropriate for the type of network considered, i.e., a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET).
