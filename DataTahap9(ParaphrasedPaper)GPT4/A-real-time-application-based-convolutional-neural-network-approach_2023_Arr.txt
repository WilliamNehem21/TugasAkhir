This academic study focuses on the precise and timely detection of tomato leaf diseases, which are significant factors affecting tomato crop yields and the agricultural economy. The researchers introduced a lightweight custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model and leveraged transfer learning (TL) models VGG-16 and VGG-19 to classify various tomato leaf diseases across eleven classes, including a healthy class. They conducted an ablation study to determine the optimal parameters for their model and used evaluation metrics to compare its performance against the TL-based models.

The study's findings reveal that by using data augmentation techniques, their proposed model achieved an accuracy and recall of 95.00%, the highest among all tested models. Subsequently, the most effective model was implemented in web-based and Android-based end-to-end (E2E) systems to assist tomato farmers with disease classification.

The paper goes on to outline related work in the field of tomato disease classification using machine learning and deep-learning techniques. It discusses how various researchers have adopted different CNN architectures and ML algorithms to classify plant diseases and highlights their results. For instance, some studies achieved high accuracy using transfer learning and deep learning models, while others combined DL with traditional ML techniques or feature extraction methods.

Ultimately, the best-performing model from the current study was deployed on a web platform and an Android application to provide farmers with an accessible tool for identifying tomato leaf diseases, taking advantage of the model's rapid and accurate prediction capabilities. The study concludes with the provision of open access to the developed smartphone-based Android application via a GitHub repository, and it emphasizes the importance of the model's high accuracy and practical implementation for helping farmers manage diseases in tomato cultivation.
