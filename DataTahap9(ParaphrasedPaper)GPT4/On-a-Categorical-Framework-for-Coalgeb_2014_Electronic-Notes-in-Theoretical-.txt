The paper presents a unified approach to coalgebraic logic by introducing a class of one-step semantic frameworks. These frameworks are designed to work with varying methods of coalgebraic logic, depending on a contravariant functor that maps a state space to its corresponding set of predicates, complete with logical connectives. It explores constructing coalgebraic logics through combinatory methods such as colimits, limits, and tensor products, and expands on existing results concerning predicate liftings.

Additionally, the paper introduces an extension to predicate liftings, used to define modalities in the logic. It asserts the existence of a complete axiomatization for the logic that encompasses all predicate liftings for any coalgebra type, assuming certain standard conditions are met. This logic is termed one-step expressive when dealing with finitary functors. It also shows that combining or composing one-step expressive coalgebraic logics through colimits maintains one-step expressiveness.

In a specific remark (Remark 2.12), the paper notes that in some categories like Set or the category of vector spaces over a field k (denoted Vec_k), every finitely generated algebra is freely generated. This implies finitary functors have a finite basis. It also states that every finitary endofunctor of Boolean algebras is naturally isomorphic to a functor based on a finite number of elements for non-trivial Boolean algebras. However, this relationship does not universally apply as evidenced by a referenced counterexample.

The paper also comments on the justification for a point-free expression of their formulations, referring to a section in another work for a more detailed explanation â€” this refers to certain mathematical conditions involving factorisation systems. Lastly, it simplifies the upcoming discussion by assuming the set X is concrete, although it acknowledges this doesn't necessarily infer the existence of kernel pairs, which are used in category theory to generalize the notion of 'elements' in algebraic structures.
