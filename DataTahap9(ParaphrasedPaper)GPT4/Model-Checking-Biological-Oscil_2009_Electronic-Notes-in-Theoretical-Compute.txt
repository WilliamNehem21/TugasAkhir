The paper addresses the widespread natural occurrence of synchronization in large populations of interacting components within physical, biological, chemical, and social systems. Biology provides several examples such as pacemaker cells in the heart, the nervous system, and groups of fireflies flashing in unison, which are also discussed in Strogatz's book. Synchronized collective behavior is particularly important in systems biology for developing methods to control system dynamics and attain desired traits. The distributed synchronization in biological systems is commonly modeled using coupled oscillators, an approach developed by Art Winfree, Charles S. Peskin, and Yoshiki Kuramoto, with each population member represented as an independent phase oscillator.

The paper introduces the Kuramoto Synchronization Logic (KSL) to define synchronization properties for simulation-based studies of Kuramoto model oscillators. It also proposes a model-checking algorithm for KSL, which is tested using a prototype simulator and model checker developed by the authors.

The paper is organized into several sections. Section 2 presents related work and the Kuramoto model, while Section 3 recalls timed automata, defines oscillator timed automata, and outlines the interaction semantics. Section 4 discusses the KSL and its model-checking algorithm. An analysis example is presented in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes with potential future research directions.

For decades, mathematical models have explored spontaneous synchronization phenomena in populations of biological coupled oscillators, inspired by real biological systems like cardiac and circadian pacemaker cells, flashing fireflies, and wave propagation in various biological systems. Mutual synchronization can be mediated by impulsive interactions or smooth interactions.

Peskin originally studied a system of pulse-coupled oscillators that communicate through sudden pulse-like interactions, such as a neuron firing. He developed a model for the synchronization of sinoatrial node pacemaker cells, proving synchronization for two identical oscillators and proposing that this would extend to any number. Mirollo and Strogatz later confirmed this for any number of oscillators. Peskin suspected synchronization would also occur among non-identical oscillators, but this remains unresolved.

The paper employs timed safety automata with state invariants, a common tool for modeling and verification that incorporates a strong fairness notion. These are used to define oscillator timed automata and interaction semantics, which are crucial for ensuring accurate measurements and interactions between oscillators within the system.

The authors highlight their intentions to use hybrid automata for modeling oscillators, fully implement a model checker and simulator for KSL, and, in the long term, apply this extended logic model checking alongside detection techniques to control fibrillation in networks of cardiac cells.
