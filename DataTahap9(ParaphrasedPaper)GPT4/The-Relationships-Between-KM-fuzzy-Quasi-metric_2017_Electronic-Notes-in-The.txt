This paper examines the interplay between KM-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and the order structures of formal balls linked with them. The study introduces two concepts: Yoneda T-completeness and Yoneda S-completeness in the context of KM-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces. It is shown that for both types of completeness, the corresponding partially ordered sets (posets) of formal balls exhibit directed completeness. Particularly, within a specific subset of KM-fuzzy quasi-metric spaces, these forms of completeness are defined via the directed completeness of their connected posets of formal balls.

The paper provides Remark 2.12 to offer readers further insight into Theorem 2.11. It also highlights the existence of certain fuzzy quasi-metric spaces where none of the maps in the characteristic family represent a standard quasi-metric, citing an exceptional example.

Overall, the focus of the paper is to delve into the correlation between fuzzy quasi-metric spaces and their associated formal ball order structures. By defining Yoneda T-completeness and Yoneda S-completeness, the paper investigates how completeness in fuzzy quasi-metric spaces relates to the order-theoretical properties of the posets of formal balls.
