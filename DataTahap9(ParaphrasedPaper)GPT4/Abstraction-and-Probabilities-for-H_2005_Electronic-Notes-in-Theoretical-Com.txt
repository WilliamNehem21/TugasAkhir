In our study, we introduced propositional hybrid logics as advancements over conventional propositional temporal logics, furnishing them with capabilities to label and reassign particular states. We proceeded to develop and validate a reliable relational abstraction approach tailored for hybrid Kripke frameworks, alongside a hybrid iteration of computation tree logic. We also stimulated debate on the conceptualization of hybrid labeled Markov chains and delineated the syntax and semantics pertinent to a probabilistic computation tree logic within this hybrid context. We advocate that the abstraction methods designed for hybrid Kripke structures should be adaptable.
