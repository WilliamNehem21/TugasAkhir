Criminology research indicates that crime isn't evenly distributed among people or locations, and many crimes are committed by individuals with prior offenses. Approximately half of all U.S. crimes involve repeat offenders. Studies also suggest considerable overlap between those who are victims and those who are arrested. Notably, individuals who have been victims of crimes, especially violent ones, face a higher risk of experiencing another crime soon after. The current study aims to contribute to an initiative between the Chicago Police Department and Illinois Institute of Technology researchers to predict future violent crime among those with criminal histories by examining the possibility of an interpersonal "near-repeat effect."

Researchers have previously observed patterns of repeat crimes in shootings and burglaries, showing proximity in time and space increases the likelihood of recurrence. Social networks are now being explored for their role in crime, as emotions, peer influence, and the distribution of items like drugs and weapons all contribute to crime and are often shared amongst acquaintances. 

In this study, each individual with an arrest record is represented as a node within a social network, connected by incidents that resulted in their mutual arrest. This method acknowledges the evolving nature of the social network and relies on simple connections without weighting their importance. The network's analysis can apply to both violent and non-violent crimes, and the study measures connections in terms of the shortest path through the network.

While the study doesn't aim to pinpoint the exact conditions or timing of repeat crimes, it can identify a higher likelihood of crime recurrence. As part of the analysis, crime clustering was assessed not based on a Poisson distribution but relative to general patterns. Moreover, the study used Monte Carlo simulations to compare observed data with a randomly generated null distribution, a technique that helps discern statistically significant patterns.

The findings revealed an increased chance of repeat violent crime within roughly six months of an initial incident among closely connected individuals in the social network, with a particularly significant number of repeat incidents within the first 25 weeks. Some lower-level repeat effects were also observed for non-violent crimes within certain time frames. The study concludes that violent repeat crimes within 90 weeks exceeded what would be expected by chance.

The research was funded by a National Institute of Justice grant, with the caveat that the paper's conclusions do not necessarily represent the views of the Department of Justice.
