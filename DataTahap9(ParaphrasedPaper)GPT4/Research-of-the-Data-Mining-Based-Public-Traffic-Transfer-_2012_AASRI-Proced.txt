The emergence of the digital city, paralleling advancements in internet and computer technology, centers on providing information services to urban residents. A significant aspect of this is offering information on public travel routes—a relevant concern in medium-sized cities with around a hundred routes and a thousand stations. Citizens must navigate these options efficiently, choosing optimal routes that minimize travel time.

Urban traffic patterns fluctuate throughout the day, with predictable variations such as increased congestion during peak working hours. Travel route systems designed to aid commuters should incorporate this predictability to offer time-saving solutions.

The primary data for these systems comes from the city's bus network. An algorithm processes this information to propose potential travel routes between any two stations, ranking them by time or distance. However, because road traffic can significantly impact bus routes, the algorithm must also forecast traffic conditions at specific times using historical data mining.

Each bus line is assigned a unique identifier because routes vary in direction—affected by factors like one-way streets and differing station stops on opposite directions, as well as varying operational times.

To represent the connectivity of bus routes, a route relation matrix is employed. This matrix categorizes connections between routes as either existing or non-existing and can demonstrate potential transfers up to n iterations, as well as the variety of ways two routes can be interconnected.

Changing from one route to another is governed by defined conditions such as the location of the start and target stations and the intersection of the routes. Despite identifying a theoretically feasible transfer, practical usability is subject to the direction of travel and station positions.

To recommend optimal travel routes, it's essential to consider commuter priorities. A Hefei city survey from 2002 shows that most travelers prioritize routes with fewer transfers and shorter travel times. Hence, the proposed algorithm ensures that routes with fewer transfers surface first, thus catering to traveler preferences.

Since travel time is heavily influenced by traffic conditions, avoiding congested road sections is crucial for time efficiency. This paper discusses organizing and analyzing historical traffic data to predict future conditions, which then guide the selection of bus routes.

A data cube model facilitates multi-dimensional analysis of this traffic data. For instance, the data cube can reveal that if 80% of traffic moves below 5 km/h during a specific time frame on Mondays, congestion is likely during that period.

Utilizing the rollup operation on the data cube allows aggregation of traffic data, drawing distinctions between workdays and weekends while acknowledging more subtle differences within workdays themselves.

In practical terms, predicting congestion in certain road sections enables travelers to choose less congested routes. Two transfer solutions may be evaluated through the data cube to determine which is less likely to face heavy traffic, thus recommending the one with better predicted traffic flow.

Finally, the relational matrix serves to describe inter-route connections within the bus network. The matrix aids in generating all feasible transfer options between two stations, as described in the algorithm presented in this paper.
