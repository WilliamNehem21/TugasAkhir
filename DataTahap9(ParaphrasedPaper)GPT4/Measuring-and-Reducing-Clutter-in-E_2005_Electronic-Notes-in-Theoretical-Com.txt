The concept of projections in Euler diagrams was developed to address the issue of visual clutter that increases with the addition of more sets. Informally, projections are sets that exist within a specific context, or subset, of the broader domain under consideration. Outside this context, projections do not convey information. These projections can be represented by various curves called projected contours.

This text describes a system of Euler diagrams that can be augmented by projections and points out two shortcomings of the current system. An Euler diagram with projections contains labeled contours and projected contours indicated by dashed lines, which may have non-unique labels. Each contour is enclosed within a rectangular boundary, and the relationships among contours (intersections, containments, exclusions) create distinct zones within the boundary, which can be shaded.

The paper discusses a three-tiered syntax for diagrammatic systems: a concrete syntax represented in a medium, an abstract syntax at the coarse-grained level, and a fine-grained abstract syntax. The concrete syntax is the visual representation, whereas the abstract syntax represents relationships without geometric detail. The fine-grained abstract syntax details the use of projected contours to represent projections and includes underlying zones determined only by the labels of given contours. A projected contour in this fine-grained syntax is a pair consisting of a label and the set of underlying zones it intersects, known as the context.

Additionally, the paper examines the clutter introduced by the three possible relationships between contours in a diagram. Extracting clutter-related information requires identifying diagram components, their relationships, and calculating clutter variation. Clutter is quantified using a scoring system that counts the number of zones within each contour.

The clutter scoring approach is consistent with factors affecting visual clutter. Disjoint contours do not contribute to each other's scores. However, if a contour contains another, the enclosed zones are counted multiple times. Intersecting contours add an extra zone to each one. This scoring reflects the relationships among components and contributes to our understanding of visual clutter.
