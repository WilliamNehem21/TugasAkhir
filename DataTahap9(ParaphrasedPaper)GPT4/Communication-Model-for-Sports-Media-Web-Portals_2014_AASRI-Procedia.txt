The paper outlines a proposal to enhance interaction between sports media outlets and their user base by introducing a digital mediation approach. This approach involves a conceptual framework and a practical demonstration via a web application. The belief is that this web app can introduce creative features to sports media websites and cultivate a stronger bond with users by encouraging their contributions. The project specifically seeks to boost user engagement and facilitate opinion exchanges within sports media web platforms.

Communication among the main participants is visualized as open, multidirectional channels. Although technology and the role of an editor are central to the model, they are not depicted separately, as they are inherent components of the framework. The editor's role, which can be held by an individual or a team, is crucial for producing, overseeing, enhancing, and moderating participatory activities while maintaining neutrality and curating content responsibly.

The proposed method aims to encourage active user participation in sports media websites by fostering open, multidirectional communication that is structured and regulated. The paper suggests that such tools, like the presented Liberopinion platform, can have educational value by promoting a sense of civic responsibility, teamwork, knowledge sharing, and supporting respectful and constructive dialogue.
