This paper tackles the challenge of selecting and organizing a collection of candidate models within the domain of dynamical systems. Instead of relying on time series data, this selection process is guided by model behavior defined using temporal logic, since this offers broader constraints on the system's dynamics.

The authors introduce a novel concept referred to as the "model ordering problem," aiming not only to pick a single model from the pool of candidates but also to create a hierarchy among them based on their behaviors with respect to a given property specification. To facilitate this, the paper suggests employing various ordering relations to compare the models according to the specified properties.

To provide a rigorous yet broadly applicable solution to the proposed problem, model checking and parameter synthesis techniques are adapted and implemented. These formal methods are designed to yield comprehensive insights into the models under consideration.

The paper details an application of the proposed method to a set of qualitative regulatory network models, demonstrating its potential effectiveness and viability.

In summing up, the authors assert that model ordering is a versatile strategy that can be applied across multiple modeling formalisms, specification techniques, and analysis frameworks. They express optimism that this approach could greatly streamline the process of model inference and establish a reliable means of evaluating models of different types. The authors are motivated to further enhance the utility and reproducibility of the proposed method.

The study bases its approach on the assumption that each model is parameterized by assigning values to certain parameters, where each parameter is uniquely identified by a distinct Roman numeral index across all models considered. For illustration, Example 3.1 describes three different models, each with three parameters: the first model includes parameters I and III, the second has parameters I and II, and the third comprises parameters II and III.
