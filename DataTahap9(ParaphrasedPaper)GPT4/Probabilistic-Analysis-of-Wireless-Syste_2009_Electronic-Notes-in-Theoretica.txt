Today's wireless communication systems are becoming increasingly integrated into a variety of critical and consumer applications, such as mobile devices, automated vehicles, smart factories, telemedicine, and sensor networks. The reliability and safety of these systems are paramount because failures can have significant financial or safety implications. Consequently, designers of wireless systems devote substantial time to validating functionality, reliability, and performance before these systems are put into production, with probabilistic analysis playing a key role in this validation process.

Simulation is by far the most prevalent method for conducting probabilistic analyses of wireless systems. Simulation environments provide ways to model random variables and apply methods like Monte Carlo simulation to analyze system behavior over a multitude of samples. Although simulation can provide estimates for statistical parameters like average and variance, it's not perfectly accurate due to constraints inherent in both the simulation process and computer arithmetic. Particularly in critical applications, such as healthcare, transportation, and military systems, reliance on simulation for probabilistic analysis is risky due to potential inaccuracy.

This paper focuses on the use of the HOL theorem prover, a tool that allows for formal probabilistic analysis of wireless systems. Although HOL is the chosen platform for this research, the methods proposed are applicable to other higher-order logic theorem provers like Isabelle, Coq, or PVS. The paper outlines related work, describes the methodology of using HOL for wireless systems analysis, and details an example analysis of the Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol in the GPRS standard's LLC layer, finally concluding with a summary.

Probabilistic model checking is another formal method typically used for such analyses but is constrained by limitations like the state explosion problem and its focus on finite state machines or Markov chains, which cannot capture certain statistical quantities like expectation and variance.

The paper suggests enhancing the formal analysis of wireless systems by combining theorem proving with techniques that allow for the precise reasoning about statistical properties. For the GPRS standard that supports high-speed data transfer, reliable packet delivery over the unreliable wireless medium is critical, and lower layers like LLC and RLC/MAC need to address this directly since protocols like TCP are less effective over wireless.

The approach presented introduces the use of higher-order-logic theorem proving to achieve accurate and comprehensive probabilistic analysis of wireless systems, which can be highly beneficial for applications where safety is a critical concern. This paper provides a methodology for such analysis, exemplified by the evaluation of the ARQ mechanism in the GPRS's LLC layer, marking the first instance of using theorem proving to perform probabilistic analysis of a wireless system.
