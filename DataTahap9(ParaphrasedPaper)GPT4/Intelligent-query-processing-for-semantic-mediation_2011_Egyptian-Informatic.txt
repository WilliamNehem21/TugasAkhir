In this research, we introduce a sophisticated method for efficiently processing queries through semantic mediation of information systems, supported by a universal multi-agent architecture. We harness intelligent agents for the purpose of query reformulation, employing innovative semantic representation technologies. Our adaptable algorithm smoothly adjusts to environmental changes, demonstrating exceptional versatility and the dynamic resolution of diverse data conflicts. The query is restructured using schema mediation for identifiable systems, and context mediation for others.

This study describes the drawbacks of existing integration approaches, including incomplete integration processes and inadequate utilization of mappings for automatic integration and query reformulation. We address these issues by proposing an extended schema mediation with higher automation levels and better transparency, though it struggles with evolutionary and scalability challenges. Multi-domain approaches and context mediation strategies dynamically address data conflicts, with varying degrees of response time and user involvement.

Our multi-agent system fortifies semantic interoperability and the resolution of conflicts within evolving ontological frameworks, leaning towards user dependency for query handling and mapping validation, specifically in e-commerce scenarios.

Our proposed query processing method is intelligent and self-adapting, transitioning as needed between context and schema mediation. This reflects a balance in computational complexity between these approaches. The system includes intelligent agents (IAs) that function as intermediaries between information systems, along with routing agents (RAs) that organize the IAs into semantically similar groups for efficient mediation. The RAs are pivotal, using semantic proximity to ensure effective query processing and communication optimization.

Agents engage in dynamic discovery and integration of information suppliers, refining their interactions to accommodate evolving environments. Our methodology applies distinct protocols for handling queries from both recognized and unfamiliar systems. We use OWL DL as our common data model, harnessing its expressiveness for robust ontology integration and inference. Furthermore, we define crucial architectural terms like context and query language, adapted to our needs.

In summary, our method employs a semantic similarity approach to facilitate mapping discoveries between agents, reformulates queries using a set of rules, and efficiently disseminates enriched queries via the most semantically relevant routing agents, ensuring an intelligent, flexible, and effective semantic mediation framework.
