This study uses geochemical data derived from lake sediments, which was gathered and analyzed following the methods and protocols outlined by McCurdy et al. (2016). The dataset includes 3,441 samples collected at an approximate resolution of one sample per 13 square kilometers. This dataset is part of the Geological Survey of Canada's Geomapping for Energy and Minerals (GEM) program, which aims to identify geochemical anomalies associated with mineralization in bedrock by re-evaluating sediment samples using up-to-date analytical techniques. For certain analytical processes, the data was adjusted with a centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation, as advocated by Aitchison (1982), and censored entries were substituted with half of the detection limit. The implications of using log-ratio transformations on things such as data representation, choosing algorithms, and the performance of machine learning tasks focused on detecting geochemical anomalies were also considered.

In the field of prospectivity mapping for mineral exploration, the primary goal is to create maps that precisely pinpoint geochemical anomalies that signal the presence of mineral deposits, using the most selective methods possible. While the concept of a geochemical anomaly has remained unchanged, the techniques to differentiate between background levels and anomalies have undergone significant development and refinement.
