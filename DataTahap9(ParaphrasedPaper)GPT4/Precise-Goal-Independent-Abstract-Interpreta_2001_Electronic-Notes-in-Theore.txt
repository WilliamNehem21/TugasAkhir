In this research, the authors focus exclusively on a goal-independent analysis of pure constraint logic programs, which allows them to create a semantics and analysis that do not rely on the techniques used for implementation. They aim to ensure that this semantics can recognize two solutions for a given problem: one specific and one general. For example, it should acknowledge that both the specific value '1' and any arbitrary term can be solutions. This has implications for analyses like definite freeness and determinacy, which may require understanding of all possible solutions. While the paper doesnâ€™t explore these analyses in depth, it intends for the proposed semantics to accommodate them.

The authors go on to describe how they define the abstract semantics of a program, recognizing that their definition depends on the chosen abstraction. To avoid making the definition overly complicated, they opted not to detail every parameter involved in these abstract semantic functions.

To approximate complex infinite structures, the paper references graphs that are akin to rational trees. Nilsson's work is mentioned, which substitutes the use of infinite structures with context vectors, effectively circumventing problems associated with infinity by associating sets of possible substitutions with each program point.

Lastly, Gallagher and his colleagues have developed a goal-independent analysis framework using declarative semantics, relying on a pre-interpretation of the program. This involves mapping the program's function symbols onto another domain. The chosen domain acts as an abstract domain, and the mapping process effectively functions as a representation function.
