Over the past two decades, self-driving vehicles have surged to prominence in research due to their potential to replace humans in various tasks, offering significant advancements in road safety and driving comfort by taking over driving duties partially or fully. As a result, they have become central to solving escalating traffic issues worldwide.

Traditional passive sensing systems used in autonomous vehicles rely on methods like cameras and computer vision to determine the distance to objects. There are two main passive sensing systems: monovision and stereovision systems.

This particular study focuses on stereovision systems, where two cameras are positioned in such a way to create the illusion of depth perception similar to human eyes, utilizing the disparity between the two images to calculate distance with high precision. In these systems, object detection is conducted on the images from both cameras before performing stereo matching to identify the same objects in both images, a process which is typically time-consuming.

The paper introduces a novel real-time distance measurement technique for self-driving systems utilizing a stereo camera setup with horizontal displacement. The method comprises two main steps: hypothesis generation, using cross-correlation after edge detection, and hypothesis verification, using feature extraction with the help of 2D-DWT and AdaBoost classification. Unlike conventional approaches, vehicles are detected in images from one camera and then matched with the corresponding images from the second camera, streamlining the process.

After detection and matching, the geometric relationship between the two cameras and the identified vehicles is used to calculate distances. Despite the method's relative simplicity, it achieves high accuracy in distance measurement. The study compares this new approach with existing ones, revealing its precise measurement capabilities in spite of its straightforward algorithm. With its adaptability, the method can be applied to other systems by altering the detection algorithm to compute various parameters such as inter-vehicle safety distance and speed, or measure distances to different object types.
