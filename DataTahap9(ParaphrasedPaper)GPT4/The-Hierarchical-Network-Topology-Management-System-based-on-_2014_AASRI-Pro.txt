As networks grow in size and complexity, managing and maintaining them has become increasingly essential. Network Management Systems (NMS) have thus become critical tools for building and maintaining networks. At the heart of NMS lies Network Topology Management (NTM), which forms the foundation for the majority of system functions, typically visualized through topological diagrams.

In this context, a hierarchical display approach is suggested, using an IP network as an example. This approach involves multiple layers of display: The first layer illustrates the primary topology, which is the relationship between routers and subnets. The second layer provides details about the interactions within subnets, and if routers or switches are present within these subnets, the display can further drill down to the port level for a third layer of topological detail.

Typically, a standard loading model is effective due to the relatively small data volume. However, a hierarchical network necessitates a multilevel loading model. When the system initializes, it only shows top-level data. This multilevel loading model is advantageous as it not only conserves storage space but also enhances the speed with which the system loads data.
