Blockchain as a Direction for Ensuring Data Integrity in Cloud-Edge Healthcare Systems

Blockchain technology offers a promising solution for ensuring data integrity in cloud-edge healthcare systems. By integrating each hospital server as a node within the blockchain network, it is possible to create a consensus-based, distributed ledger for auditing data integrity. This technology is particularly suitable for architectures in healthcare systems that rely on shared data, providing a robust defense against data tampering and collusion among participants.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related studies, Section 3 details the authors' proposed scheme, Section 4 presents experimental results and performance evaluations, and Section 5 concludes with a summary and future plans.

The authors introduce a novel scheme for dynamic data integrity verification using a Merkel Hash Tree (MHT) that supports public auditing while reducing overhead. Previous models are vulnerable to replacement attacks, but this has been addressed by Mao et al. with the development of a Position-Aware Merkle Tree (PMT), and by Rao et al. with a dynamic audit scheme based on batch authentication MHT that tackles anti-collusion. Bowers et al. ensure transaction participants are authenticated by an authorized party to prevent misuse of privacy attributes and track malicious users. Gao et al. introduce a cloud data audit scheme focusing on data deduplication for enhanced security, mitigating the threat of malicious clouds forging validators. Xu et al. contribute with a public cloud auditing method that periodically updates audit authorization to deter malicious activities on file keys.

The proposed system consists of three entities: users (trusted doctors and patients), hospital servers (untrusted, managing data and blockchain consensus), and a semi-trusted cloud server (overseeing system parameters and the genesis block).

The system operates in two phases:

1. Hospital and cloud servers generate cryptographic keys, with the cloud server compiling these into the blockchain's genesis block and determining the order of hospital servers.

2. Users create cryptographic keys, prepare verification information, and upload their data to a hospital server. This data is then recorded on the blockchain after consensus among the nodes.

The cloud server specifies initial settings such as hash functions, pseudo-random functions, data block quantity, and blockchain node structure.

Within this scheme, malicious nodes are prevented from forging identities during data verification because true identities are tied to public keys on the blockchain, combating Sybil attacks effectively. The system also demonstrates resistance to collusion attacks, with experimental results showing a near 100% verification success rate despite the presence of malicious nodes.
