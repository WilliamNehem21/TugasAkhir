The paper addresses the issue of establishing if a relation within a finite algebraic structure can be described using quantifier-free first-order formulas. The authors prove that this definability problem is coNP-complete and provide a decision-making algorithm that hinges on a semantic property: a relation is definable if it remains unchanged under isomorphisms between the structure's substructures. Moreover, they devise an algorithm to calculate the isomorphism class of tuples within these algebraic structures, supporting the efficacy of both algorithms with complete proofs and empirical evidence indicating improved performance in highly symmetric models.

The paper notes that previous work has explored the definability problem's computational complexity in various logical systems, including its coNP-completeness in classical propositional logic and other complexities depending on specific logic fragments.

Organized into seven sections, the paper provides necessary definitions, presents the complexity result, introduces an algorithm for computing isomorphism types of tuples, details the quantifier-free definability decision algorithm, assesses the algorithm's performance empirically, and concludes with a summary and potential avenues for further research.

Future research could involve a broader range of algebraic structures, incorporate control variables into model design, apply these techniques to additional logical fragments, explore the definability issue over classes of models instead of just single structures, and identify algebra classes where the definability problem allows for polynomial-time solutions.
