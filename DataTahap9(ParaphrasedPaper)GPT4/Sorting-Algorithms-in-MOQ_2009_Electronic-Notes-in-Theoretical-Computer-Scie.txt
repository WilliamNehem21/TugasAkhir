In this paper, we present a two-part analysis of the MOQA (short for "Modular Object-based Query Architecture") implementation with respect to sorting algorithms. Section 4 provides a detailed examination of the current MOQA framework. In the fifth section, we compare the performance and resource demands of two sorting algorithms, insertion sort and quicksort, within the MOQA context.

The research demonstrated that MOQA's approach introduces additional space usage and potentially increased constants in algorithmic time complexity, particularly for quicksort's average-case performance. Section 5 explores the consequences of MOQA managing relationships between data, a design choice that abstracts away from algorithmic detail and impacts both space complexity and performance.

The MOQA version of insertion sort shows significant differences compared to conventional algorithms. In typical pseudo-code, the index for insertion is explicitly tracked; however, MOQA relies on an iterator mechanism within the OrderedCollection object, refraining from explicit positional references. The paper discusses a specific process where elements are iteratively removed and connected within a new subset of the OrderedCollection, ultimately creating a proper sort order.

The paper further discusses the complexity involved in traversing and manipulating data within the MOQA context, suggesting that the current implementation might not efficiently handle such complexities. This observation leads to open questions regarding the trade-offs of retaining complex data structures within the average-case time for sorting algorithms which may be less straightforward, such as quicksort.

Finally, it is proposed that future improvements to MOQA, specifically refactoring the MOQA-Java API, can enhance flexibility. Future work aims to refine the data structure encapsulation and extend MOQA-Java to manage more specific types of partial orders. The conclusion of this study, in Section 6, summarizes the findings and Section 7 outlines the anticipated future advancements in the area.
