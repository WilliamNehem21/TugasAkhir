The TMS320VC5509, a digital signal processor (DSP), receives instructions from the human-machine interface (HMI) and is responsible for issuing the timing signal to both the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) memory, in addition to configuring the system's counting mode. Simultaneously, the timing generator provides a timing signal to the CCD sensor. The DSP continuously retrieves image data from the FIFO as indicated by its half-full signal until it has transferred all data from the detection channel to the synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM). Once the data has gone through a sequence of processing steps, the DSP dispatches the processed results back to the HMI. The touchscreen, which serves as an HMI, displays these results and also saves them onto an SD card automatically.
