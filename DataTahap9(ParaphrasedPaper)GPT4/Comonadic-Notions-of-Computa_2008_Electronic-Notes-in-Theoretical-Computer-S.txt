In this paper, the authors explore the use of strong monads and extend the concept to include symmetric (semi)monoidal comonads to structure context-dependent computations. The motivation for this work is the need to effectively handle computations that depend on context, such as dataflow (stream-based) and computations on trees, for instance, in attribute evaluation.

The authors highlight the adaptability of comonads for structuring computations that rely on environmental input or use implicit parameters. They present a theoretical framework that demonstrates how symmetric (semi)monoidal comonads can elegantly manage such computations, noting that strong monads are similarly associated with symmetric monoidal comonads in the literature on categorical semantics.

Key contributions of the paper include a presentation on the structure of co-Kleisli categories corresponding to symmetric (semi)monoidal comonads and the interpretation of languages for context-dependent computation within such categories. There is also an emphasis on the differences arising from the duality of monads and comonads, with a goal of preserving as much cartesian closed structure as possible.

The paper is structured as follows: First, a succinct overview of strong monads, their Kleisli categories, and the semantics of effectful languages as positioned by Moggi is given. Following this, the authors lay out their analogous construction for context-dependent computation based on co-Kleisli categories of symmetric (semi)monoidal comonads.

The authors admit that their work on the operational semantics for context-dependent languages is still in progress, leaving room for future research. Additionally, they discuss the challenges in defining contexts that do not align with strong symmetric monoidal comonads but rather correspond to lax symmetric semimonoidal comonads due to the need for partiality.

Moreover, the paper touches on the possibility of combining context-dependence with effectful computation, which can be represented through distributive laws of a comonad over a monad. This has previously been illustrated through clocked causal dataflow computations that meld causal dataflow with exceptions.

In comparison to Lawvere theories and Arrows/Freyd categories, the paper explains that these provide respectively finer and coarser views of effectful computation. Lawvere theories are mentioned for their explicit handling of effectful operations, and Arrows/Freyd categories are proposed as a general framework that extends beyond the effects considered by Moggi.

Overall, this paper delves into the advanced theoretical aspects of computation, providing insights into context-dependent computations and their categorical formulations through the study of symmetric (semi)monoidal comonads.
