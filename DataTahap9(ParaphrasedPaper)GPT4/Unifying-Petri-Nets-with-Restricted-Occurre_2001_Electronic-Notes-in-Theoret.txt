The paper discusses that while a transition `t` can occur at a marking `x` when all the preconditions for `t` are met (i.e., `x + pre(t)`), there can be additional constraints that prevent the transition from being enabled. These constraints are represented by an abstract set `I` of informational elements and an independence relation `dom+` on `I`. Each marking `x` and each transition `t` are associated with an informational element, and they can only be concurrently composed if their respective informational elements are independent.

Furthermore, the paper indicates that the enabling rules can become more complex by integrating restrictions from inhibitor arcs, capacities, or other structures like positive context through the use of more sophisticated algebras, with references to other works for examples.

It also mentions that while there are multiple unification approaches for Petri nets that allow for different classes of Petri nets with varied algebras and data-type handling to be integrated, these existing unifications typically have fixed enabling conditions in the occurrence rules. However, they do not necessarily accommodate more complex restrictions on enabling conditions, such as those imposed by inhibitor arcs or capacities. References are provided to other papers for more detail on the unification approaches and their limitations regarding the enabling conditions.
