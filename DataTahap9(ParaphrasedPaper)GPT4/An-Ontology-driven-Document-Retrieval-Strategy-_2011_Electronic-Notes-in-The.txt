Businesses operate in a competitive landscape where knowledge is a critical asset that ensures survival and prosperity in today's global market. Knowledge is not just important but also carries economic value and strategic significance for organizations, enhancing productivity and providing stability in dynamic market conditions.

This paper proposes enhancements to techniques for document annotation and retrieval, as originally developed by Onto-DOM. These enhancements account for the modifiers of nouns, such as adjectives, preserving all the semantic content of a document. The paper sets out to integrate tools, techniques, and ontology-driven approaches for the purpose of knowledge retrieval and semantic annotation of documents. The paper's structure includes a review of related work, a description of a knowledge management system based on distributed organizational memory, and details on annotation and retrieval strategies that handle complex nouns and natural language queries. It concludes with an evaluation of these strategies and a summary of findings.

In the context of the semantic web, initial attempts at semantic annotation of web documents include the SHOE system and Ontobroker, which allowed web authors to manually add machine-readable metadata to their pages. However, manual annotation is labor-intensive and often results in bottlenecks. Semi-automatic annotation has been proposed to mitigate such issues.

CERNO is a framework designed for semi-automatic semantic annotation of text using light-weight analysis techniques without relying on ontologies, which may lead to a loss of semantic relationships.

Gschwandtner et al. put forward a semantic annotation system for free medical text using a domain-specific system based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. Unlike the proposed work, their system is domain-specific.

The paper details an architectural design where organizations consist of various functional units, each functioning as a knowledge domain guided by principles of autonomy and coordination, forming a distributed architecture for knowledge management. Knowledge retrieval and storage strategies rely on domain ontologies, which help in the process of query refinement and contextual representation.

For document annotation, each document undergoes linguistic analysis involving tokenization, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging. Based on a predefined linguistic pattern, document concepts (DCs) are selected and compared to ontological concepts to identify potential descriptors. Unlinked DCs undergo further processing using sources like WordNet to find synonyms and hypernyms that may better match the ontological concepts.

The retrieval process is refined by considering the type of question being asked, ensuring that documents returned are the most relevant to the query. The paper presents a case study involving a tourism company dealing in African travel where an ontology with domain-specific terms was used. A corpus of 125 documents was used with an average of 9187 words per document.

An evaluation of the knowledge retrieval layer involved 50 questions, with effectiveness measured by Mean Average Precision (MAP). With a MAP value of 0.895, the proposed strategy effectively placed the most relevant documents at the top of the retrieval list, achieving the primary goal of any information retrieval system.
