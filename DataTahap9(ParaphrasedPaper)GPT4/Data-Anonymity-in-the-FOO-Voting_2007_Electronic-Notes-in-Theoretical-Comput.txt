Our study focuses on a specific facet of privacy known as data anonymity, examining it in a formal context. This concept pertains to the ability to trace data, like a vote, back to an individual userâ€”in this case, a voter. We explore data anonymity's formal applications by scrutinizing a widely recognized electronic voting protocol.

While informal definitions of privacy can improve understanding, a formal investigation requires precise definitions. Researchers have previously outlined informal definitions of anonymity, but here we aim for a systematic assessment.

In electronic voting systems, anonymity ensures a safe and efficient means for casting and counting votes. These systems are utilized for diverse scales and types, from local shareholder meetings to national elections. Distinct forms of e-voting include kiosk voting, which uses dedicated hardware at fixed locations, and internet voting, which employs widely accessible devices. The accuracy of such systems is paramount: votes must not be alterable, all legitimate votes must be included, and invalid votes should be excluded.

We model the Foo voting scheme with an ACP-style process algebra, emphasizing direct modeling of anonymous channels, thus demonstrating the dependence of data anonymity on certain factors in the scheme.

The structure of this paper includes a formal definition of data anonymity, an explanation of the Foo voting scheme, an analysis of voter anonymity within this scheme, a vulnerability assessment, and concludes with discussions for future research.

The protocol outlines interactions between an administrator, voters, and a counter. The administrator verifies voter eligibility and signs the ballot, while the counter gathers and publishes these anonymous votes. The paper briefly describes this mechanism without delving into disruption scenarios, instead pointing interested readers to more detailed sources.

Formally specified with process algebra, the Foo voting scheme's trace set is accessible yet minimalistic, leaving out exceptional behaviors for clarity and precision. This approach aims to highlight synchronization points within the voting process to preserve anonymity without disproportionately burdening the voters or the system.

The paper identifies potential vulnerabilities and stresses that formal verification deals with abstract concepts rather than real-world implementation, which could harbor specific risks to voter anonymity. Potential implementation issues could stem from cryptographic algorithm choices or public key infrastructures.

Moreover, special attacks, like those from insider administrators or group signature schemes, could compromise ballot secrecy. A flooding attack by malicious voters is suggested as improbable if proper synchronization is in place. In such synchronized systems, data anonymity could be assessed by computing attribution sets, which in turn strengthen protocol security.

Our analysis of the Foo system shows that it could be vulnerable to privacy breaches but could be bolstered by incorporating synchronization points. Weaknesses may arise if external communications or the administrator's distribution of public keys are tampered with.

Future work could include refining exception handling within the protocol, modeling a more potent intruder threat than an eavesdropper, and devising zero-knowledge techniques to inject dummy votes without overly relying on the anonymous channel.
