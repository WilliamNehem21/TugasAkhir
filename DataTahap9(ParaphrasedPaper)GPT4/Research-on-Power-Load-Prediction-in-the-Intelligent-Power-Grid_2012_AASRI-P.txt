As China advances its high-voltage electrical grid infrastructure and continues to reform its power system, the nation is poised to embrace intelligent power grids as a strategic focal point for future development. Within this smart grid framework, power load patterns are evolving, influenced by shifts in energy consumption behaviors and the variability of electricity pricing. This study evaluates the predictive precision of three distinct models: the gray model, the trend fitting model, and the MV method. Upon comparison, it is determined that the MV method surpasses the other two in terms of forecasting accuracy, offering a beneficial tool for enhancing the management of power load predictions amid the establishment of intelligent power grids.
