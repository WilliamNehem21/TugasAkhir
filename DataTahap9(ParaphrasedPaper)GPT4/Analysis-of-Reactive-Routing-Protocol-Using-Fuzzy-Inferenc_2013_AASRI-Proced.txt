Title: Enhancing AODV and DSR Routing Protocols with Fuzzy Logic for Efficient Decision-Making

This paper summarizes prior research on routing protocols, which typically focused on a single constraint like finding the shortest path between a source and a destination. However, other factors should be taken into account for optimal routing decisions, such as packet management during network congestion or alternative paths during link failure. In recent times, there has been a trend towards incorporating multiple constraints into routing protocols. Fuzzy inference systems are particularly well-suited for this as they can accommodate several uncertain and ambiguous input constraints. The paper's objective is to examine how the performances of the AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) and DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) protocols are affected when integrated with fuzzy inference systems, and to compare their behaviors with and without the incorporation of fuzzy logic.

The concept of fuzzy logic was introduced by Dr. Lotfi Zadeh at the University of California in 1965. Fuzzy logic mimics human thought processes that naturally deal with imprecision and uncertainty. Fuzzy inference systems utilize this concept and follow specific steps:

1. Identify the relevant input and output variables.
2. Assign linguistic labels to each variable (expressed through fuzzy sets), such as "low," "high," or "medium," to characterize essential features such as minimum bandwidth, hop count, and route selection likelihood.
3. Choose appropriate membership functions for these variables.
4. Construct a set of "if-then" rules based on expert knowledge to steer the systemâ€™s desired behavior. These rules link linguistic values for variables in a causative manner, and can be modified as needed.

Over the past forty years, numerous routing protocols have been developed, each with its strengths and weaknesses and none universally superior. This study uses the AODV and DSR protocols as a base and incorporates a fuzzy logic system to evaluate their performance under various metrics and conditions.

The paper finds that augmenting AODV and DSR with fuzzy logic and minor operational adjustments improves performance in realtime applications. Consequently, future research could extend the implementation of fuzzy logic to other reactive routing protocols to potentially enhance their effectiveness further.
