The paper discusses Reo, a coordination language designed originally to specify the communication and coordination of component instances within a system. Reo models systems as a collection of component instances that communicate via connectors, which are constructed by composing simple, well-defined channels.

In Reo, components connect at nodes which merge incoming data streams non-deterministically. This key feature is not directly representable in constraint automata, a formalism used to describe the behavior of Reo connectors. To address this, the paper introduces two operations: a product automata operator to join nodes and a merger automaton, representing a new primitive connector in Reo that mimics the merging behavior at a node.

Verification of Reo circuits is then approached by comparing the behavior of a constructed Reo circuit with a given constraint automaton describing the desired behavior, a process akin to model checking. The similarity of behavior between two constraint automata -- called bisimilarity -- is an important concept for this verification process, and the paper notes that algorithms calculating bisimilarity can benefit the analysis of larger Reo circuits.

The paper also touches on the effective use of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) in representing constraint automata compactly, indicating that a careful choice of variable ordering is crucial for this efficiency but does not delve into the detailed heuristics for such ordering choices within the scope of the paper.

Overall, the work extends the foundational understanding of Reo and its application in modeling complex systems, contributing new methods for effective design, composition, and verification of such systems.
