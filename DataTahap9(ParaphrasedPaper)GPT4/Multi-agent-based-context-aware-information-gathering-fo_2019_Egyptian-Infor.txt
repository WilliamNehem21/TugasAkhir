The article discusses a context-aware system that utilizes contextual data to deliver pertinent information and services that save energy and prolong the lifespan of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs). Most current precision agriculture methods reliant on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) only focus on real-time scalar data, often overlooking the nodes' energy conservation and overall network longevity, especially when dealing with multimedia data like images.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes enhancements in WMSN performance parameters such as context detection time and energy consumption by employing techniques like image retrieval for plant disease and weed detection, as well as agent technology for efficient information gathering.

The paper is segmented into sections, each covering various aspects of the proposal, which includes a model for context-aware agriculture, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) for detecting plant diseases and weeds, agent technology, simulation models, and performance analysis, along with a final section presenting the results and conclusions.

Weed identification is performed by comparing digital images to a thresholded database to differentiate weeds from useful plants. CBIR is employed to check the captured images from camera-equipped sensor nodes against a knowledge base of healthy plant images. If the images are too similar, they are discarded; otherwise, they are saved and an alert is sent.

For CBIR, color and texture features are extracted and multi-dimensional feature vectors are described and stored in the database. Color extraction uses metrics like color moments and histograms, while texture features used discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Agents use this data for context detection, and for energy conservation, they switch to sleep mode when inactive, monitoring only for critical battery status to inform the sink node.

A mobile agent system with Static and Permanent Feature Agents (PFAs) is presented for route discovery and data collection. The agents gather information from individual nodes and relay it to the cluster head. Cluster heads then merge and forward this information to the sink node based on their Euclidean distance, with the farthest clusters contributing their data first.

The Query Agent (QA) proceeds by collecting and fusing data from the various cluster heads sequentially based on proximity, ultimately delivering the gathered information back to the sink node.
