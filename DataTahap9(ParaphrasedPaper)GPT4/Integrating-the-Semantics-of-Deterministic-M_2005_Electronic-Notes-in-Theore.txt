In academic research concerning communication systems, it's important to recognize that the development and utilization of these systems involve different classes of participants. As a result, there must be distinct representation schemes for event-based and state-based perspectives to suit the needs of these varied participants. These representation schemes should be robust enough to provide all necessary information to the participants, enabling them to properly understand and interact with the system.

To ensure consistency and cohesiveness across the system, the representation schemes for event and state viewpoints must be underpinned by a unified semantic framework. Formal semantics for event-driven representations often rely on constructs like traces and labeled transition systems (LTS). Meanwhile, for state-driven representation, particularly in programming languages, analysts might use systems that can demonstrate features through execution.

The scheme employs a structure where the left side is dedicated to the events triggered by the subscriber, and the right side accounts for those initiated by other features. Additionally, the system stipulates certain conditions that must be satisfied for events to occur. A post-condition captures the outcomes post-execution, detailing the subscriber's new state and the events that have been triggered as a result.
