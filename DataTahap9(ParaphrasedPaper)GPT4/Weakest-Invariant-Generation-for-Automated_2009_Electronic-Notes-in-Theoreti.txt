This paper discusses the development of efficient techniques to identify the largest set of legitimate states for a particular program, where a legitimate state is one in which the program operation aligns with its specifications. The authors organize the paper into six sections, beginning with a problem definition, followed by the introduction of their algorithms, illustration through examples, a review of relevant literature, and concluding with their findings.

The algorithm introduced automates the generation of the weakest invariant that maintains the program's safety and liveness specifications, involving three components: invariant generator, safety checker, and liveness checker, each detailed in subsections.

The algorithm initiates with an invariant encompassing the initial program states, excluding those that fail the specified behavior (spec bs). It then iteratively removes states contributing to unsafe program transitions until it reaches a point where no more unsafe states can be removed. The safety checker ensures that states leading to a safety violation are excluded, while the liveness checker eliminates any states that might cause a deadlock or violate liveness properties.

The algorithm can handle both system and environment actions. System actions are used to verify liveness properties while a combination of both types is considered for safety properties.

The paper goes on to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm through case studies on the token ring program and mutual exclusion program, which are classical distributed computing examples. The studies are performed on a MacBook Pro, utilizing the C++ interface of the CUDD package for OBDD representation of Boolean formulas.

The authors compare their top-down approach for invariant generation—which starts with a maximal state space and prunes it down with respect to safety and liveness specifications—with other techniques such as bottom-up approaches. The proposed method effectively produces the weakest invariant and does so in a quick manner as shown by the case studies.

Overall, the paper aims to enhance the automatic generation of program invariants by using an efficient top-down approach that has been validated through established distributed computing programs.
