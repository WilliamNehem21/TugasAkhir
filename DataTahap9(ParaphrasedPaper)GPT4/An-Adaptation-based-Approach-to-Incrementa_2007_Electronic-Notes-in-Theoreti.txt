The academic paper discusses the challenges faced when building component-based systems due to behavioral interface incompatibilities between components, which can prevent their successful composition. The paper highlights the importance of software adaptation as a solution to resolve such incompatibilities, focusing on the automatic generation of corrective connectors or components, known as adaptors.

The authors propose an incremental approach to constructing component-based systems, which involves the use of generated adaptors to bridge behavioral mismatches between components. The incremental nature of the approach allows for systems to be built step by step, thus managing the complexity of the adaptation process.

In the paper, the formal model of components and the architectural style that the approach relies on are detailed. The authors describe mechanisms to determine if adaptation is necessary, to compute adaptors, and to evaluate their effectiveness.

The process of checking for behavioral mismatches is based on computing the synchronous product of the behavioral interfaces of the components and then checking for the absence of deadlocks. If the system is not deadlock-free, an adaptor is generated to enable deadlock-free operation. The adaptor ensures that component communications are properly managed to maintain the correct system behavior.

The paper also discusses various techniques to assess the adapted system and ensure it provides all expected services even after adaptation. Additionally, the authors discuss handling the addition or removal of components and the impact on adaptors.

A case study involving the "dining philosophers" problem is used to illustrate the adaptation process. Philosophers (representing components with different behavioral interfaces) interact with forks (representing shared resources), potentially leading to deadlocks. The paper explains how adaptors are used to resolve these issues.

Finally, the paper compares its approach to related work on incremental protocol enhancement and automatic adaptor generation, emphasizing the preference for localized adaptors except in cases where a centralized adaptor is unavoidable.

This paraphrase condenses the main concepts and steps presented in the original paper, highlighting the notion of automatic adaptation via generation of adaptors within an incremental construction framework for component-based systems.
