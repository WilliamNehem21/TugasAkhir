The study investigated the nutritional profile of Chanodichthys erythropterus, a key commercial freshwater fish widely distributed in East Asia and prevalent in Dianshan Lake, China. While it has been an important food source, particularly in East Asian cuisine, current health trends have increased the demand for nutrient-rich and health-promoting foods, hence the focus on this fish species.

The research revealed that Chanodichthys erythropterus muscle is a substantial source of high-quality protein, containing ten essential amino acids vital for human health. Notably, stearic acid was the most prevalent saturated fatty acid, whereas oleic acid was identified as the primary monounsaturated fatty acid in the fish. Importantly, alpha-linolenic acid stood out as the leading polyunsaturated fatty acid. The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids was found to be 2.82, which suggests that the fish offers a favorable fatty acid profile, beneficial for nutrition and potentially advantageous for the prevention and treatment of diseases.

Due to the dominance of the Cyprinidae family in the fish population of Dianshan Lake and their increasing popularity as a food source, understanding the nutritional content of this species is critical. Despite the abundance of research on fishery product composition, this study fills a gap by specifically analyzing the chemical composition of Chanodichthys erythropterus. The findings are deemed valuable for consumers seeking healthy dietary options and for the scientific community for further research. Finally, the study analyzed fish caught from Dianshan Lake, a significant source of this species and an important fishing locale situated between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Kunshan in Jiangsu Province, China.
