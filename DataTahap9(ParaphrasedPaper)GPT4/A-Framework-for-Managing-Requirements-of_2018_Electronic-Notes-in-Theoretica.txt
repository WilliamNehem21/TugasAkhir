The paper discusses a reuse manager composed of three key modules designed to process and expand queries: the query preprocessor, the query expander, and the indexer. The query preprocessor consists of three components: a tokenizer that breaks down the query into terms, a POS tagging mechanism that categorizes words by type using the Penn Treebank project's 36 categories, and an entity recognizer that identifies and classifies named entities like people, organizations, and locations.

Subsequently, the query is expanded semantically through three strategies employed by the query expander module: lexical relationships, a word co-occurrence database, and named entity recognition. The indexer then utilizes the output from these modules, examining the structure as defined by the definition manager, incorporating taxonomies via the taxonomy manager.

The paper emphasizes the importance of context in determining word meanings, detailing steps like tagging for POS and applying named entity recognition (NER) to refine tokenization, which helps to filter out 'stopwords' (irrelevant terms) and preserve meaningful query components. 

A functional prototype has been created, leveraging a taxonomy compliant with ISO 19119 and indexed functionalities from the Service Production Line (SPL) database. To evaluate performance, indexing engines such as Lucene, Sphinx, and Minion were tested with different expansion methods as well as without any semantic expansion.

The results were analyzed using precision-at-n and recall metrics. It was noted that semantic expansion significantly improves the retrieval of relevant functionalities compared to non-expanded queries, with DISCO outperforming the other techniques. However, the effectiveness can be context-dependent, as seen with the varying recall values across different domains.

The paper concludes by highlighting two main threats to validity: the need for a larger dataset for more robust quantitative analysis and the limitation of having tested only in a single domain, which could affect the generality of the results, especially concerning the effectiveness of the NER expansion technique.
