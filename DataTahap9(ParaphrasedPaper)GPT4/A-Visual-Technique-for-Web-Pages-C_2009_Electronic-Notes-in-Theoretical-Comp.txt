The paper discusses a method to quantify the visual similarity between web pages, which can be used to search a document database using a visual pattern as the search query. The results from such a query could be the most visually similar document in the database or from a predetermined set, with the latter potentially serving as a classification method. The paper highlights the growing importance of web page visual features in search engine optimization.

The proposed methodology involves segmenting a web page image into regions using image processing techniques, and this segmentation is then represented as a graph. Unlike other methods, this approach does not consider the HTML tags' structure, and similarity is measured through graph matching algorithms.

The paper's structure is outlined as follows:
- Section 2 revisits standard concepts and describes web page representation.
- Section 3 introduces a transformation of HTML code to clarify the web page's visual structure.
- Section 4 introduces a compression technique for web pages to reduce size by grouping repetitive structures and contracting tag chains not influencing visual appearance.
- Section 5 establishes a similarity measure between web pages using the tree edit distance algorithm.
- Section 6 showcases the features of a prototype implementation.
- Section 7 concludes the study and discusses future directions.

The paper underscores that users perceive the visual structure of web pages without considering the underlying HTML code. Since different HTML code blocks can produce the same visual effect, the paper suggests abstracting web pages into a canonical form based on visual structure.

Two compression functions are presented: horizontal compression (groups repetitive structures) and vertical compression (shrinks visually non-influential tag chains). The paper proposes the notion of "marked term" for this process, which helps define the compression operations preserving the visual structure of the web page.

A quantitative similarity measure, ranging from 0 to 1, is defined to assess the likeness between two web pages based on a tree edit distance algorithm. The paper addresses the challenge of assigning costs to the algorithm's operations, choosing equal costs for insertion, deletion, and relabeling operations.

In conclusion, the paper posits that comparing web pages is a significant and unresolved challenge relevant to search engines and web data mining, owing to the complexity of HTML in representing semantic content, page structure, and layout.
