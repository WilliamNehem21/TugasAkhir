The professional development of nurses extends beyond mere attendance at conferences and seminars. It encompasses active engagement in hands-on training and workshops, such as simulation exercises, which are vital for enhancing nursing competencies and ensuring the delivery of safe, accurate healthcare. Skilled and knowledgeable nurses markedly improve patient care. A commitment to ongoing education is foundational for healthcare institutions and propels nurses' careers forward. In the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses globally have been pivotal, engaging in patient care, assessments, and monitoring. Nurses with Bachelor's degrees and Saudi Arabian licenses participated in a study at Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital (DSFH) in Jeddah, although they had no prior simulation experience. Out of 256 nurses at DSFH, 120 were randomly chosen for two groups, A and B, to experience high-fidelity simulation (HFS) and virtual simulation (VS), respectively, across multiple age and nationality demographics.

HFS was conducted at the Clinical Skills Simulation Center (CSSC) using CAE Apollo simulators and CAE LearningSpace for performance recording. HFS consisted of three stages: briefing, actual simulation, and debriefing. VS was carried out in the Team-Based Learning Hall at the Fakeeh College for Medical Sciences (FCMS), using Body Interact Multiplayer software on iPads, and followed a similar three-stage format.

The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) evaluated the nurses before and after simulations, using a 4-point Likert scale to assess performance on set procedures. The reliability of the assessments was high, as indicated by a kappa coefficient of 0.91. Both simulation facilitators and test invigilators were blinded to study participant statuses.

Simulation-based training benefits depend on the program's design and the nurse's skill at managing medical affairs both academically and clinically. Simulation programs can enhance nursing knowledge, critical thinking, and long-term learning. Simulated practices are seen as effective for improving clinical competencies. In nursing education, HFS has been shown to significantly impact knowledge and skills acquisition, aligning with findings that groups undergoing VS outperform traditional clinical teaching methods in terms of skill and knowledge. However, the results indicate that the effectiveness of simulation experiences may vary based on the modality used.

The researchers extended their thanks to the nursing staff and educators at DSFH, the faculty and clinical instructors at FCMS, and all participants involved in the examinations and assessments, acknowledging their crucial role in supporting the study.
