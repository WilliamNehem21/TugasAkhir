An increasing body of research points to the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in enhancing drug design and discovery. With the advent of deep learning algorithms, powered by advancements in computing technology, there is significant potential for creating therapeutic drugs to treat various health conditions. This review focuses on cutting-edge developments in drug research that utilize generative deep learning techniques, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It begins by evaluating the use of various GAN approaches in molecular de novo design—an essential aspect of drug discovery. The review also addresses the application of GAN models for dimensionality reduction in single-cell data during preclinical drug development stages and highlights experiments in generating new peptides and proteins using GAN frameworks. Moreover, the limitations of previous research using GANs for drug design are discussed. The review concludes with insights into future research directions and the challenges faced in this domain.

Deep learning algorithms have a wide array of applications in drug discovery and design, relying on state-of-the-art computer technologies like general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPU) computing. They are pivotal in addressing complex issues in drug design and are used as tools for various tasks such as molecular de novo design, dimensionality reduction of single-cell data in preclinical development, compound property and activity prediction, reaction analysis, synthesis prediction, and biological image analysis. These frameworks learn in a manner akin to the human brain—adapting based on the environment or past experiences by focusing on the task at hand, improving performance, and optimizing learning error using algorithms like gradient descent and backpropagation.

One of the major inspirations for GANs was Deep Boltzmann Machines, which during training used two phases, positive and negative, that alternatively increased or decreased the likelihood of data. However, Deep Boltzmann Machines struggled to scale beyond simple datasets. In contrast, GANs consist of a generator creating plausible data and a discriminator distinguishing between real and generated data. They undergo iterative training until they produce highly convincing outputs.

The study touches upon the creation of high-resolution images with GANs, the advancement of transformer architecture, and the development of Self-Attention GANs (SAGANs) which exhibit improved convergence and high-quality outputs. It also considers the role of GANs in drug discovery, noting how they can significantly reduce the time and cost required for drug research, though they face challenges in exploring chemical space.

Further, the paper encompasses strategies like adaptive training with GANs in drug discovery, which helps maintain diversity in generated molecules. It explores the use of convolutional layers and the design of target-specific compounds with a focus on cannabinoid receptors. Lastly, the paper discusses the limitations of GANs, including optimization challenges and the issue of 'mode collapse,' where a lack of diverse outputs restricts the exploration of chemical space.

The review highlights concerns over data completeness and the importance of reproducibility in computational drug discovery. Emphasizing transparency and reproducibility, it notes the growing popularity of workflow solutions, like the Common Workflow Language, in establishing reliable, interconnected computational processes. The paper concludes by emphasizing the role of high-performance computing and cloud infrastructures, along with virtual machines and software containers, in enhancing reproducibility and automating workflows in drug discovery.
