Recent advancements in imaging and spectroscopy have made waves in the non-destructive assessment of agro-food quality, with particular significance in seed viability analysis. Seeds, as critical components of agriculture and forestry, necessitate effective methods for determining germination potential prior to planting, selling, or cultivation. Research has delved into using spectral and image processing techniques to evaluate internal and external seed quality, employing image segmentation and spectral correction to predict seed quality through various established and cutting-edge methods. This review articulates the evolution and employment of novel techniques for analyzing seed viability, specifically focusing on near-infrared spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, Raman spectroscopy, infrared thermography, and soft X-ray imaging. The paper reports and compares the underlying theories, principal components, related chemometric processes, analytical methods, and prediction accuracies of these techniques. Furthermore, it discusses the challenges and potential future directions of these emerging technologies in light of their current applications.

Seed vigor, entangled with factors like genetic makeup, growth environment, and storage conditions, remains challenging to define precisely, prompting researchers to center their efforts on viability detection. With the fundamental vibrations in bonds resulting in broad, overlapping absorption peaks, the interpretation of VIS/NIR spectra is complex. As NIR spectra are considerably weaker than mid-infrared absorption bands, extracting meaningful data from the vast spectral information requires advanced chemometric algorithms for both preprocessing and detailed analysis.

Predictive modeling relies heavily on multivariate methods such as partial least squares regression and nonlinear techniques like support vector regression and artificial neural networks. Classification and identification methods have been derived from NIR spectroscopy, utilizing well-known qualitative multivariate methods, including k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machine, among others.

Studies comparing different techniques have found the NIR range more informative for seed viability sorting than the VIS/NIR range. Employing normalized canonical discriminant analysis on multispectral images, combined with specific features, yields high accuracy in distinguishing viable seeds. Similarly, derivative preprocessing methods have shown high accuracy in seed viability classification.

Infrared thermography has displayed promise in differentiating seed quality. X-ray imaging is another potential tool for seed classification, using internal morphology with high cross-validation accuracy evidenced through machine learning applications.

In conclusion, optical and image-based non-destructive evaluation systems are increasingly scrutinized for their potential to assess both the external and internal quality of seeds. Emerging technologies offer rapid, reliable, and accurate alternatives for seed viability assessments, though challenges in practical applications remain. This review provides insight into the technical hurdles and prospective future developments of these innovative techniques.
