This study investigated the performance of different antennas used for microwave ablation by applying 50 watts of power for durations of 5 and 10 minutes. The researchers measured ablation diameters, lengths, and aspect ratios. The sleeved antenna outperformed the others, demonstrating the lowest reflection coefficient which is desirable, highest power efficiency, and low power density. Additionally, it yielded high Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and temperature in simulations. Notably, the sleeved antenna achieved superior precision, larger ablation zones, minimal backwards heat propagation, and a preferable aspect ratio compared to single slot, dual slot, and monopole antennas.

Materials employed for this research included COMSOL Multiphysics software version 4.4 for simulations, a 2.45 GHz solid-state microwave generator by Sairem SAS, semi-rigid coaxial cable (RG405), excised bovine liver samples for empirical testing, Teflon tape, and NIH's ImageJ software for analyzing images of the ablations.

The researchers used ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) within SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) to evaluate differences in ablation sizes and shapes between the four types of antennas. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered indicative of statistical significance. Additionally, they compared the percentage differences in ablation diameter and length of each antenna type against the monopole antenna's performance.
