The foundational communication method in wireless networks is the broadcast of messages, but unlike wired local area networks where a broadcast reaches all network nodes, wireless network broadcasts are inherently local, with messages only reaching nodes within the senderâ€™s communication range. Consequently, while in wired networks, if node A can communicate with node B, and node B can communicate with node C, then node A should also be able to communicate directly with node C, this transitive property does not hold true in wireless networks.

Our research focuses on mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), which are characterized by their self-organizing capabilities and lack of centralized control or pre-installed infrastructure for message routing. MANETs are formed by a group of wireless nodes that cooperate to enable message routing across multiple hops without relying on any established network infrastructure.

Within our research, we propose novel mechanisms for dealing with location names in such networks. We introduce a static binder for location names, signified by \l, that does not allow for its scope to be extended, which diverges from the previous approach that did allow for scope extension. This new binding mechanism not only hides any broadcasting that occurs at a location 'l' from external observers but also confines connectivity with the node at 'l' within the binder's scope.

We start with the assumption of an infinite set of names 'N', which are denoted by 'n', an infinite set of variables 'X', denoted by 'x', and two separate finite sets 'F' and 'G', containing constructor and destructor symbols, respectively. These symbols are represented by 'f' and 'g'. We define a set of terms using a specific grammar, where 'f' stands for a constructor symbol with 'k' arity. The symbol 't' is used to denote the comprehensive set of these terms that do not contain any variables.
