The academic paper discusses how modeling and simulating land use and land cover (LULC) changes can help predict future development scenarios and inform land use planning efforts. These models are important for understanding issues like land degradation and deforestation, which are key concerns in urban planning. There is substantial research aimed at identifying the driving forces behind LULC changes and improving the accuracy of these models, especially in terms of measuring neighboring area effects and integrating temporal dynamics with other models that impact LULC, such as transportation and groundwater models.

A significant focus is on rapidly changing LULC in Southeast Asian countries due to factors like population growth and economic development, which lead to urban expansion and loss of agricultural lands. There are examples of large-scale deforestation for palm oil plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, driven by international market demands. Urbanization also affects LULC changes in other developing countries.

The use of remote sensing (RS), geographical information systems (GIS), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) helps in understanding these changes. The multilayer perception artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) is highlighted for its reliability and effectiveness in pattern recognition and classification, making it a valuable tool for managing large datasets and projecting land use changes.

One study mentioned utilized an MLP-ANN model to analyze high-resolution data and determine urban expansion in Surabaya, Indonesia, ensuring accuracy through ground truth points. Another GIS-based study analyzed spatial patterns of LULC.

The paper also presents an LULC transition matrix that visually demonstrates changes between different land classifications from 2017 to 2021, showing increases in water bodies, trees, built areas, and rangeland, but decreases in croplands and other categories. Projections for 2030 and 2050 suggest an ongoing increase in built areas and a decline in agricultural lands, indicating strong trends toward industrialization and urbanization.

The study concludes that information from the LULC transition matrix and MLP-ANN predictions helps with sustainable land use management and planning. The MLP-ANN model's predictive capabilities could be further enhanced by considering climate change impacts and other environmental factors, which would lead to a more comprehensive understanding of future land use patterns and assist in developing sustainable strategies for places such as Davao City, Philippines. The paper suggests that including elevation and proximity to roads as factors in the model affected the accuracy of the predictions, which were very high for the year 2021 and indicated that the model could be effective for future projections as well.
