The provided text discusses the complexities and algorithms related to search trees in graphs. It references foundational work on the subject while presenting new results regarding the difficulty of recognizing if a spanning tree can be produced by particular graph searches. Here is a paraphrased summary:

Graph searches like breadth-first and depth-first search play pivotal roles in various algorithms, revealing significant structures within graphs. These searches yield trees that can represent minimum paths or planar graph testing aids. Even though the potential underlying reasons for the effectiveness of graph searches aren't fully understood, multi-sweep algorithms leverage these searches for complex analytical tasks.

The complexity of recognizing if a given spanning tree is a product of certain searches remains partially unsettled. The text elaborates on the proven feasibility of determining search trees for depth-first and breadth-first searches, and now extends this analysis to more complex searches such as lexicographic searches and maximum neighborhood searches. On the one hand, it's shown that for some of these searches, recognizing search trees can be done in polynomial time, or even linear time in specific graph classes like split graphs. On the other hand, this recognition is NP-complete for others.

The study of end-vertices, which are vertices visited last in a search, also receives attention due to its relevance in a variety of applications. The difficulty in determining the possibility of a vertex being an end-vertex across different searches and graph classes is highlighted, with some NP-hard problems noted.

The paper outlines the dual challenge of handling both labeled search tree recognition, where a target tree structure is given, and unlabeled recognition, where an isomorphic match is sought without specific labels. While some problems have known complexities, others remain open challenges in the field, inviting further research to comprehend and harness the properties of graph searches and their associated trees more effectively.
