This paper introduces a novel approach to verifying properties of hybrid systems using a bounded linear temporal logic through an interval method. This method allows for the possibility of obtaining inconclusive results if the verification cannot be achieved with the required precision. The core contribution of the paper is an efficient, rigorous monitoring algorithm that demonstrates the decidability of the problem by simulating a hybrid automaton and using interval time to determine when atomic propositions hold.

The authors outline the relevance of temporal logic properties in the context of hybrid systems and highlight the limitations of current verification tools. These tools typically rely on numerical simulations that are prone to qualitative errors due to numerical inaccuracies, affecting the reliability of verification.

Prior research has leveraged interval methods in hybrid system reachability analysis, offering overapproximations of reachable states. This paper builds on those methods by emphasizing the use of proofs within interval analysis to verify more generalized temporal properties.

The interval method proposed in this paper aims to integrate with existing statistical methods, offering enhanced reliability and practicality. The notion of robustness in simulation-based verification is also discussed, with the new method providing more rigorous robustness by ensuring trajectories intersect with boundaries in state space.

The paper details the approach for systems modeled as deterministic hybrid automata and suggests that the method can be extended to non-deterministic systems. The experiments show successful verification in tightly enclosed trajectories, while also exhibiting a high rate of inconclusive results in more complex scenarios involving chaotic models or close encounters with guards.

In summary, the paper presents a sound method for validating bounded linear temporal logic properties, ensuring that all trajectories from initial values satisfy the given properties. The method uses interval-based ODE integration and an interval Newton method, showing promise for practical applications in analyzing nonlinear and complex hybrid systems.
