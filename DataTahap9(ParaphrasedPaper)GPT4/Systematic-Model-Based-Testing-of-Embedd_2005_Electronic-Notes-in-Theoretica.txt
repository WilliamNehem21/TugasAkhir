The referenced academic text suggests that achieving high speed is contingent upon certain classes being designated within the 'm-ct,' which is a necessary precondition. However, the actual attainment of high speed is determined by the test scenario's dynamics, such as the starting point of the test and how long the test or successive tests are conducted with specific values, which are considered the sufficient conditions for reaching high speed.
