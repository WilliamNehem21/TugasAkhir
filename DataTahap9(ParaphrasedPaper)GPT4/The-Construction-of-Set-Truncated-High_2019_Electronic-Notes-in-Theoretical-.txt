This academic paper focuses on the exploration of higher inductive types (HITs), which are central to homotopy type theory (HoTT). These types extend beyond traditional inductive types, allowing the inclusion of constructors for points, paths, and homotopies, amongst other structures. HITs have been applied in various areas such as synthetic homotopy theory, homotopical patch theory, and in definitions related to type theory itself.

The authors express gratitude to their colleagues for contributing to stimulating discussions and to the reviewers for their recommendations on improving the paper's clarity. This research was sponsored by a grant from COST Action EUTypes CA15123.

The paper's primary contribution is the demonstration of how a broad class of HITs can be constructed from simpler, non-recursive HITs. While previous work by Kraus, van Doorn, and Rijke has established the construction of propositional truncations using non-recursive HITs, the authors' results differ notably in that they do not limit themselves to set-truncated types.

The paper proposes a method for defining the semantics of HITs by simplifying the proof of their existence to proving the existence of a basic subset of HITs. This contrasts with other approaches, such as those by Coquand and others, who interpret HITs in cubical type theory, and Lumsdaine and Shulman, who provide a semantic scheme via cell monads with parameters in model categories.

The authors introduce two criteria: a type X is called a proposition if any two elements are equal, and it is called a set if the type of their equality is itself a proposition. Having laid these foundations, they then proceed to define HITs by presenting introduction, elimination, and computation rules associated with algebra structures.

By turning to initial algebra semantics, the authors explain how to construct the initial algebra that satisfies induction. This is a technique that allows them to deduce the presence of a HIT after establishing the initial algebra, which fits within the framework of category theory.

The paper further explores the properties required of an output in the elimination rule - a dependent map that retains the algebra structure. A HIT is shown to be initial if there is exactly one morphism from it to any given algebra, meaning it is contractible in this context.

The results demonstrate that finitary, set-truncated HITs can be generated from simpler, non-recursive HITs. The authors illustrate this with examples, such as the integers modulo 2 and the propositional truncation. They also clarify that the method relies on polynomials being finitary, highlighting a limitation that the result cannot extend to infinitary polynomials without additional assumptions such as the axiom of choice. Furthermore, they note an example of an infinitary HIT by Lumsdaine and Shulman that cannot be constructed from pushouts, emphasizing the specificity of the construction method to the finitary case.
