If the value of k is insufficient for the conditions outlined in Theorem 3.2, an upper bound can still be determined as demonstrated in Theorem 3.3. It should be noted that although this upper bound may not be exact, it will not exceed the sigma chromatic number by more than one.

Furthermore, according to Remark 2.5, vertices with varying degrees will also possess distinct color sums. Therefore, any vertex at the beginning or end of the graph, within the top k vertices sorted by the canonical order, will exhibit a unique color sum compared to its adjacent vertices. This is because vertices sharing the same degree level are not directly connected if their degree is less than 2k. The remaining point to verify is that vertices sharing an identical degree also have differing color sums.
