In this paper, we introduce techniques to transform certain optimization problems, specifically the budgeted and generalized maximum coverage problems, into a variant of the knapsack problem that incorporates conflict graphs. Our transformations maintain the approximation ability of solutions, allowing us to develop polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) for these complex problems, but only for particular types of instances. Extending from our approximation schemes, we demonstrate that it is possible to create pseudo-polynomial time algorithms and, under certain conditions, these can be simplified to polynomial-time algorithms. We also explore the specific features of instances for which such solutions are applicable.

Although it's generally believed to be unlikely that a PTAS or pseudo-polynomial time algorithms exist for these problems in the broader context due to their computational complexity (unless P=NP), we shed light on the possibility of their existence in specific, constrained scenarios. We disclose necessary and sufficient conditions that help identify such specialized instances.

We detail our approach to transferring the budgeted and generalized maximum coverage problems into the knapsack problem with conflict graphs, and how this leads to useful approximation algorithms for certain restrictions of these problems. We further discuss the instances that satisfy the criteria for these algorithms and introduce exact algorithms for more narrowly defined cases. Lastly, we present our conclusions and outline possible future research directions.

We elaborate on the characteristics BMC instances should possess to align with KCG instances that have weakly chordal conflict graphs, diving into the nuances of these structures, their implications, and the resulting contradictions in certain configurations.

From these insights, we infer that a PTAS derived for the knapsack problem with conflict graphs can induce a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for a certain subset of the budgeted maximum coverage problem, specifically when we deal with conflict graphs that are weakly chordal or have bounded treewidth.

We support our claims with propositions and proofs. For example, if the reduction from the budgeted maximum coverage to the knapsack problem with conflict graphs leads to instances where item weights are bounded by a constant independent of the instance, the resulting algorithmâ€™s complexity becomes polynomial with respect to the input size. This has practical implications in real-world problems like test-case prioritization where weights may be uniform.

Finally, we solidify this concept through Proposition 4.2 which confirms that for budgeted maximum coverage problem instances with uniformly bounded weights, the algorithm derived from our transformations indeed operates in polynomial-time.
