The paper discusses the importance of algorithms in identifying pharmacologically relevant regions by analyzing fragments from bioactive compounds. Despite their usefulness, these methods are often limited to a small chemical space and typically depend on exhaustive or stochastic search algorithms. Therefore, there's a need for new fragment-based approaches capable of rapidly designing a large variety of compounds with both high structural novelty and target specificity.

The authors introduce a tool called DeLinker, which connects two fragments in three dimensions, and a transformer model developed by their group called SyntaLinker, which links terminal fragment pairs from the ChEMBL database. They also report that deep generative models can be customized for specific targets using transfer learning and a targeted subset of bioactive compounds. Following this approach, they propose SyntaLinker-Hybrid, a workflow for generating molecules tailored to specific targets by combining transfer learning with fragment hybridization.

SyntaLinker is a deep generative model using transformer architecture. It comprises multiple encoder-decoder stacks, with each containing a multi-head self-attention sub-layer and a position-wise feedforward network. For model training, they prepared protein structures, utilized the LigPrep module to generate tautomers and isomers, and employed the Epik algorithm for determining ionization states at pH 7.0. A docking site was defined and Glide-SP precision docking was carried out.

The study uses MACCS fingerprints as structural descriptors to represent chemical space, applying PCA on these fingerprints to analyze molecular shape similarities and docking scores through ROCs and kernel density estimation.

Considering computational costs, only 10,000 fragment pairs were randomly selected for model sampling, with ten molecules generated per pair, leading to a substantial number of valid and unique molecules, particularly for fragments not included in the initial training set. The findings showed a notable level of uniqueness and validity across the generated molecules for the different targets.

Lastly, the paper cites the work of Sun et al. (2017), which created ExCAPE-DB, a substantial dataset designed to facilitate big data analysis in chemogenomics, indicating the paper's relevance to big data applications in this field.
