The paper introduces a concept known as the "px-simplicity" to improve upon the existing strategies of thinning in digital images. Thinning is a process used to reduce the thickness of shapes within an image to their skeletal form while maintaining their original structure and connectivity. This technique is particularly useful in pattern recognition and image processing applications.

The authors highlight that px-simplicity allows for a new thinning approach that does not require pre-labeling steps or the analysis of a large neighbourhood around each point, unlike existing thinning algorithms that rely on the notion of p-simplicity. Px-simple points are a type of point that, when identified, can be removed without altering the topological properties of the image.

They elaborate on the need to differentiate between various types of adjacency when discussing the components of an image set, X, and its complement, X, to properly correspond to their topology. They specifically focus on a case using a 26-adjacency for X and a 6-adjacency for X. The paper introduces topological numbers to theoretically establish the preservation of topology when px-simple points are removed.

The authors propose a thinning algorithm that iteratively removes px-simple points, ensuring that the overall topology is maintained. They outline the structure of their algorithm and its ability to produce skeletons of curves and surfaces by deleting these px-simple points. This new thinning approach is also compared to other existent thinning algorithms.

The significance of their work lies in the fact that their new algorithm simplifies the thinning process while ensuring that the basic topological features of the original image, such as connectedness and the presence of holes or cavities, are preserved. Their approach is validated by demonstrating that an algorithm which deletes px-simple points will be guaranteed to preserve the topology due to the inherent property that a px-simple point is also p-simple.

In summary, the paper presents a new and more efficient method for image thinning that simplifies the process and maintains the image's topology through the concept of px-simplicity.
