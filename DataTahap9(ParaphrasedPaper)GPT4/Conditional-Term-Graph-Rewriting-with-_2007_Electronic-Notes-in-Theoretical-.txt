The paper discusses conditional term rewrite systems (CTRSs) and their properties, along with efficiency concerns when implementing term rewriting systems. Here is a paraphrased summary:

The unconditional term rewrite system (TRS), denoted by RU, is derived from a conditional TRS (R) by removing the conditions from its rewrite rules. When (F, R) forms a 2-CTRS, then (F, RU) is an unconditional TRS in the standard sense. However, this doesn't apply to 3-CTRSs, because their type 3 rules can have variables on the right-hand side that are not present on the left-hand side. Within a CTRS R, certain characteristics such as left-linearity and the concept of a constructor term are defined by the system RU. These properties are based only on the left-hand sides of the system RU, making them well-defined even if RU is not a standard TRS.

Additionally, the paper discusses the hierarchical relationship between positions in terms, defining that if position P is strictly below position Q (or Q strictly above P), then P and Q are considered to be disjoint if neither is below the other. Certain necessary restrictions are highlighted, supported by referenced counterexamples. An extension is possible to work with almost orthogonal systems and infeasible conditional critical pairs, citing the level-confluency in a particular CTRS from an example.

For reasons of efficiency, term rewriting is often implemented by term graph rewriting, where expressions are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) instead of terms. This allows for common subexpressions to be shared, reducing the time and space required for evaluations. When expressions are represented as graphs, redundant computations of subterms are avoided, as highlighted by comparisons with term rewriting which could involve costly duplication of large subterms.

Investigations into term graph rewriting have been extensive, and it has been shown that directed acyclic graphs can be associated with well-marked terms. Therefore, transforming graphs can be emulated by rewriting these well-marked terms. The paper recaps some basic concepts from term graph rewriting and cites various studies that have explored this area.
