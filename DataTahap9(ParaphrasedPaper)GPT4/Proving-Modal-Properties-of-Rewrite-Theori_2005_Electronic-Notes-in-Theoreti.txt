Rewriting logic serves as an expressive system for specifying the behavior and evolution of concurrent and distributed systems, essentially acting as a logic that characterizes change. On top of this, the Verification Logic for Rewriting Logic (VLRL) is constructed as a modal logic, enhancing the ability to reason about these changes at an abstract level. In this context, we introduce a method that allows for the automated verification of VLRL properties within systems defined by rewriting logic. This is achieved by utilizing the reflective capabilities present within Maude, a software system that implements rewriting logic, thereby providing a robust foundation for proving properties about system changes and transitions.
