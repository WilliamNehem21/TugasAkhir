The article discusses epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by irregular brain activities readily observed through electrical signals in the brain. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an effective tool for studying and monitoring these signals in epilepsy patients.

To facilitate the analysis, the research proposes clustering patient cases to optimize the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which can lead to less computational load via channel reduction. The proposed system extracts key temporal and spectral features from EEG signals and incorporates data preprocessing techniques, such as data superposition and target anticipation, to enhance the ANN's predictive accuracy.

The study classifies patients based on the prevalence of epileptic episodes in their EEG records, selects common EEG channels, and labels the data with potential epileptic events. Then, channel reduction and feature extraction occur, followed by data normalization and target encoding. Two Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) structures are designed based on the data manipulation techniques and examined for prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in identifying pre-seizure (pre-ictal) states.

A threshold for peak identification in the EEG signals is established through preliminary testing, improving peak detection. The targets are encoded using one-hot encoding to facilitate ANN processing, transforming them into binary arrays, indicating the presence or absence of seizures.

Different anticipatory and overlapping data techniques were tested, showing variable sensitivity improvements, which were strongly dependent on individual patient data. Despite the potential rise in sensitivity for certain groups, the results indicate that the anticipation of targets did not consistently benefit the model's performance.

The research attained up to an 8.33% success rate in early seizure detection and a 61.3% success rate in categorizing epileptic events. The paper points to the difficulty of creating a generalized ANN model that learns the diverse EEG patterns from multiple patients. Previous studies using the same database achieved higher classification accuracy using different approaches, such as extreme learning techniques and patient-specific LSTM models, which accounted for class imbalances and different time windows for prediction evaluation.

The findings suggest a strong dependence of predictions on each patient's specific EEG patterns, indicating the challenges in generalizing across multiple patients with a single ANN model. As a result, the study recommends initially training and testing models on individual patients before attempting generalization.

Future research directions involve combining additional features, employing multivariate discriminant analysis for better feature correlation with pre-ictal periods, and experimenting with larger datasets and more sophisticated deep learning models. This could lead to models with fewer required EEG channels if significant features are effectively extracted. Comparing results across similar EEG databases could further enhance understanding and generalization capabilities of ANN models in epilepsy research.
