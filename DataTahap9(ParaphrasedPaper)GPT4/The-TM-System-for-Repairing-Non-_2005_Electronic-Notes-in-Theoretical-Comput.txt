The paper discusses the discrepancy between the structured nature of mathematics as presented in textbooks (definition-theorem-proof) and the more fluid development of mathematics in practice. Automated theorem proving tools, resembling the textbook structure, traditionally target either proving true results or finding false counterexamples, but not both. They operate on the assumption that concepts in conjectures are well-defined and relevant, which doesn't align with the exploratory and iterative nature of mathematical research that allows for evolving definitions and refinement of ideas. This calls for a shift towards more adaptable reasoning systems that can address less precisely specified problems.

Further discussed is the development of the TM system, which is part of two broader initiatives: to implement the ideas of reasoning and social interaction as described by Lakatos and to combine reasoning systems to create a new generation of AI capable of solving complex problems.

The HR system, named after mathematicians Hardy and Ramanujan, conducts descriptive induction to form theories about a given set of objects using background concepts. This approach, which differs from predictive learning systems, leads HR to produce concepts, conjectures, and proofs within its generated theories. HR utilizes generic production rules to build new concepts from existing ones.

HR has been effective in fields like number theory and algebraic domains and has also enhanced AI systems like constraint solvers. The system is now being adapted for other sciences beyond mathematics, such as bioinformatics. New HR applications also involve proof generation in addition to its previous focus on conjecture generation.

For theorem proving, the paper explains that conjectures should be inputted into the TM system using Otter first-order syntax, which requires negating the conjecture for contradiction-based resolution. While the system currently has specific input format requirements, plans exist to relax these in the future.

Using the example that all groups are abelian, the TM system's approach is to fail at proving the conjecture and its negation. It then uses Mace to find examples that support and refute the conjecture. HR then forms a specialized theory, leading TM to discover conditions under which a modified version of the conjecture (such as self-inverse groups being abelian) is proven true. This method of processing results, different from the binary output of traditional theorem provers, led to the discovery of various modified conjectures that could still be true.
