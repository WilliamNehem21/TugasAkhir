This academic paper discusses the challenge of verifying properties of parametric initial configurations in concurrent systems, using Petri nets as illustrative examples. The authors propose an assertional language combining ideas from high-level Petri nets, constraints, multiset rewriting, and constraint logic programming to symbolically represent infinite state collections for systems with varying dimensions. Colored Petri nets (CPNs), which include tokens with structured data, serve as the authors' general model for parameterized concurrent systems. However, their definition incorporates constraints with a form of multiset rewriting to specify behavior.

The paper outlines how systems are analyzed backward, independent of initial configurations, with bad configurations often forming upward-closed sets. The authors explore the symbolic treatment of these sets using a 'rich' denotation, which accounts for minimal violations in safety properties, such as ensuring only one process can use a resource at a time. They also discuss operations on sets of configurations at the symbolic level, considering the upward-closure of sets. The authors suggest further investigation into automated theorem provers, decidable fragments, and acceleration techniques in verification problems.

In conclusion, the paper extends the work of Abdulla and Jonsson, who used symbolic approaches for timed Petri nets, to more general constraint systems and problems beyond time constraints by incorporating multiset rewriting and constraints. The ideas aim to improve parametric verification in concurrent systems.
