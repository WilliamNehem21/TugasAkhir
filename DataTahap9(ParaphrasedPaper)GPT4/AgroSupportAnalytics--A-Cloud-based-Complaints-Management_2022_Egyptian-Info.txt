In the past twenty years, the agricultural industry has seen significant improvements through the adoption of data analytics and decision support systems (DSS), which have had a considerable impact on areas such as irrigation management, precision agriculture, and optimal farming practices. Although these systems provide a structured approach to analysis and step-by-step guidance for farmers, their complexity can be a barrier for those with limited literacy, particularly in developing countries.

A variety of platforms currently exist to help overcome these challenges. These include informal online forums, social networks, and interactive voice response systems, which facilitate interactions and the exchange of advice between farmers and experts.

The rise of data analytics has led to the increased use of big data technologies and digital sensors, enhancing the ability to manage data efficiently. These advancements are beneficial for the agricultural sector—especially for decision-making—but they also pose challenges in processing the volume and variety of data, including semi-structured, unstructured, and streaming data. The development of tools that evolve with user needs and abilities is essential for maximizing the potential of these data sets.

An illustrative example of these technologies in action is the web-based GIS (Geographic Information System) application used for real-time data monitoring and collection at the Puerto de la Luz seaport. The application leverages open-source big data architecture to process data from onboard system sensors.

Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) are specialized DSS applications that have improved decision-making by utilizing spatial data. The public availability of spatial data and flexible software solutions have facilitated the integration of SDSS into GIS. One such open-source project, MicroLEIS DSS, assists in agriculture soil protection and enhances land sustainability using a variety of decision-support tools and methodologies within disparate agro-ecological contexts.

A specific SDSS for agricultural land management supports the decision-making process for food crop land management, including testing, validating, and sensitivity analysis of decision models. This system uses compromise programming modules integrated with fuzzy sets and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to transform input data, such as expert field information, into actionable insights.

At the top of this system's architecture is the application layer, which end-users interact with via a graphical user interface (GUI), accessible from different client devices such as desktops or mobile phones. For optimal performance, this layer relies on interactions with lower system tiers.

The persistence services layer is crucial for data management—it imports, indexes, and stores large datasets to ensure swift and efficient access for analysis purposes. This improves scalability and performance across the data and storage components.

The data integration and storage layer, lying below the application layer, is responsible for storing, maintaining, and retrieving application data. It uses databases and file servers, ensuring separation of data from the application logic.

Additional datasets within this layer include user profiles, login information, activity history, and agro big data storage, containing historical and current farmer complaints and expert responses. Search and analytics services within the service layer use these datasets to extract meaningful information.

The information and analysis services layer handles back-end operations, providing authentication, persistence, and information services. It uses RESTful web services to authenticate users against the user data info dataset stored in a private cloud. User access to application modules is determined based on authentication results, user type, and privileges.

Lastly, the system includes a supervisory control for managing the agro-expert users, who can be added, edited, or deleted by the supervisor. New agro-experts are onboarded into the system with automated email notifications to confirm their registration.
