The paper is structured as follows:

1. Section 2 introduces the foundational constructs related to the concept and concept map languages.
2. Section 3 outlines the issue of concept map modularization that the paper aims to tackle.
3. Section 4 presents our proposed solution to the problem and details about the preprocessing framework that we have developed to implement our approach.

Within the concept map's logging component, code repetition results in lengthy function definitions which, in turn, obscures the original function invocations. Integrating helper function calls at these junctures could be advantageous, yet there is no clear location for these auxiliary functions within the existing structure. Placing these helper functions at a global scope might solve this issue but could also create confusion if their use is solely for concept maps, thereby complicating code comprehension.

Currently, "ConceptGCC" is the only compiler that supports concepts in C++. We aim not to build a new compiler, but rather to devise a preprocessor that can convert our code into a valid ConceptC++ code, maintaining the structural benefits we introduce. Our strategy involves relocating the private and protected components of the concept map into a distinct namespace and then prefixing the namespace to function calls within the public section of the concept map. We've developed a precompiler-like application to execute this code transformation.

For template-based concept maps, as shown in example 9, modification is more complex. Moving helper function definitions to a unique namespace causes the template arguments from the concept map to become undefined. To address this, these helper functions need to be converted to template functions with the same template parameters as the concept map. These template functions must then be explicitly instantiated in the concept map's public part, since their template arguments may not be included in the function parameter lists. In another example, we introduce a new concept map with helper functions for the concept stack as defined in example 9.

When creating helper functions for non-template-based concept maps, these can be defined in a separate file. However, it is essential that their definitions are placed within the same namespace as the associated concept map. As illustrated in a subsequent example, we implement logger functions external to the concept map.
