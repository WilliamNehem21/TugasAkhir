The paper introduces Linear Concurrent Constraint Programming (LCC), which combines the ideas from linear logic and linear logic programming to provide a framework where linear constraints are used—meaning when an agent employs a constraint it is removed from the common store. Timed CCP (TCC) by Saraswat et al. expands CCP with time-related aspects, while Knight et al. introduced spatial (SCCP) and epistemic (ECCP) modalities, as discussed in a survey on the current state of CCP research.

The proposed systems can represent agents with the ability to modify content in distributed spaces. By adjusting the subexponential structure underlying the system, modelers can play with different modalities. Crucially, linear logic meta-theory can be applied in reasoning about these systems.

Exploration could involve designing richer subexponential signatures in the Subexponential Linear Logic Annotations (SELLA) framework, which would yield various computational behaviors. For instance, using the[0, 1] interval as an initial signature gives the calculus a probabilistic nature. More complex topological signatures, like Hilbert spaces, might yield more compelling concurrent systems.

A distinctive aspect of linear logic as adapted here (SELL) is that it supports an unlimited number of logical prefixes ("bangs" and "question-marks"), like!i or!i?j. This differs from standard linear logic, which has only seven distinct prefixes. As presented, agents can possess internal structure, with their local store made up of various locations identified by different subexponential indices.

Unlike SCCP, the Dynamic Concurrent Constraint Programming (DCCP) allows for creating unbounded and linear locations, relevant for specifying spaces where information can be updated. DCCP language, like most process calculi, has a minimal set of constructors yet is powerful enough to describe complex behaviors of concurrent and distributed systems. It inherits CCP constructs to add (tell) information to the store, manage variable scope (local), and compose processes in parallel. Building on LCC and the Untimed CCP (UTCC), it supports free variable quantification in ask processes and has linear behavior in its store due to linear constraint consumption. By tweaking the subexponential structure, stores can be designed either to persist or to be linear. Moreover, similar to SCCP, DCCP allows confining processes to specified spaces but goes further by enabling the creation and sharing of these spaces between agents—a concept formalized using connectives d and a in SELLA.

Within DCCP, there are restrictions to prevent process execution in another agent's space (restriction 1), as well as reading from another agent's store (restriction 2). Asynchronous communication is modeled using tell processes within an agent, which are interpreted as throwing a message to another space.

Lastly, the paper discusses rule RS, explaining how processes with tell within them add constraints confined to a particular space, while ask processes in a space need to confirm the availability of a constraint within that same location to trigger subsequent actions. The rule considers the information within the specific location while ensuring that updated store contents are appropriately attributed back to their original location.
