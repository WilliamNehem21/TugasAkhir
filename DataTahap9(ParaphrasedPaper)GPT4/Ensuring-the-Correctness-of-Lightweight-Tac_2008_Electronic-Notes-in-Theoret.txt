The paper discusses the notion of "goal templates" as a component of taclets, which are elements that define how goals within a proof are transformed when applying the taclet. A taclet may include several goal templates, delineated by semicolons, indicating that the taclet can cause a goal to be divided into subgoals. Absence of a goal template implies that the taclet application concludes the proof branch.

Taclets, known for their simplicity and operational clarity, can be seamlessly integrated into the graphical user interfaces of interactive theorem provers such as the KeY system. This integration allows users to easily apply taclets by simply clicking on expressions within the interface, with the system automatically filtering applicable taclets based on the current expression. This feature significantly eases the cognitive load for users, and user interaction with the system is discussed in more detail elsewhere in the paper.

The paper also introduces a "meaning formula" which encapsulates the essence of a taclet, separate from how the taclet is applied. The correctness of a taclet essentially depends on the validity of this meaning formulaâ€”sound taclets are those that translate into correct rules when applied.

When dealing with schema variables representing logical or program variables, the paper notes that it is straightforward to substitute these with new, specific variables. However, it's crucial to be mindful of potential overlap when instantiating these variables, as different schema variables may end up being replaced with the same concrete variable, which is not allowed for variable schema by the paper's definitions. The authors elaborate that this potential for overlap splits the possible instances of a schematic expression into distinct classes, all of which need to be considered to fully grasp the schematic expression's meaning.

The paper includes an example with program variables and jump statements, illustrating that the execution of one of the jump statements is contingent on the value of a specific program variable, which is of integer type as defined in the previous section.

Finally, the authors present a lemma (Lemma 6.4), named "lifting of taclet applications," which involves a rule schema and taclet that do not utilize Skolem symbols. The lemma suggests that under certain conditions, an instance of the rule schema described by the taclet remains valid.
