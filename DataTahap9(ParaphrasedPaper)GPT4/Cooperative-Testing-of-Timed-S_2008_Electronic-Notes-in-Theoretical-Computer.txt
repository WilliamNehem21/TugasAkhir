In the study, the researchers postulate that the behavior of an implementation, referred to as 'imp,' can be described by a theoretical input/output transition system 'i.' This system is characterized by the same sets of input actions 'actin' and output actions 'actout' as those defined in the specification's transition system, named 'tiots s.' The implementation's starting state is labeled 'i0,' while the initial semantic state of the specification is 's0.' When 'i0' conforms to the testing theory called 'tioco' with 's0,' the implementation 'i' is deemed a correct realization of the specification, formally indicated as 'i tioco tiots(s).' Additionally, 'i' is presumed to be both deterministic, meaning its behavior is precisely determined by its initial conditions, and controllable, meaning it can be guided by inputs to achieve desired outputs.

The objective of this research is to conduct focused tests, not exhaustive ones, to determine if an 'imp' aligns with a 'spec' (specification). To achieve this, the concept of a 'test purpose' is utilized. The paper introduces the idea of using annotated timed CTL (Computation Tree Logic) formulas to define these test purposes. For instance, the formula 'control: A<> bright' specifies a test purpose indicating that irrespective of any uncontrollable outputs generated by the 'plant' (another component of the system) as per the 'spec' model, the 'controller' (another component) can always either make an input transition or wait so that the system will inevitably arrive at the state 'bright.' In a scenario where the researcher accepts that the 'plant' may not fully cooperate, the modified test purpose is represented by 'E<> control: A<> bright.' This relaxed condition implies that the system can be steered to reach the 'bright' state provided that the 'plant' is at least somewhat cooperative with the 'controller' in producing certain favorable outputs.
