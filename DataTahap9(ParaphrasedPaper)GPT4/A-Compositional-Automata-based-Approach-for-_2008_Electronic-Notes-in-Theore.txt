This paper introduces KCTL, a formal language with compositional semantics designed to model and verify multi-agent systems at a knowledge level. This language extends the traditional branching time logic, CTL, by incorporating knowledge operators (KK) for each agent. KCTL provides a way to understand the occurrence of an event as perceived by an individual agent.

In contrast to ATEL, where semantics are grounded in a global automaton that represents the entire system and its knowledge relations, KCTL is founded on local automata for each agent. This allows the construction of both global automata for the system and specific knowledge relations from these local models.

The key advantage of KCTL's approach is that each agent's computation is treated separately, focusing on its local processes and message-based interactions without concern for the local computations of other agents.

To support KCTL, the paper discusses model checking procedures for verifying properties of multi-agent systems in a branching time framework. The operations for composing automata result in structures where states are defined as combinations of each agentâ€™s local states, and transitions are derived from local automata edges. Actions are classified as outputs, inputs, or internal based on their roles in the component automata.

The paper then elaborates on how KCTL enables reasoning about knowledge within state transition systems by using an extension of CTL logic with specific operators. These operators facilitate the assessment of events from the perspective of individual agents in the system.

Furthermore, a model checking protocol is described for verifying properties of systems, involving not only the logic and semantics of KCTL but also considering the practical aspects of communication between agents. The paper outlines how to handle local information and state propositions for the sender and receiver, emphasizing a clear distinction between each agent's knowledge.

Lastly, the paper acknowledges the contributions from recent research in the domain of concurrent systems model checking and seeks to improve upon these by refining the depiction of knowledge relations through local automata specifications.
