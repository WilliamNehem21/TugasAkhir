Automatic differentiation (AD) enables the conversion of code that computes a function into code that computes the function's derivatives. AD works by manipulating a specialized type of graph known as a weighted term graph, or linearized computational graph. Applying AD in languages like C/C++ and Fortran can be difficult; it requires precise tracking of variable usage to correctly build the graph representing the computation.

The paper details how weighted term graphs can be constructed and used in these imperative programming languages, as exemplified in the ADIC 2.0 system. It is structured to offer an overview of term graph construction, describe the necessary static analyses that contribute to the process, discuss the combination of graphs from separate statements, introduce an XML format for graph representation, consider the potential mutual benefits of term graphs and the AD community, and it concludes with a summary of the findings.

Key static analyses such as alias analysis and reaching definitions play a crucial role in AD. Alias analysis helps determine if different inputs are related, while reaching definitions analysis informs us about the reachability of variable definitions within the code. Another analysis, known as activity analysis, identifies "passive" variables that don't affect the derivatives and can be ignored in term graphs.

The paper suggests that AD might be viewed as a rewrite system that could offer benefits beyond its current use, possibly enhancing the optimization of loops and recursive functions. Additionally, functional programming languages might align naturally with this graph-based perspective on AD.

The authors presented a new conceptual framework for AD, guaranteeing a structured and unique output in the form of a bipartite graph. They foresee that this interpretation could stimulate the development of algorithms for recursive functions and the theoretical understanding of AD algorithms. 

Though the paper emphasizes static methods, AD utilities often incorporate both static and dynamic techniques. For unclear cases, decisions about variable statuses can be postponed until runtime. Future research will explore strategies for handling ambiguities in static analyses.

The paper acknowledges that introducing new vertices to the computational graph could potentially make derivative computation more efficient, but it would also challenge the termination assurance of the AD process. Work on graph rewriting and bisimilarity might offer insights for computing derivatives more effectively under such circumstances. Moreover, the authors touch on the computational complexity of AD, with some rewriting rules associated with NP-hard problems.
