Agriculture serves as a foundational source of sustenance for both humans and animals and has been integral to our lives throughout the evolution of civilization. Central to agriculture is crop production, which, through the cultivation of plants such as wheat and cotton, supplies the essential food and materials we depend on. Agriculture has progressed alongside other sectors, incorporating diverse types of crops and ancillary activities like farming and cattle rearing.

Producing crops involves meticulous management of various factors including soil analysis, seed selection, and nutrient optimization to ensure optimal yields throughout different seasons. Although integral to feeding the world's population, agriculture faces significant challenges due to plant diseases that can lead to substantial losses.

Plant diseases interfere with normal plant functions, potentially resulting in diminished growth, fruit yield, and increased leaf fall. These diseases spread through various means, including pathogens like fungi, bacteria, and viruses, and can be transmitted from one crop to another or through seeds.

Traditionally, disease detection in crops has been performed by experts who visually inspect plants. However, this method can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, especially for large-scale agricultural operations. Contemporary challenges have spurred the development of faster and more efficient diagnostic techniques such as image processing and deep learning, which not only save time but also enhance crop protection by enabling early disease detection and treatment.

Various imaging techniques, including photoacoustic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorescence spectroscopy, are utilized for plant stress and disease detection. Among these, hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying diseases across a wide spectrum of light, providing detailed information at the pixel level and enabling studies down to the genotypic level.

Recent research has focused on harnessing the full potential of digital image analysis, leveraging 2D and 3D imaging, along with machine learning algorithms and various sensors to distinguish between healthy and diseased plants, assess the severity of infections, and make informed management decisions.

Studies have employed imaging techniques in novel applications, such as detecting temperature variations and physiological responses in plants to identify diseases early on. Thermal imaging, hyperspectral imaging, and various spectroscopic examination methods have also been integrated, providing multi-faceted data that improve the accuracy of disease detection.

Despite the advancements in imaging methods, challenges persist in optimizing these technologies for specific diseases and automating the disease detection process for continuous monitoring. Nonetheless, with continued research and development, the efficiency and robustness of these techniques are likely to improve, supporting sustained agricultural production and disease mitigation in the future.
