Effective scheduling of air medical services is crucial in saving lives during patient transfers and disaster responses, especially when resources are limited and the population is dispersed. While precise scheduling methods exist, their computational time can be prohibitive in large scenarios. This study developed a new integer linear programming model to optimize the scheduling of air medical services. Using coordinates of air and health facilities, the model was implemented in Gurobi and compared with two novel heuristics: a neighborhood search algorithm and a tabu search algorithm. The tabu search proved superior, providing near-optimal solutions much faster than Gurobi could, particularly for large problems. The study also explored parallel computing with CUDA but found limited benefits due to the small sample sizes.

The paper is structured with a literature review, problem modeling, algorithmic solution descriptions, results, and a conclusion. A cited work by Repoussis et al. introduced a hybrid approach combining heuristic and tabu search methods to optimize resource use and response time in disaster scenarios. This paper focuses on air ambulance scheduling, considering constraints like vehicle positioning and patient arrival times. A custom algorithm ensures valid initial scheduling solutions before optimization, with a parallel variation exploiting CUDA for concurrent operations.

The primary optimization algorithm, seeking to minimize total travel time, adapts the initial solutions iteratively with a focus on solution diversity and continuous improvement until no better configuration is found. Parallel processing is used to enhance search speed. An extension of this approach includes a tabu list to circumvent local optima traps, guiding the search toward more fruitful regions of the solution space.

Experiments were conducted with eight datasets from real-world coordinates and tested on a high-performance computing system, including a graphics card for CUDA operations. Results suggest that the proposed heuristic algorithms, particularly tabu search, are effective and efficient alternatives to exact optimization methods like Gurobi, especially in large-scale, time-sensitive EMS scheduling problems.
