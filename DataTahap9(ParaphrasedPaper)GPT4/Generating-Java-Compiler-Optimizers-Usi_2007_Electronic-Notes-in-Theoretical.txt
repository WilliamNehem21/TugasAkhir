The paper presents a new language for specifying optimization rules in compiler design which utilizes bidirectional Computational Tree Logic (CTL), a type of temporal logic, to streamline the process of Java program optimization. Traditional beliefs held that using temporal logic for optimizing compilers would be too time-consuming to be practical. However, the authors demonstrate that their method can optimize Java programs relatively quickly, with compile times ranging from four seconds to four minutes for seven SPECjvm98 benchmarks.

Traditionally, optimizers are implemented using programming languages, but the authors argue for the use of CTL as it has distinct advantages. By eliminating the unnecessary use of free variables, which generally lead to an exponential increase in computational complexity, the author's specification language improves the efficiency of the model-checking process and makes it easier to describe complex rewrite rules.

The paper introduces a novel model checker designed explicitly to accommodate the features of the Java programming language and to allow for the future extension of its functionalities. They show that their custom-built model checker is more easily adapted to handle program features and intended optimizations than modifying existing ones.

Optimizations like partial redundancy elimination, which requires complex conditional formulas, are considered in this research. The authors emphasize the importance of reducing the number of free variables used in optimization specifications to minimize the computational overhead.

Efficiency gains are also made by excluding irrelevant instructions from consideration based on the relationship of the target code to the temporal formula. For example, past instructions can be ignored when only future temporal operators are present in the CTL-based description (CTLBD).

In summary, the paper suggests that well-designed CTL-based specifications can lead to an efficient and practical approach for Java optimization in compilers, challenging the notion that temporal logic is too resource-intensive for such tasks. The paper presents a mix of theoretical foundations and experimental results to validate their approach.
