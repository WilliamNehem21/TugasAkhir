Creating educational content can be a lengthy process, typically resulting in materials confined to one system and not easily shared or reused. Although standards like IMS QTI strive to facilitate the sharing and interoperability of tests and activities across various learning platforms, QTI does not adequately address the specific challenges in authoring mathematical content, such as complex, multi-part questions, a variety of notations, and the handling of precise mathematical answers.

Formats like OpenMath, MathML, and particularly OMDoc, overcome some of these issues by enabling the publication and exchange of mathematical expressions, as well as enhancing the adaptability and intelligence of educational systems. OMDoc goes a step further by offering structures that convey the semantics of mathematical documents, fostering machine understanding.

The paper proposes motivating discussions to develop a common structure that allows for the lossless transformation of content between different formats. It highlights the importance of the <response> element in the documentation, which specifies the expected answer type and can correlate with parts of the text to integrate interactive elements. The current use of common programming syntax for expressions is acknowledged, with the expectation to transition to OpenMath or MathML for better standardization.

Variables and their representation are critical for discussion among stakeholders and establishing an exchangeable format that includes mathematical expressions. The paper suggests that further refinement of the information model is needed to encapsulate activities applicable to systems like Wallis. It envisions collaboration and shared formats, drawing inspiration from the exercise description module of OMDoc, with elements like linking expressions, supporting variables, and conditional logic for adaptability.

As QTI's second version is being developed, incorporating support for mathematical notation and variables is paramount to ensure the semantic integrity of mathematical questions in authoring and maintenance is preserved. The paper emphasizes that interactive mathematical exercises share common needs across various systems and highlights how integration with external systems like CAS or automated provers can offer adaptive feedback and handle student errors. This connection not only allows for sophisticated error checking but also enhances the learning experience through personalized feedback.
