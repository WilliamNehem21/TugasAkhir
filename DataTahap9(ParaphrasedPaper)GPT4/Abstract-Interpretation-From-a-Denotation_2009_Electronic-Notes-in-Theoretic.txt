Abstract Interpretation and Denotational Semantics are interrelated in their basics and practical uses, with complex interactions present between them. By using the inverse-limit construction along with the associated Scott topology, abstract domains can be constructed as approximations of the intricately defined Scott domains. Denotational semantics are framed in such a way that their inductive nature guarantees the accuracy of the corresponding abstract interpretation when an abstract domain is used in place of a Scott domain. Thus, the principles of abstract interpretation are effectively interpreted through the lens of denotational semantics.
