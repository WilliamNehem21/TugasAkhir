This academic paper discusses the challenge of ensuring compatibility between the precedence rules of different grammar formalisms used in various parser generators. Precedence rules often vary and are defined operationally, making it difficult to compare them across grammars. The authors propose a method and a tool to analyze and compare precedence rules from different grammars, aiding in the migration process from one grammar formalism to another.

Despite the undecidability of whether two grammars define the same language, the tool supports the comparison and recovery of precedence rules. This is particularly important for managing the migration of grammars between different parser generators and for ensuring that the migrated grammars maintain the intended language specifications.

The paper evaluates the proposed method by applying it to complex mainstream programming languages such as PHP and C. It uncovers differences and inconsistencies in the precedence rules of various grammars. The tools for implementing the method are made available as open-source software.

The authors advocate for a more disciplined approach to grammar engineering, emphasizing the necessity for solid foundations and practices. The method they present contributes to these efforts by providing a means to recover and verify precedence rules throughout a grammar's lifecycle. This represents a significant step toward greater automation in grammar recovery and the consistent use of grammars across different parsing technologies.
