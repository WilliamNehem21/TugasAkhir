In Section 2 of the paper, the authors introduce their Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models named MWLCP-CP and MWLCP-SC. The subsequent sections 3 and 4 detail the core aspects of the branch-and-price algorithm, including methods for solving LP relaxations, generating new columns, and the strategy for branching within the search tree. The authors then embark on computational testing in Section 5, assessing their algorithmâ€™s effectiveness on randomly generated data sets of varied sizes and characteristics. The paper concludes in Section 6 with a summary of findings.

Embedded within a branch-and-price framework, the column generation method necessitates solving new instances of the MWLCP for every node in the branch-and-bound (B&B) tree. This requires the development of a solid branching strategy. The following section introduces such a strategy, which is a modification of one previously proposed in existing research for the graph coloring problem (GCP).

The paper finds that problems with 50 and 60 vertices are typically resolved in just a few minutes. This is also true for problems with 70 vertices and edge probabilities of 0.5 or 0.75, indicating medium to high graph density. However, low-density graph instances with an edge probability of 0.25 present more of a challenge to solve, unless there's a high probability of vertices belonging to lists.

When evaluating the CPLEX-CF approach, it's noted that this method can solve around half of the test instances within the given time constraint (202 of 405). However, a notable drawback of CPLEX-CF is the weak lower bounds produced by the LP relaxation values. On average, LP relaxation values from BP-SC formulation are 174% higher than those yielded by CPLEX-CF, and this disparity grows with larger instance sizes across parameters of number of vertices (n), edge probability (p), weight (c), and membership-to-list probability (q). The largest discrepancy observed is within instances where n = 70, p = 0.75, c = 1.5, and q = 0.75, where the LP relaxations of BP-SC are 604% larger.
