The paper discusses the concept of First Degree Entailment (FDE), a logical system originally put forward by Graham Priest. FDE is described as a multi-valued logic that can be approached in different ways, particularly as a four-valued framework consisting of: t (true only), f (false only), b (both true and false), and n (neither true nor false). The negation operation within this system converts 't' to 'f', 'f' to 't', while leaving 'n' as 'n' and 'b' as 'b'. The logical operations of conjunction and disjunction correspond to the greatest lower bound (glb) and least upper bound (lub), respectively. In FDE, the designated values for truth are 'b' and 't'.

To align with the notation of previously addressed logics, the values in FDE are reassigned as: 0 (false only), 1 (neither true nor false), 2 (both true and false), and 3 (true only). When using these numerical representations, FDE appears as a sub-logic within its own system, albeit a proper subset since not all rules preserve the designation of truth values. Specifically, the rule for introducing disjunction fails to maintain consistent designations, as demonstrated by an appropriate counterexample.

The discussion then touches upon three-valued logics, which are another form of many-valued logic systems where there are three truth values: true, false, and a third indeterminate value denoted as 'n', representing neither true nor false. The paper mentions the pioneering work of Jan ≈Åukasiewicz and C. I. Lewis in developing the foundational concepts of three-valued logics.
