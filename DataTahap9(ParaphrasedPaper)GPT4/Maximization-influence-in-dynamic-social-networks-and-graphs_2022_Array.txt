This paper examines the challenge of maximizing the spread of influence in dynamic social networks, which are networks that evolve over time. Traditional research on social influence and diffusion tends to focus on static networks, which do not change. To address influence diffusion in dynamic networks, the authors propose three algorithms that build upon established influence diffusion modelsâ€”the Linear Threshold (LT) and Independent Cascade (IC):

1. The Dynamic Mati (DM) algorithm, which is an adaptation of the MATI algorithm designed for dynamic networks, improving the efficiency of the influence maximization (IM) problem.
2. The DM-Core (DM-C) algorithm builds on the DM algorithm and employs k-core decomposition techniques along with core number information to solve the IM problem more effectively.
3. The DM-Truss (DM-T) algorithm, another variation of DM, uses k-truss decomposition and truss number information to address the IM problem.

Experimental results indicated that these proposed algorithms can double diffusion effectiveness when compared to other existing state-of-the-art approaches and can achieve results on par with the Greedy algorithm for diffusion. Additionally, the new algorithms were found to be 8.5 times faster in terms of computational time compared to previous methods.

The paper also mentions related work where various methods were suggested for selecting influential seed users in a network. For example, Chen et al. introduced the PMIA method focusing on high diffusion paths, as well as a degree discount heuristic penalizing adjacent nodes to a selected seed node. Cai et al. discussed a holistic approach to influence maximization, and Song et al. developed the BI-CLKT model that applies contrastive learning using unlabelled data.

Furthermore, the paper references datasets from a European research institution's email logs, a dataset showing contact between children, teachers and healthcare workers in a hospital ward, and a dataset of private messages from an online social network at the University of California, Irvine. All these datasets reflect temporal networks where interactions are time-stamped.

The study concludes by highlighting the improved performance of the proposed methods over existing approaches and the significant reduction in computational time. Finally, future work is envisaged to explore influence maximization in partially observed dynamic networks and to investigate other models beyond the LT and IC for dynamic networks.
