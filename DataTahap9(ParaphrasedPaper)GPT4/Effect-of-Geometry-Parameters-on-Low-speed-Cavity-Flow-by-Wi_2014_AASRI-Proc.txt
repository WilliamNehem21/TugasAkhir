This paper outlines the creation of an experimental platform in a low-turbulence wind tunnel to investigate cavity flow characteristics. The study used measurements of wall static pressure and acoustic pressure from microphones to analyze how different cavity shapes behave at low speeds. It focused on how the length-to-depth ratio and the width-to-depth ratio affect the flow patterns and noise produced by cavities. The findings revealed that in an incompressible flow state, cavity flow patterns remain constant regardless of flow velocity. The study found that a length-to-depth ratio range of 1 to 12 spans a transition from open to closed flow patterns and that increased length-to-depth ratios lead to higher cavity noise levels (radiated SPL). Moreover, the research observed that a larger aspect ratio results in greater sound pressure energy within the cavity.

The interest in cavity flow is driven by its prevalence in engineering situations such as aircraft landing gear wells, weapons bays, and vehicle sunroofs. The interaction of flow with these cavities can lead to oscillations and resultant noise. Cavity flow research is complex, involving interactions between flow dynamics, sound, and vortices, as well as unsteady and unstable shear layers, making this area of aerodynamics research both challenging and significant internationally.
