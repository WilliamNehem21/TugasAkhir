The survey focuses on the significant strides made in the field of multiobjective optimization over the past twenty years, shining a light on key research areas. Giving a brief introduction to specialized sub-fields, the survey provides recommended literature for further exploration, mainly emphasizing advancements in algorithm development. The survey pays particular attention to publicly accessible solvers and techniques designed for novel problem categories like non-convex and mixed-integer problems. Other topics include bilevel optimization issues, managing uncertainty with robust methods, and their connection to set optimization. Moreover, the survey notes the growing interest in numerical methods that eschew scalarization.

Multiobjective optimization, involving the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, has a research history dating back to the seminal works of Edgeworth in 1881 and Pareto in 1906, with mathematical foundations established by Kuhn and Tucker in 1951. The field gained momentum around the 1960s, with various educational texts contributing to the knowledge base. The series "Vector Optimization" features specialized publications on optimization with vector-valued objectives, highlighting developments in identifying all optimal solutions from a mathematical perspective as opposed to decision-making processes.

The survey also references the Dagstuhl meetings since 2004, which unite experts across multicriteria decision making, multiobjective optimization, and evolutionary algorithms; these meetings often touch upon current research themes. Furthermore, it mentions that while there is literature on non-convex problems, free solver implementations are limited.

MOSQP and Direct Multisearch (DMS) are two solvers mentioned that approach nonlinear multiobjective optimization differently, with the latter being available for academic use. The survey acknowledges a shift away from scalability-focused scalarizations to more direct techniques and reviews basic scalarization methods alongside recent literature and books that delve into these topics.

For non-convex issues, scalarization methods can be tricky as they transform the problem into non-convex single-objective subproblems, requiring global optimization. Algorithms for mixed binary linear multiobjective problems and convex mixed integer multiobjective problems are introduced, along with a discussion on decision space and criterion space methods, recommending a hybrid approach.

Addressing uncertainties in optimization problems, robust optimization seeks solutions that are good and feasible across all scenarios. The paper closes with acknowledgments from the author to the reviewers and colleagues who contributed feedback to the manuscript and notes that the research received no specific grants.
