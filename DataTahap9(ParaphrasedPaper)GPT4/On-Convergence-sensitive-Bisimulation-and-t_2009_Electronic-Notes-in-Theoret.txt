The Temporal Concurrent Constraint System (TCCS) model draws inspiration from the concept of time as it exists within the Esterel framework and related systems like Synchronous Languages (SL). These paradigms use signals for communication; signals endure for an entire instant and then vanish as the instant concludes. It has been demonstrated that signals can be recursively defined within TCCS.

Further in the paper, the authors introduce a form of bisimulation that takes into account context and the sensitivity to convergenceâ€”in essence, how systems behave and "converge" in specific contexts. This new form of bisimulation is shown to be describable using a modified version of traditional labeled bisimulation, which factors in the idea of contextual convergence.

One key result from the paper is that standard CCS processes without timing considerations can be integrated into timed systems with full abstraction. Meaning, the characteristics and behaviors of untimed processes can be completely and accurately captured within the timed framework.

In addition, the authors enhance the concept of bisimulation to incorporate sensitivity to divergence, further refining how we understand and measure the equivalency of process behaviors when considering both convergence and divergence in system interactions.
