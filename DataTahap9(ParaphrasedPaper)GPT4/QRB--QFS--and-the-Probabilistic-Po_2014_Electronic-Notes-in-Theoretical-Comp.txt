Paraphrased Outline of the Academic Paper:

Section 2 commences the paper with necessary introductory remarks. The discussion advances in Section 3 to explore functional approximation—a fundamental idea within domain theory central to the understanding of RB-, FS-, QRB-, and QFS-domains. Embracing the domain-theoretic ethos of M. Stone, which promotes the topologization of concepts, Section 4 introduces QFS-spaces as topological analogs to QFS-domains. In Section 5, the paper reveals a significant finding: QRB-domains and QFS-domains are equivalent, aligning with four other related concepts, including sober QFS-spaces. This convergence is further elucidated in the context of the probabilistic powerdomain of a QRB-domain, substantiated in Section 6 as maintaining its QRB-domain structure.

The paper details how, through rigorous evaluation, the four different potential structures of concern—ranging from arbitrary images of general compact saturated sets to finite images of finitary compacts—surprisingly converge to identical structures. This convergence holds true both with and without the assumption of sobriety.

Further examination of the probabilistic powerdomain V(X), initially introduced by Jones to define semantics for higher-order probabilistic programs, is presented. While Jones established V(X) as a continuous dcpo for every continuous dcpo X, she also noted its lack of continuity as a lattice or a BC-domain, even for elementary examples of these structures. The existence of V(X) as an FS-domain or an RB-domain for any given such X remains unclear, with exceptions limited to specific cases. Nonetheless, the relaxed criteria for functional approximation inherent in QRB-domains allow the probabilistic powerdomain of a QRB-domain to be closed under the same domain classification. The primary author previously demonstrated this relationship.

Using Theorem 5.7, the paper argues the irrelevance of a previously held assumption and aims to also prove the maintenance of the QRB-domain structure for more complex spaces, such as those comprising continuous subprobability valuations and general, unbounded continuous valuations. Contrastingly, the nature of this proof diverges from the earlier argument by constructing an approximating family of QFS maps on V(X).
