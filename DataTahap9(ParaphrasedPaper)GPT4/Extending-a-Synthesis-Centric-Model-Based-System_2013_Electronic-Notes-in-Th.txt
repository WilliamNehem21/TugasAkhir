Our approach to handling stochastic delays differs from other methods in that we treat them as syntactic elements and separate the synthesis process from the requirement of optimality. We focus specifically on Markovian (or exponentially-distributed) delays which allow us to apply a memoryless property for a syntactic, compositional treatment. By employing this method, we can manage industrial systems, using advanced tools like Supremica for efficient supervisor synthesis and MRMC for performance evaluation through stochastic model checking.

We can simplify the treatment of Markovian delays by considering them analogous to uniquely-named uncontrollable events due to their similar interleaving behavior. By transforming Markovian delays into uncontrollable events in the plant while maintaining unique labels, we can carry out supervisor synthesis on the modified plant.

To model stochastic elements, Markovian delays are incorporated orthogonally within extended finite automata, similar to the interactive Markov chains method. These delays are interwoven in parallel compositions, thus retaining the stochastic nature of the synchronization. We extend the concept of controllability to ensure it is preserved when treating Markovian delays as uncontrollable events. Prior work has confirmed that this process does not modify the stochastic behavior of the supervised plant.

Once the discrete-event plant, with Markovian delays converted to uncontrollable events, is coupled with the supervisor, we export the supervised and renamed discrete-event plant from Supremica. The exported data is then converted to a Markov chain using the Supremica2MRMC tool, which adjusts for state labels and data assignments.

This research addresses the high-level supervisory coordination problem of controlling vehicle movement to fulfill tasks based on given recipes, without causing damage or spillages. Unlike previous studies that used simulation and mixed property modeling, our work focuses on supervisory control that considers embedded vehicle controls for acceleration, deceleration, collision avoidance, and docking.

The system includes generators, exits, and waiting stations (conceptual constructs aiding system understanding) represented as storage and parking spaces within the hardware. Empty vessels are placed on vehicles at generators, filled with paint at filling stations (which can handle multiple colors), and then mixed at mixing stations. The mixed paint vessels are then returned, often to different vehicles, and moved to exit stations for storage.

Extended finite automata are depicted graphically with state labels next to states and event labels with possible guards and variable updates beneath them. Uncontrollable events, representing stochastic delays, are identified with labels starting with 'stoc'. For clarity and due to page constraints, this paper presents only key aspects of the model; complete details and tools are available in references [9,24].
