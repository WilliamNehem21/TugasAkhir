This academic paper discusses two approaches used for variable-rate spraying in precision agriculture: map-based and sensor-based. The map-based approach involves using a pre-existing map detailing the necessary application rates of chemicals based on soil properties, which remain relatively constant over time, such as organic matter content and soil texture. The sensor-based approach, on the other hand, involves real-time data collection from sensors as the farming operation is taking place, adjusting chemical application rates based on rapidly changing variables such as soil conditions and crop growth.

For disease control in crops, the sensor-based approach is more suitable, as diseases can spread quickly and change the landscape of a field. In this situation, relying on less dynamic map-based information could lead to outdated or inaccurate spraying. Furthermore, creating these maps typically requires time-intensive and laborious methods, such as visual estimates of plant disease, thus affecting the timeliness and responsiveness of disease control measures.

The paper outlines a study aiming to develop an image processing technique to enable real-time, variable-rate chemical spraying tailored to disease severity levels in crops. Specifically, the study's objectives include 1) creating an image processing algorithm for immediate determination of the severity of plant diseases, and 2) designing a variable-rate spraying system that adjusts chemical applications based on the severity of the disease detected.

In the study, the researchers developed a color image segmentation algorithm that relies on chromatic aberration to identify disease-affected regions in paddy crops. The proposed algorithm comprises three steps: extracting and analyzing color components, selecting a characteristic operator, and executing thresholding segmentation.

To measure the severity of the disease, the researchers defined it as the percentage of the sampling unit (e.g., leaf, plant surface) affected by disease relative to the total area. The image processing methodology allowed them to calculate this ratio based on the number of pixels representing diseased regions in images of paddy leaves.

Testing of the proposed disease-severity-based variable-rate spraying system involved comparing a standard mode of operation, where the sprayer's nozzles were always open, with a variable-rate application (VRA) mode. In VRA mode, cameras and other controls were activated to manage the nozzles' opening and closing dynamically based on the severity of disease detected. The system's performance was evaluated based on the chemical consumption in both operation modes over five different subplots. The research found an 800 ms time lag between image acquisition and chemical application; consequently, the operational speed was capped at 0.9 km/h to ensure proper function.
