The central aim of this research was to explore the creation of environmentally friendly composites using rice straw (RS) and corn-based adhesives (CA). The study looked at how RS treatments with NaOH and hot water would impact the composite materials' performance. The research also assessed how varying the density of the composite, the starch content, and the type of starch (corn, cassava, potato) affected the composites' flexural properties, and examined the microstructure of the composites' fractured surfaces.
 
Results indicated that composites with cornstarch adhesives exhibited superior flexural properties. Specifically, those created from hot-water treated straw combined with cornstarch demonstrated a better bond at the interface and enhanced flexural properties. Optimal flexural strength and modulus were obtained with a 10% starch content and a composite density of 0.7 g/cm3.
 
The researchers prepared cornstarch adhesives, mixed them with thoroughly washed RS, and examined the effects on composite properties. They observed that a composite density of 0.7 g/cm3 allowed for even distribution of the adhesive, resulting in maximum flexural strength and modulus. Beyond a density of 0.7 g/cm3, properties worsened due to a more compact structure that hindered adhesive diffusion.
 
These findings suggest that the developed composites could potentially be used in applications such as ceiling panels and bulletin boards, providing an eco-friendlier alternative to current materials that rely on energy-intensive processing of agricultural residues and non-degradable matrices.
