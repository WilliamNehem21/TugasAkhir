Researchers have been exploring innovative non-invasive and swift methods for the detection of material evidence at crime scenes, such as near infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and computer vision. One approach developed by Takamura et al. utilized Fourier Transform Attenuated Total Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy for dry urine trace detection and identified chemical markers that distinguish urine samples by donor gender. Another study by Zhao et al. explored a nondestructive method for detecting different liquids like apple juice, Coca-Cola, coffee, oolong tea, and milk on various shades of cotton denim fabric, simulating varying residue times with liquid concentrations of 100%, 50%, and 25%. This led to 48 experimental groups, including uncontaminated samples.

To reduce the impact of dark currents in sensors, images were captured with adjusted exposure times and the collection of reference dark images with a closed lens cap. Despite distributing the liquids uniformly on fabrics, the researchers focused only on spectral analysis, disregarding spatial information. This is contrary to real crime scenes where the spatial distribution of residues can be crucial and hyperspectral imaging systems can scan entire fabrics to locate them.

The study collected 2000 spectra for each image, resulting in 10,000 total spectra for each material condition. A random selection of 80% was used for calibration while the remaining 20% was for prediction. Machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are known for data classification and summarization, were then employed. The SVM was optimized for multiclass predictions, paired with a Random Forest as an auxiliary classifier to achieve an optimal model based on identified best parameters pairs.

In the analysis, the spectra of liquids proved more complex than those of fabrics, with liquids like coffee showing similarities to other beverages due to color resemblance. The light sensitivity of the fabric components varied, particularly distinguishing three kinds of fabrics and suggesting characteristic wavelengths for each.

Ultimately, the study presented a hyperspectral imaging system for detecting liquid residues at crime scenes, implementing classifiers like SVM and Random Forest to create classification models. The system excelled in tasks such as categorizing liquid types and concentrations, displaying accuracy rates above 81%, and in some cases over 91%, especially when differentiating liquid categories on denim.
