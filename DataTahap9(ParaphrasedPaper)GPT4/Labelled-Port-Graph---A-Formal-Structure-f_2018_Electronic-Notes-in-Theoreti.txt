This article presents the concept that elements of a graph transformation system can be modeled as labeled port graphs. Port graph rewriting rules are made up of two port graphs connected by an arrow node that specifies a morphism for applying single pushout semantic rewriting. Since multiple rule applications are possible, a strategy expression is used to choose not only which rule to apply but also where in the graph to apply it. The idea of "located graphs," which are labeled port graphs that determine rewrite positions and subgraphs to preserve, is introduced. Additionally, rewriting derivations guided by strategies can also be described using labeled port graphs, where nodes are labeled with graphs and strategies.

The paper explains that the set of labels (D) for these graphs is variable, allowing for different levels of expressivityâ€”from unlabeled to highly expressive, like e-graphs and symbolic graphs. Examples from various domains, such as biology and social networks, illustrate the practical application of labeled port graphs.

The paper also describes the structure of port graph rewrite rules in detail, including the arrow node with ports and labels that dictate how a rewrite step should proceed. Located graphs denote specific areas (subgraphs) for rewriting and areas that are off-limits (protected subgraphs). Derivation graphs, another form of labeled graphs, record information about the rewriting process like applied rules and probabilities.

The discussion further explores the correspondence between operational rewriting and the formal notion of single pushout constructions in the context of attributed graph structures. Moreover, it suggests the inclusion of symbolic labels to accommodate constraints and develop a more abstract understanding of constraint-based labeled port graphs.

Finally, the authors propose the idea of representing strategies, which guide rule application, as labeled port graphs. This would potentially allow for the creation of a reflective logical framework based on a graph calculus that includes strategies.

The paper is structured to first introduce labeled port graphs, provide examples, define rules and rewriting mechanics, present located port graphs, describe derivation graphs, and conclude with a discussion on related works and future research directions.
