The paper discusses a framework for forming new quantum interventions in Quantum Dynamic Logic (QDL) by composing existing interventions with a function f, and all operations in QDL can be viewed in light of these compositions. Specifically, interventions carried out through unitary operations can be considered a subset where f is the superoperator corresponding to the unitary operation U.

This method of generating new interventions from existing ones justifies the use of the quantum intervention approach. Unlike other quantum measurement approaches such as projective measurements, the described approach can represent a wider range of quantum operations, including those that are trace-preserving superoperators.

The paper also indicates that the categorical aspects of quantum arenas, which are introduced within it, have not been fully investigated. The authors suggest that these areas could be further studied by considering categories formed from quantum arenas and probabilistic strategies, which may emulate quantum operations. These categories, or certain subsets of them, have the potential to offer new insights into the categorical structures that are fundamental to the underpinnings of quantum mechanics, as referenced in other works cited in the paper.
