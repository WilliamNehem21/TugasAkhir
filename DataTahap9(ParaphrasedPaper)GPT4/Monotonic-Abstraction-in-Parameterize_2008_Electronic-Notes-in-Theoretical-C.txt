Since its initial use in lossy channel systems, this method has expanded to help create verification algorithms for various models like Petri nets, timed Petri nets, broadcast protocols, and cache coherence protocols, among others (refer to sources [8,10,11,12]).

The method enables us to work with operations on upward closed sets by representing them with word manipulations. This strategy avoids the complexity of using regular languages for reachability analysis and, as a result, is far more efficient in practice than automata-based techniques such as regular model checking (refer to sources [14,7,9]).

In this part of the paper, we introduce an abstraction that generates a conservative over-estimate of the transition system's behavior. The abstracted transition system exhibits monotonic properties, making it compatible with upward closed sets. We have established that both local and existential transitions maintain monotonicity and thus don't need approximation. Consequently, our focus is on deriving an over-approximation specifically for universal transitions.

In the context of broadcast transitions, an unspecified number of processes may shift states simultaneously, triggered by a single initiating process. Along with this initiator, multiple processes undergo a state transition at once. In contrast, binary communication involves precisely two processes, which engage in a synchronized state exchange known as a rendezvous.
