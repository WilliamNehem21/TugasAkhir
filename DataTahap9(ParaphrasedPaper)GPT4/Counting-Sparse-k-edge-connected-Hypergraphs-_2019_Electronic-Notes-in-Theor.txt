Therefore, it stands to reason to extend such enumeration inquiries to hypergraphs. Logically, one might anticipate that these issues become increasingly complex when expanded from graphs to hypergraphs, a trend observed in numerous graph-related problems. This complexity is indeed evident when attempting to determine an approximate count of connected r-uniform hypergraphs based on a specified number of vertices and edges, as illustrated in various studies ([5,1,4,3]).
