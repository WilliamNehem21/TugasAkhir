The academic paper discusses the philosophical implications that if statements about the future hold a definitive truth value (whether true or false), then the future is set in a manner similar to the past; the only difference is that future events have not yet occurred. To circumvent the issue of a predetermined future—a scenario where no further possibilities can unfold—the paper suggests moving away from the Law of Excluded Middle. This classical principle posits that every proposition must be either true or false and that there cannot be a middle ground.

Contrary to this classical view, the paper introduces the Łukasiewicz logic, which incorporates a third truth value interpreted as 'possible'. The introduction of this intermediate value allows for propositions about the future to be neither strictly true nor strictly false, thus enabling a conception of the future that isn't fixed.

The paper further details the construction of a four-valued logic system, referred to as the M4 logic. In this system, one significant feature is that when it is narrowed to a subset of three values, it aligns with an intermediate logic called G3. This new logic includes two types of negation, one of which is characterized as Łukasiewicz's negation in a four-valued framework (L4), where it functions as a strong negation.

In essence, the research steers towards the development of a more nuanced logical framework that can express uncertainty more effectively, particularly when discussing the fluid and undetermined nature of future events. The paper likely concludes with insights and potential applications of these adjusted logical systems in various domains.
