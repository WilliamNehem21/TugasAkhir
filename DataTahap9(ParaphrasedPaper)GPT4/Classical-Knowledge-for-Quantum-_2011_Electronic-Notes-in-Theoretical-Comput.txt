Quantum communication plays a critical role in the realm of quantum computing by offering methods to counter the enhanced risks posed by an adversary's exponentially increased computing capabilities, thanks to quantum algorithms. Despite some progress in formulating methods to formally verify quantum communication protocols, there has yet to be a practical framework established for their automatic cryptanalysis. Notably, this gap persists even though attacks have been identified against quantum protocols previously deemed secure.

The paper introduces a decision procedure designed to ascertain if a protocol upholds a specific security property by eliciting knowledge attributes of the participating agents based on both dynamic and epistemic traces of the protocol. Dynamic traces are produced using the operational regulations of the distributed measurement calculus (DMC). These traces are then augmented into epistemic traces which consider the agents' perspectives concerning the protocol's actions. This approach builds on the safety assumptions inherent in the DMC model.

The methodology offers several advantages over prior efforts. First, it leverages established DMC semantics rather than infusing external quantum mechanics axioms. Second, it employs algebraic principles to deduce knowledge properties rather than using exhaustive model-checking methods. Third, adversary actions are defined compositionally with pre-set appearance maps within the framework, rather than being arbitrarily inserted.

The authors verify that their decision procedure is both sound and will yield results (terminate), in relation to the DMC framework and algebraic axiomatics. They apply the procedure to a novel quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocol based on graph states, assessing various assumptions about the quantum channels' safety and considering both non-suspicious and suspicious agents. Nevertheless, their approach is limited to analyzing single protocol rounds; a more thorough analysis incorporating multiple runs and probabilistic methods would be a worthwhile extension.

The paper also delves into how agents gauge uncertainties concerning protocol states and actions through 'appearance maps,' which encapsulate all potential actions or assertions that an agent perceives as possible in light of actual occurrences.

In essence, this research presents a comprehensive framework for the formal analysis of security in quantum cryptographic protocols, amalgamating an algebraic rewrite system with a language tailored to quantum distributed computations. This innovative approach has been examined in the context of quantum secret sharing and demonstrated to discern epistemic properties amidst varying adversary scenarios. The complexity of such procedural analyses indicates a push towards software tools to automate protocol analysis, with work on such a tool reported as being in progress.
