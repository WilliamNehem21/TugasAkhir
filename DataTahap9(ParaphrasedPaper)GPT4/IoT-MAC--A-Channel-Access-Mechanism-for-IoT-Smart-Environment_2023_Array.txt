The advancement of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication has enabled automated interactions between devices, eliminating the need for human input. With the ability to link a vast array of devices, M2M networks can span wide areas and are expected to play a crucial role in smart environments such as homes, workplaces, healthcare, smart cities, and industrial settings. Efficient management of these extensive IoT networks necessitates a capable wireless communication technology.

The IEEE 802.11ah standard, known as Wi-Fi HaLow, is anticipated to be the go-to communication technology for M2M networks in the future, offering long-range signals of up to 1 km outdoors, data rates surpassing 100 kbps, and the ability to connect up to 8191 devices to a single access point (AP). To manage a large number of connections, IEEE 802.11ah employs a hierarchical association identifier system to organize devices into segments for communication management.

This academic paper is structured into four sections. Following the introduction, Section 2 delves into related research on IEEE 802.11ah. Section 3 details a model designed to optimize the Restricted Access Window (RAW) mechanism for handling bidirectional traffic, while Section 4 presents an evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance. The paper concludes in Section 5.

RAW is a key MAC layer feature used to boost network performance and scalability. However, the efficacy of RAW depends on specific network conditions. The paper refers to various studies and proposals aimed at enhancing network efficiency, throughput, and power consumption, with some focused on optimizing RAW for uplink traffic and others exploring strategies for managing energy and delay in large networks.

In the proposed system, an AP categorizes connected stations into groups based on an analysis of traffic patterns, arranging them in corresponding RAW slots to manage uplink and downlink traffic effectively. This approach aims to ensure periodic traffic is correctly identified as such, while critical event-driven traffic receives the prioritization it needs, particularly in the context of downlink communications.

The paper introduces a method for optimizing RAW size, considering both event-driven downlink and periodic uplink traffic. This mechanism strives to accurately predict traffic flow and schedule network access with minimal contention, thereby improving network throughput, latency, packet delivery ratios, and energy efficiency compared to existing methods. The proposed scheme is shown to be particularly effective in high-demand, latency-sensitive environments.

In conclusion, the paper suggests future research into optimizing RAW size could benefit from incorporating historical data analysis for more complex decision-making in heterogeneous application environments.
