This academic paper discusses the inherent difficulties in reconstructing images from limited data, known as ill-posed problems, where small changes in inputs can dramatically affect outputs. Various regularization techniques, including Tikhonov regularization, are used to stabilize the process by turning it into a minimization problem, although they can introduce issues like edge blurring and artifacts. The regularization parameter, a key factor in the amount of smoothing applied, must be carefully chosen, with techniques ranging from manual to automated, such as the discrepancy principle and generalized cross-validation.

The paper also addresses the challenge in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of enhancing resolution, particularly across slices, without reducing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) has shown promise in this area, and there is debate over its advantages compared to direct high-resolution 3D acquisition, considering SNR and acquisition time.

An efficient super-resolution method for merging multiple MRI scans of different slice orientations is presented, using an adaptive regularization parameter that preserves edges and sharpens the image. Edge sharpness—crucial in medical imaging—is quantified using Greenspan's suggested mathematical formula, applying a sigmoid function fit. The experiments demonstrate that this technique can significantly improve the resolution of isotropic 3D MRI volumes, coupled with an ability to maintain local edge clarity while suppressing noise.
