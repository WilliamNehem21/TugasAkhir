In this academic paper, the authors introduce an advanced cell image segmentation technique that uses a parallel genetic algorithm to handle high noise levels. The new method addresses the slow convergence issue found in traditional genetic algorithms that the authors previously encountered. They achieve this by incorporating prior knowledge about typical cell shapes, specifically using an elliptical cell contour model to denote cell boundaries.

The process begins with a Canny edge detector creating a gradient image, followed by kernel-based dynamic clustering to identify image points with a high likelihood of belonging to individual cells. Subsequently, the parallel genetic algorithm optimizes the parameters of the cell contour model to achieve the best match.

The authors employ unique strategies within their parallel genetic algorithm, deviating from traditional models like the island and stepping stone models. They introduce a novel migration approach that involves random decisions about which and how many subpopulations will share their top individuals. This technique aims to balance communication overhead and natural behavior imitation.

Steps in the algorithm include:

1. Initialization of chromosomes by generating random values representing image point indices.
2. Selection and crossover based on a fitness proportional model, creating a new set of chromosomes.
3. Mutation of new chromosomes according to predefined probabilities, replacing selected genes with random values.
4. Termination of the algorithm based on entropy stabilization or reaching a maximum number of generations.

The approach's merits include its resistance to noise due to utilizing both edge and cell shape information and its efficiency in reducing the search space and thus optimization time. With multiple processors sharing computational tasks, the segmented results show promise for further advancements, particularly in automatic initialization crucial for creating fully automated algorithms in biomedical applications.

The results from segmenting noisy images of human thyroid and small intestine cells underline the success of this approach, especially for elliptical cell shapes, and suggest a potential path toward improving automated image analysis in biomedicine.
