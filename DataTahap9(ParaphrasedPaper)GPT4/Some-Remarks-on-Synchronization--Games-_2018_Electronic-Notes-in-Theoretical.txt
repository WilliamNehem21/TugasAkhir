In our research, we delve into the field of synchronization games involving planar automata. Our studies have led to the conclusion that determining whether a synchronizer can be victorious within planar synchronization games is co-NP-hard. Additionally, we have deduced findings that suggest planar synchronization games are as complex as their nonplanar counterparts, establishing that planar automata adequately reflect the complexity involved in automata synchronization.

We build upon the concept of synchronization games recently introduced in the literature, expanding the theory and encompassing accessibility games as a subset of our broader synchronizer games framework. Our focus is on planar automata, a specific kind of automata that we have previously identified as a significant representative class for the study of synchronization challenges.

The game entails two participants: the synchronizer and the spoiler, who alternate moves. The synchronizer chooses a character from a set SC during odd rounds, and the spoiler chooses from SP during even rounds. The synchronizer's objective is to create a synchronizing string for the given automaton M, irrespective of the spoiler's efforts to prevent this outcome.

Additionally, we discuss the relevance of reduction to pairs, termed pair-synchronization games. This reduction provides a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for games where the synchronizer can win and grants a cubic upper bound on the length of optimal strategies. Furthermore, if the synchronizer is playing optimally and inadvertently produces a loop, it implies that the spoiler is intentionally causing this loop. Such a scenario would indicate that the synchronizer does not have a winning strategy, which would be a contradiction if the synchronizer is assumed to win.

Lastly, our exploration includes subset synchronization games, narrowing our focus to planar automata while also broadening our inquiry to include non-synchronizing automata.
