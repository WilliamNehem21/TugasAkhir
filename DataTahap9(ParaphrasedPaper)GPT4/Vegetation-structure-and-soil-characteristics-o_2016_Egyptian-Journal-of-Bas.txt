Geophytes, which are plants possessing subterranean storage structures like bulbs, corms, tubers, and rhizomes, are regarded as valuable resources for different economic applications. These plants are characterized by their annual leaf death cycle and are not found among evergreen species. Particularly abundant in Mediterranean climates and other regions with distinct wet and dry seasons, geophytes exhibit a high level of biodiversity in such ecosystems.

In periods of higher rainfall, many species are annuals that thrive, while in the extended dryer periods, the typical vegetation includes woody shrubs and perennial herbs. These form the scattered scrubland, sometimes clustering into more distinct, dense formations. The plant life in the eastern desert of Egypt is richer than that in the western desert, holding a significant botanical connection with the flora of the Sinai Peninsula.

Geophytes display unique generative structures and include the Cyperus genus, which consists of about 600 species found worldwide in both tropical and temperate climates. Two species, Cyperus capitatus and Cyperus conglomeratus, are found along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt and can endure extreme environmental conditions.

C. capitatus is a perennial that stabilizes sandy coastal environments in arid and semi-arid zones, while C. conglomeratus is a drought-resistant perennial found across arid regions, thriving in both coastal and inland sand dune habitats. The Cairo-Suez desert road, spanning across the northeastern desert of Egypt, showcases a natural dry habitat predominantly vegetated by xerophytic plants, with gravel as a defining characteristic.

A floristic survey revealed a total of 119 species across 97 genera and 28 families, with the most abundant families being Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Fabaceae. Various other families contribute to the overall species count, with some families represented by a single species.

The study mentioned associates common perennial plants with specific geophytes in coastal and inland desert habitats. Each of these plants obtained a high importance value in the ecosystem.

Vegetation and soil analysis highlighted that carbonate-related soil components and fine soil particles like clay and silt are closely tied to certain perennial species in the region. Geophytes are often found on sandy grounds along the Mediterranean coast, confirming observations by Maswada and Elzaawely, as well as Zahran and Willis.

Egypt's expanding population has led to large-scale desert land reclamation, most notably in the Egyptian valleys and delta regions. The shift in land use results in substantial environmental changes, positioning reclaimed areas as transition zones in the ecological succession between cultivated lands and desert.

The diverse Egyptian flora acts as a crossroad for elements from four phytogeographical regions, reflecting a mix of harsh desert and more temperate Mediterranean environmental conditions. Phytogeographical analyses have shown the prevalence of Saharo-Arabian and Mediterranean plants in the area, a likely result of regional environmental tolerances and human influence.

Through classification and ordination analyses, the vegetation of the region has been divided into six major groups linked to the geophytes under study. Varying associations characterize vegetation in different parts of the desert.

The study suggests that while C. capitatus and E. farctus are dominant or indicator species for their respective Mediterranean environments, C. conglomeratus, a Saharo-Sindian taxon, is less prominent.

Finally, this work underscores the ecological significance of geophytes in Egypt's deserts, emphasizing their potential uses and the critical need for ecological management and conservation to support sustainable development and use of these natural resources.
