Service-oriented computing has emerged as a prominent approach for creating complex, distributed software systems. An essential feature of such systems is service orchestration, which involves combining existing services into new, more intricate functionalities. This paper addresses the crucial aspect of ensuring that service orchestrations and individual service protocols adhere to predetermined application-level protocols. The authors propose using modal input/output automata (MIOS) as a semantic framework for this compliance verification.

Through a practical example, the paper introduces novel concepts of refinement and compatibility, demonstrating that these concepts form a robust interface theory suitable for service orchestration analysis. This theory provides a means for scrutinizing service orchestrations at the application level, adding to the existing body of work on compatibility analysis. The proposed theory is supported by the MIWorkbench, a tool for verifying modal input/output automata.

The significance of composing individual services in service-oriented architectures (SOAs) is emphasized, highlighting the shift towards open, standardized components in software design. The paper underlines the importance of ensuring that service orchestrations faithfully implement the intended protocols, thus facilitating easy interchangeability of services with minimal effort, a concept known as independent implementability.

The paper is structured as follows: it discusses the fundamental principles of interface theories and modal input/output automata, which are the foundation of the proposed approach. It then points out that the standard definition of weak modal refinement is insufficient for their purposes. To address this, the authors adapt weak modal refinement to focus only on relevant actions, tailoring it specifically for MIOS.

Upon examining service orchestration through existing interface theories for MIOS, the paper identifies and addresses issues not captured by the notion of refinement previously in use. The revised theory distinguishes between relevant and irrelevant actions, enabling a more focused verification process.

The paper concludes that while there is extensive research on the semantics and analysis of web service orchestrations, particularly in relation to industry standards like BPEL, none have fully addressed early application-level verification. Existing methods tend to analyze specific facets of service orchestrations without focusing on application-level verification, a gap that the proposed interface theory aims to fill.
