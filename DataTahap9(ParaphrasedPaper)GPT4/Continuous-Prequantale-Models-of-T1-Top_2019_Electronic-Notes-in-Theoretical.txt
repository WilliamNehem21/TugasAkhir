Dana Scott established domain theory as a cornerstone for the formal underpinnings of denotational semantics in programming languages, which in turn spurred advancements in the field of topology. With the aid of topological methods, domain theory has seen rapid growth, revealing a profound connection between the topological properties of spaces and the ordering principles governing partially ordered sets (posets). A key area of interest within the academic community is the way in which classical topological spaces can be represented within domain theory through the embedding of these spaces into the collection of maximal points of relevant posets. This enables researchers to apply domain theory methodologies to address various topological questions.

Concerning the representation of topological spaces as posets, a topological space X is modeled by a poset P when the set of maximal points of P, denoted by Max(P), is homeomorphic to X, meaning they have a one-to-one correspondence that is continuous in both directions. There has been significant progress in establishing the necessary and sufficient conditions for a topological space to be characterized by a poset. Readers who are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of poset models and their conditions are encouraged to consult the referenced works ([8,9,10,11]).
