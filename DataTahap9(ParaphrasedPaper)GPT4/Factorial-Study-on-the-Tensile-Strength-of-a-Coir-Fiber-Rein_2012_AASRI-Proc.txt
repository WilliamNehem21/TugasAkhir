The study investigates the impact of various factors on the tensile strength of a composite material made from coir fibers. Key variables examined include the amount of fiber used in the composite (fiber volume fraction), the duration of the curing process, and the compression force applied during manufacturing. The experimental design employs a complete factorial approach, comprising 18 different tensile tests. The data's analysis of variance reveals that the tensile strength is predominantly influenced by the fiber volume fraction and the combined effect of fiber volume fraction and curing time. Compression force during production seems to have a minimal impact on tensile strength.

Given Malaysia's abundance of coconuts, coir fibers from the husks suggest a sustainable resource for fabricating composite materialsâ€”already harnessed in applications ranging from construction to household items, with potential for aerospace use. These composites' mechanical properties are shaped by factors like the fiber and matrix stress-strain behavior, fiber volume, distribution, and orientation, as well as fabrication parameters. Understanding the impact of these factors is crucial during the early production stages.

This particular study focuses on a coir fiber and epoxy resin composite produced via compression molding. The coir fibers are sourced as pre-made sheets with random orientation and used without treatment, although they are typically prepared previously for mattress manufacturing, including a partial retting process that might alter their properties.

The findings confirm that the volume of coir fibers significantly determines the composite's tensile strength. Curing time and its interaction with fiber volume fraction also play important roles, whereas compression load during production is less critical. Future research might be necessary to assess the exact extent of compression load's influence.
