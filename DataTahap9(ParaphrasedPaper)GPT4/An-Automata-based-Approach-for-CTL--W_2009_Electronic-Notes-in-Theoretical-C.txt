In the field of model-checking, temporal logics are widely used to define properties for abstract representations of computational systems. The basic elements of these logics are propositional variables that signify truths which vary depending on the system's state. While effective at describing state-based properties, this approach falls short when it comes to capturing data-oriented aspects utilized in various modeling elements such as clocks, counters, and strings. To address these limitations, there has been research into enhancing the linear-time logic LTL with data constraints, as highlighted in scholarly references.

For instance, an important methodology for creating such symbolic value abstractions is the region abstraction used in timed automata. Research into extending LTL to handle explicit data types has often made use of symbolic value abstractions, with these abstracted values characterized by constraint sets. However, there is a gap in knowledge when it comes to the branching-time counterparts of these extended logics.
