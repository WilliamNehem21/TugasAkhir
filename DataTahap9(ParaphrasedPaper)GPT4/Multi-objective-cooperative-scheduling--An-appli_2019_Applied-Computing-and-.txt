The paper mentions various strategies to address the issue of power scheduling, dividing current methods into two primary classifications: semi-automatic and automatic. Semi-automatic schedulers require input from consumers regarding their preferences for things like temperature and appliance scheduling, while automatic schedulers operate without any human intervention. The focus of this research is on six different power scheduling methods that vary by the type of scheduler used, the optimization problem addressed, the appliances managed, and the objectives pursued.

One part of the paper discusses an optimization model for household power scheduling to improve grid peak load and reduce electricity costs. This was achieved by incorporating an incentive for users to decrease consumption during peak times and compensating for any inconvenience by aligning optimal and baseline appliance schedules. The objective function took into account the trade-off between incentives and inconvenience.

The paper also identifies a limitation in existing power scheduling approaches, which tend to overlook the integration of operational, ecological, and economical goals into demand side management (DSM) strategies. Most current methods prioritize cost reduction, and few address the need to curtail greenhouse gas emissions alongside operational and economic goals.

Moreover, the authors propose an approach based on a previous study that provided a dedicated clustering algorithm for smart grid (SG) management, adopting a digital ecosystem cooperative model. This approach consists of two modules: "the alliances builder," aiming to cluster SG components that have mutual needs and preferences, and "the seller2buyer matcher," which promotes collaboration within and between clusters.

The paper explains the importance of striking a balance between the preferences of sellers and buyers within power associations in a cooperative SG setting, mentioning the significance of penalty factors indicating the components' delay time constraints.

Experimental scenarios comparing non-cooperative and cooperative scheduling strategies based on the research's multi-objective scheduling concept were set up, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in making preference-based compromises and minimizing costs across ecological, economical, and operational dimensions.

Lastly, the paper presents MOCSF (Multi-Objective Cooperative Scheduling Framework), which includes the mentioned modules and takes into account different types of scheduling for power generation, storage, and consumption. It also outlines ongoing and future work on implementing privacy-by-design grid control and applying strategy-proof techniques to mitigate cheating in scheduling declarations.

The paper concludes by referencing related work by Vytelingum et al. on agent-based micro-storage management for the smart grid, illustrating the interdisciplinary nature of the research.
