Weyl's proof in intuitionistic mathematics demonstrated a division method that effectively identifies all polynomial roots within a desired level of precision after a finite iteration. The method begins by enclosing the circle with radius r, which encompasses all roots, in a square with side length 2r. This initial square is flagged as "suspect," meaning it potentially contains roots. With each successive level of precision, these suspect squares are divided into four smaller squares, a process that was later referred to by other researchers as "quadtree construction." The process involves numerically evaluating the integral of f'/f to determine which connected groups of squares contain roots and marking them as suspect.

This elegant analytic proof relies strongly on the concept of continuity, which H. Kneser subsequently transformed into a practical algorithm in 1940. Kneser's contribution was to adapt the method into the intuitionist framework, using an auxiliary result that allowed for a reduction in the size of the numbers considered, along with providing bounds for perturbed polynomials. By utilizing Mahler's established lower bound for the minimum distance between roots, we can deduce an exponential bound on the quantity of steps necessary for Newton's method to achieve the desired accuracy.

To practically determine the parameter v, one would use the lower bound estimates for the separation between the roots after normalizing each polynomial to have integer coefficients. An estimate of the arithmetic complexity for tracking this process would incorporate a term proportional to O(sn). This approach can be contrastively evaluated against the less constructive minimum number of steps proposed by Shub and Smale.
