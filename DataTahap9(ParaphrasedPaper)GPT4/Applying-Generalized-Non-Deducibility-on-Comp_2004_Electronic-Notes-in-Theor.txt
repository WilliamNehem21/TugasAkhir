This academic paper discusses a shift in understanding the relationship between security and dependability in system design. Historically, security was considered a more narrow concept compared to dependability, and much of the literature focused on deriving security insights from the field of dependability. However, in the past decade, security has been explored in great detail, and it's now believed that security theory can significantly contribute to the field of dependability.

More specifically, the paper investigates the potential of applying the Generalized Non-Deducibility on Compositions (GNDC) framework—an approach previously used for expressing and verifying security properties—to analyze dependable systems, especially those focused on fault tolerance. Until now, GNDC has not been applied to the area of dependability, though its concepts are based on non-interference, a common theme in security analysis.

The paper proposes using GNDC to express safety characteristics inherent in dependability, such as fail-stop, fail-safe, and fail-silent behavior. By doing so, the authors aim to create a formal classification of dependability properties, comparable to what has been achieved in security. Moreover, they demonstrate how GNDC's theoretical concepts, like compositional reasoning, can be adapted from security to dependability analyses.

The authors describe how process algebras can offer a consistent framework for specifying fault-tolerant systems and their properties. They outline a method for modeling fault-tolerant systems using extensions of the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS)—incorporating error-recovery strategies and fault assumptions—and how these models can be checked using model checking techniques.

The paper also presents a distinct approach in which faulty behavior is captured within the system model itself, rather than in an external fault injector. This approach allows fault tolerance analysis to be framed as a non-interference problem, which can be further analyzed using the GNDC framework.

Through an example of a flashing torch and its fault-tolerant energy source, the paper illustrates the practical application of GNDC in representing fault tolerance as a property. The advantages of this method include the ability to use theoretical results and analytical techniques from security research, offering more efficient analysis procedures, removing the need for universal quantification over all fault scenarios, and ensuring compositionality.

Finally, the uniform characterization of fault tolerance, provided by GNDC, enables a comparison of dependability properties and facilitates a potential pathway toward a formal, unified classification of both dependability and security properties.
