The paper presents a development in the field of lens theory, where the concept of "update lenses" is proposed as an enhancement over traditional lenses, which typically map a 'view' from a 'source'. Update lenses separate the notion of 'views' from 'updates', creating a richer structure: views remain as a set, whereas updates are modeled by a monoid with an associated action on the views. This separation allows for more flexible approaches to modifying the source beyond the standard merging of a view.

The paper explores the formal structure and properties of update lenses using algebraic concepts such as bialgebras, algebras, and coalgebras. This is achieved through applying principles from categorical algebra such as distributive laws between comonads and functors, compositions of comonads, liftings to coalgebra categories, and relationships between monads and comonads.

Moreover, the paper discusses practical implications like different strategies for view updates illustrated by the example of editing book prices, which demonstrates the limitations of traditional lenses that update lenses aim to overcome. Although the paper omits the complex product monoidal structure in the category of acts due to space constraints, it points to a section on dependently typed versions for detailed treatment.

The authors emphasize that update lenses are both practically useful and theoretically pleasing, highlighting their unique decompositions that traditional lenses lack, and revealing their structural characterizations as pairs of matching coalgebras and bialgebras, among others.

Finally, the authors express their intention to continue their research by focusing on symmetric versions of update lenses, aiming to build on existing works on symmetric lenses and incorporating contemporary categorical theories. They also plan to investigate the exact connections between update lenses and delta as well as c-lenses.
