The paper describes an affordable wireless electronic scale designed for ordinary users, which is powered by the MSP430 microcontroller. The scale interacts with personal computers through wireless communication, enabling the downloading and uploading of product information and sales data. It uses the MSP430F135 as its central processor, which manages the data from a strain sensor through signal conditioning and an integrated ADC for digital conversion.

The MSP430F135 manages data processing and storage in an AT45DB081 flash memory and displays the weight measurements through an LED, with the 74HC373 chip as the driver. Wireless communication is handled by the PTR2000 module, while a MAX232 chip is used for serial communication with a PC. The interface and programming utilize Visual Basic.

Voltage conditioning ensures compatibility with the 12-bit Sigma-Delta ADC in the MSP430F135, which can use an internal or external reference voltage; in this case, an external resistor divider provides the reference. To maintain measurement consistency as the power supply voltage (Vcc) fluctuates, a ratio metric measurement principle is used.

Real-time weight and date information is sourced from the PCF8563 real-time clock/calendar chip, which boasts low power consumption and several additional features. Communication with this chip is achieved through the I2C bus.

Through testing and calibrations, a range of 0-5 kg weights is converted to a 0-3.3V voltage. The voltage is processed by the ADC, resulting in a data range of 0-4096. A moving average filter improves measurement precision.

This electronic scale measures the weight of products and shares transaction details with a PC, featuring a maximum capacity of 5 kg and a resolution of 1g. The integration of the INA326 and OPA2234 amplifiers successfully amplifies the weak signal from the strain sensor. The combination of the MSP430 microcontroller with the PTR2000 enables effective communication with a PC, along with MAX232 for level conversion.

The user interface allows price adjustments and analysis of consumer behavior. The system could be further improved by incorporating multiple subordinate scales for expanded functionality.
