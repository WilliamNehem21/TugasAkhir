Minor order and immersion order are distinct and not directly comparable. For instance, planar graphs exclude K5 as a minor but include all complete graphs (cliques) by immersion. Conversely, graphs with a maximum degree of 3 exclude K4 as an immersion but can include all complete graphs as minors.

Despite these differences, minor and immersion orders share several traits. Both are well-quasi-orders, as established by Robertson and Seymour. Moreover, if a graph G has graph H as a topological minor, then G also contains H as both a minor and an immersion. This connection may have inspired Lescure, Meyniel, Abu-Khzam, and Langston to propose a specific conjecture.

This document goes into detail proving Theorem 1.5 and mentions Theorem 1.6, which builds on similar principles but is more intricate. For the proof of Theorem 1.6 and the proof of Theorem 1.7, the reader is directed to other sources.
