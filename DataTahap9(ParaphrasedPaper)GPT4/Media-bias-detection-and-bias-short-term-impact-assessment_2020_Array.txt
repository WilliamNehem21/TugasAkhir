The recent increase in fake news is a clear byproduct of modern communication trends, as observed in events like the 2016 US Presidential Election. Fake news is currently recognized as a serious threat to democracy and free discussion. The importance of returning to objective, clear journalism is underscored.

Media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion and, consequently, daily life. However, concerns have been raised about the media's integrity. This highlights the importance of identifying bias in news reporting and establishing a balanced and trustworthy news source.

This study uses Twitter to analyze bias. Tweets from Indian media outlets and journalists serve as a reflection of the type of news being reported. The study examines the transmission and impact of biased opinions through social media.

The research consists of three stages, starting with the assessment of subjectivity versus objectivity in news reporting. A substantial portion of news is found to be subjective, introducing biased opinions into public discourse.

Sentiment analysis is crucial across all stages. This process classifies and quantifies the polarity of tweets, which is essential for determining bias.

The model outperforms other lexicons in the context of social media, capturing nuanced sentiment intensity and related lexical features.

The influence of media on political opinions and behavior is also studied through various experiments, including providing free newspaper subscriptions and monitoring voting behavior.

The proposed methodology assesses the extent of consumer conditioning by comparing changes in their sentiment values against a threshold.

Objective news slant is measured using a method that compares media citations of think tanks with congressional citations, producing a scale of 0 (conservative) to 100 (liberal).

The extent of media and blog bias is evaluated, taking into account the coverage of political actors and sentiments expressed.

A framework for detecting and quantifying media bias is suggested. The approach analyzes tweet datasets for subjectivity, considering factors like the number of followers and levels of engagement on Twitter.

The study identifies the biases of Indian media outlets through sentiment analysis of tweets about major political parties and leaders. It highlights the importance of recognizing influential journalists who may shape public opinion due to their large followings and subjective postings.

The paper proposes a bias short-term impact assessment tool and outlines formulae for measuring bias impact, accounting for the number of followers, engagement, and activity time on Twitter.

The study benchmarks against a neutral media outlet, DD-News, to establish a reference for bias thresholds. Observations indicate that biases are often stronger on live TV than on social media, suggesting the model's potential extension to screen-based media.

Finally, the research addresses the problem of subjective news and its immediate effects, contributing to broader efforts by companies like Google and Facebook to tackle the issue of fake news.
