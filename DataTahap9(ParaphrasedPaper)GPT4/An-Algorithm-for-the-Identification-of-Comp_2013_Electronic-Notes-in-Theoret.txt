This paper discusses the complexity of biochemical pathways, which are networks of interactions among various biological entities within cells. These interactions include molecular bindings, synthesis and degradation of proteins, and movement of molecules between different cell compartments. Biochemical entities, like proteins, can exist in different forms and as part of larger complexes, complicating their identification within a pathway.

The authors present a verification approach using a notion of "molecular components" to represent biological entities in pathways. For complex molecules, they propose representing them by multiple species, corresponding to the individual entities involved.

An algorithm was developed to convert pathways into a normalized form that facilitates the identification of molecular components. This simplification makes it easier to analyze and visualize pathways and allows for the automatic generation of formal descriptions using automata or process algebra. Such descriptions enable model checking and bisimulation techniques to assess pathway behavior.

The paper notes the potential for occasional ambiguities requiring expert intervention. However, preliminary tests suggest this need is often minimal.

As an example, the EGF signaling pathway is analyzed using this algorithm, demonstrating successful identification of molecular components and automating the generation of finite state automata for each component.

The modeling notation omits inhibitors for simplicity, though they can be handled similarly to catalysts. Some reactions may involve multiple instances of the same component, in which case the algorithm arbitrarily chooses a mapping for them, sometimes necessitating user input.

Applying the algorithm to Schoeberl et al.'s model of the EGF-MAP kinase cascade, the authors show how the same reactions are involved both at the surface and internally after endocytosis, albeit in two nearly identical branches.

Once molecular components are recognized, a component interaction graph is automatically created to clearly represent the pathway's components and structure.

The paper concludes with an outlook on adapting the approach to account for quantitative aspects, such as reaction kinetics and molecule distribution. The current normalization method, without modification, would not maintain reaction rates since it might alter reactants' descriptions. Addressing quantitative elements could enable the translation of pathways into stochastic and spatial formalisms, broadening the scope of their study.
