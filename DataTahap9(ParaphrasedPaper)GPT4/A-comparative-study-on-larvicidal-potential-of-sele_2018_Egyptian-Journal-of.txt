This academic paper explores the use of medicinal plants for developing eco-friendly repellents and larvicides as alternative pest management solutions. These plants have therapeutic values and have been used in traditional medicine since ancient times. The study includes methods utilizing nanotechnology, specifically focusing on the properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for targeted pest control, noting their size, shape, and composition are critical to their effectiveness.

Research shows that the use of different reducing agents during synthesis can influence the size and dispersity of AgNPs, with borohydride creating smaller particles and citrate yielding a slower reduction. Green synthesis of nanoparticles is emphasized as an eco-friendly and less toxic approach, relying on non-toxic substances, solvents, and reducing agents to ensure the stability of silver nanoparticles.

The study involved collecting and preparing plant samples from four species: Phyllanthus amarus, Annona squamosa, Coccinia grandis, and Eclipta prostrata. The efficacy of plant extracts was tested against mosquito larvae following WHO guidelines, and the results indicated larvicidal activity at various concentrations.

IR spectroscopy confirmed that amino acids and peptides likely form a coat around the AgNPs, preventing agglomeration and stabilizing them in the medium. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns revealed the crystalline nature of the AgNPs and indicated the influence of phytochemical compounds from the extracts.

The paper reports that the extracts exhibited varying degrees of larvicidal effectiveness against Aedes aegypti and Culex larvae, with Eclipta prostrata and Annona squamosa showing particularly high activity. The effectiveness of these extracts and their dependence on concentration parallel previous findings, and the presence of phytochemicals in the plants is believed to contribute to their insecticidal properties.

In conclusion, the research supports the development of plant-based larvicides, particularly those involving green synthesis of silver nanoparticles, for controlling pest populations and supplementing traditional medicine as an environmentally friendly approach. The findings show promise in combating vector resistance to conventional insecticides and offer a viable alternative to synthetic chemicals.
