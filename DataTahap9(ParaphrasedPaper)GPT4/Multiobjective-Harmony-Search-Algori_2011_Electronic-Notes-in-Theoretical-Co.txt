The Harmony Search (HS) metaheuristic, initially developed for single-objective optimization problems, has shown promise in a range of science and engineering fields. However, its performance in addressing multiobjective optimization problems, where Pareto optimality concepts are crucial, has not been demonstrated. This study introduces two adaptations of the HS metaheuristic tailored for multiobjective optimization, using ZDT benchmark functions for evaluation. Comparative performance metrics reveal that these new approaches hold their own against the established NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm.

The HS algorithm draws inspiration from musical improvisation and was intended for solving single-objective optimization problems. It has yet to be naturally extended to tackle multiobjective optimization, particularly complex NP-hard problems, which is contemplated as a key direction for future research.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 defines multiobjective optimization and associated concepts. Section 3 delves into the HS metaheuristic, drawing parallels to musical improvisation before outlining the algorithm's components. Section 4 reviews existing research on HS in multiobjective optimization. Section 5 details the proposed enhancements to adapt the original HS algorithm for multiobjective purposes. Section 6 discusses the experimental setup and results. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and suggests avenues for future investigation.

The HS algorithm's workings and structure will be explored in Section 3, beginning with an analogy to musical improvisation for optimization in 3.1, followed by an in-depth explanation of the algorithm's mechanics in 3.2.

Several technical aspects of the HS algorithm are highlighted, such as the requirements for pitch adjustment, similar to mutation in genetic algorithms, and the careful calibration of parameters to balance exploration and exploitation in the search space.

Gao et al. put forward a modified HS algorithm that incorporates Pareto optimality for constrained single-objective optimization, allowing for the ranking of non-feasible solutions.

The paper discusses the process of integrating new solutions into the harmony memory (HM), emphasizing the computational cost of O(HMS) for recalculating rankings within the HM.

Each iteration of the algorithm features an improvisation phase for generating new solutions to populate the updated harmony memory, borrowing decision variable values from the original HM. Evaluation of these new solutions includes calculating their Fonseca-Fleming ranking.
