This paper outlines its structure by beginning with a review of related work in Section 2. Section 3 describes various perturbation techniques, while Section 4 discusses metrics for evaluating privacy and utility. In Section 5, the new approaches NOS2R and NOS2R2 are detailed. Section 6 presents experimental results and compares the performance of these approaches. The paper concludes with a summary of its research findings.

The paper acknowledges a limitation in privacy-preserving methods for distributed systems with resource constraints, noting their inapplicability to vertically partitioned data. It reviews several data perturbation strategies such as NROREM, which goes through normalization, rotation, regression, and multiplication stages. While NROREM is effective in preserving privacy and utility, scalar multiplication can adjust the dataset size, impacting utility.

A privacy protection method using a distance matrix is mentioned, which can handle noisy data effectively; however, it can still leak original data statistics, requiring stronger privacy measures. Another discussed strategy is a Bayesian-based method for classification that remains algorithm-independent, balancing privacy and utility well.

Semi-supervised clustering approaches are explored that use metric learning and multiplicative perturbation, potentially altering the data distribution and protecting privacy. However, sharing the learned metric might lead to privacy compromises. Reversible and non-reversible perturbation methods are discussed, such as KRPP, which uses noise insertion, and PABIDOT, which employs geometric alterations. Both have their trade-offs in privacy and utility.

Other methods include SEAL, which uses local differential privacy and is both scalable and efficient, and a fuzzy data transformation technique, which can sometimes neglect data utility while maintaining privacy. Value swapping is mentioned as a means to protect individual record secrecy without introducing false information.

The paper identifies a need for a better balance between privacy and utility and introduces NOS2R and NOS2R2, which combine normalization with various transformations to enhance privacy while preserving utility.

The privacy-preserving performance of NOS2R and NOS2R2 is evaluated with specific metrics. Results show that both approaches offer better privacy protection than existing methods, with NOS2R2 providing the highest level of secrecy and resistance to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) attacks.

In conclusion, the proposed methods not only improve privacy over existing strategies but also maintain a higher level of data utility, suggesting potential applicability to multi-party clustering scenarios with added feature reduction techniques.
