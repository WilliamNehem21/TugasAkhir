Paraphrased Version:

The paper first acknowledges that when contexts are represented as functional terms, it becomes challenging to apply inductive reasoning and recursion. Furthermore, one of the main benefits of higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) turns into a disadvantage, as it restricts the ability to prove properties about the methods offloaded to the metalanguage.

In Section 5 of the paper, the authors present a significant finding: the ability to derive higher-order induction from a combination of first-order induction and the axioms established in their theory of contexts. This discovery should enhance comprehension of how these axioms interact and their conceptual range.

While the validity of the theory of contexts has been demonstrated, completeness in terms of expressive power when compared to known logical systems has not yet been established. This portion of the paper focuses on an essential step in this regard: showing that higher-object systems can be derived within the scope of the theory.

The paper then addresses a concern that previous work in the field might seem to use a variety of ad hoc versions of the axioms without a unified methodology. Contrary to this impression, the paper aims to rectify this misconception by offering a systematic guide to implementing the axiom schemata and working with a weaker form of HOAS-based encoding.
