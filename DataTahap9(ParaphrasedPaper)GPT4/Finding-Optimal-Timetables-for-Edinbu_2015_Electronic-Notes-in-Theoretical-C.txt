This case study focuses on improving the public transportation system in Edinburgh, particularly its bus network, which is equipped with GPS tracking technology. Buses in the city send their geographic positions to a central server every thirty seconds. This data is used in a predictive model to estimate bus arrival times at stops. The predictions are then conveyed to passengers through various means, including on-street signs, a website, and smartphone applications.

Once the predictive model is developed, the study proceeds to validate its accuracy using real data from MyBusTracker. To assess the difference between the empirical data and model results, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test) is employed. This statistical test measures the distance between distribution functions: either that of observed data and a theoretical distribution (one-sample KS test), or two separate data sets (two-sample KS test). The test returns several key values, including 'h' (the result of the hypothesis test where '0' supports the null hypothesis and '1' rejects it), 'p' (the p-value which indicates the probability of the observed test statistic under the null hypothesis, with smaller values suggesting the null hypothesis may not be valid), 'KSstat' (the test statistic itself), and 'cv' (critical values) at a significance level of 0.05. These results are computed with MATLAB.

Traviando, a trace analyzer for post-mortem simulation, can process simulation outputs in the form of state/event traces generated by the Bio-PEPA model, allowing for analysis up to a finite time horizon.

The overarching aim of a Bus Punctuality Improvement Partnership is to enhance the timeliness of bus services. One formal approach to achieving this is by defining a stricter tolerance window for bus departure times; a smaller window indicates a more reliable service with fewer early or late bus departures.

Finally, the study explores punctuality using the Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) by evaluating a 'bounded until' formula across different intervals for departure times. The CSL formula calculates the probability of reaching the desired journey stage within a specific time range. This kind of model-checking problem is useful to understand and improve bus punctuality within the set interval.
