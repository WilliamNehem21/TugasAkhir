The academic paper you referenced discusses the extension of interpolation properties to various normal and multi-modal logics, building on earlier work that used semantic or algebraic methods to demonstrate interpolation. These methods, while broadly applicable, didnâ€™t give a specific way to construct interpolants. Marx contributed to this domain by showing how to prove interpolation for some modal logics using bisimulation techniques, covering logics such as K, fibered modal logics, and logics pertaining to knowledge and belief.

Additionally, the paper highlights the significance of computing interpolants, which plays a role in transforming implicit definitions into explicit ones, and points out its relevance to the Beth definability theorem in the context of KM logic. The practical application of these methods in query rewriting algorithms is noted, along with the importance of these algorithms to various fields within computer science. The discussion concludes by stating future work aspirations, particularly concerning the complexity of interpolant size.
