In many quantum computing designs, controlling individual qubits is not physically possible, and instead, the system could allow for universal computation through large-scale operations. We propose a technique for globally controlled quantum computing that supports fault-tolerant quantum error correction. This method typically employs three types of distinguishable two-level systems, configured in a one-dimensional periodic array, and demonstrates a fault-tolerant error threshold.

The method involves uniform phase operations between adjacent qubits. We assume the existence of temporal errors, specifically independent Pauli errors, and create a system of nested qubit encodings, which results in a high-level meta-Ising model with operations that have significantly lower error rates. Quantum computations can then be conducted on this high-level structure, which we argue maintains fault tolerance, though we do not provide exact thresholds for the fault tolerance in this discussion.

Initially, we considered a setup where the ends of the chain could be individually controlled, but using ends as "entropy sinks" is problematic because the error rate in the chain varies with its length. In contrast, the capacity to remove entropy remains constant when confined to the ends. We will now view 'A', 'B', and 'C' as separate physical species.

We frame all errors as random Pauli operators, a legitimate simplification since any system operation can be expressed as a sum of Pauli operators and an identity, and error detection tends to project the state onto either an uncorrupted state or one with a Pauli error. We focus on single qubit errors for simplicity but note that more complex errors can be handled similarly.

We describe a method for performing one level of error correction and how this process can be extended to higher levels, observing that while many operations stay consistent across levels, there are some notable exceptions.

In our system, we facilitate coupling and decoupling of the different species through Hamiltonian manipulation that averages out undesired interactions, allowing separate control of the inter-species couplings.

Stabiliser codes, a class of quantum error-correcting codes, share the property that logical Pauli operations can be executed through combinations of local Pauli gates on individual qubits. Some Clifford group operations can also be transversally applied, such as using the Steane code to implement a Hadamard gate on the logical qubit via transversal Hadamard gates on underlying qubits.

We've shown that by performing local operations and using Ising interactions, it's possible to execute complex operations like the controlled-Z (CZ) gate across the array. Reusing qubits within the chain requires careful reset procedures that do not compromise higher-level encoded information.

Finally, we demonstrate that error correction can be carried out within the chain, and logical gates can be applied to encoded qubits without exacerbating encoding errors. For fault-tolerant computing to be feasible, we must confirm that there is an error rate so low that further coding can suppress any mistakes indefinitely. Our findings indicate the existence of such a threshold, beneath which error suppression through coding is effective, preventing an explosion in the error rate due to code concatenation.
