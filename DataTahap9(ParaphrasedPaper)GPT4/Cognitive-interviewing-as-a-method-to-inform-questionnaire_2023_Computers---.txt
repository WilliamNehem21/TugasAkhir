This academic paper discusses the evaluation of immersive technologies used in healthcare education. Immersive technology is growing in educational research, particularly within healthcare disciplines, but there is a paucity of validated tools to measure their effects. A new instrument, focusing on user experience of immersive technology in healthcare education (ITEM), was developed to gauge immersion, intrinsic motivation, cognitive load, system usability, and debriefing. Nine participants were pre-tested with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) before undergoing cognitive interviews. ITEM demonstrated high content validity index scores, and the qualitative analysis probed the relationships between domains.

The study leverages cognitive interviewing, an evaluation method assessing comprehension, which combined verbal probing and think-aloud techniques in semi-structured interviews. The measure's clarity of understanding among participants was confirmed, supporting its use in further validation research.

Existing theoretical pedagogies for VR and AR in healthcare, such as Kolb's experiential learning and Mayer's cognitive theory, underscore the need for balanced cognitive load during immersive educational experiences.

A Delphi study gathered stakeholder input on the critical factors to be measured by the new instrument, resulting in a consensus on seven factors, with emphasis on participant experience as the primary data collection method.

Attention was given to all aspects of validity during the instrument's development, including content relevance and item difficulty. Mixed methods, including cognitive interviewing and quantitative content validity indexing, informed the tool's pre-test evaluation and refinement.

Methodologically, cognitive interviews varied between verbal probing and think-aloud methods, with the goal of maintaining consistency and gaining comprehensive insight into participant comprehension. To mitigate confirmation bias, two trained authors conducted the interviews using a structured approach for qualitative analysis.

The ITEM could be the first multidomain tool assessing user experience with immersive technologies within healthcare education. Findings revealed high correlation within the ITEM's domains and suggested potential relationships between variables like motivation and confidence.

The study recognized the cognitive load brought about by multi-sensory immersion in technology interfaces, as well as intrinsic motivational factors.

Limitations in measurement selection and potential cognitive interview biases such as reactivity and comprehension challenges were acknowledged.

The study avoided performance score extrapolation and underlined the necessity of broader validation efforts to link simulation-based assessments with real-world performance. Future research is recommended to perform factor analysis with a larger participant group and in diverse settings.

Overall, the study concluded that the development of the ITEM adds valuable evidence that could inform the use of immersive technology in healthcare education, recommending further validation to ensure compatibility between the theoretical constructs and practical application.

The research maintained ethical considerations, with participant anonymity and informed consent, and received approval from the Great Western Hospital's undergraduate research office in the UK.

The paper concludes by referencing studies by Chan et al. (2020) and Gupta et al. (2018) that offer preliminary usability comparisons for immersive technologies used in medical education.
