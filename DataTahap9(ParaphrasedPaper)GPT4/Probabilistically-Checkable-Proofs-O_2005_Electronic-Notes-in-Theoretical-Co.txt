Probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) have become highly significant in the study of computational complexity. They offer a fresh perspective on the nature of NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) problems and uncover a profound relationship between these problems and the difficulty of finding approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization challenges. This paper explores PCPs within the context of the real number computational model proposed by Blum, Shub, and Smale (BSS). The debate centers around whether there can be transparent and lengthy proofs within the real number version of NP, referred to as NPR.

The foundational work by Blum, Shub, and Smale in 1989 aimed to create a cohesive framework for the analysis of computational complexity over real numbers, often called the BSS model. Since its inception, considerable research has been conducted in this domain, with several textbooks offering detailed insights into issues tackled by this model.

It should be noted that this paper does not address the approximation problems typical in numerical analysis. Adopting such approximation concepts could potentially complicate matters within the BSS model, unless analytic functions are incorporated. Hence, a more combinatorial approach to PCPs within the BSS model is deemed more suitable.

Verifiers are the cornerstone of defining PCP-related complexity classes, including those for the real number model referred to as PCPR. This paper presents the definition of the real number complexity classes and suggests that similar definitions for the PCP classes in the Turing machine framework can be arrived at by making the necessary adjustments from BSS terms to those applicable to Turing models.
