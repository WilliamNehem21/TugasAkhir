The academic paper discusses various strategies for evaluating computational terms and how they apply in different contexts, particularly in relation to theorem proving and simulation of Turing machines (TMs). Here is a paraphrased summary of the key points:

- For strong evaluation strategies, the situation is more complex. Theorem 3.2 establishes that linear simulation of a Turing machine is possible with any strong strategy that prioritizes the reduction of weak redexes or weak head redexes before tackling strong redexes. Strong call-by-value, for instance, is often realized by applying weak call-by-value repeatedly beneath abstractions. Another approach is leftmost-outermost evaluation, which selects the leftmost yet outermost redex to reduce first.

- A peculiar case is the maximal strategy, which is characterized as being perpetually divergent, intentionally allowing for infinite computations when possible and, when it does converge, it takes the maximum number of steps to reach a normal form. This makes it the least efficient strategy, and as discussed at the end of section 3, it is not considered a reasonable strategy due to its inability to simulate a Turing machine effectively.

- In open settings, where the terms are open (weak evaluation with open terms), good implementations should refrain from substituting neutral terms to avoid unnecessary computations. However, substituting abstractions is acceptable. One issue identified, the open size exploding family (proposition 4.2), results from the excessive duplication of neutral terms.

- For strong evaluation strategies in strong dialects, implementations need to prevent futile replacements, with a technique often referred to as on-demand abstraction substitution. This optimization is necessary because of the identified restriction for avoiding certain kinds of substitutions under abstractions as mentioned on page 10 of the paper.

- Research is ongoing to demonstrate that strong call-by-value and call-by-need strategies are sensible, with existing tools outlined in references [9,12]. These tools may also apply to strong call-by-need as its operational semantics is becoming publicly available. Although the subterm property is upheld and the framework to prove the reasonableness of these strategies is clear, sorting out the intricate details of effectively implementing strong evaluation and useful sharing for call-by-value and call-by-need remains challenging.

- The iterated subterm property, unfortunately, leads to a problem known as size explosion, where the repeated substitution of subterms can cause an exponential increase in computational steps and the size of the objects created. On the other hand, the plain subterm property prevents this from happening by disallowing such chains of substitutions.
