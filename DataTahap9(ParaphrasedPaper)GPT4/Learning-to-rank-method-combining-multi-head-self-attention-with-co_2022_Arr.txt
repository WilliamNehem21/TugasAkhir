Current methods for learning to rank often overlook the interconnections between ranking features. Utilizing these relationships could improve ranking performance. To address this, the paper presents a ranking approach denoted as GAN-LTR, which merges a multi-head self-attention mechanism with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN). GAN-LTR enhances the Information Retrieval Generative Adversarial Network (IRGAN) framework used in web search by constructing a new model that integrates layers such as convolutional, multi-head self-attention, residual, fully connected, as well as batch normalization and dropout techniques. A convolutional neural network extracts feature relationships, while multi-head self-attention computes feature importance, giving varying weights to features. Experiments on the MQ2008-semi dataset indicate that GAN-LTR outperforms IRGAN across various metrics.

Learning to rank, a crucial technique in search engines and recommendations, benefits from machine learning methods to train models for ranking tasks. IRGAN, an innovative model by Wang et al., bridges generative and discriminative retrieval models using a game-theoretical minimax algorithm within a GAN framework, improving document accuracy.

Inspired by these developments, the paper aims to enhance the learning to rank method by infusing attention mechanisms and GANs into a strategy named GAN-LTR. This combines multi-head self-attention with CGAN and improves upon the IRGAN framework by swapping the activation function Tanh with Softsign to avoid gradient issues and enhance performance.

Additionally, GAN-LTR introduces the SIDE network model for the CGAN generator and discriminator, implementing batch normalization multiple times to mitigate gradient vanishing and using ReLU and Softsign as activation functions for stability and gradient issues. The multi-head self-attention layer in GAN-LTR captures inter-feature dependencies to refine feature representation.

Benchmarking the new GAN-LTR against IRGAN, RankNet, LambdaRank, and LambdaMART shows notable performance gains. The integrated approach of GAN-LTR recognizes feature relationships, enhances the network with local and global feature extraction, avoids deep network issues with residual layers, improves network stability with batch normalization, reduces overfitting with dropout, and uses Softsign over Tanh. GAN-LTR's advantages are validated through superior results on the MQ2008-semi dataset compared to IRGAN.
