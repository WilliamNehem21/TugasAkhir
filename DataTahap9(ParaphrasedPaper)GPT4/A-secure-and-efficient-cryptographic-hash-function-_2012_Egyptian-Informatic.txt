This academic paper is structured in the following manner: Section 2 reviews previous research in the field. Section 3 introduces the novel hash function being proposed. Section 4 dives into the security analysis of the hash function named MNF-256. The efficiency and speed of MNF-256 are examined in Section 5. The final summarizing conclusions of the study are provided in Section 6.

The paper highlights that hash functions with an iterative design are vulnerable to collision attacks, where the complexity of an attack is tied to the size of the hash function's internal state. Historically, many popular hash functions have been successfully attacked; MD4 was broken in 1998, while in 2004, notable vulnerabilities in MD5, RIPEMD, and Haval-128 were disclosed. Further work in 2005 demonstrated exploitable weaknesses in SHA-0 and SHA-1.

In terms of hash function performance, one assessment metric discussed is the bit variance test, which evaluates the change in a hash's output caused by modifying bits in the input message. By analyzing these changes across many different message alterations, the test computes the probability that each bit of the output will be 1 or 0. An ideal hash function would show a 50% probability for each scenario across all bit positions. This particular study, limited to 513 different message files, assessed the hash function's performance using this criterion.

To obscure message redundancies in encryption, Shannon's principles of diffusion and confusion are often employed. Diffusion aims to disperse the influence of a single bit of plaintext across the ciphertext to obfuscate any patterns, while confusion adds complexity to the relationship between ciphertext statistics and plaintext statistics. A high-quality hash should show that minor shifts in the input lead to a substantial transformation in the output bits.

The paper also details diffusion and confusion tests that were performed. A random message was hashed, and then a single bit was altered (toggled) to generate a new hash. By comparing the two hashes, the number of altered bits was counted to assess the level of diffusion and confusion exhibited by the hash function.
