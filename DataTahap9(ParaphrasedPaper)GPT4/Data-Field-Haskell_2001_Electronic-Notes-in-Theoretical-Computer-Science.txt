Data fields present a versatile and broad framework for organizing indexed data collections. Data Field Haskell is a variant of the Haskell programming language that implements the concept of data fields, particularly well-suited for generic programming of collections, especially those that are multi-dimensional. This paper provides an overview of the data field concept and its theoretical foundations, followed by a discussion on the specifics of Data Field Haskell and details about its implementation.
