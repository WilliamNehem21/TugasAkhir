The academic paper discusses a method of conceptualizing models that treats arguments as distinct entities linked by a relationship of conflict, as originated by Dung. Dung introduced several key ideas that have become fundamental within the field of computational argumentation, such as the notion of argument admissibility. This principle is based on the understanding that to accept a proposition c, one needs not only an argument a that supports c but also a means to invalidate all opposing arguments that challenge a. To put it another way, unlike traditional logic that focuses on the inference process within a single argument, argumentation theory also takes into account the dynamics of how arguments interact with each other.

The section provides an overview of the main terms associated with abstract argumentation frameworks, with a special interest in how various abstract argumentation semantics can be defined using labeling methods. The discussion in the paper is limited to argumentation frameworks that are finite in size.
