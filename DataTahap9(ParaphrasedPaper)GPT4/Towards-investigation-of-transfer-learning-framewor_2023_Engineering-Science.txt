This study investigates the potential of leveraging digital imaging and machine learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, to classify microfossil species and genera, aiming to streamline the traditionally manual and time-consuming process of identifying microfossils under a microscope. Using a dataset with millions of images belonging to Globotruncanita and Globotruncana genera, researchers propose a framework that utilizes both custom CNN architectures and pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet50, Xception, InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNet) to predict microfossil genus and species. The framework can achieve high prediction accuracy (>99% for genus-level, >81% for species-level) even with a limited dataset captured through low-cost light microscopy.

The significance of planktonic foraminifera lies in their usefulness in tracking evolutionary changes and in dating sedimentary rocks. The study uniquely approaches the differentiation of this fossil genera using deep learning methods. It examines six different species from the Globotruncana and Globotruncanita genera, which are challenging to classify due to their similar morphologies. The researchers employ a 14-layered custom CNN and a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, analyzing microscope images of these microfossils and overcoming challenges due to limited datasets and potential difficulties in the extraction and labeling process.

The paper presents the training and evaluation of five popular deep learning models and a custom model using k-fold cross-validation and holdout methods, focusing on genus and species classification along with a comparison of different performance metrics. The research aims to alleviate the burden on paleontologists by providing accurate predictions using transfer learning, which is notably beneficial for dealing with small datasets and noisy low-cost microscope images.

While traditional machine learning methods rely on handcrafted features, deep learning—especially transfer learning—automatically discovers informative features, improving microfossil identification. Some previous works in the field have employed various deep learning and hybrid methodologies, often targeting other microfossil families like palynomorphs, radiolarians, and fusulinids. The authors address several challenges in the field, including data scarcity, feature engineering, outdated imaging techniques, and the performance of machine learning models compared to manual identification methods.

In conclusion, their innovative framework facilitates efficient, accurate prediction for paleontological research by harnessing the power of CNNs and transfer learning, promising advancements in paleontology's digital era.
