In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), collaboration among nodes is crucial for dependable data transfer. However, self-interested nodes can hinder this cooperation, negatively affecting network performance. To make better routing choices, assessing the reputation of each node is vital. Our study introduces a Laplace Stieltjes Transform-based Conditional Survivability Coefficient Model (LCSCM), employing a Conditional Survivability Coefficient (CSC) to gauge nodes' reputations and the network's overall survivability. This innovative approach's effectiveness is confirmed through NS-2 simulations, evaluating metrics such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, and overhead while varying the number of nodes. Our model demonstrates a 24% improvement in detection rate over the PCMA model and identifies an optimal threshold for spotting selfish nodes. The LCSCM successfully enhances network performance indicators, showcasing its superiority in maintaining network cooperation.
