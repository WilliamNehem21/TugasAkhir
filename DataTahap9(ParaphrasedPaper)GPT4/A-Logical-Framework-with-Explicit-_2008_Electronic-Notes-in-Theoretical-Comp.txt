The paper presents an argument that a particular statement can be verified by constructing a logical derivation with a length not exceeding 265,536 symbols. The reader is invited to confirm the statement's validity by considering all potential derivations of a length less than 265,536 symbols, one of which will demonstrate the truth of the statement in question. Hence, the existence of such a derivation confirms the truth of the statement.
