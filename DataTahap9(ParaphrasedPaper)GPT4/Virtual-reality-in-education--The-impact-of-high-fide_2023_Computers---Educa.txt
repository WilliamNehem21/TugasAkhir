This paper examines the impact of high-fidelity nonverbal communication cues (NVCs) on the learning experience in virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs). VRLEs, which are a type of virtual learning environment (VLE) that leverage immersive VR technologies, have grown in popularity due to their capacity for distance learning and enhanced student engagement. The study developed a VRLE prototype featuring a realistic avatar of a professor, capable of displaying a range of NVCs such as body motion, hand gestures, facial expressions, and gaze, all captured in real-time and applied to the avatar during a virtual lecture attended by 96 university students. The students were split into two groups, one experiencing a full array of the professor's NVCs, while the other observed only basic body motion and minimal facial movements.

The study's goal was to evaluate whether detailed NVCs contribute to a more effective learning experience by measuring various factors including usability, realism, social presence, and knowledge acquisition. Despite previous literature suggesting that NVCs enhance communication in both traditional VLEs and VRLEs, this study found no significant difference between the two student groups in terms of learning outcomes or the perceived quality of the learning experience. The implication is that while NVCs may not necessarily increase short-term knowledge retention, their value could lie in other aspects of the learning experience such as long-term recall or engagement, needing further exploration into the sustainability and developmental challenges associated with high-fidelity NVCs in VRLEs.
