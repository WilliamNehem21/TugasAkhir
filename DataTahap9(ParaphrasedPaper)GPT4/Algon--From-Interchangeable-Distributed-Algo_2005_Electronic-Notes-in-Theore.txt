This paper discusses ALGON, a framework created to integrate a variety of interchangeable distributed algorithms, including those for mutual exclusion, deadlock detection, and agreement protocols. At its core, ALGON provides a library of algorithms, a system to integrate these into both new and existing projects, and a tool for benchmarking their performance. This allows programmers to manage the inherent complexity of distributed systems more easily by selecting algorithms based on their application's performance requirements. The key to ALGON's versatility is the consistent method interfaces exposed by algorithms within the same class, which also facilitates the switching of algorithms without altering the application code.

The paper elaborates on ALGON's architecture, utilizes a distributed deadlock detection algorithm to exemplify its design principles, and discusses how middleware can be swapped seamlessly—changing, for example, from Java RMI to CORBA—without affecting the higher-level system design. Challenges encountered, such as handling multiple inheritance, exceptions, and the automated generation of Java stubs and skeletons, were innovatively addressed.

Furthermore, ALGON is designed with system monitoring in mind, allowing developers central control and observation of system activities. It acknowledges the potential single point of failure in its design, such as with the ALGONNameServer, but adopts a dynamic registration mechanism that can be replicated for enhanced reliability.

ALGON's robustness is also noted, with an emphasis on continuing to operate despite exceptions to prevent interruption in application functioning. The paper discusses the classifications of distributed algorithms and how abstraction allows for a unified interface across different implementations. It touches on the difficulty of dealing with remote invocations and exceptions in Java, detailing how ALGON achieves middleware independence.

The paper positions ALGON in relation to existing work, noting its reflective and aspect-oriented programming techniques. The discussion concludes with a reflection on future work, like incorporating more algorithms, extending middleware interchangeability, improving performance visualization tools, and considering a C# version of ALGON that could accommodate .NET or other middleware systems.

In sum, the ALGON framework is designed to help programmers manage the complexity of distributed systems by providing a range of interchangeable algorithms and the ability to monitor and control system activity centrally. It supports adaptable middleware integration, and its design principles aim to ensure longevity and adaptability in the rapidly evolving field of distributed computing.
