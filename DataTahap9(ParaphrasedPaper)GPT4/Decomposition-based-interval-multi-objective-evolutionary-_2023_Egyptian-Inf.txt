Interval multiobjective optimization problems (IMOPs) are increasingly being studied due to the relative ease in obtaining interval information for uncertain parameters. Fuzzy numbers and random variables can be converted to interval numbers, which have clear operation criteria, by using confidence levels and cut levels, respectively.

Researchers have developed interval multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (IMOEAs) that directly tackle IMOPs by defining an interval Pareto dominance relation, preserving uncertainty information and yielding more accurate solutions. This paper focuses on the second approach.

Earlier studies like those by Limbourg et al. and Jiang et al. defined ways to handle interval Pareto dominance, either via hypervolume based on interval bounds or by probability dominance relationships considering various interval positions. Gong et al. introduced an IPDR using interval confidence levels, the II-MOEA algorithm, while Sun et al. designed an IPDR based on possibility degree lower bound through confidence.

Additional contributions include work from Liu et al., who defined interval crowding distance and modified interval confidence dominance methods to enhance comparison among individuals. Innovation in the field continues, with adaptive interval confidence proposed by Sun et al. for wind power prediction, while Xu et al. and Zhang et al. improved search algorithms like gray wolf optimization, and Chen et al. advanced IPDR and ICD calculations mixing real values and intervals.

The paper proposes a dual-ranking adaptive weight vector adjustment strategy for better population distribution and reduced uncertainty, with an interval edge preservation update mechanism to maintain convergence on the true Pareto front (PF).

The paper's structure includes an introduction to relevant definitions, details on adaptive weight vector adjustments, neighborhood adjustments, and the proposed algorithm's framework, followed by experimental results, and concludes with main findings and future work.

Adjusting weight vectors is crucial for population diversity, particularly for non-uniform PFs. The strategy accounts for sparsity and individual uncertainty. Classical algorithms like II-MOEA sort individuals using interval Pareto dominance and interval crowding distance, whereas the newly introduced IMOEAs like IMOEAs/D adjust reference vectors based on interval metrics.

IMOEAs/D-AWN has shown superior performance on test problems with complex features, suggesting better convergence and diversity when compared to other algorithms.

Challenges remain regarding optimal tuning of algorithm parameters and practical application of IMOEAs/D-AWN, especially for IMOPs with interval constraints. The work is supported by several grants from science foundations and innovation funds in China.
