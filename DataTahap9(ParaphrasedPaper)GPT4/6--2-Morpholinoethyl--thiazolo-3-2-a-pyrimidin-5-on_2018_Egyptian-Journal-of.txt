The researchers expressed interest in creating biologically active compounds to fight cancer and focused on evaluating a series of thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5-one derivatives with different substituents at the 3-, 6-, and 7-positions in search of effective anti-cancer agents. They were particularly interested in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, and plays a significant role in cancer development. Several studies have already approached the PI3K pathway as a therapeutic target, leading to the development of various inhibitors for PI3K and its related proteins such as Akt and mTOR.

A United States patent previously described some thiazolopyrimidine compounds with a morpholine ring, identified as formulae I and II, which showed anti-cancer activity through PI3K inhibition. These compounds were found to be capable of suppressing tumor growth in mammals.

Building upon these previously mentioned compounds, the research explored combining a morpholinoalkyl group with the thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5-one framework to generate a new molecular entity to potentially achieve potent anti-tumor activity via PI3K inhibition. The morpholine ring, which enhances water solubility, was connected via an alkyl chain to allow it to reach out of the binding site into the aqueous environment surrounding the target site.

The synthetic process involved stirring dimethylformamide (DMF, 10 ml) at room temperature until the reaction was complete, which took between 2 to 3 minutes. Progress was monitored through thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and after completion, the mixture was poured over crushed ice and treated with an excess of aqueous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The resultant precipitate was filtered out and washed with water, and was found to be pure enough for practical use directly after one TLC confirmation (showing a single spot).

The testing of these compounds was done in a 10-dose IC50 mode using 3-fold serial dilutions starting at a concentration of 100 micromolars (μM); pi-103 was used as a positive control starting at a concentration of 20 μM, and the reactions were conducted at an ATP concentration of 10 μM. The actual testing procedure involved a reaction incubation for 20 minutes at room temperature using technology (Echo550) capable of delivering liquid in the nanoliter range. Then, ^33P-labeled ATP (with specific activity of 10 µCi/µL) was added to start the kinase activity reaction, and the compounds were further incubated for two hours at room temperature.
