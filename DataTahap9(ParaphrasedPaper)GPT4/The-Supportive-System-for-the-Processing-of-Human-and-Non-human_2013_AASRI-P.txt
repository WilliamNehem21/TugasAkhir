Engaging with knowledge involves the intricate and advanced operations of the human brain. These operations are inherently uncertain and yield a wide array of possible outcomes. As a result, the task of developing computer systems to handle data, information, and knowledge processing is quite challenging. While numerous specialized methods and tools for knowledge processing or extraction exist, a comprehensive, all-encompassing system or software solution has yet to be developed.
