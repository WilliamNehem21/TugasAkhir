Price discrimination refers to the strategy where a seller charges different prices for the same or similar products or services based on the buyer's attributes or bargaining ability. This practice is generally seen as beneficial for both the seller, who maximizes profits, and the buyer, who may receive customized pricing. As a result, sellers are motivated to gather extensive information about potential customers to differentiate among them and set the most advantageous prices. This drive for data leads to the adoption of sophisticated methods for collecting and utilizing personal information to identify distinct customer categories.

The precise wording of survey questions is critical to ensure participants' clear and unambiguous comprehension. An initial survey was conducted with approximately ten university students to collect feedback on how the questions were being interpreted and answered. While some questions could be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," others used a scale (for example, from 1 to 5).

There was also an interest in exploring whether there was any variation in people's willingness to share their personal data when it was associated with their name (nominal) versus when shared anonymously. The assumption is that people's readiness to negotiate privacy might be affected by this factor. This consideration prompted the notion that anonymous price discrimination (such as offering different bus ticket prices for children and adults) could be a compelling approach.
