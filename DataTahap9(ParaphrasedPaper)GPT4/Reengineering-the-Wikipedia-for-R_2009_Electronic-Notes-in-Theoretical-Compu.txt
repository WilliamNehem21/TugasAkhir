This paper proposes integrating a reputation system into Wikipedia's existing framework to enhance article quality through user feedback without altering the familiar collaborative environment or the user interface. Wikipedia allows anyone to contribute knowledge, thus leveraging a vast pool of collective intelligence, and is rapidly becoming a preferred source of information over traditional publications. The suggested reputation system, or Wikipedia Recommender System (WRS), would operate externally to the existing Wikipedia infrastructure, preserving the original system as a legacy platform while providing an opt-in service for those interested in article reputation.

The paper delineates the technical challenges of reengineering a legacy system to incorporate a reputation system and presents a prototype evaluation. It asserts that using a decentralized approach for managing feedback and computing reputation scores is crucial. Each article on Wikipedia is paired with various pages, including history, edit, and discussion pages, which facilitates tracking changes and reverting to previous states if necessary. The paper stresses the importance of security, suggesting cryptographic solutions to protect the integrity of ratings from unauthorized alterations.

The authors propose a more nuanced calculation of reputation scores, taking into account diverse user perspectives, and introducing a weighted average system based on the level of trust in individual recommenders. The process retrieves and validates user recommendations from article edit pages, calculates personalized ratings, and integrates these ratings into the webpage viewed by the user.

Incorporating a trust network concept, inspired by the iwTrust question-answering environment, the WRS aims to identify users with similar trust values, fostering a community of trusted contributors. The paper acknowledges the limitations of central databases in reputation systems and suggests that decentralization can better accommodate the variety of user backgrounds and viewpoints.

Lastly, the paper demonstrates that a seamlessly integrated recommender system is feasible and can support subjective rankings without compromising the platform for users who choose not to participate in the reputation system. This innovation aspires to preserve the ease of access to knowledge on Wikipedia while empowering users to discern article quality through transparent, community-driven feedback mechanisms.
