Thailand is renowned internationally for its vibrant colored gemstone market, primary for its quality rubies and sapphires, and its skilled gemstone cutting craftsmen, as well as its expertise in jewelry design and setting. However, recently there has been a decrease in the availability of high-quality gem materials, leading to increased prices. As a result, suppliers have shown more interest in lower quality gems, which can have their appearances enhanced through a heat treatment process. When gemstones are heated with controlled gas flow, it can alter the trace elements' chemical structures within the stone, improving their color and clarity. This enhancement technique, termed "so-classical" by Chucharuwong in 1999, has gained wide acceptance.

In an investigation into the effects of different extraction methods on gemstone samples from multiple factories, it was found that using the BCR 3 (oxidation step) generally led to the greatest increase in detected lead concentrations. However, for factories 1 and 7, the initial step, BCR 1, produced higher concentrations of lead. Moreover, samples from factories 2 through 6 showed significant cracking in the rubies when subjected to BCR 3, which corresponded to the observed lead levels in the leachate, while samples from factories 1 and 7 exhibited cracks post the BCR 1 test.

When examining the lead content within the treated rubies, it was noted that the BCR 2 step resulted in the highest lead levels in the first series of tests. In the second series, despite BCR 2 being initiated earlier, it yielded lower lead levels compared to the first series. This suggests that the efficiency of BCR 2 might be improved following activation by other BCR steps.

The research was funded by the Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (GIT) and the National Research University project of Chulalongkorn University. Acknowledgments were given for the support and coordination provided by Dr. Bhuwadol Wanthanachaisaeng in acquiring ruby samples from various sources, and the GIT and the Environmental Research Institute of Chulalongkorn University for laboratory use and analytical work.

The above is a summary of the findings recorded in a paper by Kanjanabut, Chotipong, and Sutthirat, focused on establishing procedural standards for testing the stability and assessing the health impact of lead glass-treated rubies and beryllium-treated sapphires, published in the Journal of the Gemmological Association of Hong Kong in 2010.
