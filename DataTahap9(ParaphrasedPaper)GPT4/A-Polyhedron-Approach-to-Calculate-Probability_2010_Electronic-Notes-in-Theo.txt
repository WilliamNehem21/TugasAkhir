This academic paper discusses the usage of statistical testing for hardware/software systems based on a Markov Chain Usage Model (MCUM). This model uses a usage profile to represent how the system is expected to be used, assigning probabilities to state transitions. The authors introduce a new method known as the constraint-based polyhedron approach for computing the probability distribution for the MCUM from a set of usage constraints. This approach is compared to the maximum entropy technique and is shown to more accurately reflect the intended constraint semantics.

Specifically, the polyhedron method allows for better reflection of different customer profiles and their intended system usage, which is particularly useful for complex systems like RIS/PACS in the medical field. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through workflow testing of such a system, yielding promising results.

The paper describes how acquiring accurate transition probabilities in the MCUM can be challenging, particularly in complex domains where system usage is influenced by a variety of factors. An example given is American image centers which may show similar usage patterns and can be considered as one customer type.

To generate informed probabilities, field data such as direct logging or screen recording of user interaction can be collected and evaluated, or mapped directly to the modelâ€™s structure. However, since customer experts may lack statistical and MCUM theory knowledge, the data acquisition process should be simplified, allowing these experts to express their expertise in terms of constraints. These constraints can then be converted into fixed probabilities using algebraic techniques.

The paper also notes that considering certain constraints over others leads to an infinite set of valid probability distribution solutions. The entropy, a measure of uncertainty, ensures the information content is bound by the defined constraints, with the entropy function favoring a uniform probability distribution when no constraints are defined, aligning with the uninformed strategy.

In essence, the solution space for the probability distribution of a state with several outgoing transitions is restricted by structural and usage constraints, rather than the entire possible solution space, which would be significantly larger and less manageable.
