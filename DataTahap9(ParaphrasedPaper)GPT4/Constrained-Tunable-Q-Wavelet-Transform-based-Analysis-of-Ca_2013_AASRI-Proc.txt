Heart sounds can reveal a lot about the condition of heart valves and blood flow. Skilled examination through visual inspection of heart sound waveforms or stethoscope listening is required to identify heart valve issues, and experience matters. Heart murmurs are commonly linked to valve disease, making their detection crucial for the proper assessment of these conditions.

In this research, the probability distribution of heart murmurs is determined using histogram methods for a set of discrete amplitude values. The heart sound signals are categorized into a number of groups (m), ensuring a fixed ratio to the total number of signal samples (n). This ratio is maintained at 0.01 to systematically analyze the murmur intensity throughout the study.
