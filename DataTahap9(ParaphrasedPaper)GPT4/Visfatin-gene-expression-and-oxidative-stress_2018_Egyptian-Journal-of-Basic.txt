The precise causes of preeclampsia remain unclear, but the condition is linked to several risk factors, including a woman's first pregnancy, personal or familial history of preeclampsia, multiple gestations, and pre-existing conditions such as obesity, diabetes, chronic hypertension, and kidney disease. There are four categories of high blood pressure in pregnancy as defined by the working group on high blood pressure in pregnancy, specifically: chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia (mild and severe), and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. Diagnosis often involves checking for high blood pressure and protein in the urine, and other symptoms related to increased blood pressure. 

Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the onset of preeclampsia, which can cause tissue damage. Pregnant women have adaptive mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress, using enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione. When lipid peroxidation overwhelms the antioxidant defense, it can contribute to the development of preeclampsia.

The study employed SPSS version 16.0 for data analysis, using means and standard deviations to describe central tendencies and dispersions, independent t-tests for group comparisons, and Pearson correlation to evaluate relationships between quantitative parameters.

Adipokines, which are involved in metabolic processes and also linked to preeclampsia, are expressed not only in fat tissue but also in the placenta and several organs. The study found reduced placental visfatin expression in hypertensive pregnant women compared to those with normal blood pressure. This relationship suggests that adipokines may play a role in the condition's pathophysiology.

Preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life due to shared factors such as inflammation and insulin resistance. While some studies suggest that visfatin levels are elevated in metabolic syndrome and could contribute to preeclampsia, others indicate decreased visfatin levels, suggesting a potential link to the disease's pathogenesis.

Antioxidant levels, including catalase activity and glutathione, were found to be lower in hypertensive pregnant women than in those with normal blood pressure. The reduction in antioxidants could be a result of increased free radical activity, leading to lower production. On the other hand, some studies have reported increased antioxidant levels in preeclampsia.

Lipid peroxidation was identified as a key contributing factor to oxidative stress and the development of preeclampsia. The study observed higher levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker, in hypertensive pregnant women, which may disrupt maternal vascular function and lead to the characteristic vasospasm of preeclampsia.
