This paper proposes a new method of model predictive control using a Fuzzy-Hammerstein model for a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR). The paper utilizes a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to capture the Hammerstein model's static nonlinearity, while employing a linear autoregressive model to address the outcome of optimal control calculations. The innovative nonlinear predictive controller built around the Hammerstein model leverages the T-S model's universal nonlinear approximation capabilities. This approach decomposes nonlinear predictive control problems into two parts: the nonlinear model identification and linear predictive control analysis. When applied to the CSTR process, the proposed control method demonstrated superior performance to traditional PID controllers.

The paper also discusses predictive control methods based on experimental models, such as the Hammerstein, Wiener, and Volterra models, highlighting Hammerstein's capacity to characterize various nonlinear systems. Previous research approximated the Hammerstein model's nonlinear characteristics using a polynomial model and described the linear part using an autoregressive model with exogenous input (ARX). Although simulations with binary distillation columns showed the effectiveness of this method, using polynomials can limit algorithmic precision and increase complexity. Alternately, by employing nonlinear bases to portray the static nonlinear part of the Hammerstein model and a Laguerre series for the dynamic linear part, some researchers have managed to counteract output disturbances effectively in pH neutralization processes. Zhu and colleagues have made improvements to the Hammerstein model and validated the enhanced algorithm via simulation for better control outcomes. Additionally, the paper introduces two new identification methods based on Hammerstein model identification that yield effective control methods for the CSTR. Nonlinear predictive control algorithms grounded in the Hammerstein model have demonstrated algorithmic stability and robustness with simulations of pH and reaction processes.
