Ad hoc wireless networks enable nodes to communicate without centralized infrastructure, finding applications in both civilian and military contexts, such as battlefield communications, search and rescue operations, and monitoring tasks. Since nodes usually run on batteries, a significant challenge is reducing energy consumption. Since it's often not possible to replace batteries during operation, finding ways to optimize energy usage is crucial. To address this, power-saving strategies have been developed, typically falling into two categories: (1) managing nodes' active/idle states and (2) adjusting transmission power levels. Recent studies have focused on both approaches, including topology control that aims to reduce energy use while preserving network connectivity.

Unlike traditional wireless networks that depend on intermediate nodes to forward data packets, cooperative communication (CC) leverages spatial diversity akin to MIMO systems—though using single-antenna devices—to enhance signal quality and extend transmission range. This is achieved by multiple nodes transmitting the same signal, thus providing the receiver with several copies and reducing the impact of fading.

There is limited research integrating CC with topology control in ad hoc networks to enhance connectivity, particularly to a central 'sink' node. This integration is critical as node or battery failures could isolate parts of the network from the sink, and CC can offer alternative routing paths to maintain connectivity.

The academic paper proceeds with an overview of related work, detailing existing strategies for topology control and CC. Next, it formally describes the network models and identifies the main problem tackled. The CoopSink protocol is then introduced, followed by simulation results comparing it against other notable strategies. The paper concludes with a summary of the findings.

Further discussions include different energy-efficient algorithms and protocols that have been proposed for topology maintenance. Cooperative communication has also been examined for its potential in extending link coverage and designing strongly connected topologies while minimizing energy consumption, though such integration is complex and computationally challenging (NP-complete).

This study specifically contributes to the literature by exploring the use of CC to enhance connectivity with the sink node in an ad hoc network. The CoopSink protocol shows potential improvements in network connectivity while offering efficient routing and energy conservation. This is demonstrated through various performance metrics, which consider connectivity improvements, energy minimization, efficient routing to the sink, and the average number of cooperative communication (CC) links.

The CoopSink's efficiency is highlighted by its ability to provide more efficient routes to the sink than other proposals, measured by an energy savings factor (ESF). The paper concludes that CoopSink effectively utilizes CC links for maintaining connectivity to the sink, thereby enhancing the network's overall performance.
