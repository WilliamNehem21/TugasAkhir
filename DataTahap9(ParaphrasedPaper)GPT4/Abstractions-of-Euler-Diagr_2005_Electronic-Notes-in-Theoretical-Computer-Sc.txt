Euler diagrams are well-established tools that are utilized across various fields for purposes such as data storage and representation. To effectively discuss their theoretical aspects, it's beneficial to develop an abstract syntax that distinguishes crucial diagram characteristics from unimportant visual specifics, like line thickness or contour shape, which may vary depending on the diagram's application.

While a concrete Euler diagram takes the form of shapes drawn on a flat surface, the key aspects can be captured using different methods of abstraction. One common approach to abstract syntax involves identifying which specific areas—or minimal regions—are present in the diagram. This paper proposes alternative abstract syntaxes and examines their merits and limitations regarding diagrammatic features like nestedness and drawability, the semantic meaning of diagrams, and their visual arrangement.

In a tangible Euler diagram, labeled simple closed curves, defined as contours, populate a plane. A concrete region in the diagram is delineated as a set of points on the plane, which is constructed starting with the entire plane and the interior of each contour, followed by using complement, union, and intersection operations to form all the regions of the diagram.

The paper adopts a refined abstraction that doesn't necessitate conditions like the presence of a zone within each contour. This more general theory allows for the application domain to determine the necessity of such conditions.

Research has been conducted on algorithms to create physical diagrams from abstract representations, considering the challenges that arise from different well-formedness requirements, such as disallowing overlapping lines or triple points. A change in abstraction can help in pinpointing when certain conditions are fundamental for successfully drawing a diagram.
