In the process of watermark embedding, the initial step is to create a watermark, which can be composed of various types of information including numbers, images, and text. To improve security and prevent unauthorized access to the message, a password is employed. The outcome of the watermark embedding process is an image with the watermark embedded within it.

The source for the watermark detection process is an image that has to be examined; this image might be without a watermark, could have an embedded watermark, or might even be an image that was previously watermarked but then compromised. Due to varying watermarking algorithms, the watermark detection process might also require passwords or intact features as part of its inputs. The detection process could either identify the presence of a watermark or provide a confidence level regarding the likelihood that the signal includes a watermark.

An essential application of digital watermarking is in the field of data hiding. For a certified watermarking project, the task is to determine if the watermark exists, thus there is no need for meaningful content to be embedded. Conversely, if a watermarking project carries confidential data, the watermarking is significant and contains a larger quantity of information.

Techniques for data hiding chiefly fall into two categories: spatial domain algorithms and transform domain algorithms. An integration-based digital image hiding algorithm is one example of a spatial domain algorithm. It employs a BÃ©zier curve, embedding confidential images into original images of the same size. This algorithm is characterized by its straightforward computation, ease of implementation, and high-quality restoration of confidential images. It's also versatile, allowing embedding of any type of binary stream files into digital images. With proper parameter selection, these binary files can be precisely recovered. The most significant attribute of this algorithm is its robust data hiding capacity. For instance, with a gray-scale image equivalent to the original, it can conceal data up to 3 bits per pixel, making it particularly suited for hiding confidential data.

The bit substring length, denoted by l, must be a positive integer, hence, l can range from values 1 to 3. Chart 1 in the paper illustrates how varying values of l affect the numeric range of another variable, t, and the maximum data hiding capacity of an 8-bit/pixel gray-scale image as the original image.
