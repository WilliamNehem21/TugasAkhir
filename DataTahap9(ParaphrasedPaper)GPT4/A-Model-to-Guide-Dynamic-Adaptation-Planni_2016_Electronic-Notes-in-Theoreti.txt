The concept of autonomic computing, proposed by IBM's Kephart and Chess, consists of autonomic elements, each with an autonomic manager to regulate both external resources and their own behavior against high-level policies and a managed element which is a resource that could be hardware or software.

Many combinatorial problems are fundamentally about locating one or more elements within a vast potential space, defined by combinations of variable values. A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is one where these values must fulfill certain conditions or constraints. Solving a CSP involves model formulation (logical specifications of variables, domains, and constraints) and then resolving it via search methods, such as backtracking, to construct and assess potential solutions.

To demonstrate the issues in dynamically adjusting an Enterprise Application (EA) during runtime due to changing quality agreements, we use the case of a large-scale e-commerce platform as a running example. Our sections go into further detail on how our framework's planning component captures and reasons with adaptation constraints to develop possible adaptation plans under changing context conditions.

The section on manual adaptation planning underscores the challenges of manual evaluations in dynamic quality scenarios and the superiority of our constraint-based approach for dynamic adaptation planning. 

Automated reasoning within our planner component is outlined, addressing potential component conflicts due to varying quality scenarios and component compositions. This reasoning assists in selecting the best adaptation plan by resolving questions like identifying flexible componentsets and evaluating them based on objective functions that consider either the maximum or minimum number of such sets for self-adapting an enterprise application.

In light of future work, we aim to expand the model to include the decision-making process during component re-deployment across system infrastructures, develop a support tool for the model, and integrate it into self-adaptive systems. We also plan to authenticate our model through a real-world case study.
