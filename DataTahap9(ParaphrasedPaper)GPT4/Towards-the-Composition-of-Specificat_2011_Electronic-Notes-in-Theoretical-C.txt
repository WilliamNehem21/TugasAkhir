The paper discusses enhancing system development by adopting a specification-centric approach and leveraging the formal method known as Event-B. The authors argue that system specifications often arise from the integration of smaller, modular specifications, akin to combining individual components to form a more complex system. However, Event-B traditionally lacks support for combining, reusing, and validating such component specifications.

To address this, the paper proposes an extension to Event-B that incorporates a "shared event composition" technique for building and refining (distributed) systems. This methodology enables the reuse of the properties and proof obligations—assurances that the specifications meet certain criteria—from individual components to create reliable composite specifications.

The central contributions of the paper include the extension to Event-B to accommodate shared event composition and the mechanisms to uphold this composition, including the necessary proof obligations for ensuring that a composite machine built from multiple subcomponents (modules) behaves correctly.

The shared event composition model is inspired by the way subcomponents interact, often through shared states or operations, paralleling concepts from CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes). By emphasizing the synchronization of events across modules, the paper sets the stage for modular system development, where changes to subcomponents can more readily propagate through the system as a whole.

The paper outlines its structure, starting with an overview of Event-B and then introducing shared event composition, along with the principles and properties it brings to system design. Later sections delve into the parallel composition of machines within Event-B, establishing their operational semantics and explaining how machines can be refined independently, one of the critical advantages of the proposed method.

Proof obligations (POs) are key to this process, serving to validate model properties during Event-B development. The paper describes how POs for standard machines can also apply to composed machines. To demonstrate this, it presents a simplified scenario involving the composition of two machines (subcomponents) that refine an initial machine, though the concepts extend to compositions involving more machines.

The paper emphasizes the need to verify the "well-definedness" of composed machines and introduces additional POs necessary for maintaining standard properties in composed systems. It further explores the proof of the "monotonicity" property for the shared event composition, providing a simplified invariant for non-composed (single) events.

Due to space constraints, the paper doesn't detail the proof for new events added during refinement but assures that these follow the established POs of previous cases, tailored to the context of a composed event.

In summary, the paper presents an expanded framework within Event-B that promotes the concept of shared event composition, allowing for more modular and maintainable system development through the reuse of existing component specifications and their associated proof obligations.
