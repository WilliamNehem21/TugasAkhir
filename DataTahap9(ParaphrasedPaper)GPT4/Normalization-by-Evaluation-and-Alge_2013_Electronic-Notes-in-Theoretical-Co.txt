In the paper, the authors discuss a method for describing computational effects using algebraic signatures. For instance, input/output effects can be represented with operations such as inp (a binary operation) and out0, out1 (unary operations). The inp operation captures a computation that reads a bit and then continues as either one of two computations, depending on the bit's value. The out operations model computations that output a bit and then proceed with a subsequent computation.

They state that their approach to normalization by evaluation (NBE), a semantic analysis method, can apply to various computational effects beyond their examples, due to the generalization afforded by algebraic signatures. Various computational effects like non-determinism, probability, memory access, and logic programming have been described algebraically, and the same NBE algorithm can be used for these effects.

The paper focuses on a simple language to showcase the authors' contributions without delving into more complex language features like recursion and sum types, mentioning that these can be addressed with established methods from existing literature.

Further, they touch upon related work where semantic analysis with presheaf categories has been used for pure languages without computational effects. They reference work by other authors who took a practical approach to NBE for effectful languages with sum types.

The paper's essential contribution lies in investigating NBE for a language with higher types and computational effects defined by an algebraic signature. The core of their analysis is the use of the residualizing monad, which enables a clear and modular assessment of the NBE process.
