The global demand for entrepreneurship training is on the rise as governments struggle to provide sufficient employment for all citizens, prompting individuals to take initiative in job and wealth creation for themselves. With the rise in unemployment and poverty, there is an increasing emphasis on entrepreneurship education within educational institutions and government policy, aiming to foster problem-solving skills and critical thinking as a means to fill employment gaps.

This paper examines the adaptability of students in online entrepreneurship courses and offers recommendations for enhancing their experience. Various works related to this research area are reviewed; datasets from Kaggle for experimentation are described. A new stacking ensemble learning approach is proposed to predict students' adaptability to online education, with the results and conclusions presented in subsequent sections.

While there have been numerous studies on entrepreneurial intentions, there is a gap in research focusing on educational technologies in entrepreneurship education. Studies have explored assessment systems in online education and their impact on the educational experience. Innovativeness and creativity have been found to vary among students within different engineering disciplines, impacting entrepreneurial attitudes.

Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML), has been used to identify student engagement in online courses and its correlation with performance. Behavioral data and AI have been combined to predict e-learning performance. The importance of handling missing data through imputation methods, considering donor selection bias, and the effects of outliers on the data is discussed.

The paper also introduces a modified ensemble machine learning model designed to improve adaptability forecasts in the context of online entrepreneurship education. This model demonstrates resilience to noise and an ability to generalize well to new data due to its robust and diverse model foundation.

Overall, results indicate that while all students were satisfied with the attainment of course goals, those in traditional classrooms felt they achieved more compared to their online counterparts. The study underscores the need for effective instructional techniques in online courses and the role of technology in entrepreneurship education. Future research will pursue the development of a mobile platform to aid startups in marketing and global engagement.
