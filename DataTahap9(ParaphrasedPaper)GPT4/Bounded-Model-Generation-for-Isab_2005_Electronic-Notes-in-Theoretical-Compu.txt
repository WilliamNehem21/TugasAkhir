Interactive theorem provers, which employ a variety of automated proof methods tailored for specific areas, provide limited feedback when an automatic proof endeavor is unsuccessful. The shortfall could be due to the need for a supporting lemma, a more inclusive induction hypothesis, or an attempt to prove an invalid statement. In such situations, tools that can detect such non-theorems would be beneficial.

One approach involves limiting the domain to a finite model and employing a conventional SAT solver to look for a solution. If a solution is found, it signifies a counterexample to the initial higher-order logic (HOL) formula, effectively disproving its universal validity.

To facilitate this, translations of HOL formulas into DIMACS SAT and CNF formats—the latter of which requires the formula to be in conjunctive normal form—have been developed. Translating into definitional CNF involves introducing auxiliary variables to maintain efficiency and prevent a surge in complexity. While external SAT solvers like zChaff and BerkMin support advanced CNF formats, there is also a simple DPLL-based SAT solver integrated within the Isabelle/HOL interactive theorem prover. Though not intended for heavy-duty use, this internal solver allows users to explore countermodel generation without the need for additional installation steps. This conversion strategy entails a relatively modest codebase in Standard ML and aims to automate the generation of finite countermodels for propositions that do not hold in the context of Isabelle/HOL.

The methodology described has so far been applied to small-scale examples due to its inherent complexity. Despite this, it's hypothesized that the algorithm can be practically useful, as many formulae inherently possess small models.

Further investigations, including larger-scale studies and potential application to cryptographic protocol verification, are planned to validate the method's practical performance and solidify its utility for real-world problem-solving within interactive theorem proving environments.
