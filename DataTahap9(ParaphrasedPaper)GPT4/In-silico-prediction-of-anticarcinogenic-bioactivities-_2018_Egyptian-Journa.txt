The research paper discusses how computer-aided structure-activity prediction is valuable in drug development to discover drugs for treating diseases with novel biomarkers. The Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) database, which includes data on 46,000 biologically active substances, is used for preliminary biologic activity screening prior to conducting in vitro experiments. PASS predicts the potential activity (PA) and inactivity (PI) of chemical compounds, with PA values above 0.7 suggesting a high likelihood of experimental activity, while PI values gauge potential inactivity.

The ADMETSAR chemoinformatics tool is employed to predict a compound's absorption, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity, which helps reduce the chance of unfavorable outcomes in in vitro studies.

The CLC-Pred tool is used to forecast the cytotoxicity of compounds against tumor cell lines by analyzing the relationships between molecular structures and cell line cytotoxicity, using a validation method that leaves one out for each iteration. In silico predictions from CLC-Pred closely match (96% accuracy) in vivo experimental results. This tool is pivotal for evaluating and enhancing the effectiveness of compounds against cancer, with the potential to aid in the development of new anticancer drugs. Compounds with PA values greater than 0.5 are considered highly likely to be active, while PI values indicate a lower likelihood of activity.

The study also looks at ethnopharmacological data, where the frequency of mentions of a substance by different individuals is used to assess its commonality as a medicine for treating specific illnesses. Use value (UV) is calculated from these mentions to indicate the priority, importance, and distribution of medicinal knowledge among individuals. The plants Abutilon indicum, Lawsonia inermis, Lycopersicon esculentum, Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, Butea monosperma, and Tribulus terrestris are noted for their wound-healing properties and potential treatment of cancer, based on traditional knowledge. Predicted cytotoxicity activities for these plants align well with findings from a literature survey.

Selected compounds from these reported plants demonstrate significant anticancer potential in predictions made by CLC-Pred and PASS tools. The paper concludes that the study successfully demonstrates a meaningful connection between anti-inflammatory plants and cancer treatment. The application of in silico studies has confirmed the presence of anticancer activity in these plants. By linking ethnopharmacological practices with modern drug development, this research highlights the potential of ethnomedicinal plants for creating innovative anticancer pharmaceuticals and underscores the value of ethnopharmacology for the interpretive analysis in developing new cancer treatments.
