The paper discusses the differences between circular-arc graphs and interval graphs, noting that the former can have an exponentially greater number of maximal cliques compared to the latter, which have a linear number. This trait contributes to certain computational problems being more challenging for circular-arc graphs. While vertex coloring can be solved in polynomial time for interval graphs, it is NP-hard for circular-arc graphs.

Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of a particular condition in their definition to ensure compatibility among edge colorings to avoid conflicts. This condition does not require disjointedness among vertex sets in functions, permitting overlapping vertices but not overlapping edges within the partition. The discussion also covers specific cases related to sets of vertices with maximum degree and their implications on the structure of graph G, showing under certain conditions that G would be an indifference graph.
