The academic paper discusses how dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is quickly broken down in the gastrointestinal system by an enzyme called esterase, turning it into monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which is the primary metabolite responsible for its therapeutic effects. DMF has a short half-life of about 12 minutes, and as a result, it is not typically found in the bloodstream after oral administration, while MMF has a half-life of 36 hours.

The study also illustrates DMF's ability to act as an antioxidant by increasing the production of various antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione-transferase (GST), and catalase (CAT). These effects seem to be a result of activating the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcriptional pathway, which plays a critical role in regulating antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, DMF shows anti-inflammatory properties.

The experiment used rabbits divided into four groups, each with six rabbits, to test the effects of DMF. The first group (control) received a standard diet, the second group (HCD) was given a diet enriched with 1% cholesterol for four weeks. The third group (HCDDMF) had the same cholesterol-enriched diet plus DMF administered orally at 12.5 mg/kg/day, and the fourth group (DMF) received a standard diet plus DMF at the same dosage. DMF was administered as a suspension in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Control and HCD groups were given CMC alone during the treatment period.

After the experiment, blood samples were collected to measure serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The blood was allowed to clot and centrifuged to obtain serum. Rabbits were then euthanized for aortic assessment, including measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), SOD activity, and conducting histopathological examination of the aorta for changes such as the intima/media (I/M) ratio and mRNA expression of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).

The antioxidant activity assayed by the Marklund method indicated that SOD activity in aortic tissue was measured by its ability to inhibit pyrogallol auto-oxidation at an alkaline pH. Histological examination involved staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and calculating I/M ratios through measurement and averaging of the intimal and medial areas, performed by a pathologist unaware of treatment allocations.

DMF was reported to significantly decrease CETP expression compared to rabbits fed with the cholesterol-enriched diet, suggesting its role in lipid regulation. Further, the activation of Nrf2 by DMF might contribute to its hypocholesterolemic effects.

In terms of vascular inflammation, HCD-induced elevation in serum CRP suggested inflammation, as CRP is known to correlate with high cholesterol levels and can exacerbate atherosclerosis by promoting monocyte recruitment and inflammatory cytokine production.

Lastly, DMF appears to reduce oxidative stress caused by 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), a cholesterol oxidation product linked with atherosclerosis, by inhibiting overproduction of superoxide anions and inflammatory cytokine release. These findings support DMF's potential role in the prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis.
