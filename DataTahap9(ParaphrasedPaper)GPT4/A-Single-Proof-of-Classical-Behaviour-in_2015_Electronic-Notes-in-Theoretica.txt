In their physics paper, the authors have developed a method to formalize quantum mechanics principles, particularly the principle of superposition, using paraconsistent logic. Often, scientific theories contain inconsistencies, yet they aren't discarded if they remain effective in predicting and explaining natural phenomena.

The paper discusses the significance of identifying a 'strong negation' within the hierarchy of paraconsistent logics known as 'CN systems.' Identifying a strong negation is noteworthy because it allows a segment of these logics to align with classical logic, meaning there is a way to coherently integrate classical logic within these CN frameworks. This possibility has been noted in previous literature, but an explicit proof was absent. In this study, the authors offer an inductive proof that demonstrates this connection between strong negation and classical behavior within the CN systems, relying on three lemmas and two theorems to do so. Their proof illustrates that many aspects of what is valid in classical logic (referred to as C1 in the paper) are also applicable to the broader CN system, with the exception of certain self-evident properties.
