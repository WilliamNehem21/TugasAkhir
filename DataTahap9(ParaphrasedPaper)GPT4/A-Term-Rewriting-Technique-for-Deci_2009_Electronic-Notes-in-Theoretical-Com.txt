The academic paper discusses an ordering on variables for Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) within a specific logical framework. It points out that finding the appropriate ordering of terms is not a straightforward task. Chapter 3 of the paper describes two orderings that were unsuccessful.

The research introduces a new ordering that provides simpler representations of terms in proof settings and contributes an alternative method for transforming Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs). This new method could be useful when extending the underlying logic and implies that the challenge of finding the right order would persist in more complex theories.

Significant differences from previous work include unique substitution rules and an automated system for converting any formula in the fragment of First Order Logic (FOL) handled into an ordered BDD using a sorting algorithm.

To construct an ordered BDD, the first step is to simplify the guards (conditions within the diagram), individually, using a given simplification rule (Definition 3.2). The paper presents a new order on terms in Section 3.1 and defines an ordering on guards in Definition 3.8. These definitions differ from those in previous work. Following these preliminary steps, a term rewrite system is introduced. This system is used to simplify BDDs into their most reduced form, known as (0, S, =)-R-OBDD.
