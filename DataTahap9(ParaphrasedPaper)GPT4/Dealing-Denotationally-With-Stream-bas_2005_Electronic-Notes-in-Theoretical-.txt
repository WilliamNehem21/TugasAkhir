The paper presents a denotational semantics framework for Eden, a parallel functional language that incorporates kernel calculus. Continuations, which are functions representing the remaining part of a computation, are utilized to manage side effects like process creation and communication in a lazy programming environment.

In Eden, streams are the primary mode of communication between processes, allowing for behavior akin to typing on a keyboard, continuously generating characters. However, representing streams semantically is complex due to their potential infinity, which raises challenges in defining their denotational values.

Processes in Eden communicate via streams that can be infinite, complicating their representation in denotational semantics. The semantic value of an expression is defined through a continuation, a well-defined function representing the behavior of a potentially infinite computation.

For parallel applications, arguments are organized as lists, with corresponding input and output streams. Streams are evaluated in a semi-lazy fashion, where both the constructor and head of the stream must be computed, allowing an element-wise evaluation process.

Continuations provide detailed information about the remaining computation. They act as state transformers, enabling the execution of tasks by applying a function that modifies the state according to the context encapsulated in the continuation. Two types of continuations are discussed: closure continuations, which require a process identifier and context, and maximal semantics, which fully evaluate streams associated with channels.

In maximal semantics, local variables tied to parallel applications are forced, leading to the creation of more processes and channels. The paper introduces the function 'mforce' for forcing multiple identifiers and the function 'card' for computing the cardinality of a set.

When an abstraction is obtained as a value, its free dependencies are demanded and evaluated. If an abstraction pertains to a communication variable, it's communicated, and the associated channel is closed. The expression continuation is then applied to the produced value.

The denotational model proposed in the paper is capable of capturing the degree of parallelism and speculative computation. The final state graph's nodes represent the processes created throughout the evaluation, with different degrees of parallelism obtainable by modifying expression continuations. By analyzing the system's edges, one can discern speculative processes, indicated by edges from child to parent marked with "<>", signifying the child's output has not contributed to the main result.
