In the paper, the authors explore the concept of a gesture language used for interaction within a 3D virtual environment. They emphasize that the analysis presented can be generalized beyond the specific context of gesture recognition technology, addressing broader issues at a higher abstraction level that is not tied to any particular technological implementation.

The authors argue that the formal modeling of a gesture language is compelling because it has a manageable degree of complexity and brings unique challenges. The paper does not critique existing gesture languages but suggests methodologies that could support their design.

Key concerns in gesture language design are ambiguity and overlap. Ambiguity arises when gestures might be interpreted in more than one way, while overlap refers to situations where one gesture might trigger the recognition of another. These issues can make gesture interfaces confusing and less pleasurable to use, particularly when usability testing only occurs after full development and implementation, when it's more difficult to pinpoint and resolve problems.

To manage these challenges, the paper proposes analyzing individual factors separately through model-based analysis, concentrating on ambiguity and overlap. The authors utilize hybrid automata and the model checking tool HyTech to create a simplified model of the gesture recognition process. This allows for systematic identification of potential ambiguities and overlaps within the gesture language.

The paper illustrates this process by presenting an automaton model analyzing a subset of the gesture language, focusing on detecting ambiguities and overlaps using reachability analysis. Further discussion includes improving the language based on these analyses and extending the model to consider timing, which looks at the intermediate, non-specified postures between defined gestures.

The authors believe that formal modeling, specifically using automata and analysis tools like HyTech, has considerable benefits. It provides a prototype of the gesture language where essential properties can be assessed without needing repeated human user trials that are inherently variable and less predictable. This can lead to the early identification and resolution of issues related to the gesture language itself.

They acknowledge that while formal models might not capture every possible flaw, they are valuable for uncovering some problems at an early development stage. This is particularly useful in areas where formal methods are less traditional, such as the design of interaction interfaces rather than communication protocols. The ease of modeling and the complementary nature of formal methods to empirical validation underscore the importance of considering formal modeling in the development of gesture-based interfaces.
