The increasing capabilities of high-speed computers and artificial intelligence have transformed modeling problems into machine learning challenges. The use of Tikhonov and Landweber regularization in learning algorithms is gaining more attention for their theoretical and computational benefits. Various techniques including fractal features, optimization, and two-dimensional relational models are now common in pattern recognition. Researchers are particularly focused on the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for automatically reconstructing the internal structures of objects, as they become more prominent in solving such complex problems. However, these applications require algorithms that can effectively manage uncertainties, address problems that are ill-posed, and handle nonlinearity. Therefore, it's crucial to enhance existing learning algorithms and explore new ones that could outperform traditional methods in terms of speed, robustness, and result quality.

The paper is structured in the following way: it begins by describing and justifying the use of the proposed model, then introduces a new regularized learning algorithm, and follows with simulation results in the next section. The fifth section compares the new Regularization-Based Algorithm (RBA) to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Semanteme-Based SVM (SSVM). The final section summarizes the research findings.

The model's efficiency is assessed using the misclassification rate, which measures the proportion of incorrectly labeled examples in a dataset. An efficiency metric and misclassification rate formula are presented, as well as how to calculate classification accuracy.

The paper notes that many classification algorithms rely on similarity measures such as Euclidean distance but often only handle continuous data, overlooking the challenges posed by discontinuous data, which can be highly unstructured and unevenly distributed. To improve upon this situation, the paper suggests the development of new learning algorithms that factor in variations in regularizers and can recognize non-homogeneous 3D objects. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for further research to enhance numerical methods overall and to understand the sensitivity of these methods to moderate levels of noise.
