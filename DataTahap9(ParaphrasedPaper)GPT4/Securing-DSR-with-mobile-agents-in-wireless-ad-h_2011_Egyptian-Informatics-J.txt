Title: Securing Ad Hoc Wireless Networks with Mobile Agents Using Hybrid Encryption in DSR Protocol

Abstract:
Ad hoc wireless networks comprise wireless nodes that communicate without a predefined infrastructure, relaying packets beyond the direct radio transmission range. Establishing routing protocols for such decentralized networks is difficult, especially concerning security. The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is a recognized solution for ad hoc network routing. This study explores the use of mobile agents, a versatile technology in network applications, to secure DSR. A hybrid encryption approach combining symmetric key encryption for securing routing data and public key encryption for exchanging symmetric keys among nodes is proposed to enhance performance. The investigation shows that employing mobile agents can secure DSR effectively with satisfactory performance.

In the paper:
- Section 2 details the DSR protocol's workings, including route discovery and route maintenance. It highlights DSR's use of source routing, where data packet headers contain the sequence of nodes to be traversed.
- Section 3 provides an overview of mobile agents.
- Section 4 presents a new protocol merging mobile agents with DSR to safeguard ad hoc networks.
- Section 5 compares the new protocol's performance with traditional DSR.
- Conclusions and directions for future research appear in Section 6.

The paper outlines the creation of a custom simulator akin to ns2, as the prevailing ns2 version lacks support for mobile agents necessary for testing the new protocol. By validating the custom simulator against ns2, confidence in the results is ensured. Integrating mobile agents with DSR, the authors propose a new security-oriented protocol for these wireless networks.
