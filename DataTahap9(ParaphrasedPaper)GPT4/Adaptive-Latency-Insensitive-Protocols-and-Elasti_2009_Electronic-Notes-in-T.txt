In this section, we outline two methodologies referred to as ALIP and ECEE. For in-depth analysis of their characteristics, we direct readers to the foundational literature. These methods are as distinct from one another as their static analogs, LIP and EC(SEE), warranting a thorough examination of their strengths and weaknesses.

Although no assessment of power consumption was conducted, it's plausible that ECEE may use less power than ALIP while providing comparable performance, potentially due to increased clock-gating activity from anti-tokens. Conversely, the additional wiring and control mechanisms in ECEE might lead to higher power usage compared to the local counters in ALIP. This area warrants further investigation.

Defining overarching criteria for the preferred application of one protocol over the other is challenging. In specific instances, such as those we'll present in the following two sections, ALIP's superior performance is quite apparent. Section 5 will demonstrate that analyzing multiple conditions through benchmark simulations complicates the assessment process.

We provide examples illustrating circumstances where ECEE incurs disadvantages relative to ALIP. One scenario involves reconvergent fanout, where a block's output is distributed to multiple branches with varying delays. Another involves issues that emerge when incorporating state-retaining blocks.

It's important to note that static protocols can mitigate such issues through buffering strategies. On the other hand, adaptive protocols may rely on more complex data interactions, which are not as straightforward to model or optimize. Additionally, these optimizations could be significantly costly in terms of hardware or computational resources.

We developed ALIP and ECEE versions of a simplified DLX architecture using behavioral VHDL. This model allows parameter variations, such as instruction mix, degree of data dependency, and the ability to execute instruction bursts. Through this approach, we collected valuable data to contrast ALIP and ECEE performance in a complicated yet manageable scenario.

We adjusted the proportion of instructions utilizing the pipelined unit from 0% to 100% at 10% intervals, evaluating both data-dependent and independent scenarios. In our experiments, the pipelined unit had a fixed latency of 3 cycles, without utilizing the multi-cycle unit (thus having an execution latency of either 0 or 3 cycles). We discuss the outcomes at both extremes (0% and 100%) and then explore the intermediate scenarios.

Our observations from the DLX example support previous claims about ALIP's potential for improved performance. However, this does not preclude the possibility for ECEE to outperform in specific contexts. Complex block interactions within larger component networks could potentially favor the ECEE approach, as we will explore in the subsequent section.
