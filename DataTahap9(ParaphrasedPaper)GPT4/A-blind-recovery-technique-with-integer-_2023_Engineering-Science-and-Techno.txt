Visible watermarking embeds a conspicuous mark on image pixels, while invisible watermarking embeds it discreetly, preserving the picture's appearance. Invisible watermarking is broadly categorized into three types: fragile, semi-fragile, and robust. Fragile watermarking is optimal for verifying image integrity and authenticity, ensuring an image remains unaltered and genuine. Semi-fragile watermarking offers a compromise, tolerating some level of compression yet providing limited recovery options. The robust watermarking method balances imperceptibility with resilience against modifications.

Molina et al. developed a technique for embedding both authentication and recovery data into image blocks, enabling tamper detection and recovery of images. When tampering occurs, the recovery data, which is stored separately, can be used to restore the image. Tested methods delivered good results in recovering tampered images and displayed a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), indicating low image distortion.

However, watermarking systems may face the "tamper coincidence" problem, where tampering affects recovery-related data. Strategies such as using multiple sets of recovery data and applying image inpainting techniques are suggested to tackle this issue.

Several methods have been proposed over the years:

- In 2013, Tong et al. introduced a watermarking method using chaotic maps for better security and recovery.
- In 2014, Dadkhah et al. presented a singular value decomposition-based approach, although the recovery quality at higher tampering rates suggested room for improvement.
- In 2016, Singh et al. proposed a technique employing significant bits to generate recovery bits and a two-level tamper detection mechanism.
- In 2018, Tai et al. used integer wavelet transform for recovery bit generation, focusing on reducing artifacts in recovered images.
- In 2020, Sarkar et al. suggested two methods for handling heavy tampering, with limitations in restoring images when tampering exceeded 50%.

The method of embedding and extracting watermarks is critical for image authentication and self-recovery. By embedding recovery data across various image locations, the information remains safeguarded against tampering. Successful methods will embed recovery data without significantly altering original image quality.

While these approaches are valuable, there's a trade-off between the number of recovery bits that can be stored and the accuracy of tamper localization. High precision in tamper detection is crucial for quality image recovery. Improving this precision usually requires a smaller block size and fewer recovery bits, impacting the recovered image quality. Conversely, storing more recovery bits could lead to higher-quality image recovery but diminishes tamper localization accuracy.
