Hypoxanthine, which is a part of the heterocycles family, consists of pyrimidine and imidazole rings and is a unique purine derivative that’s not commonly found in nucleic acids. It is known for its distinctive structure featuring a pyrimidine ring fused with azolic (imidazole) structures, which make it of significant interest due to its biochemical, pharmacological, and physicochemical properties. In recent years, various derivatives of pyrimidine have shown broad pharmacological and clinical benefits. In particular, the fusion of pyrimidine with imidazole has garnered interest due to its broad biological activity. Hypoxanthine displays various forms of tautomerism that determine the pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors within the molecule. Moreover, fused imidazole and its derivatives typically demonstrate bioactivity against inflammatory mediators.

Despite the extensive literature on the subject, no studies have been conducted to determine the reaction pathway, mechanism, or the structure-activity relationship of hypoxanthine and its impact on physicochemical properties. This study aims to analyze the compound in depth to understand the reasons behind its pharmaceutical activity, utilizing both experimental and theoretical spectroscopy methods.

Due to inductive and resonance effects in the rings and the atoms involved, the molecule is quite reactive and may possess new drug properties. Of the eight C-N bonds in the molecule, the bond lengths for N11-C13 and C1-N2 are shorter because they are part of an imine group. The C-N bond in the pyrimidine ring is shorter than that in the imidazole ring to accommodate the structure of the pyrimidine ring. Bonds such as C4-N10, C3-N11, C1-N6, and N2-C3 have similar lengths, which are shorter than the C5-N6 bond due to the presence of an oxygen atom. The arrangement of these atoms in the chemical bonds increases covalent energy and the molecular orbital energy difference, leading to heightened chemical activity that may contribute to the molecule's pharmacological effects.

The study finds that the chemical shifts in the molecule, particularly where the imine groups are situated, play a central role in the drug-like properties of the compound. The molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) inform us about the chemical or biological reactivity of a compound, indicating where electronic or nucleophilic attacks might occur during chemical reactions. However, the three-dimensional nature of electrostatic potential makes it challenging to visualize its spatial distribution and magnitude all at once. The dipole moments across the molecule are supported by charges determined through mulliken population analysis, revealing charge depletion zones indicative of the molecule’s inhibitory character.

The chemical bond force constants and the reactive energy of intra-molecular interactions can be gauged by ionization potential. The observed ionization potentials indicate moderate force constants that support stabilized reactive energy within the molecular site. Electronegativity values are quite high in both IR and UV regions, suggesting the molecule's ability to bind with protein complexes and its capacity to attract electrons.

The fused two-ring structure seems to be instrumental in generating the compound’s antibiotic potential, thanks to its hyper symmetrical polarization properties, which solidify its pharmaceutical viability. Several energy transitions throughout the compound are linked to its drug properties, such as within the six-membered ring, where energy is transferred and absorbed, indicating an endothermic reaction that contributes to the potential energy needed for the fusion of both rings. The specific heat capacity of the compound increases with temperature, denoting a rise in the kinetic energy of the molecular system.
