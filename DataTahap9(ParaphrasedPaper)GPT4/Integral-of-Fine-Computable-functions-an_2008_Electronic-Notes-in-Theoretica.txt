In this paper, we explore the basics of reconstructing the theory behind Walsh-Fourier series. Walsh-Fourier series, along with Haar wavelets, are currently pivotal in the field of digital processing. However, these concepts were initially delved into by researchers such as Haar, Rademacher, Walsh, and Fine in the mid-20th century due to their mathematical significance. The approach to the theory of Walsh-Fourier series parallels that of traditional Fourier series, except it utilizes Walsh functions instead of trigonometric functions.

The paper also presents an important result in the form of Theorem 2.14, which states that a bounded function is Riemann integrable if the set of points at which the function is not continuous has a Lebesgue measure of zero. When this condition is satisfied, the function can be integrated in the Lebesgue sense, and the values of the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are equivalent.
