The paper discusses the relationship between the structure of first-order logical statements and their formulational complexity, focusing on the limited number of variables they contain. It also provides a semantic interpretation of tree-width by examining coalgebras associated with the pebbling comonad. In the first section, the paper reviews the concepts of quantifier rank and variable count, along with their connection to tree-width and tree-depth. The second section introduces a new comonad that integrates aspects of both the pebbling comonad and the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé comonad, allowing for the analysis of both quantifier rank and variable count within a single framework. This new comonad also facilitates the representation of tree-depth and tree-width. Although this adaptation of existing comonads is slight, the paper also innovatively extends these comonads to encompass constants in the signature and free variables, a topic further explored in the third section.
