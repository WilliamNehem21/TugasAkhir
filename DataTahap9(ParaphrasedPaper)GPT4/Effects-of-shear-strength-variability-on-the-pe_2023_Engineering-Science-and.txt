The original passage describes the findings from parametric studies on shear strength and its impact on pipeline embedment and lateral resistance when resting on clay seabeds. It confirms that both normalized embedment (z/d) and residual horizontal resistance are influenced by the mean shear strength and its variability (expressed as the coefficient of variation, COV). It also discusses the sensitivity of lateral buckling to soil and pipeline interaction and the importance of using verified models and best practice guidelines for pipeline design. Results from the studies are confirmed using centrifuge tests and field observations. The PSI-Lateral R code used in the analysis can help industry professionals conduct their own studies on soil and pipeline properties.

Probabilistic methods like Monte Carlo simulations are suggested as alternatives to deterministic approaches to better handle uncertainty in the design process. The code and methodology were verified against published data and are expected to help predict embedment and lateral resistances more accurately, leading to improved pipeline design and risk management.

Here's a paraphrased and summarized version of the passage:

This study examines how soil shear strength affects pipeline embedment and lateral resistance on clay seabeds using parametric analysis depicted in graphs. Embedment and resistance trends are consistent across pipelines, with increased variability widening the range of possible embedment values. The research includes design best practices and models, addressing key factors like lateral buckle formation and pipe-soil interaction. 

Various projects and models have been used to predict pipeline behavior, with the most common being finite element analysis and plasticity theory. The study highlights the importance of accommodating soil strength variability in design through the use of parameters like COV. A PSI calculation tool developed in the R language was used to conduct the analysis and compare results with empirical data.

Field observations of embedment help validate design phase predictions, and further pipeline embedment can occur due to soil consolidation post-installation. The developed R code, PSI-Lateral, offers a way to evaluate the impact of strength variability on pipeline lateral response and has been verified using published field data. 

The study emphasizes the importance of probabilistic methods over deterministic ones for a more accurate insight into pipeline stability and the performance of subsea pipelines in varying soil conditions. The methodology can inform the design process by evaluating shear strength variability's effect on stability parameters.
