In their paper, the authors present a novel approach to modeling database designs through the use of queueing networks, allowing database designers to understand and evaluate the dynamic behavior of databases prior to deployment. This methodology stands out from standard performance evaluation techniques, which typically focus on post-deployment tuning based on software architecture and operational database statistics.

The authors aim to validate their method by assessing the performance of the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC-C) benchmark under various workload scenarios. They demonstrate the utility of the model for informing database design decisions and for anticipating potential performance bottlenecks.

The paper is organized into sections covering related work, the application of queueing networks to database design, detailed performance analysis of the TPC-C benchmark, and concludes with a discussion on further advancements and research directions.

The work illustrates the advantages of early performance evaluation, highlighting that many post-deployment performance issues could be mitigated if addressed during the design phase. Traditional query optimization techniques, which are useful for individual statements, become cumbersome when considering their impact on overall system performance, particularly under concurrent transaction loads.

The authors argue in favor of a design-time performance model based on queueing networks, as it aligns with the level of detail accessible to designers and effectively captures essential dynamic behaviors. Their model utilizes information gathered during the initial stages of database design, avoiding excess complexity while still meeting the needs of performance analysis.

By implementing queueing network models, the paper shows that the performance behavior and transaction response times of the database designs can closely match those of actual TPC-C benchmark implementations. This supports the conclusion that the proposed approach to modeling is capable of representing real-world database system performance, providing a useful tool for database designers in early evaluation and decision-making processes.
