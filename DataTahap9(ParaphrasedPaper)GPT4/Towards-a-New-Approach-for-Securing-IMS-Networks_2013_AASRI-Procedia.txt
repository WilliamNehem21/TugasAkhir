This academic paper discusses the importance of security in IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) networks along with ensuring quality of service (QoS), both of which are essential for the development of new services. Security affects users, service providers using IMS, and network operators managing the IMS core. Current research on the subject has been reviewed, and an analysis is presented alongside a proposed approach to address IMS network security vulnerabilities. The proposed approach focuses on user and service provider aspects.

The architecture of IMS, an IP protocol-based system, is open, distributed, and flexible in terms of implementation and deployment. However, this leads to various communication interfaces that can make it susceptible to attacks, necessitating security measures at every level, including customer devices.

Key protocols in IMS are SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and Diameter, with SIP being similar to HTTP and thus prone to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Critical attacks against IMS could compromise or manipulate sensitive control function messages.

Various standardization bodies like 3GPP, ITU, and ETSI have made recommendations to secure IMS networks. A Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk Analysis (TVRA) methodology is discussed, conceptualizing the system as a set of properties with inherent weaknesses. To prevent security incidents, the method recommends countermeasures against these vulnerabilities.

The paper explains the IMS client as any user accessing services on the IMS network, either through a telecommunication or IP network. It also describes the C-S interface, which exchanges media content between the client and the service platforms, using protocols that vary with the service provided.

The analysis identifies three critical interfaces— I-C, I-S, and C-S—as highly susceptible to attacks due to their use of public, insecure network infrastructures. The paper posits that the risk of attacks on these external interfaces is greater than those within the secure IMS core network.

In the proposed approach, internal IMS core network interfaces are considered less critical, as they are inaccessible from outside and are protected by filtering and access controls. By focusing on securing the most vulnerable external interfaces, the paper suggests that overall network security can be significantly enhanced.

Confidentiality is a primary concern for all interfaces, ensuring that service platform content is only available to authorized clients and that media exchanged during client access remains confidential if the parties involved opt for a private service.
