The provided text discusses intersection types, which are becoming increasingly prominent in programming languages such as TypeScript, Flow, and Scala. It references literature that offers a comprehensive view of intersection types and their applications. The question of whether a given type system can generate a term of a specific type, known as type inhabitation, has been shown to be undecidable for intersection types of higher ranks (greater than two), but it is decidable for rank 2, though with considerable computational complexity.

The authors investigated a particular form of grammar, referred to as pre-grammar, within the context of rank 2 intersection types and specifically studied the challenge of determining whether this grammar can produce any non-empty set of terms, known as the emptiness problem. The focus was on a variation of rank 2 types that do not have positive occurrences of intersections, allowing the adaptation of existing methods created for simpler type systems in an effective manner. The authors plan to extend their techniques to the entire rank 2 intersection type system and examine other, potentially more powerful, related type systems in the future.
