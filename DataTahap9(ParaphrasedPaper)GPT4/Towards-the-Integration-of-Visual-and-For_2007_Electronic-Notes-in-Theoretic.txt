In earlier studies, the authors have enhanced the Spec Explorer model-based testing platform with new features to improve its suitability for testing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and to mitigate several related challenges. They introduced methods and supplementary libraries for representing GUIs within Spec, devised an automatic GUI mapping tool for aligning the GUI model with the actual implementation, and developed a utility to handle the potential explosion of test cases by leveraging the hierarchical nature of GUIs. For more comprehensive information, readers can refer to the cited work. These advancements have garnered considerable attention from individuals involved in modeling and testing.
