This academic paper discusses the Wavelet-based Gravitational search algorithm (WGA) and evaluates its effectiveness in finding the global optimal solutions for high-dimensional optimization problems. The performance of WGA is compared with other algorithms previously reported in literature. Experimental results indicate that WGA is efficient in solving a variety of large-scale optimization problems and is competitive with other algorithms, particularly due to its simpler structure and ease of implementation. The WGA's source code is openly available on GitHub.

When compared with DECC-D and other algorithms like CBCC1-DG, CBCC2-DG, and DECCDG, it was found that the WGA outperformed DECC-D in 18 out of 20 test functions, while performing worse than DECC-D for 2 functions. Even though DECC-DML sometimes outperformed WGA, it also provided the worst results for a number of test functions. Similarly, CBCC1-DG and CBCC2-DG performed better than WGA for a few functions; however, CBCC1-DG did not achieve the best results for any of the functions, and CBCC2-DG was the best for only one function. DECCDG outperformed WGA for a couple of functions but had the worst output for others.

One strength of the WGA is its single control parameter (CR), simplifying its use. It has been shown through experiments that WGA often achieves better results compared to the mentioned algorithms and is particularly effective for most of the test functions drawn from the CEC 2008 and CEC 2010 function sets.

The paper acknowledges the extensive research in high-dimension optimization over recent years, emphasizing cooperative co-evolution techniques. It suggests that in the future, WGA could be integrated with different cooperative co-evolution frameworks to potentially enhance its performance. Moreover, WGA's simplicity and foundational approach make it a suitable candidate for addressing various real-world, large-scale optimization challenges.
