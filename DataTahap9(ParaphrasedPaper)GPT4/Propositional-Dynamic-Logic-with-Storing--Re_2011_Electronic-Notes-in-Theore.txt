The study expands propositional dynamic logic (PDL) by incorporating a parallel composition operator and four specific atomic programs designed for managing data within data structures. The authors propose an innovative version of Kripke semantics that employs organized sets of states instead of the traditional sets of states, enabling the representation of data structures and reasoning about their manipulation using the newly introduced operators.

The paper also acknowledges a gap in PDL regarding operators for handling parallelism and concurrency in programs. While numerous PDL extensions exist to address this, the current work aims to enhance reasoning about parallel or concurrent programs.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 outlines the syntax and semantics of the new language, PRSPDL. Section 3 provides examples using PRSPDL, offering motivations for its use. Section 4 discusses the axioms and rules, along with soundness for a simplified version of PRSPDL, named RSPDL0, which excludes iteration, parallel composition, and test operators. Section 5 details the completeness results for RSPDL0. The final section, Section 6, discusses contributions and future work.

The authors mention that by leveraging PRSPDL's operators with basic programs, it's possible to define new operators, such as those found in allegorical diagrammatic reasoning. They plan to explore this in subsequent research.

RSPDL0, a fragment of the language presented in Section 2, is highlighted for further investigation. Restricted by the absence of the operators for test (?), iteration (*), and parallel composition (||), RSPDL0 aims to serve as a foundation for studying the full PRSPDL language.
