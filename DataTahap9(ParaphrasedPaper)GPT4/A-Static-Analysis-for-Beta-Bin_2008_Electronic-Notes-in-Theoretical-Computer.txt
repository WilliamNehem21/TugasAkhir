We present a method for control flow analysis that statically predicts the potential activity of processes as defined within the beta-binders calculus framework. This analysis method can capture the core behaviors of different components within the system, tracking all potential variable bindings and communications both within and between system components. It serves as a tool for preliminary checking of dynamic biological properties in a static context. We demonstrate our analytical approach with a case study highlighting interactions between a virus and immune system cells.

The notion is to represent biological systems using models akin to concurrent computing systems. Typically, these models are characterized by transition systems that can become quite complex and unwieldy for computer analysis due to their size. By applying static analysis techniques at the compilation stage, we can significantly cut down on computational resources, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with intricate biological systems. This upfront analysis aims to identify possible behaviors of the system, which lays the groundwork for establishing static verification of dynamic biological characteristics. With our approach, it is possible to confirm fundamental aspects of system behavior that can provide insights into simple properties, such as whether certain components do not interact or whether a component is effectively isolated.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the basics of beta binders. Section 3 introduces our control flow analysis approach. In Section 4, we discuss potential applications for our analysis. Section 5 applies the control flow analysis to a specific example. Finally, Section 6 offers an assessment of our methodology.

One specific challenge we address is the inherent unpredictability, due to undecidability, of whether certain communications will occur during runtime. For instance, depending on the most recent interface operation, the binder x in an interaction sequence could be either hidden or unhidden. Our analysis deals with this challenge by predicting the communication as a possibility when statically analyzing the system.
