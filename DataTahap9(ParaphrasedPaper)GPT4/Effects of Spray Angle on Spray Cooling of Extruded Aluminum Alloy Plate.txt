Recent studies have predominantly concentrated on the spray angle and related factors, such as discharge coefficients and spray cone angles, with significant findings coming from both experimental and computational research. Despite these advances, the investigation into how the spray angle influences spray cooling, particularly in the metal press quenching sector, has been languishing. Analyzing the impact of spray angle on heat transfer is notably complex, with direct numerical simulation being the preferred method for theoretical analysis.

This paper intends to numerically explore how varying the spray angle can affect the spray cooling of extruded aluminum alloy plates, aiming to identify an optimal spray angle range that could enhance cooling efficiency. The study will use the commercial finite volume method (FVM) software, Fluent, to simulate and calculate the temperature distribution within the cooling aluminum plate. Additionally, stress distribution will be assessed using MSC.Marc software.

The study assumes that the aluminum plate has a consistent temperature when exiting the extrusion machine. Hence, the initial temperature is set uniformly at 793 K, and the material is specified as 6061 aluminum alloy.
