We envision two key implementations for these concepts. Firstly, as explored in references [17,6], there is the potential for integrating our cost environment approach with established contract theories for web services, which are derived from a variation of CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems). We plan to expand on this application in future works. Secondly, we aim to enhance the theoretical understanding of network processes by acknowledging that network communication is subject to delays. By incorporating routers into our process description language, we can quantify the cost of communication based on the number of routers a message traverses, an aspect we are actively exploring.
