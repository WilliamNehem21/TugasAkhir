The academic paper delves into the significance of fruit as a vital agricultural commodity that feeds millions worldwide. It recognizes that standard fruit supply chains incorporate quality assurance protocols to ensure freshness, taste, and, above all, safety. A critical determinant of fruit quality is the stage of ripeness, which is traditionally assessed manually by experts, making it both labor-intensive and prone to error. Thus, there's an emerging demand for automating the classification of fruit ripeness.

Technological advancements have led to various automated methods using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches, which outperform others. Unlike traditional methods requiring the computation of complex, crop-specific features, DL can work with raw data, simplifying the process.

This review examines recent technologies for automating fruit ripeness classification, focusing on common feature descriptors used in these methods. It addresses the broader issue of improving global food quality and security by enhancing fruit production efficiency and minimizing waste.

The paper discusses the complex process of fruit ripening, involving changes in color, texture, sweetness, and aroma. Numerous aspects such as size, color, chlorophyll concentration, sugar and acid content, and other attributes are quantifiable and provide insight into ripeness levels.

Methods used in ripeness classification are categorized as statistical, ML-based, and increasingly, DL-based, with the latter setting new benchmarks in accuracy. The review spans literature from 2014 to 2022, with a particular emphasis on novel DL techniques.

Conventional assessments of ripeness tend to rely on visual inspections, which are subjective and laborious. Objective tools like colorimeters and spectrometers reduce biases in measurement. The paper distinguishes between climacteric fruits, which continue the ripening process post-harvest, and non-climacteric fruits, which do not.

The importance of textural changes, often seen in climacteric fruits, is highlighted, with increased softness impacting post-harvest life due to susceptibility to physical damage and disease. Advances in molecular biology have shed light on the genetic control of ripening in climacteric fruits, but how this interacts with cellular changes remains partially understood.

Proper data representation is vital for feeding ML or DL models. This could include an array of features that distinguish between different ripeness classes. The paper also notes that fruit aromas, which significantly influence consumer preference, can now be evaluated by electronic-nose devices, offering a modern, efficient approach to ripeness grading.

The paper outlines techniques from statistical analysis to machine learning models, including advanced DL architectures like CNNs, for classifying fruits based on various features such as color and aroma. It explores how concatenation of data from different imaging modes enhances the accuracy of ripeness classification.

The work mentions the potential of multispectral imaging, and attention models in the classification of fruit ripeness, confirming the effectiveness of multimodal data and DL architectures. Finally, the paper calls attention to the challenges of in-field ripeness assessment and its implications for optimizing harvest times and predicting yields, emphasizing the importance of non-destructive methods to link maturity assessments to yield predictions and harvest timing in real applications.
