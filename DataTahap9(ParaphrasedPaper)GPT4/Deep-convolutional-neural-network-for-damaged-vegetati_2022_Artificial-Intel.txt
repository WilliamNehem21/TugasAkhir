This paper introduces a novel approach for accurate and automatic semantic segmentation of vegetation in RGB images, particularly for dealing with damaged vegetation, which is important for assessing various biological factors such as crop health and weed presence. Traditional models based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Near-Infrared (NIR) channels, or RGB have been effective for identifying vegetation but inadequate for detecting damaged vegetation. The authors propose a method that generates a virtual NIR channel from an RGB image using a regression-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Two new vegetation indices, Infrared-Dark Channel Subtraction (IDCS) and Infrared-Dark Channel Ratio (IDCR), are computed from the virtual NIR. These indices, along with the RGB image, are inputs for a CNN designed for semantic segmentation, resulting in a model capable of recognizing vegetation in varying conditions.

During experiments with 84 plots containing 13 species and multiple damage levels, the best segmentation results were achieved using the RGB image augmented with the virtual NIR channel (F1=0.94) and the new IDCR and IDCS indices (F1=0.95). The methodology outperformed models using only the RGB image or RGB-based indices.

To avoid dataset bias, images from the same plot were kept within the same subset (training, validation, or test), with 80% of plots for training and 20% for validation and testing. The proposed CNN uses a last layer with a sigmoid function and a mean absolute error loss that can be improved by an adversarial loss, as in the Pix2Pix architecture, to recreate NIR. This approach ensures that the generated images are visually similar to real images.

A second similar CNN is used to estimate plant coverage, inputting a 7-channel image that includes RGB, virtual NIR, NDVI, IDCS, and IDCR. The model employs a softmax activation layer to differentiate vegetation coverage.

The paper provides evidence that using the virtual NIR and the new indices improves the model's ability to segment vegetation. Additionally, adding an adversarial loss enhances the estimation of the NIR channel, proving the effectiveness of combining traditional segmentation methods with advanced neural network techniques.
