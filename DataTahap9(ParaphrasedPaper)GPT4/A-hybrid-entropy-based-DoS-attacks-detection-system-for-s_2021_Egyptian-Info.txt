This paper discusses how trust levels in a network can be impacted by the potential for member nodes being part of a denial-of-service (DoS) botnet. The authors propose an algorithm designed to identify nodes engaging in DoS attacks, then use this information to assign trust values to nodes. Violating nodes are temporarily banned and their administrators are alerted to allow for rectification. Persistent offenders are permanently banned.

Specifically focusing on software-defined networks (SDNs), the paper emphasizes the need for security measures against DoS attacks. Previous research typically employs entropy or more sophisticated entropy-based metrics to detect DoS attacks, but these methods can be problematic due to possible spoofing and false positives.

This paper introduces a novel hybrid system incorporating both entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for DoS detection in SDNs. The system works by monitoring the entropy of source and destination IP addresses, whereby an uncharacteristically low entropy suggests an attack. However, normal but significant changes in network behavior, such as streaming a movie, could be incorrectly flagged as attacks. The proposed solution is to model normal network traffic and consider deviations from this model as potential attacks.

The proposed method leverages time intervals and probability density functions (PDFs) to create a behavioral model of the network. KL divergence is used to compare differences in PDFs from different time intervals, helping to determine if network behavior has deviated from the norm.

The paper acknowledges a sophisticated attacker with insight into the network's traffic patterns could potentially evade detection by mimicking legitimate traffic. Consequently, the proposed detection system must be robust against such evasion tactics.

To evaluate the proposed detection mechanism, the authors describe an experimental setup using a 20-node fully connected SDN with a single controller. The algorithm operates in rounds, keeping track of the number of rounds a node is deemed malicious. The percentage of malicious rounds within a window is calculated and compared against preset thresholds to assess suspected malicious behavior.

The described framework is flexible and can integrate any trust metric that can provide a binary decision on the maliciousness of a node's behavior, making it a versatile tool for enhancing network security against DoS attacks.
