Recent advancements in science and technology have prompted the integration of robots into the medical field, particularly in orthopedic surgeries such as laminectomy and total knee arthroplasty. Specially developed surgical robots have garnered particular attention in high-risk spinal surgeries where surgeon fatigue due to long operation times can compromise quality and outcomes.

Laminectomy, a common procedure for lumbar spinal stenosis, aims to relieve pressure on spinal nerves by removing a portion of the vertebra called the lamina. The challenge lies in ensuring the correct amount of lamina is left intact, as too little increases the risk of harm to the spinal canal and nerves, while too much may not relieve the pressure effectively.

Current research has focused on a spinal surgical robot capable of detecting different states during pedicle screw insertion using a real-time force-sensing algorithm. Safety control strategies are crucial for the vertebral lamina milling task. Wang et al. proposed a technique that incrementally mills the vertebra, but challenges arise with complex vertebral surfaces. The research introduced in this paper outlines the vertebral structure and the milling process, as well as incorporating fuzzy force control theory. The horizontal milling force is maintained constant while the vertical force is monitored to identify bone structure. This method offers a principled approach to distinguish between various milling states.

To demonstrate the benefits of fuzzy force control, two experiments were conducted. In the first, milling was performed at a uniform depth, while the second adjusted the depth using fuzzy logic to maintain a constant tangential force. The experiments aimed to ensure drilling stops upon reaching the inner cortical bone layer.

The researchers used bone samples from pigs, sheep, and cattle to analyze the relationship between axial force and state recognition during milling, varying milling depths and drill speeds. The tangential force was held constant through fuzzy logic. Results determined that drilling should continue when the axial force is low, indicating cancellous bone presence, and should stop upon reaching a high force value, signalling contact with the inner bone layer.

The paper also highlights the academic background of the researchers involved, detailing their education and current affiliations with institutions in China, emphasizing their expertise and focus on surgical robot development.
