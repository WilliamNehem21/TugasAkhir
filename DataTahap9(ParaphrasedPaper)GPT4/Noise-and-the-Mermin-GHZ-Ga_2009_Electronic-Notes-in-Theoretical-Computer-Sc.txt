This paper explores a specific type of game called a pseudo-telepathy game, which requires more than one participant and cannot be won by traditional means but can be won when the players utilize quantum entanglement. The challenge is that even with a winning quantum strategy, players are prone to making mistakes due to the difficulty in executing the strategy flawlessly.

The study then delves into the effects of various types of quantum noise on the winning quantum strategy in the Mermin-GHZ game, seeking to determine the level of noise that can be tolerated before the quantum players no longer have an advantage over classical players.

While quantum entanglement offers strong non-local correlations not found in the classical world, the paper investigates its application to distributed problems where no direct communication is allowed. In scenarios where each party has their own separate input and output, and the interest lies in the non-local correlations between these inputs and outputs, quantum solutions become feasible. These scenarios are often framed as games in game theory and termed pseudo-telepathy games.

The paper details the framework of the problem, explains the Mermin-GHZ game along with the optimal quantum and classical strategies, and dedicates the later sections to analyzing the effect of simple noisy quantum channels on the quantum strategy's efficacy in the game.
