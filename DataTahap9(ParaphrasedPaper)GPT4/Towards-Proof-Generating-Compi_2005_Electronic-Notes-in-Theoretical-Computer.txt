The paper addresses the significance of ensuring the correctness of software through proper compilation practices. Traditional verification methods don't confirm the accuracy of the compiler itself; instead, they verify the correctly translated output for each program. The authors introduce a novel technique where verification is integrated as proof checking within a formal specification and verification framework.

The methodology involves creating formal specifications for both source and target languages, along with defining a translation predicate. Compilers then output not only the translated program (C) but also a proof of its correctness relative to the original source program. This proof serves as a translation certificate and can be checked independently using the framework, promoting trustworthy translations.

The paper showcases the process by applying it to a straightforward translation example and employing Isabelle/HOL as the theorem prover. It also demonstrates two different methods to prove translation correctness, offering flexibility to accommodate various proof strategies and allowing the introduction of intermediate languages to manage complexity.

Key to this approach are four distinct characteristics: separate language specifications, explicit translation correctness specification, the ability to support additional specifications to derive properties, and the creation of a translation certificate as a proof script. This enables reuse of language specifications and simplifies the definition of a correct translation.

The specification and verification framework (SVF) proposed is commonly provided by a third party and not the compiler developer. It must be powerful enough to detail and reason about programming languages, ensuring consistent specifications by design. An ideal SVF would include a dependable prover and checker with a verifiable implementation. Due to the rise in the importance of proof-carrying code, the authors anticipate more SV frameworks will incorporate separate proof checkers.

The work ties into the concept of certifying compilers discussed by Necula and Lee, where a compiler generates certificates to verify specific properties of the target program. The authors' method relates in the way it distinctly separates compilation processes from the verifiable certificate, drawing parallels to existing techniques in proof-carrying code research.

The demonstration of this method includes the translation of an assignment language to a stack-machine language with an in-depth explanation of the translation contract and two proof techniques illustrating the flexibility of the process. It emphasizes the need to define observables states and manage bounded resources for practical translation correctness.

Concluding the paper, the authors present an implementation of their approach, producing a proof-generating compiler in ML for the example translation scenario. The compiler leverages Isabelle/HOL for verification, and the implementation showcases different proof techniques. Future work plans include applying the approach to more complex programming languages, improving proof checking support, and optimizing the compiler's performance.
