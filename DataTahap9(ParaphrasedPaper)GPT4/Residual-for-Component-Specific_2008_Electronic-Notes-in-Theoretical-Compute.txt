In this research paper, the authors tackle the challenge of effectively reusing software components by introducing a mathematical operation called the quotient operation. The purpose of the operation is to calculate the supplementary specifications needed when a given component is combined with other elements to meet the desired system behavior. By using modal and acceptance specifications to describe component behaviors, the appropriate quotient operation can be performed even when the integration involves complex interactions, such as the mixing of products and the internal handling of events within system components.

The authors offer a detailed review of two specification formalisms, namely modal and acceptance specifications, which are used for defining component interfaces and their corresponding behaviors in a way that can accommodate certain liveness properties. The paper is structured in a logical sequence, with initial concepts laid out in the preliminaries, followed by a formal presentation of modal specifications, and then providing a rigorous definition of residual specifications for component reuse.

The main contribution of the paper is the development of a quotient operation for modal specifications, which facilitates the determination of additional specifications required for behavior compatibility during component integration. The paper further enhances the expressiveness of these specifications by introducing acceptance specifications. Two distinct kinds of component composition are analyzed: synchronous composition and a hybrid approach of mixed product with the internalization of events. The study of these compositions leads to the corresponding specifications for quotient operations.

As a practical demonstration, an example is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed techniques and the adaptability of the quotient operation when using acceptance specifications in the context of both component interfaces and interface automata. Additionally, the paper mentions the potential for future work to continue advancing the field.

In summary, the paper offers a novel method for determining the necessary specifications to ensure that a chosen software component, when integrated into a broader system, will perform as desired. By defining and computing the residual specifications, software designers can more effectively reuse components and thus streamline the development process.
