The academic paper discusses how the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a notable technological trend, transforming numerous aspects of daily life by enabling intelligent and autonomous solutions. IoT technologies are distinctive for their ubiquity, using multiple sensors to bridge physical and virtual entities, which marks a departure from previous technological developments. These sensors are integrated into objects, facilitating machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and connecting countless devices to the internet.

A popular application in the field of computer vision (CV) powered by deep learning (DL) techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is face detection (FD). FD involves identifying the presence of human faces within images or video streams. A specific task within FD is recognizing faces and their characteristics without necessarily pinpointing their precise facial features, although certain attributes, such as eyes, nose, mouth, and face contour, can be used to assist the detection process. The dlib library is commonly used for this purpose.

The paper presents a model known as EBSaaS (Edge-Based Software as a Service), which includes an edge server (ES). This model leverages edge computing (EC), which is positioned between or above physical objects for industrial connectivity. EC facilitates rapid data processing, meeting real-time requirements for business activities, while addressing intelligence, security, and privacy needs.

Within this architecture, an ES is tasked with processing attentiveness analysis and training recognition classifiers. By assigning these responsibilities to the ES, the system can potentially process information more efficiently. The paper details a training and processing pipeline, beginning with the initial training on a face dataset within an edge device (ED). After training, the system can capture images, perform face selection (FS), recognize faces, and analyze attentiveness by sending data to the ES for rapid processing.

The face detection process iterates through several stages, beginning with candidate window selection in the P-Net layer, followed by filtering and refining predictions using nonmaximum suppression (NMS) and bounding box regression. To assess attentiveness, the paper describes an approach of dividing video datasets into images, using dlib to label facial features, and calculating aspect ratios of the eyes and mouth to detect signs of fatigue.

While the ES introduces a minor increase in recognition time, the proposed EBSaaS model is efficient and speedy in comparison to existing models, providing accurate classifications and improving online learning outcomes. It evaluates whether a student is fatigued or focused, with a notable recognition speed. The proposed system aims to advance educational methods by providing educators with a powerful tool to enhance learning experiences and ensure student success.

Additionally, the paper acknowledges that there is still room for improvement in face detection algorithms, even as they attain high accuracy. Future research could aim to refine these algorithms to handle challenging conditions such as occlusions, extreme angles, variable illumination, and demographic diversity, ultimately leading to more accurate and robust models.
