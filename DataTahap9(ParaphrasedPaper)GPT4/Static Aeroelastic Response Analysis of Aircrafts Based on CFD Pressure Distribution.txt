The static aeroelastic problem is pivotal in determining several aspects of an aircraft's performance, including flight loads, lift, drag, control efficiency, trim, static stability, and maneuvering capabilities during steady flight conditions. These factors are particularly critical for high-performance modern aircraft and greatly impact their overall performance and stability, both static and dynamic. Consequently, there is a need for precise and efficient analytical methods during the early and detailed design stages of modern aircraft to accommodate the accelerated design cycles.

The study introduces a novel static aeroelastic analysis method that utilizes CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) pressure distributions and surface elements. By incorporating correction factors to adjust the aerodynamic influence coefficient matrix and applying high-order panel methods based on three-dimensional surface elements, it provides a highly accurate and efficient solution for evaluating the static aeroelastic response. This method effectively integrates the modal approach to enable elastic adjustments.

Data within this study is made non-dimensional based on parameters such as shearing force (mg), bending moment (mgl), twisting moment (mgc), and wingtip vertical displacement (l), where m represents the wing mass, g the acceleration due to gravity, l the reference half-wingspan, and c the reference chord length.

The results indicate that the presented method effectively corrects the aerodynamic force on both the upper and lower surfaces of the wing. The corrected aerodynamic pressure and its distribution closely align with the original CFD results, thereby validating the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed revision method.

Comparing shear force and bending moment distributions along the wingspan, it is evident that for both rigid and elastic cases, the differences in aerodynamic force values and trends between the high-order panel method and the revised high/low-order panel methods (informed by CFD data) are minimal. However, the high-order panel method predicts a slightly higher torsional moment distribution compared to the revised high/low-order methods. The discrepancy is attributed to the rearward shift of the center of pressure on the chord after the CFD data revision, particularly away from the leading edge.
