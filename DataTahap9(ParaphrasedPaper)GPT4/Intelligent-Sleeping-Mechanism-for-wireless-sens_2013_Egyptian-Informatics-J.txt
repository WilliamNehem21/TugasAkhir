In this paper, a new strategy intended to prolong the service life of wireless sensor networks is introduced. Following a literature review in Section 2, the structure of the paper is outlined: Section 3 describes the LEACH-C protocol upon which the new protocol is based; Section 4 introduces the novel LEACH-CS protocol and its operational specifics; Section 5 presents a comparison between LEACH-CS and LEACH-C via simulation outcomes; Section 6 closes with conclusions and avenues for future research.

The authors highlight previous research where the LEACH-CE protocol designated 5% of active nodes as cluster heads and induced 10% of the nodes into a sleep state prior to cluster head selection. Sleep mode nodes neither gather data nor receive cluster head information, as these functions are regulated by a base station which also decides on cluster head appointment. However, this approach randomly selects nodes for sleep mode without ensuring data quality despite its positive effect on network longevity.

Another previous protocol is mentioned, which employs sleep mode by considering factors like energy levels, neighbor count, and average neighborly distances; nodes with ample neighbors and high energy levels are ideal for sleep mode, avoiding energy depletion from data redundancy. Unlike these protocols, the paper introduces an innovative approach by incorporating sensed data into the sleep mode decision process.

Section 3 elaborates on LEACH-CS, a further development of LEACH-C. It lays out the specifics of the network model design, the applied radio model for protocol operation, and comprehensive details of LEACH-CS's functionality.

The LEACH-CS methodology involves the base station collecting energy reports from every node before initiating a new round. Using this information, the nodes are ranked based on their existing energy, leading to the selection of 5% of the surviving nodes to act as that round's cluster headsâ€”a figure deemed optimal for energy-saving purposes according to the research cited.

The paper underscores that unlike previous methods, the LEACH-CS protocol integrates sensory data consideration into the sleep mode process, aiming to both extend network lifespan and maintain data quality.
