The academic paper focuses on the dissemination of emergency safety messages (ESM) across vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Due to the highly dynamic nature of these networks, straightforwad broadcasting, commonly known as flooding, is prone to a phenomenon known as the broadcast storm problem (BSP), which leads to excessive message overhead, increased collisions, and longer dissemination delays. To address BSP and enhance ESM dissemination, the paper critiques existing broadcast storm suppression algorithms (BSSAs), including p-persistence, TLO, VSPB, G-SAB, and SIR. It suggests a new BSSA based on a Selective Epidemic Broadcast (SEB) algorithm that specifically aims to minimize BSP while improving the rate of ESM delivery.

The SEB algorithm is inspired by an epidemic spreading model and aims to selectively broadcast messages to certain vehicles, thus reducing the flood of messages throughout the network. It utilizes passive acknowledgments (P_ACK) from neighbors within the network—referred to as Emergency Broadcast Neighbors (EBN)—to determine which vehicles should propagate the message further, thereby ensuring a directed and efficient spread of the ESM. The SEB's performance is reported to be superior to existing algorithms in metrics like ESM delivery ratio, message overhead, collision ratio, BSP ratio, and redundant rebroadcast ratio, achieving lower dissemination delays.

The SEB's efficacy is demonstrated through simulations using the NS-2 network simulator version 2.34, with comparisons against well-known algorithms according to various performance metrics under different vehicular density and speed scenarios. Nonetheless, the paper acknowledges that SEB may not be suitable for disconnected networks, where the lack of vehicle presence within transmission range could hinder the receipt of passive acknowledgments, suggesting future improvements might include support from roadside units (RSUs) in such scenarios.

Finally, the paper mentions Dr. S. Siva Sathya, an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at Pondicherry University, noting her research interests and contributions to the field.
