The academic paper focuses on various control mechanisms within distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrids (MGs), as well as acknowledging contributions and funding.

Primary control within a distributed energy system is divided into two levels: inner and outer control loops. The inner control loop manages the immediate output of current and voltage from DERs, while the outer droop control loop ensures accurate power distribution among different distributed generators (DGs) and also helps to reduce circulating currents.

Tertiary control is discussed as being responsible for economic dispatch and scheduling operational tasks. It not only coordinates among several interconnected microgrids but also adjusts the contributions of different distributed generators in order to maintain voltage balance at DGs and load buses. The paper highlights a proposed optimal power flow-based tertiary control using model predictive control (MPC), and another approach for tertiary control that employs a centralized Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for managing multiple microgrids.
