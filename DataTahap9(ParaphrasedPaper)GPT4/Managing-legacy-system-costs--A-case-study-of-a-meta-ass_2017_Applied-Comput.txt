In concluding this paper, it's crucial to highlight some key points regarding the meta-model. It's noteworthy that almost all of the individual outcomes from participants with a diverse range of knowledge at FinCo fall within the HBV-LTV quadrant on the decisional matrix. This pattern holds true even when examining the aggregated responses and when considering those aggregated responses without the maintainability section. Therefore, despite the varying levels of technical expertise among those conducting the assessment, the outcome of the meta-model demonstrates a significant level of uniformity.
