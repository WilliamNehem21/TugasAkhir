This paper discusses a specialized topic in cryptography known as secret sharing schemes. In these schemes, a secret (S) is distributed among a set of participants in the form of shares. The collection of all participant groups that are permitted to reconstruct the secret is called the authorized access structure (A), or access structure for short. Individual shares are sometimes called shadows. Members of the access structure are known as the authorized groups.

The paper describes two types of secret sharing schemes â€“ perfect and ideal. In a perfect secret sharing scheme, an unauthorized group learns nothing about the secret, which is quantifiably demonstrated using entropy in information theory. Karnin, Greene, and Hellman have shown that for a scheme to be perfect, the size of each share must be at least as large as the secret itself. This was later expanded by Capocelli, De Santis, Gargano, and Vaccaro to include all perfect secret sharing schemes. An ideal scheme is one where the shares are exactly the same size as the secret.

The paper also references work by Goldreich, Ron, and Sudan, who suggest using prime numbers of equal size to improve secret sharing schemes. Likewise, Quisquater, Preneel, and Vandewalle have demonstrated that choosing consecutive primes for the shares results in schemes that are both asymptotically perfect and ideal.

Furthermore, the paper discusses compartmented secret sharing schemes, denoted as A(c, k), where the set A is made up of subsets c1, c2, ..., cm, called compartments. Each compartment has an associated threshold value (k1, k2, ..., km), and there is a global threshold (k0) necessary for the scheme to work.
