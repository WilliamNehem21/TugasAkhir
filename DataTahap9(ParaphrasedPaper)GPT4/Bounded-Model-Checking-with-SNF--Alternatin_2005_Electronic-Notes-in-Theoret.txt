The paper discusses a representation of automata based on an approach described by Gastin and Oddoux, where the transitions lead from a single state to a set of states connected by a logical "and" (conjunction). Each state in the automaton can have several such transitions, and which one is taken is chosen in a non-deterministic manner. This structure allows representing the set of possible next states as a combination of different "and" connected state sets, essentially creating a logical "or" (disjunction) of these conjunctions for any state's potential future states.
