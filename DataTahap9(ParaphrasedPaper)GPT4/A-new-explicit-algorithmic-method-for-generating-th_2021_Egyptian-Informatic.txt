The realm of number theory is increasingly pivotal in disciplines such as computer science and cryptography, with prime numbers being a fundamental element. Primes are defined as natural numbers above 1 that only have two distinct positive divisors, 1 and themselves. Non-prime natural numbers exceeding 1 are termed composite.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents a new technique and algorithm for the generation of prime numbers. Section 3 introduces a comprehensive approach that applies the newly suggested method to the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes and the Sieve of Sundaram. The paper concludes with a summarization in Section 4.
