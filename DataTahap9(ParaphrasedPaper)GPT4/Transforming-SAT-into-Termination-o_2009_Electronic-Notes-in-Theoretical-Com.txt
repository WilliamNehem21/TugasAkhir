The academic paper discusses the challenge of determining whether term rewrite systems (TRSs) will terminateâ€”a problem known to be undecidable. However, contemporary algorithms, albeit incomplete, have shown success in proving termination for many TRSs, as evidenced by the results of the international termination competition. In 2004, Kurihara and Kondo pioneered the use of propositional logic to formulate termination methods. This approach was adopted in 2006 by tools such as Jambox and Matchbox in the termination competition, leveraging SAT-solving techniques and achieving significant improvements in efficiency and power, particularly with the matrix method optimized through SAT solvers. 

Even traditional methods like the lexicographic path order (LPO) have benefited from advancements in the SAT-solving community, leading to faster implementations. A similar speed increase applies to the Knuth-Bendix order (KBO), which is notable since KBO orientation can be decided in polynomial time, while SAT is an NP-complete problem. This indicates that the sophisticated algorithms for the more challenging SAT problem are outperforming dedicated methods for the KBO.

The paper explores whether translating the NP-complete SAT problem into the undecidable termination property of TRSs yields a comparable result. The experiments suggest that dedicated SAT methods outperform the translations in terms of effectiveness. Furthermore, only the simplest propositional formulas generate terminable TRSs when assessed by cutting-edge termination provers. Thus, the translation methods serve as a means to automatically produce a large set of challenging termination problems.
