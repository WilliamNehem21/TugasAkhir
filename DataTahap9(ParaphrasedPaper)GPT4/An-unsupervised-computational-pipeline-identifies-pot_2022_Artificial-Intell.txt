This academic paper discusses a systematic approach to identify promising drug candidates for treating diseases by examining how drugs alter the expression levels of genes that are disrupted in those diseases. The paper describes the use of an inverted gene set enrichment analysis (IGSEA) to analyze drug-induced expression profiles from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) dataset. This analysis identifies drugs that might restore normal gene function based on their ability to counteract the gene expression changes associated with a disease.

In the study, the researchers calculated normalized enrichment scores and p-values for each drug's effect on disease-related genes, assessing both the degree to which the drugs targeted these genes and the statistical significance of their effects. The p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control false discovery rates (FDR).

The paper also examines how two drugs might interact based on their targets within the human protein-protein interaction network, either through an overlapping (similar functionality) or complementary (distinct functionality) mode of action.

Results for Huntington's disease (HD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are presented, and drugs are characterized by their impact on disease-associated gene expression. The analysis identified 843 drugs with significant enrichment for HD and 600 for MS. However, the authors note that only a small fraction of candidate drugs has data available in the LINCS database, which limits the scope of their analysis.

Additionally, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of several drugs, such as selisistat for HD, are discussed in light of their impact on disease-related gene expression.

The researchers acknowledge limitations in the study, such as incomplete characterization of all drugs and human proteins and the challenges in constructing accurate drug-disease networks, noting that the quantity of research on a given drug can bias the associations made rather than reflect its actual biological interactions.

Ultimately, the study highlights a computational framework for identifying drug repurposing opportunities as well as potential drug combinations for treating HD and MS. The authors identify 138 possible drugs for HD and 38 for MS, providing a basis for prioritizing which combinations to explore further. While the findings are preliminary and must be experimentally validated, they offer insights that might improve the treatment strategies for HD and MS.
