The paper revisits and refines an integration of structural operational semantics (SOS) using a bialgebraic approach with coalgebraic modal logic. It presents two main enhancements: firstly, a more abstract and conceptual proof of the key compositionality theorem, using modal logic to analyze coalgebras within slice categories derived from adjunctions. Secondly, it provides a clearer interpretation of the theorem's assumptions, suggesting that proving compositionality entails identifying a syntactic distributive law that interacts with predicate liftings.

The study considers the creation of coherent transition systems from SOS specifications through coalgebras in the bialgebraic context. Previously, a prominent SOS format known as GSOS was interpreted as a form of distributive laws between behavior and syntax endofunctors, explaining how LTS bisimilarity for GSOS-induced systems is compositional at this level of abstraction.

The authors address previous shortcomings related to the mathematical elegance and practical applicability of their work, noting that the original proof of compositionality was convoluted and the distributive laws provided did not offer an intuitive grasp of coalgebraic behavior for logic formulas. The difficulty of finding appropriate behavior functors and verifying potential logical distributive laws was also highlighted as these tasks required intensive computation.

The current paper aims to mitigate these issues by offering a more general and abstract proof of the compositionality theorem. This is achieved by viewing the application of modal logic to coalgebras as a functor to a slice category of an adjunction. The paper argues that the compositionality theorem results from elevating this functor to encompass structures that include process syntax, through an adjoint lifting theorem.

The paper is structured with an overview of the bialgebraic approach to SOS and coalgebraic modal logic, followed by a study of endofunctors, algebras, and coalgebras in slice categories of adjunctions; this culminates in the proof of the main theorem. It then offers a concrete interpretation of the theorem in relation to predicate liftings. Lastly, the paper acknowledges that some of the previous issues persist and relegates certain proofs to an appendix. While the focus is on compositionality and SOS, the paper may also interest readers who are more focused on the interpretation of coalgebraic modal logic within the context of slice categories and adjunctions.
