This study seeks to improve the recognition of non-destructive testing (NDT) signals for guided wave inspection by utilizing an advanced algorithmic approach. By implementing an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) method in conjunction with a Modified Evolutionary Programming (MEP) algorithm that leverages a t-distribution (MTEP), the authors aim to lower computational complexity and enhance signal reconstruction quality. When inspecting a pipe containing defects, the use of OMP with MTEP resulted in clearer recognition of echo signals, improved reconstruction quality, and reduced processing time compared to traditional methods. The new approach is considered beneficial for identifying features in guided wave NDT signals.

The paper outlines the challenge of interpreting guided wave NDT signals due to their dispersion and multiple modes. Existing Matching Pursuit (MP) techniques, while useful for processing various types of signals, struggle with numerical implementation because of the extensive iterations required. Evolutionary Programming (EP), an optimization algorithm, offers a global search capability superior to GA-based methods but still requires numerous iterations due to its fixed step size.

To address these challenges, the authors propose a modified version of EP that selects mutations based on a t-distribution and employs chirplet functions as matching atoms within the OMP algorithm. The OMP process differs from MP by orthogonally organizing the selected atoms according to Gram-Schmidt rules, enabling the calculation of weights for the signal and its residual. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met.

The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the OMP combined with MTEP by inspecting a pipe with hole defects and processing the obtained guided wave signals. The improved results, when compared to OMP with traditional EP (TEP), exhibit that the enhanced method can reconstruct signals more effectively, in shorter computation times, and with greater clarity in detecting defect echo signals, positioning it as a valuable advancement for signal recognition in guided wave NDT applications.
