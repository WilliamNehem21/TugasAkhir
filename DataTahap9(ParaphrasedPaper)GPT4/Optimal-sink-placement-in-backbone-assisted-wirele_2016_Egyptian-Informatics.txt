This article proposes a novel approach to decide on the ideal placement of the sink (or base station) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that use a backbone structure for communication. Traditional methods position the base station either in the geographic center or randomly at the edge of the area of interest. Instead, the new strategy situates the base station at the graph theoretic center or the centroid of the backbone, which links the nodes spread out across the area of interest. This positioning is suggested to significantly improve network performance by reducing the total number of hops required for data packets to reach the sink, resulting in improved energy efficiency and reduced communication delays.

Prior work on WSN backbone structures has leveraged various topologies and routing protocols aiming to optimize energy usage, network load, response time, and overall network longevity. Trees, especially, have been popular in structuring such networks. However, these studies have not fully explored the impact of sink placement on network performance metrics, such as delay, load, and energy consumption, particularly in tree-based networks.

The research goes beyond deterministic and random sink deployment strategies and emphasizes the importance of sink location in relation to delay reduction and energy conservation. It suggests that careful sink placement can minimize network congestion and extend the lifespan of a WSN.

The paper also examines typical WSN designs where messages are routed towards a sink that is usually at the root of the tree. This conventional strategy, however, is susceptible to bottleneck issues and network failure if the node closest to the sink fails. Utilizing a graph-based topology enables flexible routing and diverse sink placements, which might not be possible due to physical constraints like obstacles or range limitations.

The findings of this study indicate that placing the sink at the graph centroid or theoretical center is superior in terms of reducing network delay and energy consumption, ensuring minimal transmission hops, and leading to a more efficient and longer-lived network. While the work is supported by simulations involving a small number of nodes, future research could expand upon these results by exploring larger, more densely deployed networks and considering mobile elements.
