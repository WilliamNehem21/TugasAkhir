This academic paper discusses the use of Terahertz (THz) imaging technology, which is non-ionizing with minimal side effects on humans. It is highly absorbed in water and reflects well off metals, and serves various applications, including medicine and security. However, THz imaging often suffers from low resolution due to weak power sources, leading to blurred, noisy images that require efficient defect recognition methods.

Several solutions are presented to improve the quality and resolution of THz images. For instance, a Dual-Graph Attention Convolution Network (DGACN) was proposed by Xie L. and colleagues, as well as a Convolutional Siamese Point Net (CSPN) by the same team for point cloud registration, incorporating feature extraction and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Yin M. et al. presented a Deep Feature Interaction Network (DFINet) to enhance feature extraction between two point clouds.

Other researchers have used different techniques, such as Liu et al., who applied a square even-order derivative method for thermal defect detection in vehicle cables, and Liu et al. developed a 2D/3D image registration for image-guided surgery. Zhou et al. combined Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning and other methods for automated ore classification in the mining industry.

This paper also highlights an alternative approach: using a differential evolution search algorithm for optimization. It utilizes a ResNet-50 backbone within a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for feature extraction. Object detection is performed via two-stage, proposal-driven mechanisms (like Faster R-CNN) or one-stage detectors such as SSD and YOLO.

The study involved a dataset of THz images collected with a linear scan machine, later augmented to improve model performance. It was found that using data augmentation improved the average precision and recall. YOLOv3 was chosen for its industry-wide adoption and compatibility, despite the emergence of newer models like YOLOv4 and YOLOv5.

Moreover, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was used to reconstruct blurred images by generating synthetic clear-blurred image pairs. This research demonstrates the potential for improved THz image processing and defect detection using advanced machine learning techniques and model optimizations.
