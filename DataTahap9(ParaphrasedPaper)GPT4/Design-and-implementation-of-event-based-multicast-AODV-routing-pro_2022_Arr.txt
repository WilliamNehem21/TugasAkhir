When a mobile device wants to join a specific multicast group but lacks information about the route, it initiates a process by creating a 'route query packet'. This packet carries a 'join' flag set to 1 and includes the multicast group's address. The mobile node then broadcasts this packet to nearby nodes. However, if the node already possesses the required route information, it can bypass this packet creation and broadcasting step.

The multicast version of the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is designed to efficiently handle the dynamic nature of mobile networks, where resource constraints and changing network topologies are common. By adapting quickly to these conditions, the multicast AODV minimizes network traffic and processing demands.

This protocol builds bidirectional, dynamic multicast trees that effectively link the multicast source with its intended receivers. There are four key message types used within the multicast AODV routing protocol to facilitate this process.
