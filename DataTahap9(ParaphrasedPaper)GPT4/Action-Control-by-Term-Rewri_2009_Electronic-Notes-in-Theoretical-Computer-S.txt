This section provides an overview of foundational concepts in term rewriting systems, which will be referenced throughout the paper. For comprehensive background information, readers are directed elsewhere. The signature \( \mathcal{F} \) comprises a finite collection of function symbols, each with a specified arity.

The notation \( X \) stands for an infinite set of variables, such as \( X_1, X_2, ... \). The notation \( T(\mathcal{F}, X) \) represents the set of terms that can be constructed using \( \mathcal{F} \) and \( X \). Terms can be equated to finite labeled trees, with the function symbol at a term's root signified by \( \text{root}(t) \). Locations within terms are denoted by sequences of positive integers, and a specific subterm of term \( t \) at a location \( p \) is indicated by \( t|_p \). Replacing subterm \( t|_p \) in \( t \) at position \( p \) with a term \( u \) is shown as \( t[u]_p \).

The paper also discusses group dynamics and how various ethos, such as competitiveness or altruism, can be modeled within the presented framework. It introduces the concept of empowerment theories, outlined with examples EMPM1 through EMPM4, which convey the idea of maximizing satisfaction for collective members M1 to M4.

Furthermore, each agent \( M \) within the collective is assigned an AUTH theory, which contains rules determining whether \( M \) authorizes a client \( C \) to perform action \( A \) on a resource \( R \), contingent upon whether \( M \) is in F-mode or C-mode. This authorization may adhere to any standard access control model, such as a role-based one, although the paper does not delve into specific access control model details, directing readers to existing literature for more information.

Lastly, the paper acknowledges that termination and confluence in term rewriting systems are generally undecidable. However, it mentions substantial research providing decidable conditions for ensuring these properties. Notably, orthogonal systems are highlighted for their confluence, while systems with primitive recursive schemes are referenced for their termination properties. Such conditions are employed to derive sufficient criteria for ensuring totality and confluence in access control policies, a technique similarly applicable to action control policies.
