The researchers have developed Bioscape, a concurrent computational language designed for the stochastic simulation of biological and biomaterial processes within a 3D reactive environment. It builds upon the stochastic pi-calculus and aims to model individual-based, continuous movement within continuous space, which is crucial to accurately simulating complex interactions between bacteria and materials, like those in infection-resistant medical implant drug delivery systems. By using Bioscape, researchers hope to better understand how to identify biological targets and materials strategies to combat infections associated with biomaterials.

This work is necessary because, despite a thorough understanding of how tissue cells react to biomaterial surfaces, the effects of these surfaces on bacterial interactions remain less explored. These interactions are essential to consider as Biomaterials-Associated Infections (BAI) pose substantial challenges in clinical settings. Currently, efforts to reduce BAI focus on developing antimicrobial or antifouling coatings for biomedical devices.

Bioscape introduces unique features beyond conventional reaction operations like send, receive, and delay. It incorporates a geometric operation, move, which differs from reaction operations by always being enabled and not being stochastic. To ensure reactions and geometric operations do not unfairly compete, the language uses two types of reduction relations and a choice operator that can choose between probabilistic and non-deterministic paths.

Bioscape defines bacterial motion using parameters such as movement space, step size, and shape, which describe the allowable movement areas, step lengths, and bacterial shapes. Cell division is represented by a mitosis operation, where a delay indicates that division is not instantaneous.

While Bioscape does not directly model overcrowding, it proposes mechanisms that could be introduced into simulations to handle such conditions. These could be external signaling molecules that inhibit cell division when cells detect nearby neighbors, or modifications to the language that prevent actions leading to overcrowding when sufficient movement steps fail.

Finally, Bioscape is contrasted with the Shape Calculus, another process calculus with similar goals. Bioscape extends capabilities with stochastic elements, dynamic creation of channels, and the use of affine transformations to model growth, while Shape Calculus uses fixed velocity vectors for movement and does not inherently model areas of allowance for agents, as Bioscape does. This capability is important for creating models that simulate the behavior of materials, like antibacterial surfaces, and their interaction with bacterial agents.

In summary, Bioscape stands out by providing more dynamic, realistic, and flexible modeling of complex biological and biomaterial systems compared to existing simulation languages.
