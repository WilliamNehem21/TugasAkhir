This paper articulates that within the area of coalgebras typically defined using an endofunctor T on the category of sets, modal logics associated with T-coalgebras can be effectively described by functors L on Boolean algebras. By adopting this viewpoint, the paper investigates how coalgebraic logics can be characterized in terms of soundness, completeness, and expressiveness using duality theory.

The research establishes a method for providing an algebraic semantics for a given logic L tailored to coalgebras of the endofunctor T, by constructing an endofunctor L*. When L and L* demonstrate a duality relationship, the soundness and completeness of the algebraic semantics directly infer the equivalent properties for the coalgebraic semantics. The study offers a set of axioms that define the duality between L and T, presenting a concrete approach to verify that specific logics have these desired properties.

The paper also acknowledges that coalgebras are widely recognized as models for diverse state-based systems, acting as a call to action for a unified logical framework capable of describing and analyzing system properties. Building on previous work, it explores the connections between coalgebras and descriptive general frames, specifically considering coalgebras on the category of sets and on Stone spaces.

The authors choose to simultaneously develop their theoretical framework for coalgebras over both sets and Stone spaces. They achieve this by using a functor which maps objects in the base category to Boolean algebras. Specifically, they look at the contravariant power set functor in the case of sets. They lay out the foundations for the duality approach, comparing it to related work on duality between descriptive general frames and Boolean algebras with operators.

Finally, the paper includes a technical note clarifying that their definition for order-preserving and â€“reflecting sets of axioms is more constrained than in previous literature. They indicate that their approach is focused on maps with Boolean preorders as domains, yet argue that their framework can still support the proof strategies used for establishing soundness and completeness in earlier research.
