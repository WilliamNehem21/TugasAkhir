Current permutation analysis techniques for inference rules are tailored to specific rule sets, but there are cases where these techniques fall short. In particular, the use of active and principal formula concepts sometimes fails to capture all possible permutations.

The concept of a strong permutation position focuses on analyzing potential rule permutations within a specific proof, considering the given instances of an inference rule. This approach helps to better understand the permutability of rules in a concrete setting.

In a given proof, permuting an inference rule doesn't affect its active, quasi-active, principal, or extra components. However, its context may change, and these potential changes are described in detail.

Theorem 4.7 states that removing redundant steps before any other proof transformation ensures that permuting a strong additive rule over a unary rule only results in a specific type of permutation outcome.

Success in proof searching goes beyond just finding a proof; it involves gaining a deeper understanding of provability, optimizing the proof search process, and removing irrelevant parts of a constructive proof that don't affect the actual computation.

The authors offer a brief and informal description of their approach for a subset of linear logic that excludes contraction and binary additive rules. However, these rules can be integrated without significant difficulty. The focus is on identifying and eliminating unused formulae that only appear in the succedent.
