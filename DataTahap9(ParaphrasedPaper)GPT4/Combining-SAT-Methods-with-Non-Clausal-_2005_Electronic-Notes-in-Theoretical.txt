An academic paper suggests that a strategy for solving complex first-order logic formulas can effectively combine traditional propositional SAT solver techniques with specialized non-clausal heuristics designed for first-order logic. These complementary methods have the potential to result in more efficient decision-making compared to each approach used independently.

When dealing with large, complex formulas, the paper emphasizes the importance of the propositional search tree's size on performance, noting that SAT solver heuristics and advanced search algorithms are crucial for efficiency. By integrating such SAT solver methods with non-clausal heuristics tailored for first-order logic, fewer decisions are necessary to resolve a given formula.

The text outlines the structure of the paper: Section 2 reviews standard propositional satisfiability methods and introduces some non-clausal search heuristics. Section 3 describes how these varied approaches have been combined in an implementation. Section 4 provides data and results from testing this implementation using CVC Lite, which is a decision procedure that supports multiple theories without quantifiers and is capable of producing proofs.

In applying the DPLL algorithm to first-order logic, the paper discusses tweaking the process by replacing variable assignments with first-order assumptions. This technique allows the first-order decision procedure to analyze partial assignments earlier, potentially recognizing infeasible paths sooner than traditional methods.

Several decision procedures are compared, such as CVC Lite, which generates conflict clauses based on proof assumptions, ICS, which optimizes by eliminating irrelevant literals without entirely tracking assumptions, and VeriFun, which follows a middle path.

A key challenge for the DPLL algorithm is the selection of "splitters," which determine the branching of the decision tree. The choice of splitters is crucial as a smart selection can significantly reduce the search space. SAT solvers like Chaff use heuristics that may not perform optimally on non-clausal formulas. Utilizing the structure of such non-CNF formulas can potentially guide the search to more effective splitter selections.

The paper highlights the risk of using ineffective splitters, especially for larger sub-problems, where a poor choice can result in much additional work. Caching heuristics are discussed as a technique for splitter selection, involving the ordering of cache splitters by recency and trust metrics to avoid poor choices. This strategy is somewhat conservative and relies on a fallback to a DFS heuristic when no suitable splitter is cached.

The final insights include the fact that direct propagation of 'and' expressions, which is more efficient than Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP) on translated CNF formulas, may not significantly affect results due to the higher cost of the first-order decision procedure.

Overall, using both fast search with CNF clauses and a caching heuristic together yields a more efficient outcome in terms of decision numbers than using either method alone. However, the combination may result in slightly higher overall processing time compared to using the caching heuristic by itself.
