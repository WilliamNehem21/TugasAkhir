This academic paper addresses the correlation between adherence to coding standards and the quality of software artifacts, especially within the open-source software (OSS) community. It presents an empirical analysis of projects hosted on the KDE and SourceForge platforms to investigate if the presence of coding standards in KDE leads to higher quality software than the more autonomous environment of SourceForge, which lacks formal standard enforcement.

The paper is structured with a review of existing research, the definition of key terms, the formulation of the research question using the Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach, and the presentation of hypotheses. It employs software quality characteristics such as complexity, reliability, and maintainability, focusing on development and design quality metrics as indicators of quality.

Specific KDE projects are encouraged to adopt the KDElibs coding style, which is supported by tools like a vim script to help maintain consistency. Additionally, KDE utilizes an automated quality assurance tool called the English Breakfast Network (EBN) to measure code quality. The paper investigates structural software complexity using McCabe's cyclomatic complexity and evaluates coupling through fan-in and fan-out metrics.

The key research question probes whether there is a statistically significant difference between KDE and SourceForge projects in terms of software complexity and quality due to coding standards. The paper analyzes the latest code changes in each project's repository, summarizing metrics such as median, maximum, and variance of complexity and coupling values for comparison.

The study aims to determine if KDE's approach to quality assurance and coding standards leads to less complex, higher-quality software compared to SourceForge's approach that does not enforce any coding standards.
