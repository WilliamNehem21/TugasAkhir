In this paper, we expand upon earlier findings that established the optimal number of replicas required for serving specific transactional workloads in open systems. Here, we derive similar findings for closed systems and utilize relationships from the prior work, along with new ones, to deduce analytical relationships that demonstrate how the response time behaves as the number of replicas increases towards infinity. The discovery of these relationships allows us to develop control policies for certain metrics while simultaneously maintaining constraints on others. For instance, ensuring the average response time of a system stays under 5 seconds could also guarantee that the response time at the bottleneck resource remains below 3.5 seconds. This means that, by monitoring a conveniently measurable metric, we can infer if another related metric crosses its threshold, thereby controlling several metrics by managing just one.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related research on model analysis and optimization in cloud environments. Section 3 examines the response time metric and how many replicas are needed to meet constraints. Sections 4 and 5 investigate the asymptotic behavior of performance indexes related to replica numbers in both open and closed models, respectively. Experimental proof is provided in Section 6, and the paper concludes with Section 7.

The replication of resources has gained renewed interest due to its implications for virtualization and cloud computing. The ability to provision virtual machines (VMs) has made replication, either static or dynamic, an efficient method for achieving performance targets without significant over-provisioning. The unpredictability introduced by cloud computing complicates model-based analysis and requires additional considerations, such as the impact of different VM manager allocation policies on CPU and I/O performance.

The current section also deduces relationships between system response time and both class and resource aggregated residence time for a closed model. Various scenarios are examined based on workload type and system homogeneity. The replication process inevitably duplicates the bottleneck resource, causing the system to evolve into a state where all demands are similar.

We use a single-resource queuing network model, which can be replicated multiple times and handle different actions for diverse applications. Applications are modeled by job classes, with the data handled by each action representing the class's population.

To validate our assertions, we collect response time data from a benchmark application using varying node counts. We then calculate the mean job demand and compare our findings with those obtained using the MVA algorithm.

We show that performance goals set based on various metrics are interrelated; replicating services to lower a specific metric also impacts other performance indices. Relationships among these indices can be leveraged to design intelligent control policies that can achieve multiple performance objectives by adjusting a single variable. The relationships between system response time, per-class response time, and per-resource residence time have been explored as the number of replicas approaches infinity, through both open and closed queuing network models.

Future research will explore relations among different metrics such as utilization and queue length, complete the analytical computation of the optimal number of replicas for multi-class closed models, and define, test, and validate dynamic replication policies that apply the results presented in this paper.
