In geophysics, acquiring labeled data can be cost-prohibitive, leading to a challenge of limited sample availability. Researchers have been addressing this scarcity by incorporating constraints into artificial neural network (ANN) inversion frameworks to enhance the ability of the network to generalize. Specific approaches include using initial model constraints within the ANN framework and combining data-driven techniques with a physics-guided convolutional neural network (CNN). Song et al. (2022) introduced an inversion framework that utilizes semi-supervised learning methods. In our study, we adopt a different ANN learning structure referred to as Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aimed at achieving high-resolution inversion of reservoir parameters from pre-stack seismic data.
