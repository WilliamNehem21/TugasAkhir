The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of mutual information (MI), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and associated studies. Section 3 introduces the new MRMJR-KCCA method, along with details on how it is implemented. The experiments and their outcomes, along with a discussion, are detailed in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

The paper evaluates the MRMJR-KCCA method using two prominent machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), chosen for their strong track record in classification scenarios. Optimal SVM parameters (gamma and C) and the ideal number of trees for the RF are determined through a 10-fold cross-validation process. The average accuracy is calculated based on 10 separate tests. Additionally, the effectiveness of MRMJR-KCCA is compared to other widely used feature selection methods discussed earlier in Section 1.
