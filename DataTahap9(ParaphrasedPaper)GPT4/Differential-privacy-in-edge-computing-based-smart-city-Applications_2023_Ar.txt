The paper provides an extensive examination of differential privacy (DP) within edge computing for smart city applications, addressing privacy in data transmission, processing, model training, publishing, and location aspects. It delves into potential DP applications in smart city contexts and envisages future directions for DP within edge computing, serving as a guide for both researchers and practitioners.

The study begins by outlining the concept of edge computing, DP definitions, and mechanisms, then reviews typical privacy challenges in smart city applications powered by edge computing. It evaluates the benefits of DP technologies and summarizes DP applications in smart cities, looking at encryption as a key but sometimes impractical privacy measure due to management challenges.

The paper showcases various privacy-preserving methods, such as data disturbance, anonymity, and encryption, and explores DP's role in reducing computational complexity and enhancing data accuracy. It examines the privacy challenges in data transmission and processing within the edge computing setting, suggesting solutions like secure multi-party computing and federated learning frameworks integrating DP.

Researchers suggest a range of DP mechanisms to mitigate noise and improve data utility. For example, the development of improved mechanisms like staircase and stage Laplace mechanisms reduce the noise impact on data queries.

The paper reviews applications of DP in smart city scenarios, emphasizing data privacy in transmitting, processing, model training, and publishing. It highlights the usage of DP in various smart city applications such as smart manufacturing, logistics, and transportation systems, to preserve user privacy during data transmission.

Concerning data processing, the paper discusses data mining and the need for privacy-preserving techniques in this domain. DP applications in model training are also reviewed, including methods like output and objective perturbation to secure training data privacy.

In terms of data publishing, the paper examines differentially private techniques for releasing data while maintaining the utility for tasks like histograms and classification. The discussion then transitions to privacy concerns specific to edge nodes and layers in smart cities, addressing the privacy of edge nodes and proposing DP-enhanced federated learning frameworks as a solution to protect data during model training and sharing.

In summation, the paper acknowledges the critical role of DP in addressing privacy concerns in smart city applications but also recognizes areas where further research is needed, such as optimizing DP parameters for better data utility and tackling untrusted edge devices. The research explores data anomaly detection and data attack defense strategies, points to blockchain technology's potential use, and suggests directions for future research focusing on privacy management and optimal privacy algorithms for resource management.

This comprehensive synthesis of DP in edge computing-based smart city applications suggests that despite some shortcomings, DP is a promising solution to privacy concerns, with the potential to enhance smart city services while protecting individual privacy effectively.
