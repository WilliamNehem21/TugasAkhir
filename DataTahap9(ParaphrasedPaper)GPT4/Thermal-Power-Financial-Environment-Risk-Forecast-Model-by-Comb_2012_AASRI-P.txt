This academic paper discusses the importance of risk management in the thermal power industry, which is a longstanding and established method of electricity generation with inherent advantages. However, the industry faces multiple risks, particularly as it transitions from a monopoly to a competitive market. This shift has introduced challenges such as market instability and security risks related to fluctuations in electricity and raw material prices.

According to China's electric power system planning, the electricity market will eventually become fully open, thereby increasing the interdependence of financial markets and the power industry. This situation leads to unprecedented market risks for participants. Noting financial security as a critical component of industrial safety, there is a pressing need to develop and implement modern financial systems to mitigate these risks.

The paper presents a data forecast model constructed on an RBF neural network using several indicators to assess the financial environment risks in the thermal power industry. To test the model, three indicators—MA5, BIAS6, and PSY12—were used as input vectors. The results showed that a combination of indicators (BIAS6 + MA5 + ASY12) yielded the most accurate predictions, superior to single indicators.

While the study focused on quantitative indicators, it acknowledges that stock movements are influenced by both quantitative and non-quantitative factors, such as macroeconomic policies, regulations, and psychology. Thus, the paper proposes the integration of non-quantitative factors into mathematical models as an avenue for future research to enhance the accuracy of forecasts.
