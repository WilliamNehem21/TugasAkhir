This academic paper discusses a broad spectrum of possible processor implementations, including ones that execute instructions out of order, use speculative execution, and utilize superscalar paradigms. The authors introduce and apply an intermediate model called MOP (Model Of Processor) to abstract and prove the correctness of architectural designs independent of specific microarchitectural details. This theoretical framework allows the researchers to separate proofs related to the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) from those focusing on the microarchitecture (MA), which has the potential to streamline the verification process for multiple designs.

The paper mentions two main rules for updating the Program Counter (PC): the 'PC update' rule, which follows standard ISA procedures, and the 'speculate' rule, which allows for largely unrestricted speculative jumps in PC value based on a branch prediction function.

To validate their approach, the authors produced approximately 400 proof goals, each individually verified using the CVC Lite automated theorem prover. For the microarchitecture (MA), they employed the DLX model, a textbook example processor, and demonstrated that it could be simulated by the MOP model. This simulation was achieved by constructing a sequence of operations (referred to as "chains") and verifying them with CVC Lite. The operations are:
1. Parcel p4 completes and retires after writing back results.
2. Parcel p3 accesses memory.
3. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) calculates results for parcel p2 or computes the address for its memory access.
4. Parcel p1 fetches data from the register file or receives it through forwarding. If itâ€™s a branch instruction, the target and decision to take the branch are computed.
5. A new parcel p' is fetched, and the PC is increased accordingly.
If parcel p1 is a taken branch, the sequence updates to include changing the PC to the computed target, thus halting the fetching of new parcels.

The authors reference Shen and Arvind, pioneers in proving Burch-Dill correctness for abstract out-of-order processors against simple specification machines, using term rewriting systems. This paper goes beyond their work by proving stuttering bisimulation and positioning MOP as an intermediate, rather than final, model that facilitates reasoning about deterministic and more complex processor implementations. 

MOP was specified and validated for a simple load-store architecture, and the correctness of the DLX machine was proven against it. The authors acknowledge that their MOP encompasses more than necessary for validating DLX, as it is aimed at simulating processors with advanced out-of-order execution. Future work will extend the current methods to handle such complexities, refine their verification methodology (currently involving manual decomposition of goals), and examine performance relative to other published methods.
