For classical abstract interpretation, the abstract semantics derived are assured to be accurate. In a quantitative context, however, the abstract semantics that emerge most closely approximate the concrete semantics. This proximity is because of the connection between the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse and the well-known least squares approximation method, as referenced in sources [7, 5].
