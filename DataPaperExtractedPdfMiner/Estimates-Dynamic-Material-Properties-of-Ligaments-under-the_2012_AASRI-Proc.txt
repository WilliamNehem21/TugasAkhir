Abstract 

The  cyclic  mechanical  property  of  ligament  plays  an  important  role  in  biomechanics.  If  the  microstructural  volume 
fractions, orientations, and interactions among components for different ligament types are understood, it is conceivable to 
develop  a  general  ligament  model  that  is  based  on  microstructural  properties.  But  the  cycle  loading  experiment  is  very 
difficult to operate, for convenience we can use the relationship between the complex modulus and relaxation modulus. 
Thus,  in  order  to  characterize  the  comprehensive  viscoelastic  behavior  of  cervical  spine  ligaments  within  their 
physiological range, the mechanical response of three types of human cervical spines: the anterior longitudinal ligament, 
the  posterior  longitudinal  ligament  and  the  ligamentum  flavum  and  a  porcine  posterior  longitudinal  ligament  collagen 
fascicles were simulated using quasi-linear viscoelastic theory model using the data from stress relaxation experiments at 
fast  strain  rate.  A  seven  parameter  model  was  investigated,  which  is  sufficient  to  characterize  the  ligament  dynamic 
material  properties.  Such  model  used  the  instantaneous  elastic  functions  approximated  as  linear  under  fast  strain  rate. 
Dynamic material properties including storage modulus, loss modulus, the dynamic modulus of elasticity and the internal 
damping were investigated by transforming the stress relaxation data into frequency domain by Laplace transformation.

1. Introduction 

Measurement and evaluation of dynamic material properties (storage modulus, loss modulus, the dynamic 
modulus of elasticity |M| and the internal damping tan(cid:303)), especially, the internal damping for biological tissue, 
is not only beneficial to the research on Physiology, Kinematics, Pathology and propagation characteristics of 
ultrasonic beam in tissues, but also is conducive to explain the problem that the heated focus region in high 
intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) diagnosis is shift. 

So far, the quasi-linear viscoelastic(QLV) theory proposed by Fung[1] has been well developed and widely 
adopted for modeling the viscoelastic behavior of ligaments by many laboratories[3-11]. Also some researchers 
have  reported  that  QLV  is  only  appropriate  to  certain  strain  levels[3],  and  some  have  stated  that  QLV  is 
appropriate at fast strain rates [6-8]. However, a limitation exists that the QLV theory is based on a step change 
in  strain  which  is  not  possible  to  perform  experimentally.  Accounting  for  this  limitation(cid:712)it  may  result  in 
regression algorithms that converge poorly and yield nonunique solutions with highly variable constants[9]. In 
order to obtain better approximate solutions, one of the common methods is to use five constants to describe 
the instantaneous elastic response (constants A and B) and reduced relaxation function (constants C, (cid:306)1 , and (cid:306)2) 
on experiments with finite ramp times followed by stress relaxation to equilibrium. Abramowitch SD et al.[10] 
introduced  this  approach  in  goat  femur-medial  collateral  ligament-tibia  tests  with  slow  strains.  Then the 
approach was well developed by Lucas et al.[7,8,11] using seven constants to describe the instantaneous elastic 
response (constants A and B) and reduced relaxation function (constants G1, G2, G3, G4, G(cid:146)) on experiments 
with finite ramp times under both the slow strain rates and the fast strain rates.  

As far as the author knows, there is a lack of published data concerning the cyclic viscoelastic properties of 
ligaments  in  the  current  literature.  Yoganandan  et  al.[12]  determined  that  the  tensile  strength,  stiffness,  and 
energy absorbing capacity of cervical spine anterior longitudinal ligament(ALL) and ligamentum flavum(LF) 
were dependent on the rate of applied loading. The stress-relaxation and hysteresis behavior of the posterior 
longitudinal  ligament(PLL)  and  ALL  were  reported  by  Hukins  et  al.[13].  Yahia  et  al.[14]  investigated  the 
hysteresis,  stress  relaxation  and  stepwise  load  relaxation  behavior  of  human  lumbar  ISL+SSL  ligament 
complexes.  Recently  Troyer  et  al.[15]  studied  the  comprehensive  viscoelastic  characterization  of  the  human 
lower cervical spine ligament using seven constants, including stress relaxation, dynamic mechanical analysis 
(the  storage  modulus,  the  loss  modulus,  the  complex  modulus,  and  the  tan(cid:303)).  However,  the  dynamic 
mechanical  analysis  for  human  cervical  spine  ligaments  using  the  modified  QLV  theory  (seven  constants) 
under fast strain rate has not been investigated. The objective of the presented study is to estimate dynamic 
material  properties  of  ligaments  in  frequency  domain  using  modified  QLV  approach.  We  focus  on  the 
investigation of three types of ligaments and compare them with porcine collagen fascicles under fast strain 
rates.  

2. Structure of Ligament 

Ligaments play an important role in spine biomechanics. Therefore, in order to understand and model spine 
biomechanics accurately, it is requisite to gain a precise understanding of the internal structures of ligaments, 
such  as  connective  tissues,  of  the  body  region  that  is  modeled.  Furthermore,  as  connective  tissues  are 
viscoelastic,  their  properties  must  be  valid  for  the  range  of  simulated  loading  conditions,  including  strain 
magnitude  and  strain  rate.  Ligaments  are  composed  of  varied  amounts  of  the  same  microstructural 
components. Thus, it is conceivable to develop a material model based on the microstructure that can be used 
to  predict  the force  response  of  an  arbitrary  ligament-type  based on  its  microstructural  composition  and  the 
microstructural material behavior. In as early as the nineteenth century, anatomical investigations[16] identified 
human connective tissue to be organized in a hierarchical manner from macroscopic organized structures to

microscopic  molecules.  Kastelic[18]  recognized  the  collagen  fascicle  and  deemed  the  fascicle  as  the 
fundamental  structural  unit  of  tendons.  The  passive  tensile  tissues,  ligament,  are  also  composed  largely  of 
water (60-80%) and collagen, elastin, but contain very little of the ground substance (arranged in parallel with 
a Maxwell element which accounts for the viscoelasticity of the proteoglycans) that give ligament its unique 
mechanical  properties.  To  keep  with  the  functional  role  of  these  tissues,  the  collagen  fibrils  are  organized 
primarily in long strands parallel with the axis of loading. As the Ligament is loaded, the bending angle of the 
crimp structure of the collagen fibers can be seen to reversibly decrease, which indicates that deformation of 
this structure is one source of elasticity. Individual collagen fibrils also display some inherent elasticity, and 
these two features are believed to determine the bulk properties of passive tensile tissues[17].

3. Cyclic mechanical properties 

If a linear viscoelastic material is subjected to harmonic oscillations, the strain will “lag” the stress with a 
lag phase (cid:303) due to internal damping within the material, which is a consequence of the viscous component of 
the  material[19].  The  tangent  of  the  phase  lag  (i.e.,  tan(cid:303))  is  called  the  loss  tangent  and  is  a  measure  of  a 
material’s  internal  damping.  However,  for  viscoelastic  body,  in  the  stable  vibration,  stress  and  strain  meet 
plural type constitutive relation is (cid:305)(t)=E(i(cid:550))(cid:304)(t), where E(i(cid:550)) is the dynamic complex modulus of a material 
which can be expressed as: 

E(i(cid:550))= E1(i(cid:550))+iE2(i(cid:550))=|M|ei(cid:303)                                                                                                                  (1)  

where E1(i(cid:550)) is storage modulus and E2(i(cid:550)) is loss modulus, |M| is elastic modulus, and 

tan(cid:303)=E2(i(cid:550))/ E1(i(cid:550))                                                                                                                                 (2) 

When  a  viscoelastic  body  was  exerted  a  loading  (stress),  the  deformation  (strain)  is  after.  Then  we  keep 
deformation (strain) unchanged, the stress-strain relationship can be expressed as (cid:305)(t) = (cid:304)0G(t), where G(t) is 
the  stress  relaxation  function.  In  the  constitutive  equation  (cid:305)(t)=E(i(cid:550))(cid:304)(t),  if  we  make  (cid:72)(t)  =H(t)(for  t<0, 
H(t)=0;for t=0, H(t)=1/2;and for t>0, H(t)=1), according to the Laplace transform, we can get the relationship 
between the complex modulus and relaxation modulus 

E(i(cid:550))=i(cid:550)G(i(cid:550))                                                                                                                                        (3) 

So  we  can  estimated  the  dynamic  material  properties  of  soft  tissue  indirectly  if  we  get  the  complex 

modulus by measuring the relaxation function. 

4. Modified QLV theory 

For  each  ligament,  the  stress  response,  (cid:305)(t),  was  analyzed  in  terms  of  the  fascicle  elongation  using  a 

hereditary integral for nonlinear displacement-time separable viscoelastic responses[2]:

where G(t) is the reduced relaxation function, (cid:305)e((cid:304)) is the instantaneous elastic stress, (cid:304) is the elongation, t is 
the  time,  and  (cid:543)  is  a  dummy  variable  for  integration.  The  stress  response  during  the  strain  ramp  onset  was

included in this analysis. 

The instantaneous elastic stress[2], (cid:305)e((cid:304)), was approximated as: 

(cid:305)e((cid:304))=A(eB(cid:304)-1)                                                                                                                                         (5) 

where parameters A and B are material constants[2]. 

The reduced relaxation function was expressed as a summed exponential function as follows:

where  G(cid:146)  is  the  long-term  relaxation  parameter  (i.e.,  G(cid:146)=limt(cid:314)(cid:146)G(t)),  and  Gn  is  the  relaxation  parameter 
corresponding to each of the time constant (cid:306)n. The time constants, (cid:306)n, were constrained to decade values and 
Equation (6) was subjected to the constraint G1+G2+G3+G4+G(cid:146)=1[6]. 

It is possible for stress relaxation to occur during the ramping phase because of a finite ramping time exists 
in  the  relaxation  experiments  (versus  an  instantaneous  Heaviside  step  function).  Therefore,  we  can  separate 
equation (5) into ramping and relaxation region, and the parameters were simultaneously fitted to both regions 
using a previously reported procedure [10]. During the ramping region, the ligament was subjected to a constant 
strain  rate  (cid:534)  over  the  times  0<t(cid:148)t0.  The  time  t0  was  determined  by  finding  the  time  associated  with  the 
maximum stress magnitude of the stress versus time. After inputting the relations (cid:304)=(cid:534)t and (cid:152)(cid:304)/(cid:152)(cid:543)=(cid:534) (for 0<t(cid:148)t0), 
finding (cid:152)(cid:305)e((cid:304))/(cid:152)(cid:543), the ramping region of equation (4) was written as:

Firstly we investigate relaxation function under the fast strain rate. The isolated ALL, PLL and LF bone–
ligament–bone  complexes  from  male  and  female  human  cervical  spines  under  fast-rate  deformations  were 
harvested for mechanical testing in Ref [7]. And isolated collagen fascicle segments were removed from seven 
porcine  lumbar  posterior  longitudinal  ligament  (PLL)  bone–ligament–bone  complexes  and  prepared  for 
mechanical testing in Ref [11]. The results of the Ref [7] and [11] indicate that QLV is appropriate for both 
spinal ligaments and isolated collagen fascicles under fast rate deformations. In this study, the time constants, 
(cid:306)n, were the same between the fascicle model and the spinal ligament mode and constrained to decade values 
((cid:306)1 = 1s, (cid:306)2 = 100 ms, (cid:306)3 = 10 ms, (cid:306)4 = 1ms)[7].

In  order  to  compare  the  reduced  relaxation  functions  of  the  collagen  fascicle,  ALL,  PLL,  and  LF,  we 
display curves in Fig. 1. As is shown in Fig. 1, the fascicle and ligament relaxation functions are similar in 
shape and magnitude, although there is a slight divergence in early relaxation behavior. The fascicle fast rate

coefficient  in  this  paper  (G4  =  0.59)  is  smaller  in  magnitude  than  the  average  ALL,  PLL,  and  LF  fast  rate 
relaxation coefficients. Thus, the ligament relaxation functions exhibit a larger decrease in magnitude early in 
the relaxation time history.

Fig. 2. The internal damping tan(cid:303) and the dynamic modulus of elasticity |M| plotted as a function of logarithm of frequency in comparison 
the fascicle mode with the spinal ligament model. The data is same as Fig. 1. (a) tan(cid:303); (b) |M|. 

When the internal damping tan(cid:303) and the elastic modulus |M| are plotted against the frequency f, curves as 
shown in Fig. 2 are obtained. At slower frequencies, damping tan(cid:303) increase slowly with the frequency f, and 
reaches  a  peak  when  the  frequency  f  is  near  100  Hz.  Then  decrease  sharply  and  in  final  the  damping  is 
approximately equal to zero when the frequency is greater than 4500 Hz. Correspondingly, the elastic modulus 
|M| increase all the time with the frequency f and rises dramatically in the neighborhood of 100Hz. And for 
comparison, the storage modulus and loss modulus are shown in Fig. 3. It is obvious that the storage modulus 
and  the  elastic  modulus  |M|  have  the  similar  characteristics  with  the  increase  of  frequency.  Also  internal 
damping tan(cid:303) and the loss modulus have the same characteristics with the increase of the frequency.

There is a histological difference between the LF and the ALL and PLL. Water makes up about two-thirds 
of  the  weight  of  normal  ligaments,  and  the  remaining  weight  is  primarily  made  up  of  collagen  and  elastin. 
Elastin is mostly known as “linearly” elastic materials, however, collagen is a basic structural element for soft 
and hard tissues in animals[2].The elastin to collagen ratio for the LF is 2:1[20]. The dry weights of elastin and 
collagen in the cervical spine PLL are only approximately 5.9% and 67.1% respectively (giving a 1:11 elastin

to collagen ratio)[21], which is similar to the ALL. The cyclic mechanical property of the ligaments is likely to 
be affected by the differences in elastin and collagen composition. Fig. 2 shows that, for LF, the amplitude of 
internal damping tan(cid:303) is lower than the cervical spine PLL and ALL; the similar shape of frequency spectrum 
with  respect  to  internal  damping  tan(cid:303)  for  cervical  spine  PLL  and  ALL  is  different  from  LF.  Moreover,  the 
amplitude  of  internal  damping  for  the  fascicle  is  lower  than  that  of  ALL  and  PLL  although  the  shape  of 
frequency spectrum curves is same for the fascicle, ALL and PLL. One of the important reasons is that the dry 
weights of ground substance (Proteoglycans) and collagen in the cervical spine PLL are only approximately 
20%~30% and 67.1% respectively, and viscous damping of ground substance is stronger. One factor for these 
difference  may  be  the  large  (orders  of  magnitude)  difference  in  ramp  times  and  relaxation  holding  times  – 
both  of  which  were  extremely  short  for  this  study,  emphasizing  fast  strain-rate  behavior  compared  with  the 
non-injurious time-frames examined previously[22]. 

In these fast-rate deformations, ligament viscoelasticity which is partly due to fluid flow and interactions 
among collagen fascicles and ground substance[23-25] is ignored. Because the comparable collagen fascicle and 
spinal  ligament  relaxation  functions  suggest  that,  at  fast  rate  deformations,  ligament  viscoelasticity  may  be 
attributed more to the intrinsic viscoelastic properties of the collagen fascicle. 

6. Conclusions 

All  ligament  types  and  collagen  fascicle  exhibited  nonlinear  viscoelastic  cyclic  behavior.  Our  study 
supports  the  assertion  that  QLV  is  valid  for  a  ligament  under  fast  stain  rate.  The  storage  modulus,  loss 
modulus,  the  dynamic  modulus  of  elasticity  |M|  and  the  internal  damping  tan(cid:303)  for  all  ligament  types  and 
collagen fascicle are dependent on frequency. All ligament types and collagen fascicle exhibited an increased 
cyclic viscoelastic with response frequencies at slower frequencies; when the frequency f is near 100 Hz, the 
damping  tan(cid:303)  and  loss  modulus  reach  a  peak,  while  the  dynamic  modulus  of  elasticity  |M|  and  the  storage 
modulus show the fastest rise; then all of them diminished viscoelasticity as frequency increased. The ALL, 
PLL and the collagen fascicle exhibited similar damping properties, but the damping of the collagen fascicle is 
lower. However, LF exhibited a different damping characteristic and lower than the ALL and PLL. Overall, 
the LF exhibited a more elastic response than the ALL and PLL. It is interesting work to compare the dynamic 
material properties in the present paper with that of a ligament model under slow strain rate. This is the subject 
of our ongoing research.
