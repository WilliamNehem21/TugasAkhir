Pharmacovigilance 

The objective of this article is to review the application of informatics-driven approaches in the pharmacovigilance 
ﬁeld with focus on drug-drug interaction (DDI) safety signal discovery using various data sources. Signal can be a 
new safety information or new aspect to already known adverse drug reaction which is possibly causally related 
to a medication/medications that warrants further investigation to accept or refute. Signals can be detected 
from diﬀerent data sources such as spontaneous reporting system, scientiﬁc literature, biomedical databases and 
electronic health records. This review is substantiated based on the fact that DDIs are contributing to a public 
health problem represented in 6-30% adverse drug event occurrences. In this article, we review informatics- 
driven approaches applied by authors focusing on DDI signal detection using diﬀerent data sources. The aim 
of this article is not to laboriously survey all PV literature. As an alternative, we discussed informatics-driven 
methods used to discover DDI signals and various data sources reinforced with instances of studies from PV 
literature. The adoption of informatics-driven approaches can complement and optimize the practice of safety 
signal detection. However, further researches should be carried out to evaluate the eﬃciency of those approaches 
and to address the limitations of external validation, implementation and adoption in real clinical environments 
and by the regulatory bodies. 

1. Introduction 

1.1. Pharmacovigilance background 

Drug safety monitoring identiﬁed as Pharmacovigilance (PV) is for- 
mally deﬁned by the “World Health Organization (WHO) ” as “the sci- 
ence and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understand- 
ing and prevention of drug-related problems ” [1] . PV may be classiﬁed 
into two categories: (1) preauthorization PV concerning the informa- 
tion adverse drug events accumulated from clinical trial settings (phase 
0/I through phase III) [2] ; and (2) postmarketing/post-authorization PV 
concerning the safety information collected during post-authorization 
life cycle. Even though pre-authorization clinical studies (i.e. RCTs) are 
deliberated as the lineament of explaining a drug eﬃcacy, they don’t 
usually detect whole safety concerns of a certain drug before its use 
in the real world due to well-known limitations. Those limitations can 
be summarized in the restricted sample of trial participants involved in

those studies compared to the total targeted population who may experi- 
ence the drug whenever marketed, the limited interval of drug exposure 
per each study participant especially if the drug projected for chronic 
use, lack of possibly risky patient subpopulations who are usually omit- 
ted from clinical trials (e.g., patients with impaired organs, elderly pa- 
tients, children, and childbearing woman who may be pregnant or lac- 
tating mother, patients on chemotherapy) [3] . Furthermore, RCTs can’t 
detect rare/very rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (with occurrences 
of 1/10000 and 1/100000, respectively) or latent ADRs ( > 6 months) 
[4] . That said, the drug eﬃcacy information from premarketing RCTs 
is generally more comprehensive and reliable, whereas complete safety 
proﬁles can’t be established [4] . These boundaries impose obligations of 
both marketing authorization holders and regularity authorities to con- 
tinuously monitor, collect, assess, and draw conclusions and appropriate 
actions to keep positive beneﬁt-risk ratio as long as the drug exists in 
market.

1.2. Drug-drug interaction detection 

One of the leading causes of global morbidities and treatment failure 
is interaction between drug agents. About 30% of unexpected adverse 
drug events may be accounted for Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) [5] . In 
acknowledgment of adverse drug eﬀects is a chief reason of product at- 
trition in late stages of the drug development cycle, the earlier detection 
of the interaction proﬁles of novel drug candidates is still intractable. 
In conventional drug development process, many of candidates of novel 
therapeutics are investigated afore triaging a slight quantity of eligi- 
ble molecules, ordinarily depends on prior scientists’ experience in the 
therapeutic domain and are nominated for subsequent laboratory and 
preclinical testing. Regular drug discovery process includes the delivery 
of new candidates from basic medicinal scientists into testing in pre- 
clinical phases followed by a conduction of diﬀerent clinical trials. Un- 
predictable drug interactions may result in serious health outcomes and 
consequently undesirable inﬂuences on the whole drug discovery pro- 
gression. Accordingly, an increasing demand for developing informatics- 
based frameworks to discover safety comprehension in terms of clini- 
cal practice and originate DDIs of novel therapeutic nominees earlier 
in drug development through multidisciplinary linking between clinical 
and preclinical information. [6] . 

Additionally,  premarketing  clinical  studies  don’t  usually  explore 
DDIs but rather emphasize on investigating the eﬃcacy and safety of 
individual medications [7] . Since patients on polypharmacy are not usu- 
ally included in clinical trials. Furthermore, whenever DDIs are doubted, 
sampling biases and cohort sizes bound the capability for identifying 
rare adverse reactions [8] . Interactions between drugs may take place 
when sharing the same target proteins, pharmacological and metabolic 
pathways leading to aﬀecting the safety and/or eﬃcacy proﬁle of phar- 
maceutical products. In other means, the co-administration may consid- 
erably aﬀect the eﬃcacy and/or safety proﬁles of a drug agent. Un- 
predictable DDIs are recognized only through signal detection prac- 
tices and postmarketing life cycle [9] . The magnitude of a DDI seri- 
ousness warrants diﬀerent regulatory actions grading from label infor- 
mation changes into market withdrawals [10–12] . Due to the limita- 
tions and diﬃculties in monitoring interaction proﬁles of drugs, mul- 
tiple informatics-based researches have been emerged in recent years 
for DDI discovery via adopting machine learning (ML) and data mining 
methods from heterogeneous data sources. 

DDIs can be classiﬁed by various criteria. With regard to severity , 
interactions are frequently characterized by three categories according 
to severity into (minor, moderate and major) [13] . Those interactions 
having minimal clinical consequences and minimal risk are classiﬁed as 
minor DDIs. Moderate DDI is with moderate clinical signiﬁcance, usu- 
ally avoid these combinations and they may be used only under special 
circumstances with closer monitoring and may require dosage changes. 
Major DDI is with high clinical signiﬁcance probably leading to seri- 
ous clinical outcomes should be averted due to negative beneﬁt-risk 
ratios. 

In terms of mechanism , DDIs are classiﬁed as either pharmacody- 
namic (PD) or pharmacokinetic (PK) [ 14 ]. It is noteworthy that PD –
based DDIs make up a smaller class than PK-based DDIs. A Pharmaco- 
dynamic (PD) interaction occurs when the pharmacological eﬀect of a 
drug is aﬀected by another as a result of: 1) direct eﬀect at target site, 
(2) interference with biological or physiological signaling pathways, re- 
sulting in additive, or antagonistic eﬀects, or synergistic/ indirect phar- 
macologic eﬀect [ 15 ]. Pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction occurs when a 
drug inﬂuences the disposition of another drug in the body by interfering 
its absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination (ADME) proper- 
ties, causing an altered plasma concentration of the ﬁrst drug that may 
lead to detrimental consequences (treatment failure or toxicity). Within 
the pharmacokinetic processes, the metabolism part covers the largest 
[ 16 ]. A recent study [ 17 ] has estimated that the PK-based DDIs occur at 
metabolic level as follows: (i) 64% of PK-related DDIs involve induction 
or inhibition of the hepatic cytochromes that are accountable for medi- 

Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 1 (2021) 100005 

cations metabolism, (ii) while 20% of PK DDIs result from transporters 
and 2% from carriers. 

1.3. The concept of Safety Signal Detection 

According to the WHO, safety signal is deﬁned as “reported in- 
formation on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event 
(AE) and a drug, of which the relationship is unknown or incompletely 
documented previously ” [ 1 ]. The practice of “signal detection ” is typ- 
ically meant for marketed drugs where a safety concern may be new 
in nature not recognized in premarketing phases or a novel pattern of 
already known adverse drug reaction in terms of (severity, high risk 
sub-population, frequency, etc.). Signal detection can be “qualitative ”
built on case-by-case assessment of individual case safety reports) or 
“quantitative ” via adopting machine learning or mining approaches us- 
ing databases of real world data from clinical trials, electronic health 
records, biomedical literature, pharmacological databases, etc. Quan- 
titatively/qualitatively detected signals necessitates further validation 
and conﬁrmation by clinical judgment [ 18 ]. 

The aims of SD practices are to earlier discover potential safety con- 
cerns (completely novel or new pattern to previously known ADR); to 
distinguish signal of higher-order associations; to conﬁrm signals that 
have been ﬁrst identiﬁed from qualitative avenues; and to probably de- 
tect class eﬀect safety issues. 

1.4. Scope 

In this paper, a systematic review was mainly conducted to formulate 
an answer to the question “How were informatics-driven approaches 
in terms of data mining and machine learning applied by researchers 
to identify DDI safety signals? The diﬀerent aspects informatics-driven 
models existing in the underlying article are shown below in Section 7 - 
Fig. 5 . 

In order to address the main objective of this review, a search strat- 
egy was conducted using the most prestigious biomedical literature 
databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar). No 
time constraints were applied to be able to retrieve all potential rele- 
vant articles. The following eligibility criteria were used to ﬁnd relevant 
studies: 

Inclusion criteria 

• Research/regular papers and review articles provided a ML frame- 

work for DDI prediction; 

• Research/regular papers provided a data mining method for drug 

safety signal detection; 

• Included information about evaluation for an informatics frame- 

work; 

• Written in English 

Exclusion criteria 

• Studies not related to the detection or prediction of DDIs; 
• Studies not applying any machine learning or data mining tech- 

niques; 

• Studies not containing any quantitative results; 
• Studies with only pharmacological scope; 
• Not written in English. 

As a summary, the remainder of this review is organized into dif- 
ferent sections. We ﬁrst discuss common data sources used in pharma- 
covigilance. We then explore informatics methods based on data mining 
techniques typically used by regulatory bodies for the quantitative PV 
signal detection and categories of ML algorithms deployed in DDI pre- 
diction. Finally, we draw conclusions along with outlining limitations 
and recommendations for future researches.

2. Widespread data sources in support of Pharmacovigilance 

2.1. Postmarketing Pharmacovigilance Data: Spontaneous reporting 
systems 

Postmarketing PV data are mainly available in several unique data 
sources through Spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs). This type of 
spontaneous data is the main source for postmarketing monitoring un- 
til now. SRSs are large databases for collecting individual case safety 
reports (ICSRs) of suspected adverse events passively reported to reg- 
ulatory authorities by patients, healthcare professionals, and industry. 
The VigiBase (the WHO-UMC global database of ICSRs) [ 19 ], US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system (FAERS) 
[ 20 , 21 ], the European EudraVigilance [ 22 ], and the “vaccine adverse 
event reporting systems (VAERS) ” [ 23 ] are the most prominent ICSRs 
management systems. 

Such kind of SRSs are developed to enable continuous monitoring of 
pharmaceutical and biological products within pharmacovigilance sys- 
tems [ 24 ]. Generally, the structure of SRSs adheres to the international 
safety reporting guidance issued by the International Conference on Har- 
monisation (ICH E2B) that sets standards for reporting individual case 
safety reports (ICSR) [ 25 ]. Other type of SRSs is the proprietary com- 
pany safety databases that contain ICSRs of a company pharmaceutical 
products. They can support early safety signal detection. The merits of 
SRSs are represented in providing information necessary for establishing 
causality assessment from real data and/or developing mining/ML mod- 
els that might not be available in other data sources. For example but 
not limited to, apparent temporal time relationship, concomitant med- 
ications, indications, de-/re-challenge information, some demographic 
patient data, and action taken & outcome Information. Despite multi- 
beneﬁts of SRSs which playing a crucial role to support wise therapeu- 
tic decision-making in regulatory bodies, they have well-known bound- 
aries. Those limitations can be summarized in over-/under- reporting 
rates, limited past medical history of patients, false signaling due to mis- 
attribution to hidden confounders/risk factors, and inability to indicate 
real incidence rates. 

2.2. Electronic Healthcare Data 

Electronic healthcare data consists of multiple sources like electronic 
health records (EHRs), administrative and insurance claims databases. 
EHRs are a kind of longitudinal observational systems where patients’ 
medical records are created from multiple systems in healthcare or- 
ganization(s). Many of the EHR ﬁelds are composed of unstructured 
data (e.g. discharge summaries, lab test ﬁndings, nurse notiﬁcations, 
etc.) and non-speciﬁc adverse events. Natural language processing (NLP) 
studies show how using EHRs data via adopting text mining approaches 
can be beneﬁcial for extracting, encoding, and detecting safety signals 
[26–29] . The main beneﬁt of EHRs from the aspect of PV is their capabil- 
ity to conduct active surveillance from real-work data [30–32] . Merits 
distinguish EHR systems from SRSs can represented in: not containing 
duplicates, largely unaﬀected by under- or over-reporting as they typ- 
ically derived automatically, providing consistent information on most 
of the subject’s drug exposure periods, clinically relevant events (inde- 
pendently from the exposure status) and valuable information on ex- 
posed subjects without events, and much more complete assessment 
of drug exposure and comorbidity status. For that, EHR systems may 
generate safety signals earlier than SRSs. Nevertheless, the abovemen- 
tioned limitations consider the key boundaries for applying in regular 
PV. Other limitations can be represented in: diﬃculty to access due to 
privacy issues, and very challenging policy and technical issues to inte- 
grate EHRs from multiple sources. In EHRs, elevated rates of a medical 
diagnosis may indicate a safety issue (if subsequent to prescription), so 
some studies have hypothesized that metrics based on exploring longi- 
tudinal observational dataset for temporal associations between events 
over time rather than person-counts could produce more accurate as- 

sociations. Mining of the EHRs data provides patterns of relationships 
among various entities oﬀering enhanced medical intelligence unobtain- 
able by other means [33,34] . 

2.3. Biomedical Literature 

In the context of PV, biomedical literature may provide important 
medical data, from preclinical researches, clinical trials, observational 
studies, and case reports, which can be missed in regulatory PV ac- 
tivities due to focusing on coded and structured SRSs data. Addition- 
ally, drug interactions are frequently reported in pharmaceutical jour- 
nals and technical reports, making medical literature the most eﬀective 
source for the detection of DDIs. Therefore, developing NLP methods 
aiming at mining drug safety information for either single drug-adverse- 
event combinations or higher-order associations have been grown in re- 
cent years [35–37] . Despite its merits, this type of data sources has a 
number of deﬁciencies that can be summarized as following: (1) Infor- 
mation comprehensiveness is limited due to restricted ﬁnancial access 
to many databases, ignorance of their existence by many people, non- 
standardization of their interface formats, in addition non-user friendly 
search engines; (2) Information quality is limited because no uniform 
guidelines exist for contents of the major text ﬁelds in database records 
(abstracts, titles, keywords, descriptors); (3) Compatibility among the 
contents of all record ﬁelds leading to diﬀerent perspectives of the same 
technical topic; (4) Information retrieval is limited because time, cost, 
technical expertise, and substantial detailed technical analyses are re- 
quired to retrieve the full scope of related records in a comprehensive 
process; (5) Unﬁltered nature of biomedical literature is too statistically 
noisy to allow accurate signal detection. These deﬁciencies can result 
in two serious limitations: a substantial amount of relevant literature 
is not retrieved, and a substantial amount of non-relevant literature is 
retrieved [36] . In summary, it is very challenging to detect drug safety 
signals due to high statistical noise of the biomedical literature, so high 
quality text mining algorithms and/or machine learning needed to be 
developed [37] . 

2.4. Biomedical Knowledge Databases 

There  are  a  number  of  freely  available  biomedical  knowledge 
databases, for example, DrugBank, STITCH, and PharmGKB [38–40] , 
support authors to develop representation frameworks targeting the pre- 
diction of safety signals. This kind of resources provides information 
about drugs’ chemical structures, biological elements, targets of phar- 
macological actions, functional/metabolic pathways, etc. Making use of 
this type of data sources oﬀers some privileges, for example, allowing 
the opportunity to predict early-stage attrition due to new therapeutic 
candidates’ toxicities during drug-development process [ 41 ]. This type 
of data sources has limitations represented in: (i) diﬃculty of modeling 
and simulating multifaceted metabolic pathways for thousands of drug 
candidates as it is crucial to preprocess molecules extracted from those 
databases with a set of cleaning rules to be representative dataset; (ii) 
no available databases completely describe the exact mechanisms by 
which drugs and genes may interact; (iii) complex informatics methods 
are required to explore those chemical or genetic data. 

3. Data mining methods for Pharmacovigilance signal detection 

3.1. Disproportionality analyses 

Data mining is the process of extracting the patterns, associations 
or relationships among raw data using diﬀerent analytical techniques 
involving the creation of a model to derive useful knowledge [42,43] . 
In PV, the data mining techniques are dedicated for hypothesis genera- 
tion of new possible adverse drug events ”. Quantitative signal detection 
practices in large databases (e.g. VigiBase) are founded on data mining 
algorithms using disproportionality analyses (DPAs) [44,45] . DPAs are

drug and the suspect adverse event; b, number of reports containing

terest); c, number of reports containing the target adverse event with

categorized into two general classes (frequentist and Bayesian). Both 
categories utilize the entries of confusion matrix (as shown Fig. 1 ) to 
compute the magnitude of statistical association between drug-adverse- 
event combinations (DECs)  in a PV database [ 46 ]. Their principles 
depend on estimating observed-to-expected reporting ratios for drug- 
reaction pairs using the total number of cases in background [47–52] . 
They quantify the unexpectedness of adverse event being reported to 
a drug or drug pair. All DPAs share the same basic of disproportion- 
ate reporting between observed to expected ratios, despite they diﬀer 
in computation per each. Whenever a DEC’s DPA computation exceeds 
the predeﬁned minimum thresholds, it will be ﬂagged as a statistical 
safety signal that requires further clinical assessment. Diﬀerent thresh- 
olds are used for these algorithms to identify signiﬁcant safety signals for 
DECs. 

3.2. Association Rule Mining 

Besides DPAs, there is an algorithm called association rule mining 
(abbreviated  as  ARM)  [ 53 ].  ARM  is  considered  a  well-known  min- 
ing algorithm for disclosing interesting patterns concealed within large 
databases. This algorithm was ﬁrst advanced since more than a decade 
to be applied to the ﬁeld of computer science, then expanded to various 
sciences [54–56] . Some studies have adopted ARM-based algorithms to 
detect adverse DDI patterns using SRSs [ 57 ]. Apriori algorithm is a kind 
of association rules mining which oﬀers an appropriate representation 
of sparse data for complex computations [ 53 ]. Any association rule can 
be expressed in the form of 𝑥 → 𝑦 where x is an element from X item- 
set, while y is an element from Y itemset, noting that x & y are diﬀerent 
items. To estimate directionality, the general Apriori algorithm works in 
two steps. The key of primary step is built on counting a frequent item 
set when an observed association between items exceeds the support 
threshold. While the second step depends on generating conﬁdent asso- 
ciation rules fulﬁlling predeﬁned minimum thresholds. From the scope 
of PV, 𝑋 symbolizes an itemset of medications and y symbolizes an item- 
set of adverse-reactions. A signiﬁcant association rule indicates that a 
speciﬁc DEC exceeds minimum thresholds of minimum conﬁdence and 
support. The support of a DEC 𝑆( 𝑋) is the observed numerals of reports 
having 𝑋. While support of an association rule 𝑆( 𝑋  → 𝑌 ) can be sym- 
bolized as 𝑆( 𝑋  ∪ 𝑌 ) . The conﬁdence of an association rule 𝐶( 𝑋  → 𝑌 ) 
indicates ( 𝑆( 𝑋  ∪ 𝑌 ) ) ∕ ( 𝑆( 𝑋) ) ( 1 ). Conﬁdence deﬁnes how frequently 
objects in Y represented in reports containing X. Conﬁdence enables the 
estimation of conditional likelihood ( 𝑃 𝑟 ( 𝑌 )∕( 𝑋) ) ( 2 ) of Y in presence of 
X. An interesting association is ﬂagged when a rule fulﬁlls the minimum 
thresholds of both support & conﬁdence, however some studies have 
suggested other measures to ﬁlter signiﬁcant DDI associations [ 53 ]. 

3.3. Regression-based Approaches 

Confounders are hidden covariates that may be hidden factors lead- 
ing to either ﬂagging spurious safety signals or delaying the detection 
of signiﬁcant ones [ 58 ]. It is worth mentioning that confounders may 
infer a risk factor predisposing the adverse reaction or a key to identify 
higher risky patient subpopulations. A simpler type of confounders can 
be seen in variables (for example, age, gender, and year). They may be 
handled eﬀectively by the stratiﬁcation for each stratum using Mantel–
Haenszel adjustments [59,60] . Nevertheless, adjusting huge numerals of 
possible confounders may result in missing signal detection in a timely 
manner [61–63] . Another limitation is represented in stratiﬁcation by 
gender, age-group, etc. where the number of case reports are low and 
then infeasible to conduct subgroup analyses. Additionally, there are 
other forms of confounders called “innocent bystander ” responsible for 
the occurrence of adverse events such as interacting drugs or indica- 
tions of reported comedications. Unfortunately, using Mantel–Haenszel 
approaches for adjusting such kind of confounders is ineﬀective [ 60 ]. 
For large numbers of covariates, adopting logistic-regression (LR) ap- 
proach is more eﬃcient [ 61 ]. 

LR extends linear regression function by a sigmoid function to a value 
interval from 0 to 1 [ 62 ]. LR computes ROR by categorizing database’s 
records as case-control records where a case is counted whenever hav- 
ing adverse-event of interest, whereas controls are counted whenever 
records having other adverse-events. In the context of PV, two studies 
have reported adopting LR modeling using SRSs aiming at DDI signal de- 
tection [63,64] . The comprehension of LR can be expressed according 
to the following formula:

4. Paradigms of data mining and text mining studies using 
spontaneous reporting systems for detecting DDI signals 

Nevertheless the limitations of any “spontaneous reporting system 
(SRS) ” in regular PV practices, SRSs provide precious tool in detecting 
previously unknown safety concerns [ 65 ]. DPAs represent the most com- 
monly applied algorithms in the area of quantitative signal detection 
within health authorities and large pharmaceutical industry [66,67] . 

The Shrinkage measure Ω, which is the extension of IC measure for 
the triplets {drug-drug-AE}, has been innovated by Norén et al . at Up- 
psala monitoring Centre (UMC) to screen potential DDI signals in the 

4 

H. Ibrahim, A. Abdo, A.M. El Kerdawy et al. 

Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 1 (2021) 100005 

VigiBase [ 9 ]. Authors have shown the privileges of Ω shrinkage mea- 
sure compared to logistic regression in detecting interesting patterns of 
DDI signals. It can be calculated by estimating the proportion between 
observed and expected frequencies as seen in the following equation; 

Ω =  𝑙𝑜 𝑔 
2 

𝑛 111 + 𝛼
𝐸111 + 𝛼

(4) 

Where E111 stands for the “expected ” incidence value of drug-drug- 
event combination within a PV database; a is a constant equals to 0.5; 
Ω025 is the lower boundary of 95% conﬁdence interval which ﬂag a 
statistical DDI signal when its value ≥ 0 [ 9 ]. In 2013, Choi et al. have 
investigated the feasibility of using the national Korean health insurance 
system named “HIRA ” in identifying DDI signals [ 68 ]. They adopted 
the shrinkage measure Omega Ω on the ICD-10 codes of diagnoses in 
association with a standard DDI dataset of NSAID and diuretics. 

A Reporting ratios (RR) was used, as a conditional disproportionality 
analysis, to assess the increased of users searching for hyperglycemia- 
related terms given that they searched for both pravastatin and parox- 
etine. The results provided evidence to the potentiality of prediction of 
drug safety signals from search logs. 

Almenoﬀ et al . have examined the Bayesian disproportionality mea- 
sure MGPS (90% conﬁdence interval) in screening interaction proﬁles 
between antihypertensive drug “verapamil ” and other classes of car- 
diovascular medications [ 69 ]. Results have shown the usefulness of 
MGPS disproportionality algorithm in mining DDI interesting patterns 
in polypharmacy conditions. Schuemie et al. [ 70 ] proposed an approach 
known as longitudinal GPS (LGPS) which is a modiﬁcation of the orig- 
inal MGPS approach. LGPS computed the expected number of medi- 
cal events during drug prescriptions based on an aggregate unexposed 
patient-time in exposed and unexposed patients. For protecting against 
confounding from dominating unexposed patients so long as the major- 
ity of the patients in a population don’t receive speciﬁc medicine, au- 
thors suggested a ﬁlter named Observational Proﬁles of Adverse events 
Related to Drugs (LEOPARD) to eliminate spurious associations caused 
by protopathic bias. LGPS has been shown to outperform related meth- 
ods, including MGPS. 

In 2010, Harpaz et al. [ 71 ] have proposed an enhanced Apriori al- 
gorithm using FAERS data for the purpose of detecting interesting DDI 
patterns. Because of the unsuitability of classic Apriori metrics for drug 
safety ﬁeld, RRR measure was utilized instead, with supplementary ﬁl- 
ter that each drug pair in association triplet should have RRR score 
higher than any of each drug individually. The second ﬁlter criterion 
was aimed to eliminate spurious DDI signals. Results exhibited nearly 
35% of the drug-drug-reaction associations relating to well-known DDI, 
thus indicating the probable beneﬁt of custom ARM in ﬂagging poten- 
tial DDI signals that warrant further clinical assessment. Another study, 
Ibrahim, H et al . [ 72 ] have presented an augmented data mining al- 
gorithm “hybrid Apriori ”, customized to PV applications, where dis- 
proportionality PRR measure was adopted as interestingness measure 
to discover association patterns of adverse DDIs from FAERS data. On 
the other side, Van Puijenbroek et al. [ 73 ] have considered an adjusted 
disproportionality measure ROR through implementing a model of lo- 
gistic regression on the Netherlands’s PV database “LAREB ” to evalu- 
ate the adverse eﬀects for the coadministration of “non-steroidal anti- 
inﬂammatory drugs (NSAID) ” and “diuretics ” on worsening the symp- 
toms of congestive heart failure (CHF) disease. Results implied that us- 
ing NSAIDs themselves has no role in increasing the risk of CHF. While 
upon coadministration with diuretics, NSAIDs have contributory role in 
aggravating CHF. The authors have concluded that adopting LR can of- 
fer advantages over bivariate disproportionality measures via guarding 
against false signals as a result of confounding by concomitant medica- 
tions. 

Thakrar et al . have illustrated the principal of multiplicative and ad- 
ditive modeling in discovering DDI signals using SRS [ 74 ]. The design 
of multiplicative/additive framework was built on estimating the inter- 
action coeﬃcient ( 𝛿) where the associated risk with drug pair coadmin- 

istration is larger than those observed with each drug individually. In- 
creased risk of a particular safety concern linked to speciﬁc drug(s) can 
be represented in higher incidence rates, higher observed-to-expected 
ratios, observed disproportionate reporting, etc. The statistical formula 
for a multiplicative model of “interaction coeﬃcient 𝛿″ associated with 
a drug pair can be calculated by a logarithmic linear regression equation 
as follows: 

𝐿𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 ) = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ( 𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝐴 ) + 𝛾 ( 𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝐵 ) + 𝛿 ( 𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝐴 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐵 ) 

+ 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 

(5) 

While the statistical formula of the additive model for an “interaction 
coeﬃcient 𝛿″ associated with a drug pair can be calculated as shown in 
the below equation. 

𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ( 𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝐴 ) + 𝛾 ( 𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝐵 ) + 𝛿 ( 𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝐴 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐵 ) 

+ 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 

(6) 

The principal of multiplicative model is based on assuming that a 
safety concern accompanied with a medication is multiplied to its back- 
ground estimate, whereas the principal of additive model is founded 
on adding the safety concern linked to a drug into its background esti- 
mate. Regarding the multiplicative model, supposing the null hypothesis 
is real (i.e., non-DDI), the proportional risk of drug-drug-adverse-event 
combination is equal the product of the proportions of each drug individ- 
ually ( 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐵 = 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐴 × 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐵) ( 7 ). Likewise the additive model, if 
the proportional risk of an adverse event (AE) associated with a particu- 
lar drug-pair is equal to the sum of proportions for the same AE of inter- 
est associated with each drug individually ( 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐵 = 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐴 + 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐵) 
( 8 ). DDI signal generated when multiplicative model 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐵∕ 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐴 ×
𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐵  >  1 or additive model 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐵  − 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐴 − 𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝐵  >  0 along 
with signiﬁcant p - 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒  <  0 . 05 . The additive model in the context of 
DDI signal detection has shown higher sensitivity results compared to 
the multiplicative one. Hence, multiplicative models can be complemen- 
tary evidence for DDI signals detected by the additive models. 

There are diﬀerent types of unstructured data sources which can be 
represented in narrative portions of EHRs, biomedical databases, etc. 
In recent years, researchers have proposed methods for mining such 
sources to eﬀectively predict adverse DDI signals making up for the lim- 
itations of spontaneous reporting systems. Algorithms related to text 
mining and natural language processing (NLP) are commonly utilized 
to evolve these tasks. 

Iyer et al . [ 75 ] have proposed an approach of natural language pro- 
cessing for disclosing DDI signals directly from the embedded verbatim 
parts of two big corpora of EHRs. They adopted adjusted disproportion- 
ality measures to detect signiﬁcant associations of DDIs composed of 
1165 distinct drugs and 14 distinct AEs. The authors’ method has shown 
comparable performance between the DDIs signals discriminated from 
EHRs and those identiﬁed from SRSs. 

Jon D. Duke et al . [ 76 ] have developed a new approach to mine 
mechanistic features from PV literature abstracts to predict potential 
DDI signals. Authors have speciﬁcally investigated interesting DDI pat- 
terns associated with the increased risk of myopathy and related mus- 
culoskeletal conditions. First, the authors applied two-step Information 
Retrieval (IR) approach to recognize the expression patterns relevant 
to DDI from PubMed abstracts. Then, they performed two logistic re- 
gression analyses to test each DDI eﬀect on myopathy. They validated 
clinically signiﬁcant DDI signals via using a database of electronic health 
records. Five novel DDI signals of increased risk of myopathy along with 
related cytochrome metabolizing enzymes were predicted. 

LePendu et al . [ 77 ] proposed an approach for mining textual clini- 
cal notes corresponding to 1,044,979 patients derived from the Stanford 
Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE) us- 
ing odds ratio (OR) as frequency-based association measure. In purpose 
of generating hypotheses of DDIs signals, authors have used unstruc- 
tured notes of EHRs rather than SRSs. Authors have evaluated their sug- 
gested approach in terms of sensitivity and speciﬁcity using gold stan-

dard of known interactions from DrugBank and the MediSpan® Drug 
Therapy Monitoring System TM (Wolters Kluwer Health, Indianapolis, 
IN). In overall, authors’ method achieved 81.5% area under the Receiver 
Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve for signaling known DDIs. 

Segura et al . [ 78 ] proposed the shallow linguistic kernel technique 
for automatic DDIs extraction from biomedical texts. As the recogni- 
tion of drug names is an essential prerequisite step for the automatic 
discovery of DDIs from biomedical texts, authors used UMLS MetaMap 
Transfer (MMTx) tool to automatically identify drug entities occurring 
in unstructured textual documents of DDIs from DrugBank database. 
The MMTx recognizes and annotates drug entities according to UMLS 
semantic types (e.g., Clinical Drug [clnd], Pharmacological Substance 
[phsu], and Antibiotic [antb]). Drug-DDI corpus was created, annotated 
with 3169 DDIs, as the output of MMTx in XML format. Also, MMTx 
tool was used to extract and label candidates of drug pairs with 1 if in- 
teraction exists or labeled 0 if no interaction exists. The performance 
of proposed shallow linguistic kernel-based technique, with a precision 
of 51.03%, a recall of 72.82% and an F-measure of 60.01%, conﬁrmed 
the remarkable impact of automatic entity recognition on the relation 
extraction task. 

In 2013, White et al . [ 79 ] have demonstrated that the internet search 
logs that are generated by consumers are able to provide early clues 
about DIAEs. The authors conducted a large scale study of web search 
log paying attention on speciﬁc interaction between paroxetine (an an- 
tidepressant) and pravastatin (a cholesterol-lowering drug), which was 
recently reported in 2011 to cause hyperglycemia. Yang et al . [ 80 ] pro- 
posed a text mining methodology where they used social media to iden- 
tify DDI patterns by combining ARM and lexicon-based algorithms. The 
authors used a data source called “MedHelp ” as an example for an on- 
line healthcare forums. Only triplets were considered whereas each co- 
occurrence was counted for a pair of interacting drugs associated with 
an adverse event. They examined the signiﬁcance of the constructed 
drug-drug-adverse-event associations using 4 metrics as follows {sup- 
port, leverage, lift, and conﬁdence} [ 81 ]. Some limitations related to 
the previous mentioned measures for example, the leverage could be 
very small or even negative because of the very small of threads related 
to ADR compared with the total number of threads. For that, authors 
adopted another measure called interaction ratio to capture DDI signals 
through which variation of conﬁdence can be calculated. The generated 
patterns have proven the feasibility of the proposed approach in DDI 
signal detection from DrugBank database. 

5. Machine learning approaches for the prediction of safety 
signals 

In recent years, research eﬀorts have directed from data mining ap- 
proaches towards machine-learning (ML) to discover DDIs early during 
the drug discovery process before becoming commercially available. ML 
methods can be characterized into two broad categories: supervised and 
unsupervised [ 82 ]. In supervised learning, a model is built prior to the 
analysis where the model learns from labeled input data in order to esti- 
mate speciﬁc relationships between the features and the labels of the in- 
put data. Then, the learned model is applied to unseen data to predict the 
category or quantity of interest. Classiﬁcation and regression are very 
common supervised learning techniques used in biomedical research. It 
is worth mentioning that regression-based approaches are traditionally 
adopted for either biostatistics or data mining purposes as illustrated in 
section 4 . However, in several studies either linear or logistic regression 
are considered as ML models for binary/multi-class prediction of con- 
tinuous/categorical features. Supervised ML algorithms may be used for 
feature selection, classiﬁcation, prediction or evaluating the eﬃciency 
of some parameters [ 83 ]. In contrast, for unsupervised learning, the al- 
gorithm is applied directly on unlabeled input data to ﬁnd regularities, 
and then a model will be built according to the identiﬁed patterns. Clus- 
tering and biclustering algorithms are the most common unsupervised 
ML techniques [ 84 ]. The following subsections from 5.1 through 5.5 

6 

summarize the most common ML algorithms adopted by researchers in 
the ﬁeld of safety signal detection. 

5.1. Support Vector Machine 

Support vector machine (SVM) is the most popular non-probabilistic 
ML algorithm which was ﬁrst developed by Vapnik and Lerner for bi- 
nary classiﬁcation problems [ 85 ]. The main concept of SVM is to create 
the optimal hyperplane/decision boundary. A hyperplane is a line/(n- 
1) dimensional plane that can separate n-dimensional input space into 
two classes so that a new data point can be easily categorized into the 
correct class [ 84 , 86 ]. There are two types of SVM: linear SVM and non- 
linear SVM depending on whether data are linearly separable or not. For 
linear SVM, the distance between the decision boundary and the closest 
data points is referred to as the margin. As shown in Fig. 2 , the optimal 
hyperplane is the line with the largest margin that can separate the two 
classes. The margin is calculated as the perpendicular distance from the 
hyperplane to only the closest points referred to as the support vectors 
of the hyperplane. Only these points are relevant in deﬁning the line 
and in the construction of the classiﬁer. 

The real-world applications of SVM is subject to non-linearly sepa- 
rable data where a linear decision boundary cannot be used to classify 
the dataset. This leads to the emerging of a new generation of learn- 
ing systems called kernel functions. A SVM Kernel is a function where it 
takes input training dataset with non-linearly separable decision surface 
and transforms the low-dimensional feature space into an abstract high- 
dimensional space. The most common kernel functions used in SMV 
modeling are Gaussian radial basis function (RBF), polynomial, and sig- 
moid kernels [ 87 ]. 

In this, we can conclude the merits and demerits of SVM. The key 
advantage is the kernel trick that enables SVM to create non-linear max- 
imum margin decision boundaries in the original non-linearly separable 
feature space and consequently allows SVM to operate well in high- 
dimensional spaces. While disadvantages are represented mainly in: (i) 
Long training time for large datasets; (ii) its black-box nature that makes 
the ﬁnal model diﬃcult to interpret. 

5.2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a popular ML algorithm belonging to 
the family of instance-based learning for the purposes of classiﬁcation 
and regression prediction [88,89] . KNN at its core is a distance-based 
algorithm where the distance between two objects/data rows is calcu- 
lated. KNN typically requires the calculation of distances between an 
example and k samples in the training dataset with the smallest dis- 
tance to determine the prediction. While in the test set, the class label is 
predicted by only calculating distances for the nearest k neighbors (see 
Fig. 3 ). The most commonly used distance metrics in this regard are 
“Euclidean distance ” and “Hamming distance ” [90,91] . “Euclidean dis- 
tance ” metric is computed as the square root of the sum of the squared 
diﬀerences between the two vectors as seen in the following formula: 

𝐷 𝐸 𝑢𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑑 𝑒𝑎𝑛 ( 𝑝, 𝑞 ) = 

√ √ √ √ 

𝑘 ∑

(

)
2 
𝑞 𝑖 − 𝑝 𝑖 

𝑖 =1 

(9) 

While the “Hamming distance ” metric computes the distance be- 
tween two binary vectors to the sum of the bit diﬀerences between bi- 
nary strings as seen in the following formula: 

𝐷 𝐻𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 ( 𝑝, 𝑞 ) = 

𝑘 ∑

|
|
|𝑞 𝑖 − 𝑝 𝑖 
|

𝑖 =1 

(10) 

Here 𝑝 = ( 𝑝 

1 ,  … .,  𝑝 𝑘 ) and 𝑞 = ( 𝑞 

1 ,  … .,  𝑞 𝑘 ) refer to vectors in k- 
dimensional space. The notations “𝑝 & 𝑞” are two objects in n-space; 
“𝑞 𝑖  & 𝑝 𝑖 ” are vectors starting from the origin of the space (initial 
point/object); n denotes n-space.

rithm concept. Where, k = number of neighbors; X

The main advantage of KNN algorithm is its capability to arbitrar- 
ily approximate any data distribution. However its demerits can be 
abridged as follows: (i) Computationally challenging as KNN uses all 
data points of the loaded training dataset for conducting queries; (ii) the 
number of data needed to be scaled grows exponentially with dimension 
by increasing the dataset size. It is known as the “curse of dimensional- 
ity ”. 

5.3. Random Forest Classiﬁer 

Ensemble learning is a general meta-approach that combines predic- 
tions from multiple ML models to achieve better predictive performance. 
One of the powerful ML algorithm based on bagging ensemble learning 
is random forest classiﬁer (abbreviated as “RFC ”). It was developed by 
Leo Breiman [ 92 ]. Bagging is one of the main standard strategies used in 
ensemble learning techniques that ﬁts many decision trees on diﬀerent 
samples of the same dataset and averages the predictions (see Fig. 4 ) 
[ 93 ]. 

RFC is a supervised learning algorithm that is based on the infras- 
tructure of decision tree algorithm and to classify either categorical or 
continuous features [ 94 ]. It estimates numbers of decision tree classi- 
ﬁers which ﬁt on various subsets of a training dataset to augment the 
predictive performance and manage overﬁtting compared to “Decision 
tree algorithm ” (refer to Fig. 5 ). The considered number of features at 
each sub-tree equals to the square root of the number of features in the 
input training dataset. Then, it averages the scores of each decision tree 
to predict the class of the test dataset instance [95,96] . 

Besides the high variance associated with tree classiﬁers due to sub- 
stantial change in the training dataset resulting in very diﬀerent sub- 
trees and being non-interpretable, RFC is still privileged as a relatively 
fast training model that requires little data preparation can be adopted 
for multidimensional problems [97,98] . 

5.4. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks 

Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) are a set of algorithms developed 
to imitate the neurons in human brain that are designed to recognize 
patterns in data which may be used for classiﬁcation or clustering prob- 
lems [99,100] . There are two main categories of ANN: (i) simple neural 
networks; (ii) deep learning neural networks (refer to Fig. 6 ). We here 
outline the general ANN architectures and common activation functions 
with taking into consideration deep learning neural networks are out of 
scope of the underlying review where ANNs. 

There are two speciﬁc architectures for ANNs: (1) Feed-forward neu- 
ral networks and (2) Feedback/Recurrent neural networks. Feed-forward 
neural networks are the most common architecture of ANN in practical 
applications. In this architecture, the information travels in one direc- 
tion towards the output layer with one or multiple hidden layers. While 
Feedback/recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are more ﬂexible and much 
diﬃcult to analyze than feed-forward networks. RNNs can process vari- 
able length inputs by processing them in time steps, allowing the output 
of deeper layers to be fed back to previous layers in subsequent time 
steps. Therefore this type of ANN is typically utilized in sequential and 
time-series tasks. 

Fig. 7 shows scheme of an interfacial neuron where a sequence of 
three operations can be represented as follows: (1) take an input feature 
𝑖 for a vector 𝑋 and assign it a weight, then sum those inputs to obtain 
modulated features coming to the body of the neuron, and ﬁnally have 
an activation function 𝑓 “Perceptron ” that transforms those modulated 
features into the ultimate output/class [ 96 ]. 

There are various types of activation functions but the most com- 
mon ones used in ANN modeling are Heaviside step function [ 101 ], Sig- 
moid function [ 102 ], Hyperbolic Tangent function (Tanh) [ 103 ], Recti- 
ﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU) [ 104 ], Softmax function [ 105 ]. Heaviside step 
function is the classic and simplest ANN activation function with bi-

nary outcome that was ﬁrst developed by Frank Rosenblatt (Refer to 
the “blue circle ” in Fig. 7 above). It outputs 0 if the score is ≤ 0, and 1 
otherwise. 

Sigmoid is a non-linear activation function which is also known as 
“Logistic function ”. It provides a smooth and diﬀerentiated gradient 
curve. Sigmoid is typically used as the activation function in binary 
classiﬁcation problems where its prediction output is normalized into 
the range [0–1]. Like Sigmoid, Hyperbolic tangent activation function 
is used in binary classiﬁcation problems. Nonetheless, it is zero centric 

and the output values range from -1 to 1. B is the most popular acti- 
vation function used in multiclass classiﬁcation problems besides deep 
learning neural networks applications. ReLU allows the elimination of 
negative units in an ANN which diminish the sparse activation of only 
about 50%. Unlike the previously mentioned activation functions, Soft- 
max’s output is computed by the probabilities of modulated inputs to 
predict target class with the highest probability. The sum of the entire 
probabilities must be equal to 1. This function is commonly utilized in 
multiclass classiﬁcation problems.

feature i . 

5.5. Naive Bayes 

Naive Bayes (NB) is one of the simplest supervised ML algorithms 
that is suitable for binary and multiclass classiﬁcation of categorical in- 
put features. NB is based on Bayes’ theorem to estimate posterior proba- 
bility with the assumption of independence between features [ 106 ]. The 
comprehension of NB as a probabilistic classiﬁer can be expressed as in 
the following equation: 

𝑃 ( 𝑐 |𝑥 ) = 

𝑃 ( 𝑥 |𝑐 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑐 ) 
𝑃 ( 𝑥 ) 

(9) 

Where 𝑃 ( 𝑐𝑥 ) denotes the posterior/conditional probability of class 
(target) given predictor (feature); 𝑃 ( 𝑐) is the prior probability of class; 
𝑃 ( 𝑥𝑐 ) symbolizes the likelihood which is the probability of predictor 
given class and 𝑃 ( 𝑥 ) represents the prior probability of predictor. 

The merit of NB modeling is that it is easy to build with no compli- 
cated iterative parameter estimation. It is particularly useful to imple- 
ment on large datasets [ 107 ]. However, the main limitation of NB is the 
assumption that all the predictor features are completely independent. 

6. Paradigms of machine learning studies for prediction of DDI 
signals 

In the light of principles of the state-of-art ML algorithms described 
throughout section 5 , in this section, we present paradigms of ML studies 
reported in biomedical literature. Two main types of ML approaches - 
(network-based [108–111] and similarity-based [ 17 , 112–120 ]) - have 
been adopted by researchers for the purposes of predicting DDI safety 
signals. 

Regarding network-based ML methods , they have been proposed by re- 
searchers for diﬀerent objectives, including DDI prediction, drug-target- 
interaction (DTI) prediction, adverse drug reaction prediction, or drug 
repurposing [ 121 ] . For discovering unknown DDI signals, the strate- 

gies of network-based ML approaches depend on inferring drug simi- 
larities between network nodes or learning about topological features 
of the network structure [122,123] . Those knowledge networks can be 
constructed by extracting and integrating existing drug knowledge from 
one or multiple data sources (e.g. chemical, biological, target, genomic, 
pharmacological databases) leading to various shapes of networks (e.g. 
drug-drug, drug-target, protein-protein, pharmacodynamic, drug-gene, 
phenotypic, pharmacokinetic, etc.) [ 124 ]. 

Cami et al., [ 108 ] suggested a predictive pharmacointeraction net- 
works (PPIN) framework to predict DDIs by utilizing the network topo- 
logical structure for all known DDIs of a knowledge database “Mul- 
tum Vantage Rx ”, a commercial available database of curated DDIs 
and related side eﬀects. Based on intrinsic and taxonomic properties 
of drugs nodes and edges representing interaction between nodes, the 
PPIN has reported 48% sensitivity, 90% speciﬁcity and 81% area un- 
der the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). On the other 
hand, Huang et al. , [ 109 ] have conducted a study based on protein- 
protein-interaction (PPI) network for systematic prediction of PD DDIs. 
They designed two metrics of network topology to integrate pheno- 
typic & genomic similarities between drug pairs. Numerous PD DDIs 
have been discovered with high accuracy score (0.82) and modest re- 
call score (0.62). In 2014 [ 111 ], Cheng et al., adopted a heterogeneous 
network-assisted inference (HNAI) framework for large-scale prediction 
of ligand–receptor DDIs. Their work depended on integrating drug phe- 
notypic, therapeutic, chemical, and genomic properties. They tested 
ﬁve ML algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 3-nearest neighbors 
(or 3NN), logistic regression and support vector machine to predict 
DDIs. The key ﬁnding of the HNAI model was a reasonable area un- 
der the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) (0.67) as 
evaluated using ﬁve-fold cross-validation. In 2019, Cheng et al. [ 110 ] 
have reported a network-based method for predicting beneﬁcial drug- 
combinations discriminated from adverse DDIs for FDA-approved an- 

9

tihypertensive drugs. Three types of experimentally evidenced clinical 
data sources (FDA-approved drug labels, Database of Clinicaltrials.gov, 
and published preclinical studies) were utilized. In this study two topo- 
logical measures were adopted for capturing associations between ele- 
ments of disease and drug–target networks in the human protein–protein 
interactome. Network-based proximity measure was used to capture the 
topological linking between two drug–target modules, whereas, Z-score 
was used to get closeness among disease and drug networks. As a re- 
sult, six diﬀerent relationships of drug-drug-disease modules could be 
distinguished by combining a number of decision rules. 

In recent years, Similarity-based ML frameworks have been greatly 
adopted for classiﬁcation tasks in the ﬁeld of pharmacovigilance, par- 
ticularly DDI prediction compared to feature vector-based frameworks. 
Similarity-based  methods  postulate  that  similar  treatments  may  ad- 
versely interact with the same drug. A Similarity-based ML framework 
ideally composes of ﬁve phases that can be summarized as follows: 
(i) Feature capturing from one or more data sources; (ii) Constructing 
feature matrices usually show relationships between a drug and fea- 
ture descriptors expressing various relationships between interacting 
drugs from various perspectives. These feature descriptors may reﬂect 
the chemical properties of a drug (e.g. 2d chemical substructures, 3d 
pharmacophores, anatomical therapeutic chemical “ATC ” codes, etc.). 
They may also represent pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic proper- 
ties of a drug (e.g. target proteins, metabolizing enzymes, transporter 
proteins, and carrier proteins). Moreover, descriptors may reveal some 
pharmacogenomics/ clinical properties (e.g. gene proﬁle, interaction- 
proﬁle, adverse-drug-event (ADE) proﬁle, etc.); (iii) Computing feature 
similarity scores between bit-vectors using various types of similarity 
indices [125–134] ; (iv) Implementing the prediction phase by adopting 
well-established ML algorithms; (v) Evaluating predictive performance 
results of the Similarity-based ML framework. 

Those similarity-based ML frameworks have a number of notable 
merits compared to network-based or feature vector-based frameworks: 
(1) They do not require feature engineering that is usually a complex 
procedure; (2) Existing similarity indices (e.g. Tanimoto coeﬃcient) are 
well-developed and broadly used; (3) higher predictive performance 
outcomes. 

Ferdousi et al., [ 17 ] have conducted a recent study for computational 
prediction of DDIs based on the similarities of the biological elements 
between drug pairs extracted from two publically available databases 
(DrugBank & KEGG). They compared 12 similarity measures for their 
ability to recall positive DDIs (i.e. known DDIs). Then, they selected the 
most reliable binary-similarity measure. They could extract 250,000 po- 
tential DDIs categorized as (low, moderate, high, very high) according 
to their prediction scores. They qualitatively validate few of the pre- 
dicted DDI associations and no quantitative performance evaluation has 
been made. Vilar, S. et al., [112–115] have conducted a series of stud- 
ies built on similarity-based modeling using DrugBank as a data source. 
The use of drug structural similarity information for DDI prediction gave 
an overall precision of 0.26, sensitivity of 0.68, and speciﬁcity of 0.96 
[ 112 ]. Vilar, S. et al. , [ 113 ] have successfully applied a similarity-based 
model for DDI prediction based on the interaction proﬁle ﬁngerprints 
(IPFs). A database of 17,230 DDI candidates along with their potential 
pharmacological eﬀects has been provided for supporting decision in 
DDI detection and pharmacovigilance (PV) data analysis. This method 
has reported precision values ranging from 0.4–0.5. Whereas in 2014 
[ 114 ], Vilar, S. et al. , have presented a protocol integrating ﬁve sim- 
ilarity ﬁngerprints of drug pairs in purpose of large-scale DDI predic- 
tion. The study reported a robust AUROC > 0.95. Vilar, S. et al., [ 115 ] 
have extended their work in 2015 targeting speciﬁc type of adverse 
DDIs using FDA PV database (FAERS). Their similarity-based method 
depended on capturing chemical and pharmacological features. Their 
results showed enhanced sensitivity, speciﬁcity and precision in com- 
parison to the data mining algorithm proportional reporting ratio “PRR ”
traditionally applied on PV databases. Likewise, Sornalakshmi et al. , 
[ 116 ] included diﬀerent similarity measures represented in 2D chem- 

ical structure, 3D pharmacological, interaction proﬁle ﬁngerprint (IPF), 
target, and ADE from DrugBank and SIDER data sources as ground truth 
for DDI labels, then trained SVM models to predict potential DDIs. Got- 
tlieb, A. et al., [ 117 ] have proposed the inferring drug interactions (INDI) 
method which infers both metabolizing enzyme CYP450-associated PK 
DDIs and PD DDIs based on chemical and side eﬀect similarities. They 
made use of two publicly available resources to extract known DDIs & 
their severity. The results showed high AUC value ≥ 0.93, in addition to 
high sensitivity and speciﬁcity levels by using 10-fold cross-validation. 
Herrero-Zazo et al. [ 118 ] used Lexicomp and Vidal compendia as gold 
standards for DDI labels. They adopted supervised learning models using 
ANN constructed from DrugBank data based on PK and PD properties, 
along with drug–enzymes relationships. Tatonetti et al . have conducted 
a study where data from two diﬀerent sources (FAERS and HER’s Stan- 
ford hospital) have been linked aiming at detecting DDIs spontaneous 
reporting systems [ 119 ]. A predictive logistic regression model using 
FAERS data source has been constructed where eight classes of seri- 
ous clinical adverse events (SAEs) proﬁles were generated. Two datasets 
were utilized, one for training and the other for testing. Nearly 171 po- 
tential DDI signals have been identiﬁed which validated using Stanford 
health records. The AUC values ranged from 0.51 to 0.71 for the eight 
models. In Vilar S et al. study, 2018, NLP has been adopted to extract 
the embedded representations of DDIs from PV literature, then apply 
ML to directly make predictions yielding good predictive performance 
in terms of sensitivity, but modest precision with numerous false signals 
[ 120 ]. 

7. Discussion 

This paper investigates pharmacovigilance signal detection for drug- 
drug interactions from several aspects. Based on the illustration pre- 
sented above in sections and subsections, herein we concluded a gen- 
eral framework of informatics-driven modelling that may be used by 
researchers for the purposes of adverse DDIs discovery (as shown in 
Fig. 8 ). One of the main objective of knowledge-based studies is to eval- 
uate the eﬃciency of a model features in discovering novel DDI sig- 
nals. Various metrics were used in purpose of evaluating the capability 
of informatics-based approaches in DDIs prediction. The most common 
metrics utilized in these studies are precision, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, 
accuracy, F1-measure and AUROC. Sensitivity indicates how well the 
model distinguishes adverse DDI signals. Speciﬁcity measures how well 
the model can disclose non-DDI signals. Accuracy measures how well the 
model can predict both DDI signals and non-DDI signals. AUROC metric 
is mainly used in ML studies to estimate how well speciﬁc descriptors 
can distinguish between two classes (DDI/ non-DDI). 

Table 1 displays a comparison of performance metrics for either data 
mining or machine learning studies – (previously presented in sections 
4.0 & 6.0) – in the context of DDI signal detection. There are no state- 
of-art methods that can be benchmarked. This is due to diﬀerent subsets 
size, quality & diverse of data preparation approaches, diﬀerent valida- 
tion methods, etc. Henceforth, in Table 1 , we focused the comparison 
on two main items (research context and data source), besides the well- 
established algorithms per each context (please refer to Fig. 8 ). From 
the data mining perspective, hybrid Apriori seems to provide the best 
performance among data mining algorithms in terms of sensitivity and 
precision. 

Classic PV signal detection practices are focused on adopting DPA 
algorithms to mine SRS data for constituting hypotheses of single drug- 
AE combinations that need further investigation to establish evidence–
based medicine to conﬁrm or refute causality associations between those 
pairs. Then, regulatory actions may be taken to protect the public health. 
However, there is still limitations towards adopting data mining ap- 
proaches in regular PV practices to generate novel hypotheses for DDI 
signals. Moreover, modest eﬀorts are in place to mine DDI signals for 
experimental drugs where there is no or limited data in various data 
sources. Wherever a novel hypothesis for DDI signal is created, more

experimental/clinical investigations may be needed to provide further 
evidences for conﬁrming a DDI signal. Several factors have impact on 
detecting DDI signals where important ones may be missed or spuri- 
ous associations are more likely to be produced. These inﬂuences can 
be summarized in: minimal demographic data, duplicated reports, no 
information regarding patient exposure, underreporting that may arti- 
ﬁcially increase expected risk estimates of the drugs, verbatim medical 
terms, unstandardized drug names, etc. Accordingly, optimizing current 
data mining techniques with chosen thresholds aiming at overcoming 
raw data challenges and capturing DDI signals with higher sensitivity 
and precision is crucial. Also, researchers have shown ARM and its ex- 
tended algorithms as good choices for handling the sparse of postmar- 
keting PV data within SRSs where strong association patterns could be 
generated to easily recognize higher order of Drug-AE associations. On 
the other side, adopting EHRs as a complementary source for routine 
PV practices generally and DDI signal detection speciﬁcally is challeng- 
ing. This may be attributed to the ontology problems, heterogeneity of 
data from various sources and patients’ information are mainly being 
in textual formats, besides confounding by co-medications, risk factors 
and/or comorbidities. Hence, developing NLP approaches and to be in- 
tegrated with regression methods can be an option to handle ontology 
problems along with managing confounders. Another avenue of NLP can 
be adopted in regular PV data in purposes of reducing the large space 
of drug-drug-event associations inherently present in SRSs and allowing 
further processing in the context of DDI signal detection [ 134 ]. 

Whereas from ML perspective, PPIN framework provides a better 
overall performance concerning both accuracy and speciﬁcity compared 
to other methods. While, SVM appears to have the best overall DDI pre- 
dictive performance in terms of AUROC compared to other supervised 
ML in predicting DDI signals [135–140] . However, SVM has inherited 
limitations represented in the time lapse of model running and the black 
box nature limiting the interpretation of the prediction outcomes. In re- 
cent years, the dawn of adopting supervised ML in PV signal detection 
has resulted from the evolution of multiple useful biomedical knowl- 
edge resources as gold standards of labeled DDIs (e.g. DrugBank [ 141 ], 
KEGG, Micromedex), besides using these resources to assess the predic- 
tive performance of supervised ML avenues. 

The use of supervised ML has its limits such as class imbalance, sparse 
features, low overlapping and consistency between diﬀerent DDIs re- 
sources [ 142 ]. Therefore, advancements in incorporating unsupervised 
ML approaches in DDIs discovery studies, improvements of DDI cor- 
pora annotation, and establishing standardized guidelines for establish- 
ing DDI gold reference datasets are probably essential steps to develop 
more realistic ML frameworks during drug-development, as well as, pre- 
marketing phases. Other directions of developments to be implemented 
into routine PV practices are represented in how ML may contribute 
in boosting DDI signal detection from SRS data and/or predicting their 
types/change in severity, combining more than one data sources (e.g. 
EHRs, patient support programs, prospective surveys, randomized con- 
trolled trials, etc.) rather than restricting to SRS data, assessing ML al- 
gorithmic performance by constructing reliable test sets, in addition to 
advancing frameworks for increasing transparency or explainability of 
ML outputs. 

According to the abovementioned illustrations and beyond the struc- 
tured PV data sources, the exponential increase of the scientiﬁc liter- 
ature complicates the exploration of such biomedical corpora [ 143 ]. 
Biomedical corpora enables constructing learning datasets of medically 
related terms that embed prior knowledge and aid in the pragmatic use 
of certain words within speciﬁc contexts [ 120 ]. Informatics-based meth- 
ods, in particular text mining and ML frameworks have great applicabil- 
ity in this regard to aid in extracting, analyzing and classifying biological 
information designated in scientiﬁc publications. During the past years, 
biomedical corpora have presented a valuable PV data source for the 
detection and analysis of DDI signals. The unstructured nature of this 
type of data sources is challenging. Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
approaches are crucial in this context to annotate, standardize and map 

relevant medical terminologies and generic drug names is crucial for 
implementing reliable computational models. 

8. Concluding remarks 

The availability of freely available safety data sources along with 
the adoption of novel DM and/or ML methods has advanced the PV 
domain. In this review, we particularly focus on developments in in- 
formatics techniques in the context of DDI signals. We have shown a 
portfolio of PV resources, DM and ML approaches techniques proposed 
to discover adverse DDI signals. Each method may re-stimulate interest 
to evolve DDI surveillance practices by oﬀering diﬀerent prospects. To 
the best we know, the underlying paper is the ﬁrst review combining 
machine learning and data mining methods to disclose potential signals 
of DDIs in drug safety surveillance. Possible causal DDIs associations are 
experimented during drug development cycle, then monitored via post- 
marketing PV systems after being in market. Developing better predic- 
tive methods, to ﬂag potential DDI signals, becomes of great importance 
to industry and regulatory bodies [144,145] . 

The black box nature of ML methods is one of their major limita- 
tions leading to diﬃculty in interpreting of what features are impor- 
tant and/or interpreting the model results. However, generally, adopting 
informatics-driven methods to be implemented in regular drug develop- 
ment process will be valuable. Since this will enable greater linkage 
between basic experimental platforms and controlled clinical settings 
early during drug development phases, then empowering the analysis of 
important safety concerns for investigational drugs at earlier stages lead- 
ing to more eﬃcient triage for novel drug candidates for further steps in 
the development process [ 146 ]. Boosted predictive approaches can be 
achieved by integrating structural and biological knowledge with en- 
riched safety datasets [ 147 ] . Previous studies have shown beneﬁts from 
linking drugs’ phenotypic, therapeutic, structural, and genomic informa- 
tion in revealing DDI patterns in both drug discovery and postmarketing 
PV processes [148–150] . 

Innovative  paradigms  have  arisen  from  exploiting  various  data 
sources compared to conventional PV practices, permitting for the ac- 
tive monitoring of DDI drug proﬁles. As spontaneous systems are con- 
sidered the biggest assembly of real world data for distinguishing DDIs 
[151–154] . The discovery of higher-order drug–event combinations is 
more challenging than identifying signals of single drug–event pairs due 
to the limitation of under-reporting rates in large SRSs. Although the 
DDI detection research shifted away from SRSs utilization into other 
data sources in the recent years, this couldn’t replace the main role of 
SRSs in regular PV. Accordingly, more eﬀorts are required in purposes 
of evolving methods for routine DDIs discovery across diﬀerent safety 
data sources. 

Also, the main challenge in DDI signal detection studies is the lack 
of well-established guidances for assessing informatics-driven methods 
performance. Principally, this is due to the lack of reference standard for 
interaction safety proﬁles of the whole marketed drug products [ 155 ]. 
Hence, researchers should conduct more studies with purposes for ac- 
quiring better comprehension to the landscapes of multivariate associ- 
ation measures along with estimating corresponding predictive perfor- 
mance. Furthermore, developing approaches targeting the estimation of 
optimal DDI signal detection thresholds that achieve balanced trade-oﬀ
between sensitivity and speciﬁcity with decreasing false signals can be 
a valuable perspective. 

In conclusion, informatics-driven approaches don’t prove causality 
association, but instead they can be valuable complementary tool to 
ﬂag hypotheses of DDI combinations and support signal assessment. 
Comprehensive clinical judgment will always endure fundamental for 
establishing causal relationships between drugs and safety concerns.
