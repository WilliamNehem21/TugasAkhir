The DeNitriﬁcation–DeComposition (DNDC) model is a process model with a series of carbon and nitrogen bio-
geochemistry in agro-ecosystems. It incorporates the driving factors of the ecological environment and aims to
simulate the carbon and nitrogen cycle in the terrestrial ecosystem. Furthermore, the model can be applied effec-
tively in a paddy ecosystem. Based on an investigation and literature review, this study summarized and analyzed
the impact of agricultural practices such as water management, fertilizer application, and straw incorporation on
greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon storage. After years of improvement, the DNDC model can presently be
used effectively to evaluate the carbon sequestration and emissions mitigation potential of various agricultural
practices. However, the related details of scientiﬁc processes of agricultural management, such as biochar incor-
poration and plastic mulching in paddy ﬁelds, should be added or modiﬁed and combined with experimental
cases of actual agricultural practices to complete the calibration of the model, provide theoretical support for
its promotion, and establish a reliable method of evaluating carbon sequestration and emissions mitigation in
paddy ﬁelds.

1. Introduction

The agricultural ecosystem provides the food people require and
also crucially carries carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the C and N cycle.
The ecosystem is affected by numerous natural and human factors,
such as soil, climate, crops, and agricultural practices. All these factors
are connected to each other through substance and energy exchange,
forming a complex biogeochemical system. However, because of
human activities, the agricultural ecosystem is a critical source of non-
carbon dioxide (non-CO2) greenhouse gases (GHGs), which account
for 56% of anthropogenic emissions of non-CO2 GHGs (IPCC, 2014).
Methane (CH4) emissions from the global agricultural ecosystems are
3.22 × 106 Gg CO2-eq yr−1 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are
5.99 × 106 Gg CO2-eq yr−1 (FAO, 2020). Paddy ﬁelds are vital parts of
an agricultural ecosystem, and their harvest area accounts for 23% of
the total area of cereal crop cultivation worldwide (FAO, 2020). Because
of prolonged ﬂood water management, soil has been maintained in an
anaerobic reduction condition during rice growing seasons, which pro-
vides favorable conditions for CH4 production. CH4 emissions from
paddy ﬁelds account for 18% of emissions from agricultural sources
(FAO, 2020). In addition, the application of N fertilizer, water-saving ir-
rigation, and certain other agricultural practices promote N2O emissions
from paddy ﬁelds. Annual N2O emissions in China are approximately 33
Gg N, accounting for 14% of the emissions from agricultural soils (Aliyu
et al., 2019). Furthermore, the improvement of the C storage of paddy
ﬁelds is crucial in mitigating global warming. The C storage of upper
paddy soil (0–30 cm) in China is 1.6 Pg C, and the C sequestration poten-
tial is 0.9 Pg C (Qin et al., 2013). Therefore, when stabilizing rice produc-
tion, the adoption of agricultural practices that increase the C pool
content of paddy soil and reduce GHG emissions (C sequestration and
emissions mitigation for short) is a crucial measure for coping with
global climate change.

To accurately assess the impact of agricultural practices on the C se-
questration and emissions mitigation potential of paddy ecosystems, un-
derstanding the C and N cycle of paddy ecosystems is crucial. Much basic
data has been accumulated through ﬁeld observation and simulation ex-
periments for understanding the scientiﬁc process of the C and N cycle in
terrestrial ecosystems. With the continuous improvement of science and
technology as well as the deepening awareness of the C and N cycle's
mechanisms, scientists have begun to develop models to quantify and
predict the substance ﬂow of ecosystems. Among them, the process-
oriented model, based on the biogeochemical process of C and N dynamic
migration, collects the key processes and their control factors in the agri-
cultural ecosystem. The process-based model can effectively expand the
scope of analysis from limited site experiments to unlimited scales in
time and space and also provide a practical method for quantitative mea-
surements of the C and N cycle in the agricultural ecosystem.

At present, a series of process models are recommended in IPCC
guidelines for national GHG inventories, including the Century, RothC,
CH4MOD, and DNDC-Rice (originating from the DNDC model) models.
The DNDC model, developed by Li et al. (1992), has been used in various
countries and regions to simulate the C and N cycle in agricultural, wet-
land, forest, and grassland ecosystems. In a paddy ecosystem, the DNDC
model is mainly used to evaluate soil C and N dynamics and GHG emis-
sions. After years of development, the DNDC model can perform simula-
tions effectively and its efﬁcacy has been recognized by numerous
researchers.

Based on a series of biogeochemical processes, the DNDC model
combines ecological driving factors, environmental factors, and corre-
sponding physical and chemical processes to study the C and N cycle
in the terrestrial ecosystem. In the past few decades, many scholars
have jointly used and developed the DNDC model, adding new
submodules and biogeochemical process formulas and parameters.
The function of the model has been continually expanded, forming mul-
tiple forms such as Manure-DNDC, DNDC-online model, which can be
used to evaluate C and N dynamics, GHG emissions, nonpoint source
pollution, GHG economic beneﬁts, and other data (Gao et al., 2014;
Gilhespy et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2017), and it has been widely veriﬁed
and applied worldwide. This review mainly introduces the research
progress regarding the DNDC model in evaluating the effects of agricul-
tural practices on C sequestration and emissions mitigation in paddy
ecosystems.

2. Biogeochemical process of the DNDC model

The DNDC model is composed of an input interface, biogeochemical
ﬁeld, and core process. Users input the environmental driving factors
(including meteorological data, soil parameters, crop parameters, and
agricultural practices) of the target ecosystem through the input inter-
face. The target environmental characteristics are used to build the bio-
geochemical ﬁeld and to transform the driving factors into driving
forces of chemical element movement. The core process determines
the biogeochemical reactions before ﬁnally completing the calculation
and simulation of C, N, and moisture in the ecosystem. In the book Bio-
geochemistry: Scientiﬁc Basis and Model Method (Fig. 1), Li (2016) elabo-
rated the detailed submodules and processing mechanism process of
the model and also discussed the scientiﬁc basis and calculation process
supporting the model.

2.1. Soil climate

DNDC model can be used to simulate the gas from soil, such as CO2,
CH4, N2O, NH3, etc. The formation of CO2, CH4, and N2O in soil is mainly
the result of soil microbial activities, which are impacted by soil envi-
ronment. Therefore, correct simulations of soil climate, including soil
temperature, moisture, pH, and electrical potential (Eh) and related
substrate concentration, are critical for tracking GHG emissions.

The model uses the parameters of heat transfer rate, speciﬁc heat ca-
pacity, and thermal conductivity of soil to calculate soil temperature
layer by layer and balances the relationship of input water and output
water to calculate the soil moisture of each layer. In the paddy ecosys-
tem, the key to simulating CH4 and N2O emissions accurately is to com-
bine soil temperature, water dynamics, and gas ﬂux. To ﬁt the model to
a cold and snowy environment, the rain–snow submodule was modi-
ﬁed and agricultural snow cover model (snowMAUS) was embedded
in the DNDC model, enabling it to more effectively simulate the effects
of rain and snow on soil temperature and moisture (Cui and Wang,
2019). The DNDC-Rice model improved the simulation of soil leakage
and evapotranspiration and it calculates the soil water content layer
by layer in an hourly step, alters the soil water content with the param-
eters of irrigation time and duration, and deﬁnes the water leakage rate
(leakage to the 50-cm-deep soil layer at 1 mm day-1 rate), thereby
implementing the dynamic simulation of water in continuous ﬂooding
and alternating dry–wet treatment (Katayanagi et al., 2012). To

accurately simulate the GHG emissions of paddy ﬁelds in India, Pathak
et al. (2005) increased the leakage rate of certain reaction substrates
in soil in the model, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate.
The results of the optimized model greatly reduced CH4 emissions at the
high leakage point but had no effect on those at the low or medium
leakage point.

2.2. Plant growth

Plant growth is closely related to the dynamics of C and N in the ter-
restrial ecosystem, which is also the basic step for the DNDC model to
correctly simulate the dynamics of C and N in the soil–crop–atmosphere
cycle. To accurately simulate crop growth, the model developers
established crop submodules and integrated relevant crop growth
models, such as the simple empirical equation, PnET (Photosynthesis-
Evapotranspiration), EFEM (Economic Farm Emission Model), NEST
(Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature), and general crop model
MACROS (Modules of an Annual CROp Simulator) (Zhang et al., 2002;
Li et al., 2004; Zhang and Niu, 2016).

The optimized model can simulate the daily growth of crops, the ab-
sorption of soil water and N elements by crops, the potential productiv-
ity of crops, the growth of crops under the conditions of water and
nutrient constraints, and the DOC of a reaction substrate transported
into soil by plant root secretions (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the optimized
model can track the circulation of C, N, and water in the ecosystem dur-
ing plant growth. It uses nine crop parameters (maximum biomass pro-
duction; biomass fraction of grain, leaf, stem, and root; biomass C/N
ratio; annual N demand; thermal degree days for maturity; water de-
mand; N ﬁxation index; optimum temperature; and vascularity) to de-
ﬁne rice plant and simulate the daily growth and potential productivity
of rice. The DNDC model calculates the stress index of water and N to
evaluate the absorption of soil water and N by crops. The DOC of a reac-
tion substrate transported to soil by plant root secretion is calculated to
track the circulation of C, N, and water in the ecosystem during rice
growth. At present, crop parameters in the DNDC model mainly come
from observed values in North America and China. Users can use the de-
fault values or create their own simulated crops. Katayanagi et al.
(2013) veriﬁed the N balance in the DNDC-Rice model using rice crop
parameters in Japan. The results indicated that the observed values of

grain, stem, and root biomass were consistent with the simulated values
(root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 13, 16, and 7%, respectively), but
the leaf area index, leaf biomass, and leaf N content were overestimated
(RMSE = 125, 60, and 37%, respectively), mainly because of the overes-
timation of rice N absorption and leaf N assimilation.

rates. The decomposition process is affected by many factors, such as or-
ganic matter type and soil texture (Li, 2016). The DNDC model can accu-
rately simulate SOC and its dynamic change under speciﬁc climates
(R2 = 0.96) and can also complete long-term estimation (Zhang and
Shao, 2017; Ku et al., 2019).

2.3. Carbon dynamics

2.4. Greenhouse gas emissions

Soil organic carbon (SOC) content is a crucial indicator of soil fertil-
ity. In DNDC model, soil organic carbon residues in agro-ecosystem di-
vide into 4 major pools: residues, microbe, humads, and passive
carbon (Fig. 3). Each pool has 2 or 3 sub-pools with speciﬁc default de-
composition rates, which affected by soil temperature, soil moisture,
soil texture and substrate concentration, etc. SOC is utilized by plants
and microorganisms and ﬁnally participates in the C and N cycle. The ac-
cumulation of crop residues, manure, biochar, and microbial residues in
paddy soil constitutes a critical source of soil's SOC pool. According to
their physical and chemical properties, exogenous carbon sources are
allocated to different subpools of SOC with default decomposition

The production and consumption of CO2, CH4, and N2O in soil occur
through different redox reactions (decomposition, nitriﬁcation/denitri-
ﬁcation, and methane production) (Fig. 4). Eh determines whether a re-
action can occur. The model constructs the “anaerobic balloon,” uses the
Nernst equation to calculate Eh in the system, and then uses Eh to judge
which redox reaction should occur. The balloon uses the Michaelis–
Menten equation to quantify the kinetic effect of substrate concentra-
tion on the reaction rate, realizing the conjugate calculation of the ther-
modynamics and kinetics of the redox reaction generated by GHGs.
Moreover, the model deﬁnes the interior of the balloon as a relatively
reduced soil microarea and the exterior as an oxidized one and allocates

and exterior of the balloon proportionally to produce reduction or oxi-

Because of the special water management mode of paddy ﬁelds, the
soil water ﬂuctuates frequently between states of saturation and
unsaturation, and the range of Eh variation can be from +650 to
−350 mV. CH4 and N2O can only be produced under speciﬁc Eh condi-
tions (CH4, −300 to −150 mV; N2O, 200 to 500 mV) (Li, 2016). In the

model, O2, NO3
and H2 and DOC are used as electron donors to more effectively track
the change of soil Eh, determine the reaction rate of each oxidation/re-
duction reaction, and calculate the generation and consumption of CH4
and N2O (Fumoto et al., 2008; Katayanagi et al., 2012).

3. Carbon sequestration and emissions mitigation of paddy ﬁelds

The DNDC model employs the climate, soil, crop, and agricultural
management of the ecosystem as the environmental driving factors;
constructs the soil biogeochemical ﬁeld, including temperature, mois-
ture, pH, Eh, and substrate concentration; adopts the biogeochemical
process in the C and N cycle as the core process; and ﬁnally, completes
the dynamic simulation of the C and N cycle of the ecosystem. The
DNDC model combines agricultural practices such as crop growth,
water management, fertilizer management, and tillage. After agricul-
tural practices are input, the change of the biogeochemical ﬁeld in the
model affects the C and N cycle in the system, thereby affecting the C se-
questration and emissions mitigation effect of the paddy ecosystem
(Fig. 5). In a paddy ecosystem, agricultural practices affect the C and N
cycle and have a critical impact on its C sequestration and emissions
mitigation potential (Table 1).

3.1. Carbon sequestration potential of a paddy ecosystem

3.1.1. Effect of exogenous carbon addition on the carbon sequestration po-
tential of a paddy ecosystem

Agricultural practices are the main reason for SOC change. SOC
change is induced by two processes: (1) the consumption of SOC by mi-
croorganisms through heterotrophic respiration and (2) the addition of
exogenous C. The model calculates the daily change in SOC storage by

calculating the C output (soil respiration and DOC leaching) and C
input (such as straw return, plant litter, and manure input) of soil
daily and accumulates the daily change in SOC storage to obtain the an-
nual change (Li, 2016).

Exogenous C input, such as straw return, manure input, or biochar
application, can promote the accumulation of soil SOC. Yan et al.
(2011) found that the average organic C content in the surface soil
(0–20 cm) of cropland in China increased from 11.95 g kg−1 during
1979–1982 to 12.67 g kg−1 during 2007–2008, with an average annual
growth rate of 0.22%. Based on the Geographic Information System
(GIS) database of soil properties and agricultural management systems,
the C sequestration of farmland soil for the next 30 years was estimated.
The estimations revealed that the soil in East Sichuan is in a state of con-
tinuous C sequestration under current management practices (Zhang
and Shao, 2017). The main reason is the increase of crop yield and exog-
enous C caused by straw return, which is an effective measure for soil C
sequestration. With the increase of the straw return proportion in
China, SOC will continue to increase; however, the decomposition rate
of straw left on the surface is higher than that of straw buried in the
soil, which is not conducive to the accumulation of SOC. Adding tillage
methods and the amount of straw return to the model can help simulate
and evaluate the effect of different depths of straw return on C
sequestration.

Without straw return or manure application, the SOC of a paddy
ﬁeld will continue to decrease. Fresh straw return and decomposed
straw manure application can increase soil SOC content by 9% and
11%, respectively (Ku et al., 2019). Manure application can promote
the increase of soil SOC content mainly because its decomposition rate
is lower than that of fresh straw. The combined simulation results of
DSSAT crop model and the DNDC model indicate that soil SOC stock
can be increased by 28% with the combined application of chemical fer-
tilizer and manure (Naher et al., 2020). When straw and other biomass
are cracked into biochar, their properties become stable and they are
beneﬁcial for C sequestration when applied to cropland. Stable biochar
can ﬁx more C in the soil. A meta-analysis revealed that biochar could
signiﬁcantly increase the SOC content of farmland surface soil (Liu
et al., 2016). In the model, biochar is classiﬁed into inert C pools with
low decomposition rates. However, biochar contains some easily de-
composable components, and its stability varies depending on the
source. Therefore, determining how to use the model to evaluate the C
sequestration potential of soil after biochar application remains to be
completed.

3.1.2. Effect of tillage practices on the carbon sequestration potential of a
paddy ecosystem

In addition to the application of exogenous C, the long-term use of
plowing tillage, rotary tillage, and other traditional tillage methods in
the agricultural ecosystem has effects on soil mineralization, thereby af-
fecting SOC accumulation. No-tillage practices can ﬁx C by reducing the
disturbance of soil and the decomposition rate of the C pool. However,
according to the results of the DNDC model, the potential of no tillage
for soil C sequestration is highly limited. In Jiangsu, China, the soil C se-
questration potential at 0–30 cm soil depth under reduced tillage, no
tillage, and combined tillage (reduced tillage and 30% straw incorpora-
tion), was quantitatively estimated, which indicated that the applica-
tion of reduced tillage and no tillage could increase the accumulation
of SOC in some paddy ﬁelds, and combined tillage had twice potential
for C sequestration than in reduced tillage (Xu et al., 2012b). Site exper-
iment and model simulation results in Ningxia and Hunan province also
showed that the effect of no tillage combined with straw return on soil C
sequestration was superior to that of no tillage only (Huang et al., 2012).
However, some studies have conﬁrmed that no tillage practices lead to
soil hardening and affect soil aeration and crop yield (Pittelkow et al.,
2015). Therefore, comprehensive consideration is required when
assessing the C sequestration potential of tillage practices.

3.2. Greenhouse gas emissions mitigation potential of a paddy ecosystem

3.2.1. Effects of water management measures on the emissions mitigation
potential of a paddy ecosystem

CH4 is produced by methanogenic bacteria using soil humus, rice
root exudates, soil microbial residues, and organic materials as sub-
strates. In the root exudation area (around the root) or soil micro-
oxidation area, some CH4 is oxidized to CO2 and H2O by methanotrophic
bacteria, and some CH4 that is not oxidized is discharged into the atmo-
sphere through rice plants, bubbles, and liquid diffusion. The model
builds a module based on an anaerobic balloon, which can effectively
implement and stimulate CH4 and N2O emissions in ﬂooded paddy
ﬁelds.

Flooded paddy ﬁelds are a critical source of CH4 emissions, and the
key to reducing such emissions is to optimize water management.
Mid-season drainage not only inhibits the ineffective tillering of rice
through water stress but also reduces CH4 emissions through promoting
the oxidation of CH4. Compared with continuous ﬂooding, mid-season
drainage can signiﬁcantly reduce the total CH4 emissions from paddy
ﬁelds by 36% to 77% (Zou et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2012b). Li et al.
(2004, 2005) used the DNDC model to evaluate the potential of paddy
emissions mitigation in China, and their results indicated that mid-
season drainage water management could reduce CH4 emissions by
4.2–4.7 Tg CH4-C yr-1 while increasing N2O emissions by 0.13–0.20 Tg
N2O-N yr-1 from paddy ﬁelds in China. Compared with the practice of
single drainage, multiple drainage can further reduce CH4 emissions
during rice growth (Sander et al., 2016), which is consistent with simu-
lation results of the model (Minamikawa et al., 2016). Compared with
ﬂooding, single and multiple drainage in 2051–2060 reduced CH4 emis-
sions by 21.9–22.9% and 53.5–55.2%, respectively, under the RCP4.5 sce-
nario (Minamikawa et al., 2016).

In addition, the DNDC model can deﬁne numerous water manage-
ment modes. This enables the simulation analysis of GHG emission sce-
narios under various types of water management to effectively predict
their emissions mitigation potential in time and space scales. After pa-
rameterizing two rice varieties, namely M206 (a high-yield and semi-
dwarf variety) and Koshihikari (a traditional variety), Simmonds et al.
(2015) simulated the grain yield and CH4 and N2O emissions of rice
under different N loads and water management types with water-
seeding and dry-seeding cultivation. The results indicated that DNDC
could distinguish the rice yield of the two varieties and reproduce the
CH4 emission dynamics under different management scenarios.
Water-saving irrigation management, such as controlled irrigation and

alternate wetting and drying, can signiﬁcantly reduce CH4 emissions
but may also promote N2O emissions (Zhou et al., 2020). Field experi-
ment and model evaluation results revealed that alternate wetting
and drying effectively reduced CH4 emissions during rice growing sea-
sons but also simultaneously stimulated N2O emissions; furthermore,
the comprehensive global warming potential (GWP) was only one-
third of that under ﬂooding management (Katayanagi et al., 2012).
The model could also effectively simulate the dynamics of CH4 emission
peak values in the rice–dry crop rotation system, which was basically
consistent with ﬁeld observation results (Zhang, 2013; Chun et al.,
2016).

3.2.2. Effect of nitrogen management on emissions mitigation potential of a
paddy ecosystem

Chemical N fertilizer and manure provide the substrate source for
soil nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation microorganisms, which is the most
critical factor affecting N2O emissions. The global annual N2O emissions
from the application of chemical N fertilizer and manure were 2.0 ± 0.8
Tg N and 0.6 ± 0.4 Tg N, respectively (Li and Ju, 2020). The N2O emis-
sions caused by the ﬁeld fertilization practice accounted for 33% of
total N2O emissions. The continuously increasing amount of fertilizer
being applied has been the main reason for the global N2O emissions in-
crease. Many studies have conﬁrmed that soil N2O emissions increase
linearly or exponentially with the increase of N application
(Shcherbak et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018).

To reduce the application amount of N fertilizer, improve the utiliza-
tion rate, and reduce the N2O emissions of cropland soil, many scientists
have summarized a concept and technology based on the optimization
of N management called the 4Rs: right fertilizer rate, right application
time, right place, and right source. The submodule of N application in
the model includes factors such as the type, amount, time, and mode
of application, which provide a foundation for the estimation of the im-
pact of 4R technology on GHG emissions.

Based on DNDC model, the simulated value of crop yield was ﬁtted
the measured value well in rice-wheat rotation system under different
N application, which reﬂected the relationship between crop yield and
N application; when N fertilizer application reached 60% of the conven-
tional amount, the increase in N no longer promoted a signiﬁcant in-
crease in crop yield, whereas the comprehensive greenhouse effect
decreased by 43% compared with the conventional practice (Li, 2012).
After the rice varieties were parameterized by Simmonds et al. (2015),
the model could reproduce the CH4 emission dynamics under different
amounts of N fertilizer and different ﬂooding times. The results of DNDC
estimation indicated that GHG emissions could be reduced without af-
fecting the crop yield through reducing the amount of N applied based
on the current amount. At present, a large potential exists for reducing
the use of chemical N fertilizer in China. The paddy yield will be stabi-
lized when the amount of N fertilizer is reduced by 0.88 Tg per year.
In the main rice growing regions of China, such as Jiangsu, Yunnan, Gui-
zhou, and Hubei provinces, GHG emissions can be reduced by as much
as 40% through N fertilizer reduction (Chen et al., 2016).

3.2.3. Effect of exogenous carbon addition on the emissions mitigation po-
tential of a paddy ecosystem

The reasonable addition of exogenous C can affect CH4 emissions in
paddy ﬁelds. Numerous studies have shown that all types of exogenous
C, such as straw, green manure, and organic manure, provide rich sub-
strates for methanogens and can signiﬁcantly promote CH4 emissions
from rice ﬁelds (Wang et al., 2012b; Zhou et al., 2020). Compared
with no exogenous carbon addition, manure input and straw incorpora-
tion enhanced CH4 emission per unit of rice yield signiﬁcantly, with 54%
and 107% increase respectively (Zhao et al., 2019b). Straw return or ma-
nure application can suddenly increase the content of soil organic mat-
ter, but it will be gradually decomposed by soil microorganisms,
providing a rich substrate for methanogens and other microorganisms.
The model constructed the effect of environmental conditions on

S. Yin et al. / Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 140–149

147

microbial decomposition activity, which can accurately reproduce the
biogeochemical process of exogenous C addition.

In addition, CH4 emissions increased signiﬁcantly under the scenar-
ios of high straw return and manure application (Wang et al., 2012a).
The results of model simulations and ﬁeld experiments indicated that
N2O emissions were affected by straw return amount, return type, and
return depth. Returning straw to the ﬁeld after incineration resulted in
signiﬁcantly higher N2O emissions than returning to the ﬁeld directly
(Chen et al., 2015). After the indices of alfalfa and broad bean were pa-
rameterized in the DNDC model, the observed values and simulated re-
sults of Gao et al. (2016) revealed that the application of alfalfa and
broad bean straw during rice growing season signiﬁcantly increased
CH4 emissions, and the effect of broad bean straw was greater than
that of Alfalfa straw. In different rice rotation systems, the GHG emission
of a rice–Chinese milk vetch rotation system was lower than that of a
rice–wheat rotation system (Zhang et al., 2019b). However, the model
cannot accurately express the effect of biochar treatment on CH4 and
N2O because no speciﬁc input parameter exists for biochar in the
model (Wang, 2013).

3.2.4. Effect of coupling agricultural practices on the emissions mitigation
potential of a paddy ecosystem

In actual rice production, the pairing of water and fertilizer and other
agricultural practices is often used to stabilize the yield and reduce GHG
emissions. A reduction in N application by 15.7% would not reduce rice
yield in China, and the combination of shallow irrigation and appropri-
ate fertilization could reduce GHG emissions by 34.3% while increasing
the rice yield by 1.7% (Chen et al., 2016). The most effective measures
for GHG emission mitigation in paddy ﬁelds are upland rice cultivation
N shallow irrigation N use of ammonium sulfate instead of urea or am-
monium bicarbonate N medium-term sun drying N straw return in
nonrice-growing season N application of slow-release fertilizer N contin-
uous ﬂooding irrigation (Li et al., 2006). Tian et al. (2018) paired the
DNDC model with the DSSAT model and Agro-Ecological Zone model
to evaluate the balance relationship between GHG emissions and yield
under Chinese rice-planting conditions. The simulation results showed
that CH4 and N2O emissions could be reduced while the yield was guar-
anteed under the double management measures of mid-season drain-
age and balanced fertilization. The DNDC model can also be used to
analyze the N balance and N use efﬁciency of paddy ﬁelds under differ-
ent irrigation, fertilization, and controlled drainage conditions. When
water-saving irrigation is applied and the amount of N applied does
not exceed 180 kg N ha-1, the soil N pool of paddy ﬁeld is loss (54.7–-
127.6 kg N ha-1). Except for shallow irrigation–deep storage–medium
level N application and shallow irrigation–deep storage–high N applica-
tion, the N deﬁcit of controlled drainage treatment was greater than that
in conventional drainage treatment. The combination of shallow irriga-
tion, deep storage, medium level N, and controlled drainage was the op-
timal water and fertilizer treatment mode (Liu and Shao, 2013).

The application of plastic mulching cultivation technology can solve
the problem of winter irrigation of paddy rice in northwest China, and it
is also a crucial form of agricultural management for CH4 emission mit-
igation. Compared with continuous ﬂooding, plastic mulching could sig-
niﬁcantly reduce CH4 emissions by 86% while maintaining rice yield
(Zhang et al., 2013). Moreover, compared with a ﬁeld without
mulching, the soil climate of a ﬁeld with mulching was signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent, mainly with respect to ﬁeld evapotranspiration, heat exchange,
and soil aeration, which affected the soil temperature and moisture, mi-
crobial activity, and gas diffusion emissions. Many studies have modi-
ﬁed and optimized the mulching submodule of the DNDC model (Han
et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2019a; Zhou et al., 2019). The model can sim-
ulate the soil temperature and moisture accurately under different
mulching density scenarios. However, few studies have been conducted
on GHG emissions simulation under the condition of paddy ﬁeld
mulching.

In addition, cultivating and selecting varieties with excellent drought
resistance and high yield play crucial roles in water saving and emissions
mitigation. In recent years, China has developed a new variety of culti-
vated rice, namely water-saving and drought-resistant rice (WDR),
which differs from lowland and upland rice varieties. WDR has the char-
acteristics of high-yield and high-quality rice and the water-saving and
drought-resistant properties of upland rice. When irrigation was reduced
by 50%, the yield and quality of WDR were the same as those of traditional
rice (Luo, 2018). When irrigation was reduced by 70%, its CH4 emissions
decreased by 51–77% while the yield remained relatively stable (Sun
et al., 2016). The emergence of WDR combines the advantages of the
high yield of lowland rice and low water demand of upland rice. The
water demand, root exudates, and root oxygen secretion ability differ
from those of conventional lowland rice, resulting in the speciﬁcity of
GHG emissions and N loss. How to make more effective use of the
DNDC model to evaluate its potential in paddy ﬁeld emissions mitigation
is one of the directions for model improvement and optimization.

4. Conclusion

It is critical to recognize the potential of C sequestration and emis-
sions mitigation in paddy ﬁelds for dealing with global climate change.
Many studies have made numerous achievements in case studies of C
sequestration and emissions mitigation. Since the establishment of the
DNDC model, researchers worldwide have used their ﬁeld data to verify
and correct the model, which has caused the continual increase of its
credibility and continual expansion of its functionality and scope. The
model can now be used in various terrestrial ecosystems to predict
crop growth, soil C and N dynamics, GHG emissions, and N loss.

After modiﬁcation and calibration, the model has been applied to the
assessment of GHG emissions and the SOC sequestration potential of C
sequestration and emissions mitigation measures such as straw return,
water management, and N reduction. Moreover, it is necessary to fur-
ther analyze the effects of various management measures—such as
straw return to the ﬁeld, biochar application, and water management
from ﬂooding to water-saving irrigation—on the comprehensive poten-
tial of C sequestration and emissions mitigation in paddy ﬁelds; thus,
the timing for exogenous C application and water management can be
arranged and the C sequestration and emissions mitigation potential
of this measure can be maximized.

With the aggravation of environmental problems and the improve-
ment of agricultural practices, expectations for the prediction function
of the model are increasing. In the future, it will be necessary to evaluate
the comprehensive effects of various farmland measures on SOC
change, GHG emissions, food security, and ecological environments.
How to make more effective use of the DNDC model to serve the low-
C production of rice from the point to regional scale as well as how to
establish a reliable prediction and evaluation system under agricultural
practices and climate scenarios are the development trends for the
model's application.
