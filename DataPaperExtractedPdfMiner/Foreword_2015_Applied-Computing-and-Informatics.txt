Foreword

Dear Colleagues,

Applied Computing and Informatics (ACI) was established as
journal over 13 years ago.
Saudi Computer Society’s ofﬁcial
Throughout its journey, the journal has seen ups and downs.
Nevertheless, it’s still standing as the only ofﬁcial journal of the
Saudi Computer Society (SCS). Being so means a great responsi-
integrity, publishing ethics and
bility to strive for quality,
universality.

Since I accepted the responsibility as EiC of the ACI journal
two years ago, we have received 292 Manuscripts from 39
Countries. With Elsevier as our publisher, and King Saud
University as our main support, the Journal is picking up more
momentum and gaining reputation. Reviewers remain an integral
part of processing and publishing articles for ACI. We received the support of 632 reviewers from
66 countries to provide us valued comments and suggestions and hence keeping the quality of the
manuscripts.

Our future challenges include:

•

•

•

Finding sponsoring organizations to support this and other journals to come from the Saudi
Computer Society.
Sustaining quality to achieve further desired outcomes such as international and academic
indexing.
Encouraging international researchers, editors, advisors, and authors to utilize ACI as a plat-
form to propagate innovation and creativity. Incentives such as a best paper award can help
achieve this.

With the newly elected Saudi Computer Society (SCS) council members, I have great hopes that

the only direction for our journal is up.

With best regards
Prof. Hatim A. Aboalsamh
Editor-in-chief
