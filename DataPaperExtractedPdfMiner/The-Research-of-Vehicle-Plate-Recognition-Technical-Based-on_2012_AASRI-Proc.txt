Abstract 

In  the  aspect  of  character,  after  analyses  of  license  plate  recognition  technology  home  and  abroad,  we  use  weighted 
statistics to make plate in the image in a more prominent position. At the same time, we combine the thick grid feature 
extraction and momentum BP algorithm to distinguish license. This method improves the accuracy and speed of character 
recognition.

1. Introduction 

With  the  development  of  social  economy,  the  automobile  industry  and  the  transport  industry,  road 
transport  has  become  much  more  important  than  railway  transport.  But  with  the  increasing  popularity  of 
motor  vehicles,  the  phenomenon  of  traffic  congestion  is  getting  more  serious  and  automated  traffic 
management  has  become  a  serious  problem.  Intelligent  Transport  System  (ITS)[1]  produced  an  effective 
solution to this problem,  which is proposed on the Intelligent Transportation Society of the United States in 
the 1990.

License  Plate  Recognition  (LPR)  is  an  important  component  of  ITS,  applied  in  the  field  of  electronic 
billing.  As  a  special  computer  vision  system  in  the  real-tine  case,  the  LPR  system  mainly  includes  the  sub 
system  of  license  plate  detection  and  character  recognition.  The  LPR  system  involves  numerous  discipline 
domains, such as Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Digital Image Processing 
etc.  The  LPR  system  can  distinguish  the  license  plate  numbers,  letters  and  Chinese  characters,  making  the 
computerized monitoring and management a reality. 

Based on image processing technology, the ultimate goal of LPR system is to identify all the license plate 
number and the color from the picture. It is difficult to  search for license plate characters directly  from the 
collected  images.  In  order  to  reduce  difficulty,  the  general  part  of  the  LPR  software  is  divided  into  three 
modules: the license plate location, character segmentation and character recognition. The task of license plate 
location is to determine plate position from the picture. The task of character segmentation is to cut out one by 
one after the positioning of characters in license plate images. The task of character recognition is to identify 
characters by segmentation. 

2. Image Preprocessing 

Due to many factors, the quality of images is poor in the process of signal collection and  importation. It 
usually contains different degrees of  noise, blurred,  tilted and defected.  The pretreatment  will  have a direct 
impact on the ease of recognition and identification of results. Pretreatment can not only  remove the image 
noise, improve image quality and reduce the negative impact, but also effectively reduce  the required storage 
space  of  the  system  and  improve  the  recognition  speed.  Image  preprocessing  usually  includes  gray-scale 
transformation, noise reduction, and image enhancement processing. 

2.1. Image gray processing 

As the camera used to capture images of the car are 24-bit true color image, while the majority of image 
processing techniques are directed at the 256 grayscale image, so it is necessary to convert the color image 
into  the  grayscale  image.  The  RGB  color  of  grayscale  and  color  image  in  grayscale  image  correspondence 
transformation relations are

2.2. Image noise removal and edge enhancement 

The  method  of  noise  removal  has  airspace  law  (such  as  median  filtering,  k  average  neighbor,  etc.)  and 
frequency-domain  method  (low-pass  filter  and  high-pass  filter).  Based  on  the  vehicle  license  plate 
identification, the edge definition of objects is higher. Therefore, we select the value filtering to carry on the 
image smoothing. 

In order to enhance the contrast of images, make license plate and the  background contrast stretching, to 
enhance image processing is necessary. In fact, image enhancement is an amendment to grayscale image. The 
main  objective  is  to  improve  the  definition  of  contour  lines  of  license  plate  number.  While  the  balance  of 
technology  of  the  straight  side  chart  is  the  best  and  the  algorithm  is  simple.  In  this  paper,  we  use  the  gray 
histogram  balanced  method  to  the  image  enhancement.  Suppose  having  n levels  grayscale  image,  and  the 
probability of  i  level grayscale appearance is ip , so it contains the information content is

close histogram of uniform distribution is the histogram equalizing. 

3. License plate location 

The license plate localization is the region which extract license plate from the plate image containing the 
license plate. In this paper, we use a weighted statistical method to make plate position to be prominent in the 
image. It is the concrete principle as follows. 

The object of weighted statistical method is the image which is composed of the element 0 and 1, carries 
on the line-by-line scanning to 2 value image, and adds a positive integer m to the weight value of a specific 
rectangle  domain  around  the  pixel  that  the  value  is  1.  For  example,  the  original  image  matrix  as  shown  in 
table 1. The specific rectangle domain is 3 (cid:117) 3, and m values is 1. After carring on the weighting operation, we 
obtained matrix as shown in table 2.

The length and breadth proportion of specific rectangle domain is 3.14:1(standard car license proportion of 
length and breadth). We carry on the weighting statistics operation to three kinds of graph as shown in figure 
1 (a), and get the result as shown in figure 1 (b).

4. Feature Extraction 

According to statistics of China's motor vehicle licensing standards[3], China  has three types of standard 
license plate to identify different objects at present. They are Chinese character, English character and digital 
& English, including 51 Chinese characters, 25 capital letters except I and 10 digitals. A total of more than 80 
license plate characters have the same size and uniform.  

The thick grid feature named as local gray feature is a part of Statistical characteristics. First, the thick grid 
feature extraction method is made the size and position of recognized characters normalized. Second, divide 
 part  and  count  the  number  of  pixels  of  each  grid.  Each  of  the  grid  reflects  a  particular 
grid  into 
character.  In  the  identification  stage,  the  grid  is  combined  as  statistical  characteristics  to  identify  the 
characters.

4.1. Image gray processing 

In order to eliminate bias on the lattice position, we need to move the whole lattice images of characters to 
the stipulation position, this process is known as the location of the normalized[4]. This paper uses the method 
based  on  the  center  of  mass  position  normalization.  First,  calculate  the  outside  frame  of  characters,  and 
discover the center, then move the characters center to the position which assigned. The anti-jamming ability 
of this method is strong. Calculate character center

The process that makes the transformation to the characters of different size, and cause them to become the 
identical  size  is  called  the  size  normalization.  There  are  commonly  has  two  kinds  of  size  normalization 
methods. 

One  kind  is  that  to  reduce  or  enlarge  the  character  outside  frame  to  proportionate  unification  size.  The 
other  kind  is  to  carry  on  the  size  normalization  according  to  the  distribution  of  black  picture  element  on 
horizontal and the vertical direction (goal picture element). 

4.2. Character feature extraction 

For  reserved  character  overall  construction  and  detail  characteristic,  after  normalization,  each  pixel  as  a 
grid  point  input  to  neural  network  sorter.  The  car  license  character  5(e.g.  Figure  2(a))  is  normalized  the

5. Character recognition algorithm based on BP neural network  

5.1. Technology of BP neural network 

BP  neural  network  is  essentially  a  set  of  samples  of  the  input  and  output  that  is  transformed  into  a 
nonlinear  optimization  problem.  It  is  a  learning  algorithm  through  the  gradient  algorithm  for  solving  the 
question of the weight (e.g. Figure 3). 

Figure3. BP neural network model

(cid:3)

The  BP  algorithm  has  not  only  the  input  spot,  the  output  spot,  but  also  one  or  many  concealed  spots. 
Regarding the input signal, firstly, it should disseminate the concealed stratification spot forward. After action 
function, BP disseminates the implicit strata point's output signal to the output spot. Finally network gives the 
output result. Excitation function usually selects the function:

If there are M levels in network, the level of M only contains outputs, and the first level is input point, the

When  revising  the  weight  gradient  descent  law,  before  considering  the  gradient  direction,  we  frequently

convergence rate is slow. For this reason propose the law that has the momentum gradient descent.

5.2. Design BP network 

(1) Input level’s number: To be normalized the grid of 

44(cid:117) , take each picture element spot as a network, 

and the input level neuron number takes 16. 

(2) Output level’s number: 51 Chinese characters, 25 capital letters except I and 10 digitals. 
(3) Concealed level’s number: This article uses three BP neural network that only has a concealed level.  

Concealed level’s number is calculated by the formula[6]: 

where  n  is input number,  m  is output number,  s  is concealed number, and  c  is integer between 1~10. So, 
there have 18 Chinese characters, 16 English character and 15 digitals in concealed level. The initial weight of 
BP network is defined in [0,1] . The initial value of learning factor and the momentum factor is respectively 
0.1 and 0.9.

After  analyze  the  experiment,  we  obtain  that  the  momentum  gradient  descent  law  restrain  quickly 
comparing  with  the  steepest  descent  law.  The  momentum  BP  law  needs  to  iterate  236  times  to  make  error 
reach restraining, but the steepest descent method needs to iterate 2088 times.

We can see digital and the letter recognition rate is high by Table 3, but the Chinese character recognition 
rate isn’t ideal. The reason is that on the one hand, English letter and digital quantity are few, but the Chinese 
characters  are  many.  On  the  other  hand,  the  structure  of  Chinese  character  is  complex.  In  addition,  in  the 
actual  operation  light,  weather,  photography  and  other  reasons  also  affect  the  recognition  rate  of  Chinese 
characters. 

6. Conclusions 

In this paper  we use  weighted statistics  to  make plate in the image in a  more  prominent position. At the 
same time, we combine the thick grid feature extraction and momentum BP algorithm to distinguish license. 
The momentum gradient descent law restrains quickly comparing with the steepest descent law by experiment. 
As there are so many kinds of plates, the paper only studies the common background of the blue license, 

thus the license for the other background is left for us to study in the future.
