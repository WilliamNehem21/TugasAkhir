Food traceability is an important aspect of the food safety supply chain to ensure efﬁcient tracking of produce to
check contamination and other foodborne diseases. The health and nutrition response after the Covid-19 pan-
demic requires a robust and diverse food supply chain in which traceability could play a major role. Since it is
an emerging ﬁeld of study with growing interest in the technological front, it is important to study the scientiﬁc
trend and research activities. This study provides an important insight into the food safety value chain response
towards modern food safety management systems through scientometric analysis. Scopus database was used to
retrieve the documents from the year 1992–2021. The research papers and conference papers were only chosen.
Vosviewer software was used to carry out the scientometric analysis. The distribution and growth trend of
documents, country-level distribution of publications, the relationship between authors and co-authors, etc.,
were analyzed. The intensity of publications from different countries and the collaborations was analyzed
using bibliometrix R-package. The year-wise research publication showed a rapid increase in the researchers
conducted on traceability systems to enhance food safety from 2014 onwards, mainly from the USA and China.
However, the research appeared to be in the developing phase compared to other technology implementation
and automation advancements.

1. Introduction

The importance of food supply chain was largely felt after the decla-
ration of Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 (WHO, 2020). The food sup-
ply chains throughout the world faced intermittent disruption due to the
lockdowns and restrictions imposed by the governments (Galanakis,
2020). The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC or U.S. CDC) which acts as the national public health agency of
the United States reported over 16,000 Covid-19 cases and 239 deaths
among workers of the country in meat processing facilities across 19
states (Dyal et al., 2020). Similarly, China noticed traces of the virus on
the beef imports reaching the country from Australia, Brazil, New
Zealand, and Bolivia (Singh and Liu, 2020). Similar incidents were also
reported from other countries of the world which led to ban on imports
and severe measures leading to adverse impact on trade and tariffs.

The food industry is still reliant on a large extent on the physical
paper records which mostly remains on the paper and difﬁcult to search
and covert into digital form. As such, traceability systems offer the nec-
essary solution leading to risk minimization that is critical to the assur-
ance of food safety in a connected world (Aung and Chang, 2014). The
traceability tool is utilized to identify the movement of food from pro-
duction to distribution along with necessary inspection and certiﬁcation
within the system. The transparency in the chain of events through the
traceability systems lead to minimization of possible fraud and cheating
(Pearson et al., 2019). Several upcoming researches and development
organizations are making use of advanced technologies such as Internet
of Things (IoT), distributed ledger and block chain technologies, wire-
less identiﬁcation sensor technology, etc., for capture and processing
of data leading to the efﬁciency in management of food systems
(Bouzembrak et al., 2019; Iftekhar and Cui, 2021). Blockchain technol-
ogy has helped the consumers to track the movement of food products
which leads to the reduction of counterfeiting, dilution and adulteration
of produce (Garaus and Treiblmaier, 2021). The study on consumer ben-
eﬁt through traceability systems have shown an improved access to in-
formation for making informed purchase decisions. The retailers also
beneﬁt through the access of information related to the origin of the
product (Islam and Cullen, 2021). These technological tools are data
driven thriving on cloud-based online solutions. The reliability of the
data is essential to ensure food safety chains from origin to destination.
The application of traceability on agricultural systems is also useful
in the creation of competitive advantage. The addition of value with
the integration of the traceability system and supply chain management
processes leads to better management of the business process and im-
provement of performance (Wang and Li, 2006). Traceability systems
also leads to proﬁtability and improvement in product quality since it
makes easy for the producer to recall the products from the market if
a defect is detected due to the efﬁcient tracking of the product. This
leads to better proﬁtability for the producer along with ensuring the
quality of the product available for the consumers (Bechini et al.,
2008; Cui et al., 2019; Germani et al., 2015). Furthermore, the integra-
tion of blockchain technologies leads to transparencies for all the partic-
ipants of the value chain. The storing of data during the process which is
irreversible leads to the creation of trust and credibility leading to the
sustainable development of the industry along with maintaining a re-
cord of clients for further use (Jeppsson and Olsson, 2017; Maity et al.,
2021; Malik et al., 2021; Sunny et al., 2020).

The developments in the ﬁeld traceability related to food safety was
observed through bibliometric analysis to measure objectively the

impact of the scholarly publications and the inﬂuence as a measure of
scientiﬁc quality (Van Raan, 2003). However, to our best of knowledge,
there is no previous study of a global bibliometric analysis on the aspect
focusing the future of food safety using traceability-based solutions. The
current article explores the application of traceability solutions in
the domain of food safety using different technological applications.
The major goal of the paper was to offer a comprehensive overview of
recent developments in the realm of food safety and traceability. To ac-
complish our goal, we used the Scopus database to undertake a biblio-
metric study of documents published in food safety and traceability
area. The following were some of the major takeaways from the
paper: (1) the distribution and trend of publications over time (2) the
distribution of publications from various nations (3) organizations
engaged in the area that have published more than two papers (4) rela-
tionship between different authors and co-authors (5) authors in the
domain who has published more than ﬁve documents (6) source and
citation relationship of the sources (7) top journals where over ten doc-
uments were published (8) top documents which have at least 100
citations, and (8) collaboration between different countries in context
of research publication. This paper is structured as follows: In
Section 2, we brieﬂy describe the materials and methods adopted for
the study. In the third section, we present the ﬁndings based on the da-
tabase and methodology of the study. In Section 4, we conclude the
paper in the light of previous literature.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study design

The bibliometric analysis was performed using articles published
until May 2021 in Scopus indexed journals (https://www.scopus.com/).
Out of various document types, only research articles and conference pa-
pers were selected for the study because we are interested in checking
the research evidence concerning our major keywords, food safety and
traceability.

2.2. Source of information

The bibliometric analysis was conducted using publications re-
trieved from the Scopus database (Elsevier B.V., USA). Scopus database
was used since it is the largest abstract and citation database of peer-
reviewed literature encompassing science, technology, social sciences,
etc. (Ballew, 2009). Also, it includes other relevant information for the
study, such as citations per document and country-wise afﬁliation of
all the authors (Agarwal et al., 2016; Hernández-Vásquez et al., 2018).

2.3. Search strategy

The literature search was carried out using the search term in the
title and abstract ﬁeld, as mentioned in Table 1, on a single day, May
27, 2021. The validity of the search strategy was determined by manu-
ally reviewing the retrieved documents by two authors. The period
restrictions were not applied, resulting in documents published from
1992 to 2021. After removing the duplicates, we were left with 805 doc-
uments. The information related to citations, bibliography, abstract and
keywords, funding, and others were exported as CSV ﬁles for further
analysis using bibliometric tools. The Scopus database may involve
some errors in bibliometric applications (Falagas et al., 2008), for

which standardization was necessary for the data. A few documents
were detected which were erroneously ascribed to the sphere of author
afﬁliation and country. Thus, a standardization was conducted physi-
cally by two authors before conducting the analysis. (See Fig. 1.)

2.4. Data analysis

The current study employs VOSviewer version 1.6.16 software
(Derviş, 2019; Van Eck and Waltman, 2013) and open-source
bibliometrix R-package (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017) for conducting bib-
liometric analysis. VOSviewer software provides maps of various biblio-
graphic data that are easy to interpret. VOSviewer can display maps in

different ways along with the functionality of zooming, scrolling, and
searching. The popular maps developed using the software are
co-authorship, keyword co-occurrence, citation, bibliographic coupling,
or co-citation map based on bibliographic data (Van Eck and Waltman,
2010). The maps on VOSviewer are better visualized when the database
contains a large number of items (i.e., at least 100 items or more). The
other computer programs used in the bibliometric analysis cannot
display the maps in such an explicit manner (Pal et al., 2021). The com-
prehensive science mapping analysis including the worldwide distribu-
tion map of publications and collaborations within the countries was
conducted through bibliometrix R-package. The tool is programmed in
open source platform R which employs speciﬁc tools for both bibliomet-
ric and scientometric quantitative research. The co-occurrence network

3. Results and discussion

3.1. The distribution and growth trend of publications yearly

The increase in the number of publications in a certain discipline is a
fair indication of the research trend in that ﬁeld. The study of the rising
trend in the number of publications can offer answers to a variety of
new concerns and the future of the discipline.

A plot of the number of publications and cumulative publications on
a year-to-year basis was plotted to analyze the research trend in con-
nection to the growing scenario linked to traceability relevant to food
safety paradigms (Fig. 2). Traceability about food safety is a relatively
recent ﬁeld, with the ﬁrst papers dating back to 1992. However, it
wasn't until 2008 that researchers began to show a signiﬁcant increase
in this ﬁeld of study. Every year since 2009, at least 30 papers have been
published. This year alone (2021), 48 articles have been published thus
far. Furthermore, the cumulative publication graph shows that, since
2003, academics all over the world have been paying close attention
to the subject of traceability in the context of food safety. The number
of cumulative articles has increased exponentially since 2003, with an
R2 value close to 0.85 (p < 0.0001).

3.2. Publication distribution on a country-by-country basis

The 805 articles came from 85 different nations. China had the most
publications (199 articles, or 18.49% of all papers), followed by the
United States of America with 185 articles (17.19%) (USA). Italy was
on the third position with 77 articles (7.16%) followed by Spain with
49 articles (4.55%). Canada occupied the sixth rank with 34 articles
(3.16%). Germany and the Netherlands tied for seventh place, both
producing 28 articles (2.60%). Following that, ﬁve countries (South
Korea, Australia, India, France, and Ireland) produced 20–24 articles.
Furthermore, eight countries published articles in the range of ten to
nineteen. The remaining 129 countries published less than ten articles
on the aspect of traceability linked to food safety. When each country's
contributions are added together, the total number of publications is
1076, which is greater than 805. This is evidenced by the fact that
there has been a great deal of cross-national collaboration. In total,
twenty nations published more than ten publications in the ﬁeld of
food safety connected to traceability. Table 2 shows the data for the
various nations.

Table 2 shows that 13 of the top 20 nations have a nominal GDP of
less than $15,000. This shows that economically developed nations

have recognized the beneﬁts of traceability solutions in food safety
and are investigating their viability in order to ensure that the country's
food is safe. The United States of America has received the most citations
out of the 185 papers that have been published in the country. In terms
of the number of documents published in the domain, China, the United
States of America, and Italy are the top three nations. However, it is
worth noting that China ranks ﬁfteenth (15.99), the United States of
America tenth (27.04), and Italy thirteenth (20.47) in terms of average
citations per document. The European nations of Ireland (86.10),
Belgium (46.21), and Spain (46.21) are in top place in terms of average
citations per document (37.67).

The Total Link Strength (TLS) is a measurement of a country's collab-
orative research with another (Table 2). TLS study revealed that the
United States, with a TLS of 98, was by far the most superior country
in terms of collaborative research. The US has collaborated on papers
with China, the UK, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland,
Canada, France, Japan, Belgium, South Korea, India, Norway, Taiwan,
Thailand, Kenya, Denmark, Turkey, Chile, and Columbia (Fig. 3). China
was in second place, with a TLS of 85. The United States, Italy, the
United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand,
France, Sweden, Columbia, the Netherlands, Japan, Thailand, South
Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Romania, Singapore, and Hong Kong have
all published research documents with China.

The United Kingdom occupied the third position in joint research
with a TLS score of 57. Researchers from the United Kingdom, the
United States, China, Italy, Canada, Spain, Germany, New Zealand,
Ireland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Sweden, Kenya,
Finland, and Hungary collaborated on papers. The TLS score and the
Country Cooperation Network Map reveal that most nations have a
strong research connection with the United States, the United
Kingdom, and China. Fig. 3 shows the country collaboration network.

Furthermore, the top organizations that published more than two
publications in the same ﬁeld of research were selected (Table 3). Ac-
cording to the bibliometric analysis, eight organizations generated at
least three papers during the years. Six of the eight organizations that
released more than two publications in the study domain are from
China, which is noteworthy.

It was found that the School of Food and Biological Engineering,
Jiangsu University, China, had published ﬁve documents that received
154 citations. The average citation per document was found to be
30.80. It was followed by the Food Science and Technology Programme,
C/o Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore,
Singapore and National University of Singapore (Suzhou) Research In-
stitute, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China, with four publications and an equal
number of average citations per document (34.50). The average citation
per document of China Agricultural University, Beijing was the highest

(50.67) though it produced only three documents with 138 citations.
The remaining four universities received less than 20 average citations
per document and produced three documents in the research area.
From the analysis, it can be concluded that the School of Food and Bio-
logical Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China and China Ag-
ricultural University, Beijing, China, plays a signiﬁcant role in the ﬁeld
of research.

3.3. Authors and co-authors relationship

The number of published papers and citation metrics obtained by
the authors was used to identify the most active researchers in the
area (Table 4). Wang J. has the highest number of publications (16)

followed by Li, J. (13). Liu, Y and Wang, S. had equal number of (12).
However, in relation to the citations; Hobbs, J.E. had the maximum
number of citations (454), followed by Wu, L. (415) and Kim, M.S.
(355). This suggested that these three researchers are the most active
researchers in the study area Fig. 4.

The average number of citations per document, on the other hand,
provides information about the most inﬂuential scholars. In other
words, a high-quality article will have more citations, which may be de-
termined by computing the average number of citations per document.
It can be observed that Hobbs, J.E. (documents: 6, citations: 149),
followed by Kim, M.S. (documents: 6, citations: 355) and Wu, L. (docu-
ments: 9, citations: 415), had the highest average citations per docu-
ment. This is suggestive that the documents of Hobbs, J.E., Kim, M.S.

and Wu, L. were more impactful than the others. The average citation
per document of Thakur, M. was 31.00 (fourth position) and Zhang, J.
was in the ﬁfth position with an average citation score of 27.30. Interest-
ingly, Wang, J. was at the ﬁrst position with 16 documents in the re-
search area, indicating that even though Wang, J. is a proliﬁc researcher
with strong networking and collaboration skills, his research ﬁndings
are rarely recognized.

3.4. Distribution and co-citation relationship

The relationship between sources and citations indicates which
prominent publications the authors choose to publish their ﬁndings
(Fig. 5). Table 5 shows the major publications/ journals that have pub-
lished research articles on traceability in the context of food safety.
The most preferred journal for publishing the study on traceability in
food safety problems was the Food Control journal. So far, seventy-
eight papers have been published in the journal. The journal received
1901 citations as a result of these papers. The Food Chemistry journal
came in second, with forty-eight papers published and 870 citations.
With twenty-seven publications, the Journal of Agricultural and Food
Chemistry came in third. These research papers got 575 citations in
the journal. The average number of citations per document indicates
the importance of publications published in journals. Food Policy, Jour-
nal of Food Engineering, and British Food Journal were the top three
journals in terms of average citations per document. This is due to the

fact that high-quality research was published in Food Policy, Journal of
Food Engineering, and British Food Journal. This is supported by the
fact that these journals have an impact factor exceeding 2.30. Except
for Acta horticulturae, Advance journal of food science and technology,
and Journal of Food Science and Food Technology, the rest of the
journals had an impact factor of over 2.30. It is also worth noting that
journals with a higher total link strength had a higher average citation
per document than those with a lower average citation per document.
This points to the fact that these journals were highly cited by papers
published in other journals, as seen by the source-citation relationship
map (Fig. 6).

3.5. Documents and citation relationships

The relationship between the published documents and citations re-
ceived is important to understand the quality of the publication. The
higher citation count is representative of superior quality of the publica-
tion resulting in a greater number of citations by other researchers in
the same ﬁeld. In our study, the articles which have been cited for
over 100 times were only selected. This narrowed down the number
of articles to 36 (Table 6). The article which was cited the greatest num-
ber of times was authored by Gowen et al. (2007), which highlighted
hyperspectral imaging as an emerging process for food quality and
safety control. Consumer preferences in terms of food safety, country-
of-origin labelling, and traceability were reported in the second most
referenced paper. The hyperspectral reﬂectance and ﬂuorescence imag-
ing system for food quality and safety was highlighted in the third most
referenced document. The paper by (Loureiro and Umberger, 2007) has
been cited the most (23 times) by the selected set of 36 articles among
these three top-cited pieces. Bertolini et al. (2006) and Angulo and Gil
(2007) articles were referenced 10 times by the chosen group. This indi-
cates that more high-quality publications in the subject of food safety
and traceability follow these two texts.

It can be seen in Fig. 6 that there were two separate and closely
linked clusters. The document by Hobbs et al. (2005) received the
most citations in the ﬁrst category. The materials from Gowen et al.
(2007) were among the most referenced articles in the second group.
To sum up, the documents by Loureiro and Umberger (2007), Hobbs
et al. (2005), and Gowen et al. (2007) were the most important publica-
tions that had a major inﬂuence on the concerned research domain.

4. Conclusion

The results presented in our study showed an increasing trend par-
ticularly from the year 2014. The majority of publications and collabora-
tions were from countries like the China, US and countries of the
European Union. The sources analysis indicated that the organizations
publishing more than two documents in the area were mostly from
China, Singapore and New Zealand. The ﬁndings support the efforts of
the developed countries in prioritizing traceability of agricultural

products to ensure food safety and security (Caporale et al., 2001; Salina
et al., 2021). The most active author in the domain was (Wang and Li,
2006) with 16 publications and a citation count of 238. The average
citation received by the author was 14.88. The publications in the do-
main were not dominated by any particular journal. The journal ‘Food
Control’ contributed maximum articles in the domain with 78
documents and 1901 citations followed by the journal ‘Food Chemistry’
(48 documents and 870 citations) and ‘Journal of Agricultural and Food
Chemistry’ (27 documents and 575 citations). The articles with over 100
citations narrowed down the total number of articles to 36. The article
with greatest number of citations was authored by (Gowen et al.,
2007), which provided an insight the role of hyperspectral imaging for
ensuring food quality and safety control. The collaboration map be-
tween the authors of different countries in the research domain showed
that the prominent countries in article publication in this domain were
India, Brazil, New Zealand and European
USA, China, Australia,

countries. Also, the highest collaboration in publications were observed
between USA and China. The results are in consistence with the interna-
tional collaboration publication output of China and USA which has
showed exponential growth in the past two decades. The growth of
science in China during the period has led to major collaboration with
G7 countries at the research ﬁeld (He, 2009; Verbeek et al., 2002). The
major limitation of the study could be the reliance on the Scopus data-
base which is subject to continuous change and updating in the number
of indexed journals (Durieux and Gevenois, 2010; Uthman, 2008). This
implies that a bibliometric analysis after an interval of few years may
provide substantial variations in the results since the researches in the
area is continuously growing with the emergence of several novel tech-
nologies. There could be a possibility to combine different databases for
better depiction of content in the research area. However, the results
obtained in the study can help the researchers to dive deeper into the
research area and investigate possible research gaps for future study.
