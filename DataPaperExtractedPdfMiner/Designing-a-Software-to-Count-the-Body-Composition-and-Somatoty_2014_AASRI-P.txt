Sports morphology is a science that is specialised in studying the changes of human body structure which 
occur under physical exercises ,The high performance of tained by athlets makes it necessary to evaluate the 
body capacity and the individual characteristics of each athlet . 

This  evaluation  considers  a  number  of  parametrs  such  as  weight  ,height,  body  surface  ,fat  mass,  muscle 

mass and bones mass . 

From  this  logic  stems  the  idea  to  design  a  software  capable  to  treat  in  put  data  (Anthropometric 

measurements ) where the the out put data will be in form of Somatotype and body mass . 

By  using  Matiegka  equation  and  carter-heat  method  of  anthropometric  somatotype,  as  a  consequence  the 

objectives of this research are : 

1)
2)

To simplify the computing operations of Matiegka equation and the carter-heat method. 
To increase the precision of computing the results of body mass and somatotypes of several athlets in 

faster time and less efforts. 

3)

To design baseline data of body mass and somatotype for a big number of athlets to follow up their 

morpholic state,thier selection and thier guidance to the most appropriate sport ‘s activity. 

4)

To design a somatochart and body composition chart . 

2. Research terms 

Software:  he’s  a  direction  give  to  the  computer  to  excute  precise  task  in  the  time  from  .(Ghistaine  and 

Patrick 2000). 

Body composition (body mass) : is a term refers to the human body from three ingredients are ( muscles, 

fats, bones) . (Battinelli,2007) 

Somatotype : is an expression refers to the morphology , and is expressed in three points , the first refers to 

the endomorphy(right), segond (midale)to mesomorphy , third (left) ectomorphy (carter,2002) 

3. Equations adopted in software 

We used the formulas of Mateigka (1921) : 

3.1. Fat mass 

MA = d. s.k. 
MG : absolute fat mass in kg 
d:½(cid:153)skinfold(subscapular, (biceps+triceps)/2chest,forearm,abdominal,thigh)/6 
s : body surface calculated by the formula Izakson(1958) : 
 s = ( 100 + wieht + ( stature – 160 )) / 100 
k : constant = 1, 3 
- calculating the percentage of fat mass (relative) : 
MG% = (MA/ body mass).100 

3.2. Bones mass : 

MO = l.o².k 
MO: absolute bones mass in kg 
l : stature in cm 
o = (diameters distal arm, forearm, thigh and leg)/4 in cm 
k: constant = 1,2 
- calculating the percentage of bones mass (relative) : 
MO% = (MO/masse corporelle).100 

3.3. muscle mass : 

MM = l.r².k 
MO : absolute muscle mass in kg 

40  

 Asli Houcine et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   8  ( 2014 )  38 – 43 

l : stature in cm 
r =((cid:153) circumference arm, forearm, thigh and leg) / 25.12 - ( (cid:153)skinfold arm, forearm, thigh and leg) / 80 
k : constant = 6,5 
- calculating the percentage of muscle mass (relative) : 
MM% = (MM/body mass).100 (Matiegka, 1921). 

4. Somatotype 

We  used 

the  Heath-carter  Antropometric  Somatotype 

(Duqaet  and  carter 

,2001),(Heat  and  

carter,1977),(Philipaerts,2002) 

4.1. How the software works: 

programming language : 
visual C sharp(C#)(cid:314)Microsoft visual studio 2008 
Data base (cid:314)MySQL (Wamp Server) (Mickey,2002),(Donis,2005),(Loca and John,2010) 
Software platform : 
32 bit ,64 bit Windows (XP , Windows 7) 
Size of program : 2 ,45 MB 

First step : 
After fixing the program (setup software) you’ll see the next interface and it’s « somatotype interface » if 

you want to change the language from english to arab click on « administrator box ». 

fill the information about somatotype then click on the « somatotype box » to show the results , if you want 
to  represent  data  in  the  somatochart  clik  on  «  chart  »  ,  if  you  want  to  delete  data  click  on  «  reset  »  ,  After 
making  sure  to  fill  the  correct  to  data  click  «  save  »  and  you’ll  see  the  message  if  you  want  to  Continue 
calculate body mass click « OK » , and if want to save the results somatotype just click « NO » if you want to 
close program click on « cancel » 

Observation : to fill the high side of the program (code ,Name , Age ….) are necessary to save the results in 

database.

The second step: 
Fill the data for body mass then click on « OK » to show results ,same previous steps if you want change the 
language or graphical representation or delete afer confirming data click « save » then click on « data base» 
box , to confirming data save in data base you will see the next interface . 

After  clicking  on  «  data  base  »  you’ll  see  black  page  ,  click  on 

execution  for  appearence  of  stored 
information , if you want to research about ( Name or code or …..) entre Name …, in research box you will see 
the spacial information in blue color . 

If you want to delete the stored information for this code click on « delete » 

, and if you want to delete 

all the information from data base click on « delet all » 
then click on Name or code …., that you wanted to change then click on « somatotype » or « body mass » box , 

 ; if you want to change in some data click on 

 
 
 
 
 
 
42  

 Asli Houcine et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   8  ( 2014 )  38 – 43 

You'll find that the data was automatically filled then make a change process then click on « Save » , if you 

want data representation Somatotype or body mass choose the serie name then click on the box
apear to you the interface . 

and will 

When the next interface apear choose graphical represetation chart type then click on « OK » then click on « 

somatochart ». 

To apear somatochart as you see in the picture .  

5. Search Results  

1 ) Facilitating  the countable  operations  for  matiegka  equations  and Heat-carter  method  for  antropometric 

somatotype . 

2)  Counting  the  results  of  the  body  mass  and  somatotype  for  big  number  of  sportsmen  in  short  period  of 

time ,less effort and more accuracy. 

3) Designing basic data rich of the body mass ‘and the somatotype ‘s results of many sportsmen ,So that ,it 

helps in pursing their morphological state and the way to select and guid them to the best sport activity. 

4) Designing the somatochart and diagram for body composition .

6. Recommendations  

Link this software to the hardware to the process to make measurs anthropometry . 
Take care to the morphology side to estimate training program 
It’s necesory to take care of somatotype in selection process and to direct athlets to the right physical

3)
activity . 

4) Make  more  of  meetings  and  conferences  about  the  importance  link  to  the  sport  domain  with  ather 

sciences especially electronic engineering science .
