Abstract 

The  high  voltage  (HV)  lateral  double-diffused  MOS  (LDMOS)  has  a  much  lower  on-resistance,  a  higher  tolerance  to 
breakdown  voltage  and  a  higher  output  power  used  for  automotive  ICs  and  high-frequency  communication  modules. 
However,  its  shortcomings  are  evident,  including  a  high  trigger  voltage  (Vt1),  low  holding  voltage  (Vh),  low  ESD 
discharge  capability  per  unit  length  and  multi-fingers  unable  to  fully  turn-on,  which  are  serious  impacted  the  ESD 
reliability capability. In this paper, the HV-nLDMOS device with adding field-oxide-devices (FODs) in the bulk area to 
make the trigger voltage effectively decreased, and in order to increase the ESD capability is investigated. Furthermore, 
the influence of bulk P+ area which was replaced by FODs in the bulk region on snapback parameters in a 0.25-(cid:80)m 60-V 
high  voltage  process  is  evaluated.  After  that,  the  ESD  capability  has  grate  increased  while  the  device  with  adding  any 
FOD structures in the 0.25-(cid:80)m 60-V high voltage process. The It2 value is > 7A and to be increased > 111.74% than that 
of a reference group. Noteworthy, this structure may make the trigger voltage (Vt1) too low to operate normally. Therefore, 
it should be careful considered that the problem of maximum FOD occupied ratio while using this methodology.

1. Introduction 

With  the  rapid  process  technologies  development,  high  voltage  control  circuits  or  high  power  driver 
devices/circuits are widely used in automotive ICs, high-frequency communication modules, power switches, 
power management circuits, LED illuminations and LCD drivers  [1-4]. The power devices can sustain a high 
voltage  and  current,  and  can  be  integrated  with  low  voltage  logic  circuits  that  not  only  minimized  the  chip 
area  but  also  lowdown  the  production  costs  and  power  consumptions.  In  order  to  provide  better  reliability 
quality on an HV BCD process for the customer  [5-9], the wafer foundries enhance the device electricity and 
reliability  on  the  layout  and  design  due  to  the  extreme  operating  environment.  There  are  many  kinds  of 
solutions to increase the reliability on source, drain, N-well and NBL [5-6] in the HV device, such as a source-
side  embedded  with  the  bulk  zone  [7],  and  the  stripe  source-side  and  bulk  electrode  are  far  separated  by  an 
FOD. Then, is there any other solutions? 

2. Layout Design of DUTs 

In this paper, the FOD structures will be applied to the source- and bulk-sides of the HV devices whose 
experimental structure and schematic layout are shown in Figs 1~ 3. This experiment, we aim to increase the 
Rbulk value of an nLDMOS from source-to-bulk side, hoping not only to reduce the trigger voltage (Vt1) and 
increase ESD robustness, but also to have no impact on the device area. Therefore, under the minimum design 
rules  in  this  paper,  some  FODs  which  are  extended  into  the  contact  region  of  the  bulk-side,  from  only  one 
contact replaced shown in Fig. 2(a), gradually increasing the extending contact numbers shown in Figs 2(b)~ 
3(a), and finally the contact numbers of an end-to-end in the bulk region have only two contacts shown in Fig. 
3(b). It is in order to observe the FOD structure of bulk-side effects on an HV LDMOS device. 

In the design of an HV nLDMOS device, a layout symmetrical idea is considered, therefore, for this case 
whose contact number is set to be 164 in the bulk side. Then, the FODs extend into the bulk region, the upside 
and  lower  part  of  the  entire  bulk-side  can  have  a  contact  at  least.  Therefore,  after  calculating,  while  the 
contacts number is equal to 2, 8, 12, 30, 52, 162 in the bulk side can be replaced by the FODs. However, the 
total contacts number of the bulk region is equal to 164 on planning, which was due to it not only needs to 
conform with the distance rule of a contact to the oxide definition (OD) boundary and the distance rule of a 
contact  to  the  y-direction,  but  also  the  contacts  number  can  not  be  too  few.  Therefore,  the  experimental 
planning groups with adding FODs structure in the bulk region are listed in Table 1. Here, the devices under 
testing were fabricated by a TSMC 0.25-(cid:541)m 60-V BCD process. The channel length (L) is kept to be 2-(cid:541)m, 
channel width of each finger (Wf) is 100-(cid:541)m, finger numbers M= 6, and the total channel width (Wtot) is kept 
a constancy, 600-(cid:541)m.

3. Testing Equipment System 

A transmission-line-pulse (TLP) system for experimental testing is controlled by the LabVIEW software. It 
managed  the  subsystem  electrical  machine  such  as  the  ESD  pulse  generator,  the  high-frequency  digital 
oscilloscope  and  the  digital  power  electric  meter  instruments  to  achieve  the  automatic  measurement.  This 
machine  can  provide  a  continuous  step-high  square  wave  to  device,  and  short  raise  time  of  the  continuous 
square wave can also simulate transient noise of ESD. This HBM-like system has used the short square wave 
with 100 ns pulse widths and 10 ns rising/falling times to evaluate the voltage and current response of device. 

4. Measurement Results and Discussion 

As the FOD structures are applied to bulk region, the TLP data can be obtained and shown in Fig. 4(a) and 
Table 2. From these data, it can be clearly seen that when the component is added FODs in the bulk side, the 
It2 value will increase rapidly as the total area of FODs in the bulk side is larger. Due to the power limitation 
of TLP equipment, the It2 value of component reaches 7-A (the equivalent HBM immunity greater than 10-
kV), we labeled it as > 7-A on Table 2. Meanwhile, it can find that when the contacts number of bulk side was 
replaced by FODs and was greater than 30, that is, the total area ratio of FODs in the bulk side was greater 
than 93/100, it will appear a secondary-breakdown phenomenon shown in Fig. 4(b). As the area ratio of FODs 
in the bulk side is enhanced more, the bulk-to-source resistance (Rbulk) will be greater, which will result in the 
trigger voltage (Vt1) smaller, and the trigger voltage decreased as the area ratio of FODs increased. When the 
area  ratio  of  FODs  is  reached  93/100,  the  trigger  voltage  has  down  to  about  60-V,  thus  making  the  other 
fingers  easier  to  turn  on,  and  then  that  will  cause  many  snapback  conduction  phenomena,  and  the  It2  value 
became higher. 

Our  proposed  structure  can  effectively  enhance  ESD  capability  of  element,  but  the  trigger  voltage  of 
device might be less than 60-V, which may cause internal circuit performance abnormal. Therefore, we must 
notice the area limitation in FODs in the bulk region to enhance device ESD ability. The Vt1, Vh versus FOD 
area ratio relationship is shown in Fig. 5(a). Here, the Vh values seem to be a U-shaped distribution. When the 
occupied  area  ratio  of  FODs  structure  is  86/100,  the  holding  voltage  (Vh)  is  existed  a  lowest  value. 
Nevertheless, the Vh was increased gradually again as the FOD area ratio was > 86/100. Therefore, the FOD 
occupied area ratio in the bulk region will be judged in the ESD ability and latch-up immunity considerations. 
In Fig. 5(b), with a suitable ratio of FODs adding, nLDMOS structures posses a stronger It2 value, improved 
about 1.12% ~ >117.74% as compared with the reference group. So, it can be concluded that an FOD adding 
in the bulk region is good for ESD robustness.

5. Conclusion 

This  paper  proposed  an  HV  nLDMOS  device  with  FODs  structures  in  the  bulk  side  to  observe  ESD 
reliability. With the FOD structure in the bulk region can effectively enhance the anti-ESD ability of these 60-
V nLDMOS devices. The It2 average value can be improved about 1.12% ~ >111.74% as compared with the 
reference group value. Moreover, we should also pay attention to the trigger voltage of a DUT might not be 
too small and less than the operation voltage 60-V as with increasing FOD structure occupied area. Therefore, 
with  these  FODs  adding  in  the  bulk  region  can  extremely  effective  enhance  the  ESD  ability;  however,  we 
should take care about the maximum FODs area limitation.
