Deep Learning (DL), a type of Machine Learning, has gained signiﬁcant interest in many ﬁelds, including agricul-
ture. This paper aims to shed light on deep learning techniques used in agriculture for abiotic and biotic stress
detection in fruits and vegetables, their beneﬁts, and the challenges faced by users. Scientiﬁc papers were col-
lected from Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Springer, and Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)
using combinations of speciﬁc keywords such as:’Deep Learning’ OR’Artiﬁcial Intelligence’ in combination with
fruit disease’, vegetable disease’, ‘fruit stress', OR ‘vegetable stress' following PRISMA guidelines. From the initial
818 papers identiﬁed using the keywords, 132 were reviewed after excluding books, reviews, and the irrelevant.
The recovered scientiﬁc papers were from 2003 to 2022; 93 % addressed biotic stress on fruits and vegetables. The
most common biotic stresses on species are fungal diseases (grey spots, brown spots, black spots, downy mildew,
powdery mildew, and anthracnose). Few studies were interested in abiotic stresses (nutrient deﬁciency, water
stress, light intensity, and heavy metal contamination). Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks
were the most used keywords, with GoogleNet (18.28%), ResNet50 (16.67%), and VGG16 (16.67%) as the most
used architectures. Fifty-two percent of the data used to compile these models come from the ﬁelds, followed
by data obtained online. Precision problems due to unbalanced classes and the small size of some databases
were also analyzed. We provided the research gaps and some perspectives from the reviewed papers. Further re-
search works are required for a deep understanding of the use of machine learning techniques in fruit and veg-
etable studies: collection of large datasets according to different scenarios on fruit and vegetable diseases,
evaluation of the effect of climatic variability on the fruit and vegetable yield using AI methods and more abiotic
stress studies.

1. Introduction

Fruits and vegetables contain dietary ﬁber, which helps to lower the
risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity (Slavin and Lloyd, 2012). They
also provide vitamins, particularly C and A, and minerals essential for
human well-being. For example, 100 g of fruit contains 2 to 14.8 g of di-
etary ﬁber, 61 to 89.1 g of water, and 90 to 646 Kcal of energy (Slavin
and Lloyd, 2012). Despite their importance to human life, many stress
factors induce a considerable loss of their productivity. Stressors include
biotic factors caused by living organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi,
parasites, and abiotic factors, caused by non-living organisms such as
light intensity, water quantity, nutrient deﬁciency, and other environ-
mental and climate factors (Goncalves et al., 2005; Hao et al., 2020).
For instance, early blight is one of the most common diseases on toma-
toes and can cause severe yield losses and many fruit lesions (Blancard,
2012; Brahimi et al., 2017). Likewise, wilting of Solanaceae, namely to-
mato, pepper, potato, and eggplant, is a genuine concern for farmers; to-
mato wilt can cause losses up to 100% (Sikirou et al., 2015). As abiotic
stress, weak or high light can signiﬁcantly affect crop physiology and
morphology (Hao et al., 2020). Furthermore, when irrigation is minimal,
and the plants are exposed to high water stress, they will die without
any possibility of recovery (Wakamori et al., 2020). Likewise, nutrient
deﬁciency can cause many diseases that signiﬁcantly affect plant yield.
For instance, deﬁciencies in three major mineral elements of plants
can be observed through blossom end rot (BER) for Calcium, green or
yellow shoulder and mottled maturation for Potassium, and paler
green and uniform yellow or chlorosis on leaves for nitrogen (Tran
et al., 2019). When diseases are not quickly identiﬁed and treated ade-
quately, the production of hectares of ﬁelds can be destroyed. Therefore
early identiﬁcation of crop diseases and stress is essential for best pro-
ductivity. Common stress and disease detection approaches focus
mainly on visual recognition (Ferentinos, 2018). However, not all
farmers have the experience to recognize disease symptoms to apply
the appropriate treatment. Then, they call on experts who are not al-
ways available. In addition, visual recognition is a time-consuming
and laborious task that often fails to meet recognition accuracy require-
ments (Liu et al., 2020; Dutot et al., 2013). These errors lead to the abu-
sive use of pesticides, destroying the soil and harming consumers'
health. Thus, some approaches have been proposed to automate the
classiﬁcation of diseases. Those approaches are based on machine learn-
ing and computer vision that use handcrafted features extracted from
images by experts. Thus, the learning is not fully autonomous due to
the dependence on handcrafted features (Breitenreiter et al., 2015;
Brahimi et al., 2017). Deep Learning is an old concept based on artiﬁcial
neural networks. It was ﬁrst used in 1943 when Warren McCulloch and
Walter Pitts published their ﬁrst mathematical and computational
model of the biological neuron (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943). Deep

learning has become popular in recent years thanks to three main as-
pects: the ever-increasing power of computers, which allows the crea-
tion and training of neural networks with many hidden layers, the
availability of big data and large datasets, and the possibility of using
cloud computing. The functioning of biological neurons inspires ANN.
ANN consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output
layer. Deep Learning consists of more than one hidden layer. Moreover,
the hidden layers are of different types, such as convolutional and
pooling layers. A DL system is self-teaching, learning by ﬁltering infor-
mation through many hidden layers. Due to its ability to extract raw
data directly, DL is used to overcome the limitations of the methods
based on handcrafted feature extraction. Since the ﬁrst DL technique
was introduced, many modiﬁcations have been made to achieve various
architectures. Identifying the different DL techniques used so far, their
limitations, and the users' main issues is important. A certain number
of papers did similar works. For instance, Santos et al. (2020) provided
a brief overview of DL applications in agriculture. They deﬁned several
including Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Fully
DL architectures,
Convolutional Networks (FCN), and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN). They then discussed the various applications of DL in agriculture,
including disease detection (focusing on 6 papers), crop identiﬁcation
(4 papers), land cover (3 papers), and weed identiﬁcation (3 papers).
Similarly, Paul et al. (2020) proposed a review of agricultural advance-
ment based on machine learning and computer vision techniques.
They focused on the details related to image acquisition and image pro-
cessing techniques. They also presented the machine learning tech-
niques commonly used, among which DL belongs. Singh et al. (2018)
also reviewed recent works in which DL concepts were used for plant
stress phenotyping from digital images. The review compared DL
methods to other techniques in decision accuracy, data size require-
ments, and applicability in various scenarios. Despite all these works,
the real challenges of using DL for stress detection in fruits and vegeta-
bles are missing in the literature. In addition, none of the authors used
artiﬁcial intelligence and DL to address both abiotic stress and parasitic
attacks in plants. The interest in focusing on biotic and abiotic stresses in
plants is crucial since plants are designed to live in an environment
where these two types of stress interact (Atkinson and Urwin, 2012).
For example, drought stress can expose plants to pathogens. Therefore,
focusing on the two types of stress would be an excellent asset for good
monitoring to improve crop yield. This paper provided an analysis of the
main stresses that face fruits and vegetables, the DL methods used to
overcome them, their limitations, and some perspectives.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 clariﬁes
the concepts and terminologies used in this paper. The methodology
is described in Section 3. Section 4 then presents the ﬁndings and
their discussion with the perspectives, and Section 5 concludes the
work.

2. Clariﬁcation of concepts and terminologies

This section provides the history of the concept of Deep learning and

a brief deﬁnition of the different terminologies considered.

2.1. History of deep learning

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning (ML), an Artiﬁcial In-
telligence (AI) ﬁeld. ML is a ﬁeld of study that allows computers to learn
without being explicitly programmed (Samuel, 1959). Deep learning is
built on artiﬁcial neural networks inspired by the human brain's func-
tioning. The concept of artiﬁcial neurons was ﬁrst used in 1943 by
McCulloch and Pitts, who showed that neurons could be combined to
build a Turing machine (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943). In a neural net-
work, successive layers are connected to learn concepts. The simplest
networks have only two layers: an input and an output layer, each of
which can have several hundred, thousands, or even millions of neu-
rons. As the number of neurons increases, so does the network's ability
to learn more and more abstract representations. Rosenblatt (1958)
invented the perceptron, a formal neuron, the smallest possible neural
network, whose activation function is a step function called Linear
Threshold Function. The perceptron has many inputs and weights for
each input. The perceptron has an algorithm that allows it to learn the
weights of the information from a set of data with labels (Rosenblatt,
1958). However, Minsky and Papert showed that perceptrons have
some limitations (Minsky and Papert, 1969). Thus, research on neural
networks was stopped for a decade. The following important milestone
was multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with the backpropagation algo-
rithm introduced in 1985 by Ackley to revive the ﬁeld. MLPs are neural
networks that aim to classify more complex data than a perceptron. To
do this, the MLP examines each piece of data and updates the weight of
each neuron in each layer of its network to best classify that database.
Later in 1988, Neocognitron, a hierarchical neural network capable of vi-
sual pattern recognition, was proposed (Fukushima, 1988). Then,
Convolutional Neural Network with Backpropagation for document
analysis was developed by LeCun (LeCun et al., 1998). A so-called
deep neural network has at least two hidden layers (there can be as
many as desired). Deep learning has been revolutionized since the
2010s with the creation of several architectures.

2.2. Deep learning architectures

Modiﬁcations of model architecture are an essential factor in im-
proving the performance of models. The ﬁrst Deep Learning has ex-
perienced considerable modiﬁcations up to the present day. Such
modiﬁcations include structural reformulation, regularization, nor-
malization, and parameter optimizations (Alzubaidi et al., 2021).
These mainly occurred due to the reorganization of the processing
unit and the development of novel blocks. In particular, the most
novel results were performed using network depth. Some examples
of Deep Learning architecture are AlexNet, ZefNet, Visual geometry
Inception–V4,
group (VGG), GoogLeNet, ResNet,
DenseNet, ResNet, Xception, Recurrent neural networks (RNN),
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU),
Autoencoders, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Deep belief net-
works.

2.2.1. Importance of optimization techniques

In Machine Learning, optimization is done each time a model is
trained: the learning algorithm optimizes the values of the model pa-
rameters to minimize the prediction error on the training dataset.
However, the hyperparameters are not optimized during training.
The number of layers in a neural network, the number of neurons
per layer, etc., are hyperparameters that are not optimized during
training. The choice of values for the hyperparameters inﬂuences
the quality of the ﬁnal model, sometimes strongly. On the other

hand, the manual selection of the best hyperparameter values can
be complex, even for the most experienced data scientists. Thus,
there are simple search algorithms, such as Grid Search or Random
Search, to explore the search space and retain the best-explored so-
lution. These simple algorithms are beneﬁcial if the number of possi-
ble combinations of hyperparameter values is quite limited and the
search space is simple. Still, their use becomes prohibitive for larger
and more complex search spaces, as is the case for the most sophis-
ticated models. The problem of optimizing the hyperparameters of
a Machine Learning model is generally related to the optimization
with mixed variables
some
hyperparameters can take integer values, others real values, others
strings of characters. Moreover, it is only possible to efﬁciently com-
pute the gradients of the model performance (e.g., the accuracy
score) concerning the hyperparameters. Finally, the search space
can be pretty signiﬁcant and complex if
the number of
hyperparameters is high enough. Based on this reﬂection, this is an
ideal application for optimization algorithms.

2.3. Plants abiotic and biotic stresses

Stress can be deﬁned as any state of discomfort for the plant. Many
stressors, including abiotic and biotic factors, can slow or inhibit plant
development and growth. Biotic factors include diseases, infections,
and pest attacks. Infections can be bacterial, fungal, or viral. Viral dis-
eases are caused by viruses which are tiny micro-organisms with a ge-
nome composed of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic Acid
(RNA). They reproduce inside a living organism. Filamentous parasitic
fungi cause fungal diseases. These fungi are disseminated by spores or
mycelium present in the soil and penetrate the plant organism through
stomata or roots. They then appear as spots on fruits, leaves, or seedlings
and cause wilting, leaf dieback, and root rot. In contrast, phytopatho-
genic bacteria cause bacterial diseases. These bacterias live as parasites
on the plants and cause cankers and soft rots. Abiotic stress factors in-
clude drought (water stress), excessive watering (waterlogging), ex-
treme temperatures (cold, frost, and heat), salinity, mineral toxicity
(Verma et al., 2013), nutrient deﬁciencies, and soil contamination by
heavy metals such as cadmium and lead. In response to stress, plants
slow down their metabolism and decrease energy expenditure. Stress
reduces growth, photosynthesis, and therefore yield. When a plant is
stressed, it prevents its normal development, and its yield can no longer
be optimal.

3. Methodology

The methodology was organized into three subsections. The ﬁrst de-
scribed the research strategy, the second deﬁned the research ques-
tions, and the last presented the literature synthesis and statistical
analyses.

3.1. Description of the research strategy

Scientiﬁc articles were searched in databases such as Google
Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, Springer, and Direc-
tory Of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The following keywords were
used: ‘Deep Learning’ OR ‘Artiﬁcial Intelligence’ in combination:
‘AND’ with ‘fruit disease’, ‘vegetable disease’, ‘fruit stress’, OR ‘vegeta-
ble stress’. The last papers were assessed on July 4, 2022. No time
interval was speciﬁed during the search process since Deep Learning
is a relatively new technique, and we want to retrieve as many articles
as possible. Therefore, 818 research papers were identiﬁed, including
journal articles (original and review articles), conference papers, and
book chapters. Two hundred forty-six of the documents were dupli-
cates. Identiﬁcation was followed by a screening process that included
reading the title, abstract, and content of the paper to ensure that it
was related to the use of DL to detect stress on fruits and or vegetables.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 9 (2023) 46–60

By screening the titles and abstracts, 363 other papers were excluded.
After the content screening, we removed 50 irrelevant articles, 12 lit-
erature reviews, and 15 book chapters. Among the irrelevant articles,
some address stress on species other than fruits and vegetables using
artiﬁcial intelligence or Deep Learning, while others refer to stress but
do not use artiﬁcial intelligence or Deep Learning methods. Before ex-
cluding them from the ﬁnal selection, we checked references cited in
systematic reviews, books, and articles on related topics. Finally, 132
articles were included in the study. Thirteen of the 132 articles were
not free of charge. We have therefore used only their abstracts. The
methodology described was inspired by the Preferred Systematic Re-
views and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al., 2021) and
Fig. 1 summarizes it.

3.2. Deﬁnition of the research questions

Research questions help to structure better the systematic literature
reviews. Our ﬁrst concern was the objective behind using AI and DL
methods to detect stress in fruits and vegetables. Then, we identify the
species to which the techniques were applied and the type of stress
involved. Data being an essential element for any model, we deﬁned
the data's type, size, and source. We also looked at the countries
where the authors have installed experiments to collect the data. In
addition, several algorithms and implementation frameworks in the
literature are used for given tasks. Thus, we have deﬁned them through
the selected studies. Moreover, we sought to determine the models'
hyperparameters, performances, and evaluation metrics. Finally,

Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 9 (2023) 46–60

we have identiﬁed the challenges that researchers and practitioners
face. An explicit reformulation of each research question is given in
Table 1.

3.3. Literature synthesis and analysis

The literature synthesis was done in three parts. The ﬁrst part con-
cerns the bibliometric analysis and some general descriptive statistics.
VOSviewer was used for the network of the keywords co-occurrence
(van Eck and Waltman, 2022). VOSviewer provides a range of intuitive
visualization, mainly for analyzing bibliometric maps. The second part
focuses on the answers to the research questions. The occurrences of
each response were used to calculate the frequencies. Similar terms
were merged to make analysis easy. Some variables were analyzed to-
gether to get insight from their study. Results were presented in tables,
pie charts, or bar charts. The data analysis was conducted in the Ana-
conda environment using the Spyder Notebook framework, with Py-
thon 3.9.12. The libraries used to synthesize data frames Figures were
Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy. We have also used the function: ‘ggplot’
of the package: ‘ggplot2’ (Wickham, 2016) of R software (R Core Team,
2021). Furthermore, the geographical location of the collection sites was
represented using QGis. The last part was synthesizing the gaps and
ranking them based on their relevance and making recommendations
for new studies.

4. Results and discussion

The use of Artiﬁcial intelligence in classifying and detecting biotic
and abiotic stresses in fruits and vegetables is recent, as shown in
Fig. 2. The ﬁrst papers in this area appeared in 2003, followed by one
paper in 2006. A rapid progression was observed from 2019 to 2021,
with a peak of 34 papers in 2020. This increase is evidence of re-
searchers' interest in using AI and DL methods for early disease detec-
tion, as precision agriculture has become a necessity to face the
challenges related to food security. Twelve papers were published
from January 2022 to July 2022. Most of the papers are journal articles.
Conference proceedings account for about 36% of the total number of
papers.

4.1. Bibliometric analysis of keywords

Keywords are the words or groups of words that inform the critical
aspects addressed by a research paper. For more precision, we elimi-
nated inconsistencies by merging similar keywords such as ‘CNN’,
‘cnns’, and ‘convolutional neural networks’. Table 2 shows the top 10
most frequent keywords of the reviewed articles, their number of occur-
rences, weight links, and total link strength. The weight links are the
number of connections of a keyword with other keywords indicating
its importance. The total link strength represents the total strength of
the co-occurrence links of a given keyword with other keywords.
Fig. 3 completes Table 2 by illustrating the keyword co-occurrence net-
work. According to this ﬁgure, we distinguish two main periods in the

history of detecting and classifying diseases and stress in fruits and veg-
etables using artiﬁcial intelligence methods. The ﬁrst period, the ﬁrst
cluster of the map, concerns the time when classical machine learning
methods were employed through segmentation using k-means cluster-
ing. The K-means clustering algorithm groups pixels with common at-
tributes that belong to a particular segment. The support vector
machine (SVM) constitutes the core of this cluster. It has 13 occurrences
and 22 connections (Table 2) with other words, including ‘artiﬁcial neu-
ral networks (ANN)’, ‘k-means clustering’, ‘decision tree’, ‘disease detec-
tion’, ‘defect detection’, etc. Indeed, k-means clustering was used to
segment images. In contrast, SVM, ANN, random forest, and decision
tree classiﬁed the diseases. The emergence of deep learning methods
marks the second period represented by the second cluster. Deep learn-
ing constitutes the cluster's core with 36 occurrences, 29 connections,
and 72 total link strengths (Table 2). The group of words ‘deep learning’
is linked to other keywords such as: ‘Convolutional neural network’, ‘re-
current neural network’, ‘feature extraction’, ‘data augmentation’, ‘gen-
erative adversarial network’,
‘ﬁne tuning’,
‘classiﬁcation’, ‘agriculture’ etc. Indeed, deep learning methods such as
convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks were
born during this period. Unlike classical machine learning methods,
these methods aim to extract features directly from images. Their
performance has improved thanks to the increased databases using
algorithms such as generative adversarial networks. In addition, using
pre-trained models through transfer learning,
the models are
ﬁne-tuned and can classify images with much better accuracy for
precision agriculture.

4.2. RQ1:What is the objective behind the use of the DL or AI techniques?

According to the authors, the objectives behind using Deep Learning
and AI techniques are diverse. After careful analysis of each paper, we
have grouped these objectives into three main categories: the detection
of biotic stress, the detection of abiotic stress, and the improvement of
the robustness of the models.

In the ﬁrst group, we have four sub-objectives. The ﬁrst was the au-
tomatic detection of diseases in 46.46% of the collected papers. The sec-
ond sub-objective of this group was the detection of vegetable diseases
(9.45%). The third of this group concerned the detection of both fruit
and vegetable diseases in 7.87% of the papers. The fourth is the fruits
and vegetable disease segmentation in 3.94% of the papers. The second
main objective of 5.5% of the articles was the automatic detection of abi-
otic stress, including nutrients deﬁciency, water stress, light stress, and
metal contamination. The last main group includes three sub-objectives.
The ﬁrst is using complex backgrounds to improve the robustness of the
models. It accounts for 11.02% of the papers. The second represents
8.66% of the documents that use hybrid models to improve algorithms'
robustness. The use of transfer learning to improve the accuracy of pre-
diction models and reduce the time and cost of calculations in 7.09% of
the articles constitute this group's last sub-objective. Table 3 illustrates
the objectives thus described and the percentage values given to each.

4.3. RQ2: What are the species of fruits and vegetables considered?

avium L.), banana (Musa paradisiaca L.), mango (Mangifera indica L.), po-
tato (Solanum tuberosum L.), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), lettuce
(Lactuca sativa L.), pear (Pyrus communis L.), guava (Psidium guajava
L.), pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.),
sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), carrot
(Daucus carota L.), pumpkin/Squash (Cucurbita spp.),
jackfruit
(Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.), olive (Olea europaea L.), plum (Prunus
domestica L.), avocado (Persea americana Mill), pineapple (Ananas
comosus L.) and papaya (Carica papaya L.) (Table 4). Of all these species,
apple and tomato are the most investigated, with 35 and 33 occur-
rences, respectively, representing 16.67% and 15.71%. This is easily ex-
plained because apple is the most consumed fruit in the world (Feng
et al., 2021) while tomato is the second most consumed vegetable
after the potato (Kabas et al., 2022). In 2019 the world production of ap-
ples reached 7,620,288 t (Oviedo-Mireles et al., 2021) while the world's
annual tomato production was 160 million tonnes (Bazrafshan et al.,
2022).

The worldwide interest in these two products justiﬁes that they are
the object of enough essential work to increase their productivity. After

apple and tomato, grape, lemon, peach, orange, cucumber, and straw-
berry came next with 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10 occurrences, respec-
tively. The least considered species are jackfruit, olive, plum, avocado,
pineapple, and papaya, with one study for each.

4.4. RQ3: What type of stress was studied?

The species of fruits and vegetables identiﬁed face two types of
stress: biotic and abiotic. Diseases constitute about 85% of the biotic
stress factors, and pest attacks make up 7.93%. Viral, fungal, and bacte-
rial infections are fruits and vegetables' main biotic stress factors. Fungal
diseases are the most dominant. All species' most common fungal dis-
eases are grey spots, brown spots, black spots, downy mildew, powdery
mildew, and anthracnose. Regarding abiotic stress, only 6.34% of
assessed papers deal with it and address aspects such as light intensity,
nutrient deﬁciency, heavy metal contamination, and water stress. Three
studies (Tran et al., 2019; Fuentes et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021) focused on
nutrient deﬁciencies in respectively grape, tomato, and sugar beet. In
addition, three other studies were about the cadmium concentration,
the lead concentration, and the light intensity of lettuce (Xin et al.,
2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Hao et al., 2020). We did not get any article
that used DL to predict abiotic stress due to climate change. The low per-
centage of abiotic stress indicates the lack of interest in this stress detec-
tion on fruits and vegetables using artiﬁcial intelligence and DL.

4.5. RQ4: What are the type and the source of data used?

Training of the DL models requires large input databases. Because
data is the most important input of models, it is necessary to ensure
their quality. The data used are essentially images (92%). The other
data types are climatic data: mean temperature, minimum tempera-
ture, maximum temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, solar,
and sunlight. The reviewed papers used about 50% of the data they
collected in the ﬁeld, while 28% relied on the plant village databases
(www.kaggle.com/charuchaudhry/plantvillage-tomato-leaf-
dataset). PlantVillage is a free downloadable web dataset containing
images of 54,303 healthy and diseased leaves, divided into 38 categories
by species and disease. Species include apple, blueberry, cherry, corn,

52

grape, orange, peach, pepper, potato, raspberry, soybean, squash, straw-
berry, and tomato. Diseases are bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. The
remaining 18% used data from AI Challenger 2018, ImageNet, Crowd AI,
PlantDisease, Coffee leaf, etc. The sensors used to collect this data are
cameras, smartphones, and drones.

4.6. RQ5: What is the countries-wise distribution of the self made-data?

Fig. 4 presents the map of the experimental site of data collection
from the selected studies. It shows that most papers used data collected
in Asia (14, 6, 4, and 3, respectively, from China, India, South Korea, and
Bangladesh), followed by the United States of America, Europe (Italy,
Germany, United Kingdom, Greece, and Latvia). In addition, there
were some efforts from North Africa (Algeria and Egypt), Austral
Africa (South Africa), and East Africa (Tanzania). From the selected
studies, West Africa was not represented (Fig. 4).

4.7. RQ6: What models were used?

Deep Learning applications have accelerated exponentially over the
last ﬁve years thanks to the advancement of powerful computing de-
vices such as graphics processing units (GPU). Thus, this section con-
siders the classical machine learning algorithms and ends with deep
learning.

4.7.1. Classical machine learning algorithms for stress detection in fruits
and vegetables

Classical Machine Learning methods are either supervised, semi-
supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement based. In supervised learn-
ing, the datasets are labeled, which means that the output parameters
and expected results must be speciﬁed. Accuracy must also be adjusted
during the learning process. Examples of algorithms in supervised
learning are linear regressions, support vector machines (SVM), deci-
sion trees, etc. Semi-supervised learning methods combine labeled
and unlabelled data. Algorithms of this type are fuelled by certain infor-
mation through labeled categories, suggestions, and examples. Then
they create their labels by exploring the data on their own, according
to a rudimentary scheme or the guidance of data scientists. One exam-
ple is the naive Bayes classiﬁer that uses Bayes' theorem based on con-
ditional probabilities. Researchers employ this algorithm to recognize
classes of objects on labeled data sets. Then, the algorithm is trained
on unlabelled data. Once this cycle is completed, the researchers associ-
ate the labels and restart the training. This technique is mainly used in
the context of natural language processing. Unlike supervised algo-
rithms, unsupervised algorithms are not trained. Unsupervised algo-
rithms depend on extensive learning methods to identify patterns by
combing unlabelled training data sets and observing correlations.
Some examples are K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), and A priori. Reinforcement learning algorithms are built on re-
ward and penalty systems. The algorithm is assigned a goal and tries
to get closer to it to obtain maximum compensation. It relies on limited
information and learns from its previous actions. These algorithms may
depend on a pattern (a model); they must follow predeﬁned steps, and
the number of errors and trials is limited. Other algorithms do not rely
on a scheme and interpret with each new attempt. Supervised and un-
supervised methods are most commonly used for stress detection in
fruits and vegetables.

4.7.1.1. Supervised machine learning. Samajpati and Degadwala (2016)
propose the classiﬁcation of apple fruit diseases from the extraction of
features and colors. Random forest classiﬁers were used for disease clas-
siﬁcation. Still, on apple, Omrani et al. (2014) were interested in detect-
ing three-leaf diseases (Alternaria, black spot, and apple leaf miner)
using support vector regression based on the radial basis function. The
authors compared ANN and SVM as a classiﬁer and found that SVM per-
formed better. Note that the data used are unbalanced between the

three classes considered. Nine classiﬁcation algorithms are used for
jackfruit disease classiﬁcation in Bangladesh (Habib et al., 2022).
Among the algorithms, Random Forest performed better than all other
classiﬁers, with an accuracy of almost 90%. In addition, Vakilian and
Massah (2013) implemented a device for detecting two fungal diseases
of cucumbers. Inoculated plants are used as input for the ANN
backpropagation algorithm, giving an acceptable performance. Zhang
and Wu (2012) developed a classiﬁcation method based on multiclass
SVM in several steps. The ﬁrst step consisted of the background removal
of acquired images with a split-and-merge algorithm. The second step
involved extracting each fruit image's color histogram, texture, and
shape features for feature space composition. In the ﬁnal step, the
multiclass SVM was constructed. They come up with the Gaussian Ra-
dial Basis Kernel achieving the highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 88.2%.
In Razmjooy et al. (2012), they used SVM sequential minimal optimiza-
tion (SMO) to reach 95% accuracy for the classiﬁcation of potato defects.

4.7.1.2. Unsupervised machine learning. Dubey et al. (2013) proposed the
defect segmentation of apple fruits using k-means clustering in two
steps. The ﬁrst step consisted of pixel clustering based on color and spe-
cial features. The second step used the merged clustered block to a spe-
ciﬁc number of regions. Likewise, K-means clustering was used for
segmentation in the case of any infection (Samajpati and Degadwala,
2016). Moreover, Omrani et al. (2014) employed K-means clustering
to segment the region of interest in apple leaves. However, wavelet
and grey-level co-occurrence matrix techniques were used to get the
texture features. Also discussing segmentation of the diseased region,
Rozario et al. (2016) suggested a computer vision-based approach in
fruits and vegetables using K-means clustering, modiﬁed K-means clus-
tering, and the Otsu method. In Bangladesh, an agromedical expert sys-
tem for detecting and classifying papaya fruits has been developed
(Habib et al., 2020). The system uses K-means clustering to detect the
disease-infested region on a leaf. Still, in Bangladesh, another agro-
medical expert system for jackfruit detection and classiﬁcation has
been developed (Habib et al., 2022). The system also uses K-means clus-
tering to detect the disease-infested region on a leaf. PCA was employed
to reduce the dimensions of the feature space in Zhang and Wu (2012).
Moreover, for potato defect detection and size sorting, Razmjooy et al.

(2012) provided a system based on mathematical binarization and de-
fect segmentation using color-based classiﬁers.

4.7.2. Deep learning approaches

Depending on the learning task, four deep learning approaches can
be considered: deep supervised, deep semi-supervised, deep unsuper-
vised, and deep reinforcement learning.

ð

4.7.2.1. Deep supervised learning. The deep supervised learning tech-
nique deals with labeled data. It considers a collection of inputs and re-
Þ. For instance, we want to predict byi knowing the
sultant outputs xi, yi
input xi and will obtain a loss value l byi, yi
. Then, the network parame-
ters are repeatedly updated to get an improved estimate for the pre-
ferred outputs (Alzubaidi et al., 2021). There are several supervised DL
techniques, and the most common are convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

Convolutional neural networks, also known as CNN or ConvNet, are
deep learning algorithms that take the input image, assign weights/
biases to the components of the image, and then classify the entire pic-
ture. Based on the resolution and size of the image, it is transformed into
an array. Each entry consists of a number between 0 and 255 for RGB
(Red Green Blue) systems. This number represents the pixel intensity
of the image. CNN's structure consists of three layers: the convolutional
layer, the pooling layer, and the fully connected (FC) layer. The ﬁrst
layer makes extraction of high-level features. It convolved the image
with a ﬁlter or kernel using the formula: Z ¼ X∗f , where X and f are
the input image and the ﬁlter, respectively. The second layer intends
to reduce the spatial size of the image representation and the computa-
tional and processing overhead of neural networks. It also extracts key
positionally and rotationally invariant features. The last layer uses the
ﬂattened output of the previous pooling/convolution layer as input.
Flattened means that a 3D matrix or array is expanded into a vector.
Speciﬁc mathematical calculations are performed for each FC layer.
After the vector has passed through all the fully connected layers, the
softmax activation function is used in the last layer to calculate the
probability that input will belong to a particular class. This process is re-
peated for other classes and individual images within those classes. It
trains the network and teaches you, for instance, to distinguish between

healthy and diseased. Fig. 5 shows that most papers used GoogleNet,
ResNet50, and VGG16 for stress classiﬁcation in fruits and vegetables.
These are the architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNN).
The CNN technique has performed well on tasks such as disease identi-
ﬁcation on apple fruit (Agarwal et al., 2019; Alharbi and Arif, 2020; Jiang
et al., 2019; Sheikh et al., 2020), detection and diagnosis of damage to
jackfruit by pests and diseases (Orano et al., 2019; Kukreja and

One can attribute the widespread use of CNNs to their outstanding per-
formance in solving a wide range of problems, particularly those involv-
ing images (Alzubaidi et al., 2021). In addition to performance, there are
other advantages to using CNN models. For instance, the reduction of
weight and convolutional neurons (Agarwal et al., 2019), the capability
to transfer learning (Aﬁﬁ et al., 2021; Thet et al., 2020), the possibility to

deploy the models in a mobile application (Orano et al., 2019;
Ferentinos, 2018; Sheikh et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2019), the alleviation
of training time required (Atabay, 2017), the lower computational com-
plexity (Ferentinos, 2018), and the simplicity of the model (Singh et al.,
2018). Moreover, several open-source CNN software have been made
available. However, unbalanced data often hurt CNN models perfor-
mance (Hao et al., 2020). Apart from CNNs, there are other supervised
deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

The Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) technique is specialized in
sequences of data x tð Þ ¼ x 1ð Þ, . . . , x τð Þ with the time step index t rang-
ing from 1 to τ. It uses the knowledge gained from its previous state as
an input value for the current prediction. Therefore, it can help achieve
short-term memory in a network and effectively manage time-based
data systems. There are two different types of RNN: Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The LSTM is con-
ceived to use memory to forecast data in temporal sequences. It has
three gates: input, output, and oblivion. The GRUs also predict time se-
quences via memory but have two gates: Update and Reset. The RNN
method works best for tasks where a single input is connected to a sin-
gle output and a single input is associated with such an output se-
quence. It also works best with a series of inputs that produce a single
output, such as sentiment analysis, and a set of inputs that create a set

of outcomes. The technique is used to measure water stress in tomato
plants based on images, environmental data (temperature, relative hu-
midity, vapor pressure difference, and scattered light), and stem diam-
eter (Wakamori et al., 2020).

4.7.2.2. Deep semi-supervised learning. In Deep semi-supervised learning,
the learning process is based on partially-labeled datasets. That is, we
are in a situation where few labeled learning examples are available
and many unlabelled samples (Ouali et al., 2020). The proportion of la-
beled examples is generally relatively small, ranging from 1 to 10% of
the total number of instances (Ouali et al., 2020). Text document classi-
ﬁers are among the most common examples of semi-supervised learn-
ing applications because it is challenging to retrieve large numbers of
labeled text documents. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are
sometimes used in the same way as this technique. GANs are composed
of two models: the Generator, which generates new samples based on
the approximate distribution of the original dataset, and the Discrimina-
tor, which is used to distinguish the original dataset from the data gen-
erated by the Generator. Another variant of GANs techniques is Deep
Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs). DCGANs
techniques helped in estimating the severity of citrus diseases, improv-
ing the model learning performance (Zeng et al., 2020). The advantage
of these techniques is to minimize the amount of labeled data needed
(Alzubaidi et al., 2021). One of the drawbacks of this technique is irrel-
evant input functions that exist in training data and can lead to incorrect
decisions (Alzubaidi et al., 2021). GANs techniques are also known to be
unstable to train (Zeng et al., 2020).

4.7.2.3. Deep unsupervised learning. This technique allows running the
learning process without labeled data available. The model is supposed
to organize the data on its own, based on the input data's features, to
discover the data's unknown structure or relationship. This approach
often includes Generation network technology, dimensionality reduc-
tion, and clustering. Some members of the DL family are working well
on Nonlinear dimensionality reduction and clustering tasks. These in-
clude Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Autoencoder.

The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) or Boltzmann Ma-
chine: is a generative unsupervised model that learns a probability
distribution from the original dataset and infers data it has never
seen before. The RBM has an input layer and one or more hidden
layers. It uses a neural network with neurons connected to neurons
in the same layer and other neurons in other layers. The nodes are
connected in a circle. In contrast to all deterministic network models,
the RBM model is called stochastic. It is ideal for system monitoring
and handwritten digit recognition (eg: check veriﬁcation and crimi-
nal evidence). The advantage of RBM is its possibility to encode any
distribution due to its expressiveness and computational efﬁciency.
In addition, using hidden layer activation as input to other models
is a helpful feature to improve performance. This technique is more
challenging to train.

Autoencoders are unsupervised deep learning techniques used to
learn efﬁcient data coding (Kunapuli and Bhallamudi, 2021). They
consist of four or ﬁve ﬂat, two symmetric deep belief networks.
Half of the network encodes, and the other half decodes. The
autoencoder learns essential functions in the data by minimizing re-
construction errors between input and output data (Abirami and
Chitra, 2020). There are an equal number of neurons in the output
layer and the input layer with Autoencoders. Autoencoders are ﬂex-
ible due to both linear and nonlinear transformations in encoding
(Abirami and Chitra, 2020).

Autoencoder was used to predict and classify early and late phe-
nomena resulting from macronutrient deﬁciencies in tomato plants
(Tran et al., 2019) and for detection of lead concentration in lettuce
(Xin et al., 2020). In general, the most crucial drawback of unsuper-
vised learning methods is their inability to provide accurate

information from the data sorting and computational effort (Singh
et al., 2019).

4.7.2.4. Deep reinforcement learning. Developed in 2013 with Google
DeepMind (Mnih et al., 2015; Alzubaidi et al., 2021), Deep reinforce-
ment learning is the process by which an agent interacts with the envi-
ronment to change its state. The agent takes action accordingly based on
the observation made. Agents interact with the situation to help the net-
work achieve its goals. This network model has an input layer, an output
layer, and some hidden layers, and the state of the environment is the
input layer itself. The model serves as a continuous attempt to predict
future rewards for actions taken in a particular situation. This learning
is much more challenging to perform because it cannot use the simple
loss function (Alzubaidi et al., 2021) compared to the traditional deep
supervised method. In addition, there are two crucial differences be-
tween deep supervised learning and deep reinforcement learning.
First, one does not have full access to the function requiring optimiza-
tion. That is, one needs to query through the interaction. Second, the
state being interacted with is founded on an environment in which
the input is based on previous actions (Arulkumaran et al., 2017;
Alom et al., 2019; Alzubaidi et al., 2021).

4.8. RQ7: What are the hyper-parameters used to implement the models?

Fig. 6 shows four hyperparameters of DL models: the activation
functions, the pooling methods, the optimizers, and the loss functions.
The activation functions are added at each layer of the DL model. They
enable the algorithm to learn and understand something extremely
complicated and non-linear between the inputs and response variables.
Relu (Rectiﬁed Linear Unit) was preferred mainly (80%) over the other
Sigmoid, Tanh, and LeakyRelu. Because of its mathematical simplicity:
y = max(0,x), Relu uses less expensive operations. Therefore, its training
rate is fast (Kukreja and Dhiman, 2020), and it improves convergence
and rectiﬁes vanishing gradient problems. LeakyRelu is an extension of
the Relu function. The Sigmoid function is S-shaped and is used for bi-
nary classiﬁcation problems such as 0 healthy and 1 diseased. It is
expressed by: y ¼ 1= 1 þ exp (cid:2) x
Þ The activation function Tanh is an ex-
tension of the Sigmoid function. It can be calculated using the expression
y ¼ 1= 1 þ exp (cid:2) 2x
(cid:2) 1 Max pooling operators were used more than
average pooling (Fig. 6). The objects of interest produce the highest pixel
values, so taking the maximum value in a block will be better than the
average. In addition, max-pooling acts as a noise canceller and provides
better performance than average pooling.

The optimizers are algorithms used to minimize the loss function.
The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam(Adaptive Moment
Estimation) were the most used, respectively, with 52% and 27%. The
SGD frequently updates the model parameters and allows using large
data sets with less memory. Adam optimizer proposes an adaptive
learning rate for each parameter.

The loss function ’Categorical cross-entropy was used in more than
75% of the papers. The categorical cross-entropy function deals with
probabilities. Each of the predicted probabilities is compared to the ac-
tual value of the class output (0 or 1), and a score is calculated. In con-
trast, the Contrastive loss function operates on the data points
generated by the network and their positions relative to each other
(Khosla et al., 2020). Then, the Categorical cross-entropy seems better
for image classiﬁcation tasks.

4.9. RQ8: What are the evaluation metrics?

The most frequently used metrics for assessing model performance
are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (Fig. 7). Accuracy or Classiﬁ-
cation Accuracy (CA) measures the effectiveness of a model as the per-
centage of correct predictions where the top class (the one with the
highest probability) as indicated by the model, is the same as the target

label as annotated beforehand by the author (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-
Boldu, 2018). When precision (P) is the fraction of true positives (TP,
correct predictions) from the total amount of relevant results, the Recall
(R) is the fraction of TP from the total amount of TP and false negatives
(FN). The F1 score is the harmonic average of precision (P) and recall
(R). For multi-class classiﬁcation problems, each metric gets averaged
among all the classes. The following formulas are used to compute
them (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldu, 2018):

The R2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) are the few ob-
served regression metrics. The RMSE is the square root of the mean
square error. It is used to measure the standard deviation of the re-
siduals. The coefﬁcient of determination or R-square is the propor-
tion of the variance of the dependent variable that the linear
regression model explains. The R2 is a scale-free score, which
means that regardless of whether the values are small or large, the
R-square value will be less than one. The R2 and RMSE are calculated
using the following formulas.

4.10. RQ9: What are the performances achieved?

We consider the most used evaluation metric (accuracy) to group
the best-performing models reported by the authors into ﬁve classes.
The ﬁve classes are deﬁned as follows: class 1 from 95 to 99.99%, class
2 from 90 to 94.99%, class 3 from 80 to 89.99%, class 4 from 70 to
79.99%, and class 5 from 50 to 69.99%. We then calculated the occur-
rence of each model in a class and reported it as a frequency. This was
done for two purposes. The ﬁrst one is to identify the best models of
all those written by the authors. The second purpose is to check if the
best ones are also the most commonly used. We assume that a model
would be best if it has been mentioned each time with at least a 90% ac-
curacy value. Thus, a model must fulﬁll two criteria to be considered
‘best’. The ﬁrst criterion is that it has to be represented in the ﬁrst
class. The second criterion is that the model is neither in class 3 nor in
class 4 or 5. According to Fig. 8, only ResNet 50 and AlexNet meet the
criteria and can therefore be considered the ‘best’ models. Of the top
three most used models, GoogleNet, VGG16, and ResNet50, only
ResNet50 is among the best according to our criteria. One concludes
that the most used models are not all included in the best ones.

4.11. RQ10: What are the gaps and perspectives

The automatic detection and classiﬁcation of stress in fruits and veg-
etables is a useful approach that eases the task of both the farmer and
the specialist of plant pathology. Indeed, it allows non-experienced
farmers to monitor their plants and apply timely measures to optimize
yield. The plant pathologist can no longer travel long distances to assist
the farmer. However, there are ﬁve signiﬁcant gaps linked to the use of
these methods. The ﬁrst one, the most important of the whole process,
from training to testing the model, is related to the data. Data challenge
is on the one hand due to the source and, on the other hand, the quantity

of data. Collecting data representing the characteristics of several dis-
eases at different stages requires careful monitoring, ﬁnancial means,
time, and patience. It constitutes a constraint for researchers who, to
remedy this, use online databases to train their models. For example,
in more than 45% of the papers studied, the data used were obtained on-
line (Hong et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021; Adedoja et al.,
2019; Agarwal et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019;
Rangarajan et al., 2018). Plantvillage is the most popular of all the online
databases and is found in 28% of the articles reviewed. They offer the
possibility of having many images of several species. However, these
are images taken in the laboratory. These pictures are mostly infested
leaves with a homogeneous background (El-Kereamy et al., 2016).
They do not show different illumination levels given the time of day
the photo would be taken in the ﬁeld, the crop substrate, or any other
features observed in a natural ﬁeld environment. As a result, these
images do not reﬂect what is happening in the ﬁeld. Another challenge
related to the data is their small quantity which sometimes creates an
imbalance in classes. Indeed, there are some diseases whose symptoms
are not easily observed in the ﬁeld. Thus, collecting data to balance these
rare classes with other frequent classes is not always straightforward.
From the reviewed papers, many authors faced unbalanced classes
problem in their training data (Fenu and Malloci, 2021; Tani et al.,
2018; Kodors et al., 2021; Fuentes et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020). In addi-
tion, if the number of observations in some classes is minimal, it will be
challenging to represent between the classes, which will cause
problems in validation or creating test samples. For instance, Fuentes
et al. (2017) considered 0.9% of their dataset for the minimum class

and 43% of the data in the maximum class, while Kodors et al. (2021)
used 6% of the observations in the minimum class while 65% repre-
sented the maximum class. The ﬁnal consequence is the reduction of
the global performance of the model. Of the studied articles, 20% used
unbalanced data. Some augmentation methods, such as blur, rotation,
contrast enhancement, etc., are used to overcome overﬁtting and class
imbalance. However, these methods still do not reﬂect what is observed
in the actual situation. Apart from augmentation methods, transfer
learning is also used for small databases and unbalanced classes.
However, even transfer learning does not improve the model's accuracy
when the imbalance is enormous. The second gap is the consequence of
the ﬁrst. Indeed, the models deployed with data of homogeneous
characteristics or unbalanced classes suffer from bias and overﬁtting.
The unbalanced classes create problems because one doesn't get
enough insight into the class on which the model is based. Then, opti-
mized results were not obtained for imbalanced classes in real time.
The models show good performances on training data but have
difﬁculty generalizing. The ﬁnal consequence is the reduction of the
global robustness of the model. The third gap is the non-classiﬁcation
of the severity of some attacks. Although necessary, the infection's se-
verity was not implemented in some models (Orano et al., 2019;
Wang et al., 2020; De Luna et al., 2019). In particular, (Wang et al.,
2020) and (De Luna et al., 2019) proposed to detect whether apple
and tomato fruits were defective or not. But there are several levels of
defectiveness in general. Thus, the merchant would be more proﬁtable
if the algorithm categorized the severity of defects. Therefore, the less
attacked ones can be sold and the more attacked ones isolated quickly

to avoid losing everything. The fourth gap is related to the types of stress
studied. Most of the work focuses on the early detection of biotic stress,
such as diseases. Very little work has focused on abiotic stress due to
nutrient deﬁciency, water (water stress), heavy metal contamination,
and light quantity. At the same time, no work has been done on
predicting stress due to climate change in fruits and vegetables. Indeed,
climate change has many side effects in our lives. Thus, we recommend
that AI-based models be developed to predict the impact of abiotic
stress related to climate change on fruits and vegetables. It would
allow us to start thinking about ﬁnding mitigation measures. Finally,
the early detection of several diseases on the same leaf using AI methods
remains a real challenge. Because, in the ﬁeld, it is not uncommon to
ﬁnd several diseases or pest attacks on the same leaf. Experiments
should be implemented to collect mega data with various characteris-
tics on different species of fruits and vegetables. These data should be
made available to researchers to have robust models that work well in
real situations.

deep learning techniques used had a good performance but needed to
be improved. This review also provides research guidelines for scientists
who intend to work in this area.
