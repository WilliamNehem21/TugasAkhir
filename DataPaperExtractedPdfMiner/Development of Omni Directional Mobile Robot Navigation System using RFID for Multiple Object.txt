destinations. Both Omni robot and RFID system must be integrated to each other in the way of controlling the 
whole  system.  Omni  robot  is  concerned  due  to  its  capability  of  mechanical  manipulator  and  is  capable  of 
tethered and autonomous operation. It also focuses on RFID system which relies on navigation module using 
customized  features  of  RFID  technology.  RFID  system  consists  of  tags,  reader  with  antenna,  and  software. 
When an RFID reader scans the tag, a pulse of radio energy is sent out and the tag sends back the inventory 
control number. 
The objectives of this paper are; 

  To design and develop Omni directional mobile robot that can move in indoor environment. 
  To perform navigation by allocating identification tag at certain located area. 
  To develop an efficient algorithm in providing better solution during navigation and to go particular 

target. 

2. Methodology 

Following is the desired algorithm of mobile robot navigation system to navigate desired location of RFID 
tag by identifying the angle between the tags and the reader which is mounted on the mobile robot.Navigation 
elaborates  the  desired  algorithm  of  mobile  robot  navigation  system  to  navigate  location  of  RFID  tag  by 
identifying the angle between the tags and the reader which is mounted on the mobile robot.  

Initially, the robot is pre-programmed with an order list of tag numbers in defining the position of the tag 
whereas  the  current  target  angle  is  determined  by  calculating  current  goal  location.  When  the  known  ID  is 
achieved,  the  target  transponder  is  detected  through  the  signal  backscattered  from  all  the  tags  within  the 
communication  range.  The  calculation  after  input  received  by  the  two  antennas  is  recorded  and  computed 
using; 

(1) 

The mobile robot is then updating its headed by turn right and left and checked whether the angle between 
calculated and compass is reached. If not, it will turn until it found the correct angle. If yes, mobile robot is 
moving forward and detected more points. Mobile robot is then identifying current tag whether it is goal or 
not.  If  goal,  it  will  stop.  If  not  it  will  calculate  current  to  goal  angle  and  compare  through  continuous  loop 
until it find the goal. 

3. Omni Robot 

The  Omni  directional  mechanismhave  three  axis  and  angle  (x,y, )  movement  abruptly  in  a  two 
dimensional space, which ease to increase robot mobility and more keen access to limited spaces compared 
withconventional  two  wheel  driven  robot  [1].  Yukawa  et  al.  further  explained  that  Omni-directional 
mechanism  in  the  robot  consists  of  four  wheel  units  with  a  driving  mechanism  and  a  steering  wheel 
mechanism. Since the four wheel units drive and steer independently, the position and direction of the mobile 
robot can be controlled with a high degree of accuracy [2]. Omni robot is becoming technically demanding for 
users in industrial and business sectors Figure 1. Many Omni robot navigation system products are appearing 
within medium and long term propositions that lead to development of variety technology advancement in the 
future.  The  most  common  and popular navigation  techniques  suggested  in  the  state  of  the  art generally  fall 
under  one  of  the  following  categories:  dead-reckoning  based,  landmark-based,  vision  based,  and  behaviour 
technique based [3].

A.  Navigation 

The  fundamental  requirement  for  mobile  robot  through  navigation  is  to  estimate  the  position  of  the 
autonomous mobile robot. In earlier research, there are several methods used to estimating the robot position 
for  example  path  planning,  trajectory  planning,  algorithmic  exploration  and  path  execution  with  self-
localization. The goal of autonomous robot navigation is built for a system in which dynamically guide and 
control  the  mobile  robot  from  its  start  positions  to  a  predefined  end  position.  According  to  the  previous 
research, it is state that the robot successfully done their task if the robot can efficiently interpret the data from 
the sensor [4].  The first method used in previous research is self-localization. This method used the passive 
RFID  tag  where  placed  on  the  floor.  The  advantages  of  this  method  is  that  there  does  not  required  any 
information regarding the RFID tag except their ID number. Besides that, this method is used without need 
for the robot to stop temporarily to observe the RFID tag [5]. 

In addition, it is required to calculate the distance between the robot and the wall at the time robot passes 
the  specific  area  to  smoothly  organize  the  movement  of  the  robot.  Other  than  that,  by  using  the  trajectory 
planning and path planning, we can estimate the position of the mobile robot. The differences between this 
method is that the presence of moving and avoiding the obstacle. The path planning used common approach 
by performing the specific algorithm to determine the shortest path. While for the trajectory planning in the 
presence of obstacle and find out the path and motion along the path. Furthermore, effective approach can be 
used by combining the dead reckoning and external sensing by using the metric model. By using the odometry, 
the approximate current pose can be obtaining but maintain the pose estimate [4].

B.  Two wheel mobile robot 
Omni Directional robot locality is identical by 3-coordinates: position (x, y) and robot direction angle   in 
an  absolute  frame.  Therobot  can  mimic  the  waywhich  [5-8]  acquired  from  the  current  posture  (x,  y,  )  in 
analignment space. Figure 2 shows an active driving two-wheeled robotwhereC is the centre ofmotion of the 
robot. The platformscentre of gravity of is at the origin (o), and (Vx, Vy)represents linear speed or tangential 
velocity, and w is the angular velocity. Here,r is the radius of the wheels, and D for azimuth length between 
the  wheels  [9].  Robot  linear  speed  is  defined  by  the  absolute  velocity  (Vx,  Vy)  (Cartesian)in  the  platform

coordinate system at the origin (o), and w for the angular velocity [9-11]. Theta ( ) denotesthe heading angle 
of the turn in radians. The system is represented in (x, y) coordinate (and orientation) varying with respect to 
time. At any instant, the x the y coordinates of the robot’s centre point are changing based on its speed and 
orientation. While the time varying states, the physical laws governs the behaviour of the mobile robot but the 
system  is  time  invariant.

4 Result 

Data  from  in  table  1  are  collected  to  check  whether  the  tag  is  detected  fast  or  not.  This  experiment  is 
aimed to verify the counting number of passive tag that can be detected in 5.3 sec at a distance of 1cm.This 
passive tag can be detected at the range of 150mm.Each trial is tested to check detected tag during navigation. 
Each trial in figure 4 summarizes the path taken by mobile robot to reach its target.For trial 1 and 2, only five 
tag is detected, while trial 3, 4, and 6, six tag is detected and both trial 4 and 5, seven tag is detected. This 
experiment results in random decision path which will be taken by each trial.

applied  in  real  situation.  In  addition,  the  position  of  the  mobile  robot  is  determined  based  on  information 
provided  by  the  tag  and  the  orientation  information  by  the  compass  while  the  angle  between  the  robot’s 
current  direction  and  the  target  tag  is  used  to  provide  action  to  the  actuators.Intelligent  controller  might  be 
applied to the system to reduce an error. Moreover, suitable sensor such as ultrasonic sensor might be used to 
avoid obstacles in indoor environment.
