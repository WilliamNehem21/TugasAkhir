Abstract Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the popular decision support systems for
multi-criteria decision making problems. The AHP has different theories for prioritization, consis-
tency evaluation and consistency improvement, a review of which is presented in this study before
diving deep into the core contribution. Consistency evaluation is one of the key computations while
using the AHP. This paper describes a method that can be employed to improve the consistency of
the judgment matrix utilized by using the Cosine Consistency Index (CCI). The approach described
uses a cosine maximization method to revise the entries in the judgment matrix on an iterative basis
until the CCI is improved. The recommended method entails that it is possible to modify any judg-
ment matrix to achieve CCI of desired level. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested with numer-
ical examples and improved CCI values are validated through paired sample t-test. The results of
this study showed that the algorithm signiﬁcantly improves CCI values with the inclusion of pro-
posed approach.

1. Introduction

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the more
popular decision-making techniques that are widely utilized
to address Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) prob-
lems. This method breaks down the problem into a hierarchy
of sub-problems. Then from the elicited judgments from
experts on the comparative performance or criticality of the
sub-problems, priorities are computed. These priorities enable
the decision making related to sorting, ranking or selecting the
most suitable alternative in MCDM problems [1]. One of the
biggest advantages of a AHP approach is that it helps decision

makers to dissect a complex issue into its constituent parts in a
manner that is more simplistic [2–6]. However, as a MCDM
tool, it does have inherent disadvantages and the way in which
criteria are aggregated is often criticized as potentially risking a
loss of information, for example, in situations in which trade-
offs between good and bad scores occur. Furthermore, AHP
involves a large amount of pairwise comparisons [4], which
could sometimes become tiring during judgment elicitation.
Moreover, some of the studies adopt fuzzy set theory [7] and
analytical network process [8,9] to offset the limitations in tra-
ditional AHP. Also various theories exist as to which decision
making processes can effectively help a group of people to
mutually agree on problems and opportunities. Techniques
such as structuring, ordering, grading and evaluating have
been comprehensively explored across a wide variety of studies
relating to group decision making processes [10]. Previous
research into AHP as a MCDM tool has indicated that it
can be very effective when applied to a group decision problem
because it allows the priorities of each participant to be accu-
rately estimated [11–15] and subsequently improved through
quantitative methods [16–18] before being aggregated into a
set of preferences that reﬂect the requirements of each partici-
pant [19–24].

In order to ensure that AHP is implemented in an effective
manner, it is important to ensure that the judgment matrix
upon which it is based has a Cosine Consistency Index (CCI)
that is approximately equal to 1. According to the literature
[25], it is acceptable for a CCI to be above 0.90, but anything
below 0.90 is unacceptable. However, while their insights are
useful, they failed to extend how CCI can be improved. Con-
structing a judgment matrix that delivers an acceptable CCI
is extremely challenging because it is very difﬁcult to compare
the various elements of the matrix, and the human capacity to
do so is limited. Moreover, some recent studies on decision
making in hierarchical collaborative production planning
[26], knowledge discovery [27] and service-oriented enterprise
architecture [28] have failed to address and statistically validate
[29,30] consistency improvement in preferences. This becomes
all the more critical for the experts in more complex problems
and in the presence of incomplete or subjective information.

One method of improving the CCI of matrices that demon-
strate inconsistency (CCI < 0.90) could be to return them to
experts who have the ability to restructure them via a series of
relevant judgments in a manner that ensures increased CCI.
Although such an approach may yield reliable and accurate
results, it is largely impractical because of both the longer time
requirements of such an approach and the availability of experts
for subsequent rounds of judgment elicitation. As such, there is a
need to develop a method of improving the consistency of judg-
ment matrices that demonstrate CCI < 0.90, so that the revised
matrix achieves an acceptable consistency (CCI P 0.90). Once
such a matrix has been developed, it would then be possible to
derive the reasonable priority vector of the ﬁrst matrix by apply-
ing the Cosine Maximization Method (CMM). The CMM cal-
culates CCI value by calculating average similarity between
priority vector and each column of AHP matrix with an objec-
tive of maximizing the CCI value. Previous research have exam-
ined this type of approach [15,31–35] and highlighted the need
for methods of consistency improvement through convergence
focused iterative approaches.

This study proposes an approach that can be used to
improve the cosine consistency of a given judgment matrix,

so that more priorities can be evaluated for prioritization
and empirical ﬁndings from data. The research will describe
the use of an algorithm on a matrix that exhibits inconsistent
CCI to develop a consistent judgment matrix that yields
acceptable CCI (CCI P 0:90). A numerical example that
demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed
algorithm will also be presented followed by validation
through t-test.

2. Theory and methods

Before moving on to the actual contribution in the current
study, it is important to review the background of develop-
ments in the methods of AHP. So we ﬁrst evaluate the different
methods within AHP and subsequently the different methods
for consistency evaluation within AHP. Subsequently we nar-
row down our discussion to the Cosine Maximization (CM)
and CCI approach developed by Kou and Lin [25] and how
the current study extends it.

2.1. Prioritization methods using AHP

The prioritization method provides a process by which the reli-
able priority vector can be obtained from expert judgments. In
recent years, a number of prioritization methods have
emerged. However, the performance and suitability of these
decision support methods have met with a lot of academic con-
troversy and often it has been proposed to try out hybrid
approaches for improving results, from the classic literature
to recent studies [25,36,37]. A review of 20 popular prioritiza-
tion methods within AHP has been summarized in table pro-
vided in the supplementary materials
(i.e. Eigen vector
method [38], weighted least squares method [39], additive nor-
malization method [15], least squares method [40], gradient
Eigen weight and least distance method [41], geometric mean
method [42], geometric least squares method [43], logarithmic
least squares method [44], goal programming method [45], log-
arithmic goal programming method [46], fuzzy preference pro-
gramming method [47], unusual and false observations [48],
singular value decomposition method [49], interval priority
method [50], linear programming method [51], data envelop-
ment analysis method [52], correlation coefﬁcient maximiza-
tion [53], Bayesian prioritization procedure [54], weight
estimation with evolutionary strategy [55], and heuristics and
re-evaluation based method [56]). Since there are so many
approaches for prioritization under different constraints and
contexts, Srdjevic [57] argued that a better priority vector
can be derived when various prioritization methods are com-
bined. The availability of so many methods within AHP also
highlights the difference of outcome in comparable methods,
due to which there is a need to explore methods on improving
consistency of priorities.

2.2. Methods for consistency evaluation using AHP

In view of such focused studies on challenges of priority estima-
tion when information and judgments may be imprecise and less
clear to the experts, the need for measuring consistency of such
contexts was established. Several researchers have identiﬁed
methods of measuring the extent to which PCM is consistent.
Seven common methods and indexes for consistency evaluation

have been reviewed in table provided in the supplementary
materials (i.e. logarithmic-least squares [58], geometric consis-
tency index [11], random index method [59], the induced matrix
method [60], statistical consistency test [61,62], consistency ratio
measure [63] and harmonic consistency index [64]). Vargas [65]
employed a statistical approach to develop a statistical method-
ology for the consistency test. Consistency index in previous the-
ories has been used as a reliable source to validate the ﬁnal
solution and to interpret weights for each expert in consensus
models [66,67]. Further, group decision making problems can
be effectively described by multiplicative preference relations
using consensus degree [68]. Some of the previous studies have
tried to assess the vulnerability pairwise comparison matrix
using dynamic changes to criteria importance by focusing on
preference at one or more times [69]. In this study, we focus
on the Cosine Maximization Method, which is one of the emerg-
ing approaches. The reason for focusing on this method is
because it provides high ﬂexibility and efﬁciency based on mul-
tiple performance criteria such as Euclidean distance and mini-
mum violation for improving the consistency of a judgment
matrix [25]. Further it develops the same ordinal stability for pri-
oritization as multiple other methods such as Eigen vector based
methods and additive normalization methods, while it performs
better than weighted least square methods and logarithmic least
square methods. Further in terms of Euclidean distance based
error measures, CMM has the lowest error reported as com-
pared to other methods such as Eigen vector based methods,
additive normalization methods performs, weighted least
square methods and logarithmic least square methods. This is
why, this study focuses on the CMM and attempts to address
some of its existing limitations as discussed in forthcoming
sections.

2.3. Methods for consistency improvement in AHP

A range of approaches associated with consistency improve-
ments was investigated by many authors, such as Peters and
Zelewski [70] and Ishizaka and Lusti [71]. Moreover, one of
the recent studies proposed a set of properties that describe a
family of
functions for representing inconsistency indices
[72]. Seventeen common consistency improvement methods
have been reviewed in table provided in the supplementary
material (i.e. Eigen value improvement [73], convergent itera-
tive algorithm [33], least square method [74], triplet selection
[75], heuristic algorithm [70], controlled error consistent matrix
development [71], weak transitivity [76], Gower plot and linear
programming [77], auto generate consistent matrix [16], con-
trolled linguistic preference deviation [78], adaptive AHP
method [79], missing value multi-layer perceptron [80], orthog-
onal projection and linearization [81], integer programming
[82], consistency and consensus improvement [67], consistency
optimization [83] and ordinal consistency improvement meth-
ods [84]). Among such approaches, a CMM provides an efﬁ-
cient and valid means of identifying a priority vector in the
AHP. CMM offers a number of advantages over other prior-
itization methods: it enables derivation of a consistency index
for the PCM, removes the need for statistical modeling and
facilitates the calculation and interpretation of the CCI. Over
the past few decades a signiﬁcant body of academic work
has explored many facets of pairwise comparison methodol-
ogy, but it is only in recent years that studies by Koczkodaj

and Szwarc [85] and Brunelli and Fedrizzi [86] have begun to
address the key issue of calculating the most viable inconsis-
tency indices. Within the AHP, the most effective methodology
for identiﬁcation of the priority vector has long been debated,
and seminal works were published by Cook and Kress [87],
Fichtner [88] and Barzilai [89]. However, Ishizaka and Lusti
[90] demonstrated by statistical analysis that, in the majority
of cases, the variations between the different methods were
not statistically signiﬁcant, and did not materially affect the
outcome of the AHP. In addition, a recent study has found
that properties 3 and 4 from a proposed list of 6 did not cor-
respond to the Cosine Consistency Index [72].

2.4. Cosine Maximization Method (CMM)

Before moving to the technical use of CMM for the purposes
of deriving priority vectors, a fundamental understanding of
the associated deﬁnitions and theorems is required. These are
elaborated as follows:

Deﬁnition 1. Matrix A ¼ ðaijÞn(cid:2)n
aij > 0, aii ¼ 1 and aij ¼ 1=aji for all i; j 2 f1; 2; . . . ; ng.

is positive reciprocal

if

Deﬁnition 2. A positive matrix A ¼ ðaijÞn(cid:2)n is perfectly consis-
tent if aij ¼ aikakj for all i; j; k 2 f1; 2; . . . ; ng.

Deﬁnition 3. The similarity measure between two vectors, ti
and tj, SMðti; tjÞ, in a n dimensional vector space, V, is a map-
ping from V (cid:2) V to the range [0, 1]. Thus SMðti; tjÞ 2 ð0; 1Þ.

Property 1. The similarity measure in Deﬁnition 3 exhibits the
following well-known characteristics:

(1) 8ti 2 V , SMðti; tiÞ ¼ 1;
(2) 8ti, tj 2 V , SMðti; tjÞ ¼ 0 if ti and tj are dissimilar;
(3) 8ti, tj, tk 2 V ,SMðti; tjÞ < SMðti; tkÞ if ti is more like tk

than it is like tj.

The objective of the use of the similarity measure was to
produce similarity mapping that identiﬁes more similar vectors
that have a higher similarity value. Further, the vectors of Rn are
considered column vectors.

Theorem 1. If
tj ¼ ðtj1; tj2; . . . ; tjnÞT,
two vectors ti and tj would be as follows [25]:

two vectors were ti ¼ ðti1; ti2; . . . ; tinÞT and

Several common similarity measures are currently in wide use
such as, Dice, Jaccard, overlap and cosine similarity measures
[91].

A PCM will result in a set of priority vectors, and these can
be used to produce a similarity measure. The hierarchy that
results from the use of AHP represents the complex decision
problem. Within this, the cosine similarity measure represents

 
Improving the Cosine Consistency Index

the similarity between the priority vector and each column vec-
tor of the PCM. This type of measurement system has been
applied to both information retrieval [92,93] and AHP [94]
models.

The cosine similarity of Theorem 1 can be utilized to derive
a reliable priority vector from a given PCM. Let A ¼ ðaijÞn(cid:2)n as
a positive reciprocal PCM and w ¼ ðx1; x2; . . . ; xnÞT as a

According to (2), A consists of the following n column vectors:

Let Cj be the cosine similarity measure between the priority
vector w and the jth column vector aj of A, where
w ¼ ðx1; x2; . . . ; xnÞT and aj ¼ ða1i; a2j; . . . ; anjÞT.

As such, it is only in the event that A is perfectly consistent
that it is possible for the cosine similarity measure between
the derived priority vector and each column vector of A to
be equal to 1. If this is not the case,
0 6 Cj < 1

ð6Þ

This means that the derived priority vector and each column
vector of A need to be equal to 1 as much as possible for the
priority vector to be reliable. The optimization model can be

2.5. Cosine Consistency Index

The consistency of PCM is an important issue in the applica-
tion of AHP to derive a priority vector. In one piece of
research, Saaty [38] developed the use of a CI that was corre-
lated with the use of the eigenvector method (EV) and this was
represented as follows:
CI ¼ ðk (cid:5) nÞ=ðn (cid:5) 1Þ
ð13Þ
where n is the dimension of the PCM, k is the principal eigen-
value of the PCM, the Perron root [95] and approximate prior-
ity vector of A. According to this approach, a PCM needs to be
perfectly consistent for CI ¼ 0. However, while a large number
of different methods and approaches have been presented in
the existing literature, there is a lack of consensus on their
effectiveness and reliability [32,96–98]. As such, there is a dis-
tinct requirement to produce a new consistency index related

 
 
122

G. Khatwani, A.K. Kar

to the CM method that measures the inconsistency level of a
PCM in a standard and reliable manner.

According to the rules presented in Theorem 3, bearing in
mind the fact that C(cid:4) is the optimal objective function value
of the optimization model (12), for PCM to be perfectly con-
sistent, we require the following:

C(cid:4) ¼ n

Otherwise,
0 < C(cid:4) < n

ð14Þ

ð15Þ

The inﬂuence of the size of a PCM can be eliminated by divid-
ing the objective function value C(cid:4) by n. This results in C(cid:4)=n,
which is the CCI of the PCM and takes on values in the inter-
val (0, 1]. The following emerges:
CCI ¼ C(cid:4)=n

ð16Þ

In the event the PCM is perfectly consistent:

CCI ¼ 1

Otherwise
0 < CCI < 1

ð17Þ

ð18Þ

and this condition entails that the PCM demonstrates relative
consistency.

This study has not addressed methods by which CCI
thresholds can be identiﬁed, nor has it examined the relation-
ship between the consistency of CCI and PCM. While there is
no benchmark cutoff measure for CCI, given its implications
for PCM, it is pertinent to expect a CCI of at least 90% [25].
Through considering the practical application of CM, it
becomes apparent that this method does offer some distinct
advantages over prioritization approaches. It is easy to com-
pute, provides a consistent measurement method and is
unique. However, the method will only be effective if it is
applied to a complete and precise PCM that offers the required

3. Improvements to the Cosine Consistency Index approach

Let N ¼ f1; 2; . . . ; ng. Recall that a judgment matrix A ¼ ðaijÞ
is an n (cid:2) n matrix, all of whose entries are positive such that
aji ¼ 1=aij, for all i; j 2 N, especially aii ¼ 1, i 2 N. The judg-
ment matrix always represents a positive reciprocal matrix.
An n (cid:2) n judgment matrix is consistent if aij ¼ aikakj, for all
i; j; k 2 N

Lemma 2.1. If an n (cid:2) n judgment matrix A ¼ ðaijÞ is a
consistent matrix, and w ¼ ðx1; x2; . . . xnÞT is its principal right
eigenvector, then aij ¼ ðxi=xjÞ, for all i; j 2 N. Let A ¼ ðaijÞ be
an n (cid:2) n matrix, and w ¼ ðx1; x2; . . . xnÞT be the principalright
eigenvector of A. From this lemma, we know that if A is a
consistent matrix, then aij ¼ ðxi=xjÞ, for all i; j 2 N, namely,

Step 3 Use Eq. (16) to calculate the CCI;

However, this approach does not take into consideration the
fact that the people’s perceptions and the decisions they make
are likely to vary in response to their psychological states and
the information to which they have access. As such, Eq.(19)
does not hold. Hence, we can take the comparison matrix A
as a perturbed matrix of the consistent matrix W ¼ xi=xj
namely, set
aijðxj=xiÞ ¼ eij
where eij is perturbation variable, eij > 0, and eji ¼ 1=eij.

Eq. (20) can be expressed as eij ¼ aijðxj=xiÞi; j 2 N in this
case, we set ers ¼ maxi;jfeijg ¼ maxi;jfaijðxj=xiÞg and thus, ars
related to ers is an entry that has the largest deviation in matrix
A. Judgment matrix A demonstrates an unacceptable CCI
ðCCI < 0:90Þ and it is natural that any attempts to improve it
involve ﬁrst attempting to modify the entry ars. It is
will
important that the corresponding entry asr is also modiﬁed in

In the next step, this approach of improving the CCI needed
empirical validation with real datasets. The validation with
actual data is elaborated in the subsequent section.

4. Method validation

This section will present the application of the approach
described above within two numerical examples in order to
practically demonstrate the recommended approach and high-
light the advantages of the CCI improvement approach. The
improvements in the CCI values through the application of
the WAM and WGM form are respectively shown in Tables
1 and 4. Further, Tables 2 and 5 respectively highlight the
average number of iterations required for WAM and geomet-
ric mean form to achieve CCI >¼ 0:90 for 20 different data-
sets. These datasets are PCMs that were collected as primary
responses for prioritization among alternatives for the prob-
lem, namely information search channel selection [99]. The
users were asked to select preference between the pair for seven
different criteria that inﬂuence consumers’ search for informa-
tion on Internet.

Subsequently,

the optimal objective function value C(cid:4)
should be calculated by following step 2 of the algorithm.
CCI should then be calculated using Eq. (16).

If CCI < 0.90, the error matrix should be calculated and the
element that needs to be modiﬁed in order to improve the
CCI identiﬁed. Each of these steps should be repeated until
CCI P 0.90.

The variables FinalCCI and InitialCCI are the paired vari-
ables with a sample size of 20. The improvement in CCI values
can be validated by paired sample t-test with following
hypothesis:

H01: There is no signiﬁcant improvement in CCI with the
WAM approach.
Ha1: There is a signiﬁcant improvement in CCI with the
WAM approach.

The summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation,
and standard error along with their conﬁdence limits of differ-
ence for paired variables are displayed in Table 3. The test is
signiﬁcant (t = 26.415, p = 0.000), indicating that there is a
signiﬁcant improvement in CCI with the WAM approach.

Further, one of the assumptions of paired t-test is that the
difference between paired observations is assumed to be nor-
mally distributed. The authors have used Q–Q plot of differ-
ence between FinalCCI and InitialCCI values as a tool to
verify the assumption and it can be observed from Fig. 2 that

5. Conclusion

This paper described the use of a corrective model that utilizes
cosine maximization to produce a comparison matrix that
exhibits consistent CCI. The CM technique is used to maxi-
mize the sum of the cosine angle between each column vector
and derived priority vector of a PCM. An algorithm has been
suggested for determining transformed PCM and the weight
vector. The cosine maximization was employed to amend a
pair of entries that exhibited maximum errors, thus ensuring
that the resulting matrix maintained all major information that
was present in the original matrix. Through applying either the
WAM form or the WGM form detailed in Step 5 of the
approach, it was possible to revise the matrix in an effective
manner. As such, the approach recommended is viable and
can be applied to inconsistent CCI ratings of <0.90 in order
to create a positive reciprocal matrix that demonstrates
CCI P 0:90. Further, for given scenario it was possible to
establish that average number of iterations required in achiev-
ing a CCI P 0:90 for WAM form and the WGM form is
almost similar. The algorithm converges to CCI = 1 but this
study limits its improvement scope to near approximate value

t-test for WAM approach.

Further, it can be observed from Fig. 3 that Q–Q plot of
CCI improvement values shows no obvious deviations from
normality for WGM approach.

Thus the improvement in outcome is established based on
the proposed method of improvement on the CCI. The average
number of iterations in such improvement is also an indication

of 0.90 to address the research gap of Kou and Lin [25]. More-
over, the number of iterations of WAM and WGM to achieve
desired consistency level depends on context speciﬁc require-
ments and computational time and cost constraints. Finally,
the algorithm was
tested with numerical example and
improved CCI values were validated through paired sample
t-test.
It can be concluded that algorithm signiﬁcantly
improved CCI values with the inclusion of proposed approach.
The study successfully carried out in the present research
has considerable consequences for managers. Notably, it is
possible to exploit the proposed soft computing technique as
a crucial decision-making instrument for managers. This is
advantageous with respect to the way it can optimize the
matrix consistency to desired level. In the context of optimiza-
tion, it is possible for managers to utilize the technique to select
different alternatives without being subject to bias toward a
certain alternative or criteria. In terms of applicability, a major
challenge of using AHP for empirical research is getting ample
number of consistent responses which may facilitate generaliz-
ability of results. This approach will ensure that more

t-test for WGM approach.

Improving the Cosine Consistency Index

127

responses may be modiﬁed systematically, so that the consis-
tency challenge may be addressed, and more priorities are used
for empirical data collection and analysis.

The next steps of the research should involve the practical
application of the proposed approach to real-life case studies.
Through using these case studies, it will be possible to compare
the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with similar
existing approaches. This work can potentially be extended
in the future to include the amalgamation of statistical mea-
sures that can precisely describe optimal consistency levels.
Further, some future research can be in direction of improving
the algorithm which reduces the number of iterations for
reaching the optimal consistency index using cosine maximiza-
tion method. Moreover, the purpose of study was to develop a
CCI improvement method rather to check the signiﬁcant devi-
ation of new matrix priority vector from original matrix prior-
ity vector. However, future studies can focus on adding
constraint that checks for signiﬁcant deviation of new matrix
from original matrix for achieving optimum consistency level.
Some possible limitations for proposed method are that the
CM for priority vector derivation method fails on imprecise
and incomplete matrix. The scope of conversion of imprecise
information and incomplete judgments from experts to priori-
ties that satisfy all requirements surrounding consistency (or
even consensus) has not been explored. Finally, threshold for
CCI for achieving desirable value is yet to be derived using
relationship between PCM consistency and CCI, and could
be taken forward in future exploration of the method.
