In recent years, set-theoretic categories, i.e. categories where objects are sets (classes) of a possible non-wellfounded universe and morphisms are set(class)- theoretic functions, have been used as a convenient setting for studying the foundations of the coalgebraic approach to coinduction, see [1,2,6] [7,8,10,18,19,17]. Both among category theorists and among set-theorists however, set-theoretic categories had not received much attention for opposed ideological motiva- tions.

In Section 1, we recall some definitions and basic facts concerning set the- ory and set-theoretical categories. In particular, we recall the definitions of set based functor and of inclusion preserving functor, and Aczel-Mendler Fi- nal Coalgebra Theorem. In Section 2, we study some properties of inclusion preserving functors, which will be useful in proving the main results of the paper. In Section 3, we strengthen Aczel-Mendler Theorem, by showing that all class-theoretic functors admit final coalgebras. In Section 4, we study two classes of partially specified endofunctors on set-theoretic categories: functors which are constant on objects and functors which are identical on objects. Directions for future work appear in Section 5.

The core of this subsection is to prove that if F is a functor which has con- stant set-cardinality on objects, then F is naturally isomorphic to an inclusion preserving functor G, which is constant. To this end, we need the following Lemmata 4.1 and 4.2.

Now we are in the position of stating the main result of this section, i.e. Theorem 4.14 below. This follows from the following inconsistency result of fixed points in a cartesian closed category with coproducts, applied to the image category of Definition 4.7.
