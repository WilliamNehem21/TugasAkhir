The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recall some nota- tion, notions and facts. In Section 3 we prove the computability of the canonical form and of the set H. In Section 4 we describe the difference scheme for (1) and some of its properties. In Section 5 we prove the computability of the solution op- erator for (1). We conclude in Section 6 with a short discussion of possible future work.

The difference scheme may be chosen in various ways. Our scheme taken from [5] is a little more complicated than the scheme used in [4] but it has some useful feature mentioned in the introduction. We describe it in few stages.
