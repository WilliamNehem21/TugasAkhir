in the sense that we can freely convert between the two. The notation we use has the advantage that word concatenation is easier to define, and behaves somehow more naturally. This makes it easier to develop the theory in this paper. A different notation is used by Asarin, Caspi, and Maler [2]. They

Remark 3.1 We should note that we allow the bounds on intervals I to be real-valued, whereas in the literature they are taken to be integer-valued. The added expressiveness of allowing real-valued bounds will be important later in this section to define a useful notion of derivative for timed regular expressions.

There are two obvious open questions that remain to be resolved. First, can Theorem 6.2 be extended to real-bounded intervals? Preliminary inves- tigations seem to indicate that it is the case, but the details remain to be worked out. Second, can Theorem 6.2 be extended to timed regular expres- sions with other kinds of integer-bounded intervals? A variation of the proof of Theorem 6.2 can be used to get a version of the theorem for expressions e1 and e2 with interval-bounded, left-open, and right-closed intervals. Whether this can be extended to expressions with a mix of both types of intervals, or with left-open and right-open intervals is not clear.

e. It remains to be seen whether the approach applies to any of the extended form of timed regular expressions described in Section 3 that can capture the full class of languages recognized by the timed automata of Alur and Dill [1]. There been a fair amount of work on studying bisimulation of timed pro- cesses in the context of timed process algebras (see [18,12], for instance.) It would be interesting to relate that work to the one in this paper. One differ- ence is that timed processes are typically not taken to be distributive (that is,
