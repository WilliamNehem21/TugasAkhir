We give a technique that can be used to prove that a given function is a measurement. We demonstrate its applicability by using it to resolve three notoriously difficult cases: capacity in information theory, entropy in quantum mechanics and global time in general relativity. We then show that this technique provides a new and surprising characterization of measurement. Thus, in principle, it can always be used.

What was far from clear in [10] was whether or not capacity was a measurement. In [8], it was shown that C measured its kernel, but the complexity of the argument prevented its extension to all channels. However, as we shall now see, Theorem 3.2 makes it possible for us to prove that capacity measures the entire interval domain without doing any additional work.

We previously viewed the bijection N  I[0, 1] as a way of transferring domain theoretic structure from I[0, 1] to N. However, we can also view it as a way to transfer topological structure from N to I[0, 1]. Specifically, we topologize I[0, 1] with the Euclidean topology N inherits as a subset of the plane. Thus, we represent I[0, 1] as the region of the unit square below and including the main diagonal.
