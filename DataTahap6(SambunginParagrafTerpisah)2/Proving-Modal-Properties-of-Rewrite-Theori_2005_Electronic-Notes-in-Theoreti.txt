Rewriting logic is a very expressive formalism for the specification of concurrent and distributed systems; more generally, it is a logic of change. In contrast, VLRL is a modal logic built on top of rewriting logic to reason precisely about that change. Here we present a technique to mechanically prove VLRL properties of rewrite theories using the reflective capability of rewriting logic through its Maude implementation.

Rewriting logic [9] provides a formal framework for modelling concurrent sys- tems in terms of states and state transitions, which is efficiently implemented in the Maude system [5]. It is a logic of change in which deduction directly corresponds to the change. In contrast, the Verification Logic for Rewriting Logic (VLRL) [7] is an action modal logic to talk about change in a more indirect and global manner, like other modal and temporal logics. VLRL was developed to prove abstract properties of systems specified in rewriting logic.
