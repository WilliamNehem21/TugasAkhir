The leave-function must be executed for all profiles in Pa, and the enter -function must be executed for all profiles in Pb. An additional WOS is added to consider the overhead of the RTOS due to context switches. We can now state the definition for the WCET Wreconf(ca, cb).

In the field of dynamic-priority scheduling some scheduling algorithms exists, which allow a change of task parameter at run time. Most algorithms concentrate on changing a single resource only: the CPU utilization, by changing the task periods. For example Elastic Scheduling [4] treats tasks as springs with given elastic coefficients to better conform to actual load conditions. In the Rate-Based Earliest execution time of a task can be changed at run time. The Scheduler is based on general model of real-time scheduling called Resource Allocation/Dispatching (RAD). RAD separates the management of the amount of resources allocated to each task from the timing of the delivery of those resources. Our Flexible Resource Manager internally uses a quite similar separation. Constraints on the amount of resources and the timing constraints are checked separately.
