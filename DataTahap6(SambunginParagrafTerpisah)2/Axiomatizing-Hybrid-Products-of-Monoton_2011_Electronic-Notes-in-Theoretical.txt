The main aim of this paper is to propose a robust way to combine two monotone hybrid logics. This work can be regarded as a further extension of both topological semantics for hybrid logic (Ten Cate and Litak 2007) and bi-hybrid logic of products of Kripke frames (Sano 2010). First, we generalize the notion of product of topologies (Van Benthem, et al 2006) to the monotone neighborhood frames and introduce two kinds of nominals: i (e.g. for a moment of time) and a (e.g. for a spatial point), and the corresponding satisfaction operators: @i and @a to describe a product of monotone neighborhood frames. Second, we give five interaction axioms and establish a general completeness result called pure completeness of bi-hybrid logic of monotone neighborhood frames. By extending this, we also establish a pure completeness result of bi-hybrid logic of products of topologies.

also [15]). They proposed a way of combining two topological modal logics, based on topological semantics for modal logic studied by McKinsey and Tarski [11]. More- over, they showed that the fusion of two S4s is complete with respect to the product of two rational lines, while Kremer [8] showed that this fusion is incomplete with respect to the product of two real lines. Up to now, however, there is no study of the weaker notion of product of neighborhood frames (for neighborhood semantics of modal logic, the reader can refer to [3]).

The most significant feature of [13] is to propose the idea of naming lines by two kinds of nominals, instead of the ordinary idea of naming points in hybrid logic. This idea allows us to extend pure completeness result to two-dimensional Kripke semantics. In this paper, we keep this key feature also for two-dimensional neighborhood or topological semantics and see if it gives rise to the corresponding general completeness result. As a result, we will demonstrate that the idea of naming lines is robust for obtaining the completeness result.
