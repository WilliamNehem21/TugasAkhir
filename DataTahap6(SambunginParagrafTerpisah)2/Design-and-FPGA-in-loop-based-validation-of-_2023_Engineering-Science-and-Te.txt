Primary control: It is further divided into inner control and outer droop control loops. The inner control loop regulates the output current and voltage of DERs. The outer droop control is responsible for accurate power-sharing among the DGs and also mitigates the circulating current.

As aforementioned that tertiary control focuses on economic dis- patch and operation scheduling. It is also characterized as coordination between multiple MG, which are interconnected. In [14] tertiary con- trol is implemented to adjust the DG compensating efforts with respect to unbalanced voltage limits of DGs and load buses. Optimal power flow-based tertiary control using MPC is proposed in [15]. In [16], authors proposed a centralized IOT-based tertiary control solution for multi-microgrids.
