The authors [6,7] elaborately discussed singular boundary value problems and solved by the methods based on repro- ducing kernel space. Galerkin and Collocation methods are presented for solving two-point boundary value problems by Mohsen and El-Gamel [8]. Secer and Kurulay [9] described the Sinc-Galerkin method for singular Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. Rashidinia et al. [10] proposed a reliable paramet- ric spline method.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we review the basic properties of Bernstein polynomials and we develop the Bernstein operational matrix for derivative. Section 3 implemented and presented the methods of solution for the singular boundary value problems. In Section 4, some numeri- cal examples are presented to show the efficiency and the applicability of the suggested algorithm. Conclusion is given in Section 5.
