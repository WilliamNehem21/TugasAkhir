Negativity in items such as profit and loss, cash flow and share price change (adjusted, annual) was avoided by adding a fixed amount in all of these in order to have them be on scale from zero onwards (like in other DEA studies, see Pastor & Ruiz, 2007). In profit and loss, it was added 3789,001 EUR (thousands) to each real number, in cash flow the amount was 1454,001 EUR (thou- sands), while in share price changes it was added one (1). Also inventory turns needed to be modified for the purposes of DEA re- search as in general it is so that higher input amounts should lead to higher outputs (having the same and consistent direction be- tween inputs and outputs). Therefore, inventory turns was calcu- lated as an inverse number (lower the inventory turns, the higher the input number).

this study to larger economies, and possibly to main European ex- change listed companies or North American ones. The retail sec- tor in these markets has globally leading companies present, which would make examination of this sector fruitful. As manufacturing is increasingly Asian based, this would be another interesting di- rection to follow. In both of these possible further studies inven- tory and asset role should be examined further to shed more light on issues found in this research. Another possibility for further re- search would be to take earlier years in data from times before the global financial crisis. Using older data would enable to exam- ine the era, when there were higher interest rates. This ought to stress the importance of inventory and assets.
