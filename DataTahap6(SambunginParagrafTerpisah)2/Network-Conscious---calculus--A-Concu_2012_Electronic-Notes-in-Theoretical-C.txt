We distinguish two types of names: sites, which are the nodes of the network, and links, named connectors between pairs of sites. Sites are just atoms, e.g. a, links have the form lab, meaning that there is a link named l between a and b.

We show that we can gain the congruence property through a concurrent semantics, while keeping the notion of bisimilarity as standard as possible. We emphasize that interleaving semantics is far from being natural in this distributed setting. In fact, it is based on a mutual exclusion mechanism between remote actions which is simpler from a formal point of view, but not realistic for modeling concurrent systems.

Now we introduce well-formed NCPi processes. Informally, a process is well- formed if each bound link it contains is bound explicitly, and not as a side-effect of binding a site, and if two links with the same label but different endpoints do not appear free in any of its suprocesses. For instance, a(b).lbc.p and (lab)lab.lcd.p are not well-formed: the former because lbc is implicitly bound by a(b), the latter because l labels two links between different sites.

Our calculus only captures point-to-point communication, but a network could be used for more complex forms of interaction, e.g. multicast. One possible development direction might be allowing different mechanisms of message exchanging. Moreover, one can think of complex QoS conditions on resources, e.g. restrictions on bandwidth or costs. There is also some room for asynchronous variations, for instance each hop of a routing path could be performed in different transitions. This would capture the step-by-step behavior of SDNs.
