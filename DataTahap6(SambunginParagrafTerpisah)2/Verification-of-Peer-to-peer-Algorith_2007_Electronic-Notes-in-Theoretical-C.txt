In recent years, great importance has been placed on distributed applications and P2P networks. Such systems are decentralized and highly dynamic, allowing an arbitrary number of nodes to join and leave the network. The essential operation in most P2P systems is the efficient location of data items, and the question whether a node is reachable in the network is a crucial problem. P2P network constructs

In the literature that describes such algorithms, e.g. the original Chord paper by Stoica et al. [15], correctness proofs are sketched at a high level of abstraction and tend to provide no operational semantics. On the other hand, model-checking techniques are not directly applicable to the verification of P2P systems as these systems are inherently dynamic and have infinite-state behaviour. Thus, a real challenge is to find a right level of abstraction at which to model the algorithms and perform the verification.

In general, nodes can join the network in arbitrary order. Since the internal structure of the system is hid- den from the observer, a major problem is how to specify the behaviour of a ring. The approach we propose is to add a token ring protocol, i.e. an abstract token to be passed clockwise along the ring, on top of the Chord protocol.
