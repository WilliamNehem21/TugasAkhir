since both not involve messy and lengthy cables [16,17]. Gen- erally, a wireless sensor node consists of a computational mod- ule, communication module, power supply and appropriate sensing system [18,19,26]. Both wired and wireless technologies are extensively used for monitoring and controlling [16,20]. In future, both wireless sensor network and mobile communica- tion may assume an indispensable part of our lives due to their flexibility, deployment and low cost [21].
