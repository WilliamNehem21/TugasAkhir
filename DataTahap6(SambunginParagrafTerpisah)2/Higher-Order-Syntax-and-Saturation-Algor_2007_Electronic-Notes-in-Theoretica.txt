We denote by t[u := v] the term obtained from t by replacing all (capture-free) occurrences of u by v. The size of a term t, denoted by |t|, is defined by structural recursion as usual. A formula is a term of type B.

The design space for our later calculus will be given in this section in terms of saturatedness conditions. The idea is that if a set of formulas respects these closure conditions and we cannot observe an obvious contradiction, then, in fact, this set must be satisfiable. We will formulate this result as a model existence theorem.

notably seized upon the rich object-level in our system. Although our tamed rule of replacement gives insight into the limited power of the identity predicate in MFI1, the question remains open whether one can achieve local termination criteria for such a calculus. In the literature, e.g., [6], the argumentation is often that as soon as identities are involved, one faces the same problems as in K over transitive frames where formulas have to be passed along a chain of successors.
