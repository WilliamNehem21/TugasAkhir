This paper adopts the combined sensing, security and performance tradeoff in CRN [8]. In the model, arriving SU on finding an idle encryption node gets encrypted and then transmitted. The model included security control that ceases the operation of the CRN on intrusion detection. The effects of encryption and security control was quantified and sensing time at which the combined tradeoff was maximized was predicted. In the proposed model, sensing time is used as the reference point to determine the improvement in the performance as a result of scalability.
