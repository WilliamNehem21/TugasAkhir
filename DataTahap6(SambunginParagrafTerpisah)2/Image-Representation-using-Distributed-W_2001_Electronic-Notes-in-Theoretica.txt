Weighted finite automata (WFA) define real functions, in particular, grayness func- tions of graytone images. Inference algorithm that converts an arbitrary function (graytone image) into a WFA that can regenerate it is given in [7]. In this pa- per we define the theoretical construct of Cooperating Distributed Weighted Finite Automata with n-components(n-WFA) and study the power of this construct in various modes of acceptance. We give an inference algorithm and the de-inference algorithm for the n-WFA.

In Section 2 we give the preliminary definitions of the weighted finite au- tomata and its applications to digital images. In Section 3 we introduce the construct of Cooperating distributed weighted finite automata and study the acceptance power of this construct in various modes of acceptance. In this sec- tion we also deal with the representation of gray-scale images using n-WFA and give an inference algorithm and the de-inference algorithm for the n-WFA. Section 4 deals with the conclusions of this paper.
