In this paper we present some new results which go some way towards explaining this phenomenon. Our results show that a large class of realizability-style constructions always give rise to C, RC or HEO (as appropriate). The proofs make essential use of a technique due to Dag Normann. In this extended abstract, we content ourselves with giving precise statements of our theorems, and a brief outline of the method of proof.

We will also need the notion of a realization of a type structure over a PCA. This is an obvious adaptation of Definition 4.1; indeed, in the more general framework of applicative morphisms, we can make do with a single notion of realization.
