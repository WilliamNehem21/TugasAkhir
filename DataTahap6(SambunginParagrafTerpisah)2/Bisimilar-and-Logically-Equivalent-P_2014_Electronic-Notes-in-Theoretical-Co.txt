In this section, we propose a very small process (program) calculus for the PDL programs presented in the previous section 2. We prove that two processes are bisimilar if and only if they have the same set of finite possible runs with context. It is inspired on [2].

In order to prove soundness it is necessary to show both that every axiom is valid in this class of frames and the inference rules also preserve the validity. The validity of axioms 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 and the inference rules are well-known from the PDL literature [5,16,4]. Below, we present the proof for axioms 4.

Another possibility for future work would be to establish the precise complexity of the satisfability problem for PDL+. We already have the EXPTIME-hardness due to PDL. We suspect it is EXPTIME-complete, as PDL, but we would like to provide an EXPTIME algorithm for the satisfability problem.
