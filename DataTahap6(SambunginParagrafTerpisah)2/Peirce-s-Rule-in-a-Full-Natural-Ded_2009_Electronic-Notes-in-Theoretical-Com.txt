Natural deduction (ND) for first order classical logic is obtainable from the intuitionist system by the addition of Peirce rule. In a previous paper [4], it was presented a normalization strategy for the implicational fragment with Pierce rule. The end normal form is divided in two parts: an intuitionist subdeduction followed by a series of Peirce rule applications, maybe empty. Here, we extend this normalization process to

It is well-known that Strong Normalization (SN) holds for classical as well intuition- istic Natural Deduction. Prawitz [7] and Gandy [2] proved SN. Gandy provided a more direct one. Of course, the implicational fragment has SN. This section shows a counter-example to SN wheb Peirces rule is added to the implicational fragment. Therefor, NP-Imp is not SN. In fact, if derivations are not prepared for the appli- cation of RED4, the reduction procedure becomes infinitely long.
