The Transportation Problem (TP) deals with transporting some products from the source to the destination with the minimal total cost subject to satisfy the demand and the supply constraints [1]. The objective of TP is to achieve minimal total cost as an optimal solution. It was first developed by Hitchcock [2] and one of the lin- ear programming problems [1,3]. It can be applied to the real- world problems such as personal assignment [4], task allocation [5], problems of flow shop scheduling [6,7], and vehicle routing [8,9].

second one is finding an optimal solution from IBFS [10]. It is nec- essary to start with IBFS to solve transportation problem [1,3,4,10]. Finding IBFS is important and significant because it is a basic solu- tion in obtaining optimal solution [3]. The result of IBFS can be similar or closer to the values of the optimal solution. The better result of IBFS can decrease the number of iterations in obtaining an optimal solution [1]. This research focuses on finding IBFS to obtain the minimal total cost of the transportation problem.

VAM is the best well-known initial basic feasible solution in general [3]. It has been studied for a long time and modified by some researchers such as Hosseini [3], Soomro et al. [20,21], Rashid [22], Hakim [23]. Goyal [24], Das et al. [25,26], Azad and Hossain [39] proposed the utility function to select goals of multi- objective transportation problem which has two stages and multi-choice grey number. Ali and Mustapha [40] compared five methods of transportation problem to find the best one. Roy et al. [41] introduced a conic scalarization approach to obtain a

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 present the mathematical formulation of the transportation problem and Total opportunity cost matrix. The existing methods are summarized in Section 4. Section 5 is the description of TOCM-MT and Section 6 is the illustration of the numerical samples. The experimental results showing the performance of the proposed method is discussed in Section 7. The conclusions of the experiment and future research are demonstrated in Section 8.

Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS) is an initial solution of transportation problem (TP) and is known as the starting solution of TP. In some cases, IBFS gets the optimal solution. Three existing methods will be discussed to find IBFS in this section.

The value of GV11 is 0 because 53 is smaller than 91. The value of GV12 is 0 because 0 is smaller than 22. The value of GV13 is 1 because 92 is greater than 10. The value of GV14 is 0 because 22 is smaller than 80. The value of GV21 is 1 because 53 is smaller than 91. The value of GV22 is 1 because 0 is smaller than 22. The value of GV23 is 0 because 92 is greater than 10. The value of GV24 is 1 because 22 is smaller than 80. TotalGV1j is the sum of GV11, GV12, GV13, and GV14, and then the TotalGV1j is 1. TotalGV2j is the sum

The detail data of 6 randomly generated samples are given in Appendix A. TOCM-MT, TDM1, and JHM have been coded in C++ programming language and run successfully for the solution of 31 numerical examples. TORA software was applied in VAM and optimal solution.

of JHM, and twelve better results than that of TDM1. TOCM-MT was found to have 24 optimal solutions out of 31 numerical exam- ples, thus this method gets 77.42% accuracy. Otherwise, VAM, JHM, and TDM1 obtain an accuracy level of 32.26%, 70.96%, and 45.16% respectively.
