Expressions are multilinear when variable occurrences are linear and products have factors using different variables. We demonstrate that multilinear expressions are either constant or have never a local minimum or a local maximum. Therefore the interval of multilinear expressions may be computed precisely studying their values at the bounds of the variables therein. We then propose a technique for the interval analysis of generic expressions that transforms them into multilinear ones and computes the interval of the latters.

We recall the mathematical background and define multilinear expressions and demonstrate our results in Section 2. The algorithm for the interval analysis of multilinear expressions and the study of its computational complexity are in Sec- tion 3. In Section 4 we study the extension of our technique to generic expression. Section 5 reports our conclusions.

A polynomial function is a function defined by a polynomial. For example, the function f from real numbers  to  , defined by f (x) = 5x3 + 2x + 7 is a polynomial function of one argument. Polynomial functions of multiple arguments can be defined, using polynomials in multiple variables, as f (x, y)= xy2+2xy+y+1.

Let id(E ) be the set of identifiers in E. It is evident that an expression E represents a polynomial in id(E ) variables. Therefore it is a functions from n to , where n is the cardinality of id(E ). An expression is called multilinear if the corresponding polynomial is multilinear.

In order to turn E into an expression that is linear in x, we need, in the worst case, d/2 iteration of lines 4-10. These iterations introduce d/2 fresh variables. Similarly for every other nonlinear variable. In the worst case, the iterations are n(d/2).
