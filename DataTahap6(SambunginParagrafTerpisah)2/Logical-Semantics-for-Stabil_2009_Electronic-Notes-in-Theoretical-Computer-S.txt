We remark that Lemma 3.5 holds only under the legality hypotheses. The property stated by following theorem, namely that in a derivation the basis collects the minimal information on the premises necessary for the typing, is crucial for building a model starting from a type assignment system.

Proposition 5.6 Let X and Y be object of Coh, I be the set of all (possible) iso- morphisms between X and Y and T be the set of all (possible) iso-coherent bijective maps between |X| and |Y |. A biunivocal correspondence can be established between I and T .
