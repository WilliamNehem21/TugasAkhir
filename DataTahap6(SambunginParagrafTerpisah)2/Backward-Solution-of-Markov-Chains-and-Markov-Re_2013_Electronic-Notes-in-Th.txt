The state space S is partitioned into the set of transient states ST and m sets of recurrent states SRi (recurrent classes). The sub-matrix T is the sub-stochastic DTMC of the transient states ST. Each rectangular sub-matrix Fi is the probability matrix of going into the i-th recurrent class from ST. Each square sub-matrix Ri is the DTMC of the i-th recurrent class.
