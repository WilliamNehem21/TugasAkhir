Synopsis In Section 2 we briefly recall the main definitions about directed bigraphs and abstract directed bigraphs. In Section 3 we analyze the algebraic structure of directed bigraphs; this analysis is then carried on to the category of abstract directed bigraphs in Section 4. In Section 5 we put directed bigraphs at work, giving an encoding of the Fusion calculus. Conclusions are in Section 6.

Now, we define some variants of the tensor product, allowing sharing of names. Process calculi often have a parallel product P | Q, that allows the processes P and Q to share names. In directed bigraphs, this sharing can involve inner downward names and/or outer upword names, as described by the following definitions.
