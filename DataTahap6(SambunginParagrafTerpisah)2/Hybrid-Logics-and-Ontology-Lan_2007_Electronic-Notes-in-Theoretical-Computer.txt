in ontologies. Binders and state variables are another feature from Hybrid Logic that would clearly be useful in an ontology language, but it is well known that adding this feature to even a relatively weak language would lead to undecidability. However, recent work has shown that this feature could play a very useful role in query answering, where the syntactic structure of queries means that the occurrence of state variables is restricted in a way that allows for decidable reasoning.

This problem is normally addressed by discarding sub-trees below a node when- ever it is merged with another node. In the above case, for example, this would result in x2 (and the edge from x1 to x2) being removed from the graph when x1 is merged with x0; the resulting graph is fully expanded, and so the algorithm would terminate. This only works, however, in tree-shaped parts of the completion graph, as the notion of a sub-tree is otherwise not well defined. This can lead to problems if nominal nodes are created and merged.

Various decision procedures [9,25,19] are known for restricted fragments of con- junctive queries. The most common restriction used in order to obtain a decision procedure is that each role that occurs in the query must be a simple role, i.e., a role that is neither transitive nor has a transitive sub-role.

Unfortunately, the above described technique is only able to deal with tree shaped queries, i.e., those where the query graph does not contain a cycle, because the above mentioned tree model property means that DL concepts cannot capture cyclic relationships. Even nominals cannot express the arbitrary cyclic structures that can occur in a query [31].
