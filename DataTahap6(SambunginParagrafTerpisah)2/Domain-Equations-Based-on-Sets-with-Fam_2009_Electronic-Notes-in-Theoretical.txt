We see at once that the identity functions are R-continuous (R-monotone) and the composition of R-continuous (R-monotone) functions is an R- continuous (R-monotone) function. The category CRPOS has R-complete R-posets as objects and R-continuous functions as morphisms. The category CRPOSR has R-complete R-posets that R-limits preserve pre-orders in R as objects and R-continuous functions as morphisms.
