Example 3.5 Given a left-skew closed category (C, I, () and a monad T on C that is lax closed. This is the same as T being left-strong and right-strong with the the left-strength cst and the right-strength cstR making a bi-strength and commuting. Let B (T C = B ( T C as in Example 2.8. Because T is left-strong, we have that (Kl(T ), I, (T ) is left-skew closed. Now, if (C, I, () happens to be left-normal,

Example 4.7 In Example 3.5, we assumed a closed category (C, I, () with a lax closed monad (T, c) and tried to establish that the left-skew closed category (Kl(T ), I, (T ) where B (T C = B ( T C was normal. This did not work out.
