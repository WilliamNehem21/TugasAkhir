MinLog is an interactive proof- and program-extraction system developed by H. Schwichtenberg and members of the logic group at the University of Munich. It is based on first order Natural Deduction calculus and uses as primitive minimal rather than classical or intuitionistic logic. See [9,25] for full details.

Our approach for the MinLog extraction of the generic modulus of uniform con- tinuity t, given the concrete MinLog term t is different from the letter of Proposi- tion2.5. It amounts in fact to the design of a new variant of the MD-interpretation, which combines those features of the pre-existing versions due to Kohlenbach 16 which turn out to be useful on the machine.
