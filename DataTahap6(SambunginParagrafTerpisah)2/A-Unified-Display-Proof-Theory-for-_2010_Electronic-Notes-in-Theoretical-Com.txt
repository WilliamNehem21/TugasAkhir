in bunched logics, which are read as true or false relative to resources: roughly speaking, the additives have their standard propositional meanings while the mul- tiplicatives denote resource composition properties [20]. In computer science, such resource readings of bunched logic have very successfully been exploited to obtain logics for program analysis. Most notably, separation logic [24], which is based upon an interpretation of resources as portions of heap memory, has spawned a host of program analysis applications that discover and reason about the structure of heap memory during program execution (recent examples include [7,8,10]). Bunched logic has also been variously employed in addressing other computing problems such as polymorphic abstraction [9], tree update [6] and typed reference update and dis- posal [2].
