Furthermore, EM collector design plays a vital role in capturing and transferring the energy used by wireless sensor nodes [7,8]. Some other design structures, such as metamaterial absorbers, antenna arrays and rectennas, have been proposed [9,10]. Metama- terials are materials whose electromagnetic characteristics are derived from their structure rather than their chemical composition.

2.2 and 0.0009, respectively. Therefore, the overall dimensions of the proposed design and the back-side coated copper are (15 mm  15 mm), respectively. The proposed design consists of five split ring resonators (SRR) positioned at a 45-degree angle to each other to increase performance. Orienting the SRRs at a 45- degree angle has the potential to improve the coupling mecha-

nisms that exist between neighbouring resonators. The diagonal arrangement facilitates the effective interaction between the elec- tric and magnetic field components. The phenomenon can poten- tially induce a more robust interconnection among adjacent (Split Ring Resonators (SRRs)) yielding superior resonance charac- teristics and heightened electromagnetic reactivity. These res- onators are manufactured of annealed copper. The thickness of the  annealed  copper  is  0.035,  where  the  conductivity
