We outline the technical development of the paper introducing it here in re- stricted form so as to more easily convey the basic ideas and intuitions. The more general enriched universes of discourse considered in the paper (Definition 2.2) are indispensable to accommodate multi-sorted theories.

Remark 2.1 For clarity, and as a notational convention, we will henceforth high- light V -enriched structures by underlining them. Corresponding structures that are not underlined will denote ordinary categorical notions. Thus, for instance, for a V -category C , its underlying ordinary category is denoted C .

One cannot expect to obtain an external completeness result at the level of gen- erality of the previous section. However, in the presence of free constructions, an internal completeness result does hold. Its importance in relationship to external completeness is illustrated in the application of the following section.
