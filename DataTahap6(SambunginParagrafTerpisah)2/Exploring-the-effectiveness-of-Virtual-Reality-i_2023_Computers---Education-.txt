Virtual Reality (VR) has gained popularity in education, but its potential in language learning, specifically for teaching a minor language like Maltese, has been understudied. To address this gap, a mixed-methods study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of VR in language learning and identify the advantages and challenges of teaching Maltese as a second language (ML2) with a focus on improving language skills. Qualitative research involved a focus group, while quantitative analysis utilized an online survey with a Likert scale and 25 Maltese teachers as participants. The results revealed that younger respondents were more inclined to believe in the significant impact of VR on improving learning outcomes compared to older respondents. VR was found to effectively engage students in immersive environments and enhance the learning context with entertainment features. However, challenges related to costs, bulky headsets, and technical issues were also uncovered. Although VR tools are not currently utilized in teaching Maltese, this research explored their potential effec- tiveness in ML2 instruction and provided suggestions for effective integration into language teaching. The findings provide quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of VR tools in education and their potential to facilitate ML2 learning. Most participants expressed a positive perception, emphasizing the importance of integrating VR technology into Maltese teaching practices to create more engaging and immersive learning experiences for ML2 learners.

VR is a valuable tool in the process of second language acquisition because it allows learners to operate or test scenarios that may be impossible or difficult to access in real life, encouraging active partici- pation and interaction (Zhao et al., 2020). Additionally, VR can trans- form practical experience into knowledge and skills, making it an ideal tool for learners to acquire knowledge, develop competencies, and practice skills (Liu et al., 2020).

with approximately one million visitors in 2021 despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (Malta Immigration, 2021). Third-country na- tionals who wish to reside in Malta must integrate into Maltese society by learning about Maltese culture, the Maltese language, and English (Euromed Rights, 2022). Therefore, exploring new technologies that can help learners become proficient in Maltese as quickly as possible is a relevant research area.

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of using VR tools to teach Maltese to international students (Gardner, 2020; Zheng et al., 2022). This research will contribute to the academic literature by addressing the research gap on the use of VR in teaching a minority language such as Maltese. Furthermore, it will offer insights into the use

VR provides a highly immersive learning experience by simulating environments (Hamilton et al., 2021). This unique feature allows stu- dents to engage with language learning in a realistic and interactive manner. For kinesthetic learners, the interactivity offered by VR is particularly beneficial, as it provides hands-on experiences that enhance language acquisition (Garduno et al., 2021). Since physical travel to practice a target language with native speakers may not always be feasible, VR can offer a simulated environment for students to commu- nicate with native speakers, facilitating second language acquisition (Panagiotidis, 2021).

VR can make language learning lessons more memorable, leading to improved vocabulary retention (Yoshimura & Borst, 2021). The immersive nature of VR allows students to engage multiple senses, reinforcing their understanding and memory of new words and phrases. By experiencing language in context, students are more likely to retain L2 vocabulary and reinforce their language skills.

Nonverbal communication, such as body language and facial ex- pressions, plays a crucial role in language learning (Hamilton et al., 2021; Parmaxi, 2023). VR offers an opportunity for students to practice and understand nonverbal communication in a simulated environment, building their confidence in real-life interactions. VR also eliminates the fear of making mistakes when interacting with locals in a foreign country, thus providing a safe space for language practice (Panagiotidis, 2021; Zheng et al., 2022).

2020). VR offers an active learning experience that surpasses passive reading, as students interact and apply their language skills, leading to better learning outcomes (Yildirim et al., 2020). Moreover, VR helps to eliminate distractions and keeps learners focused on the learning pro- cess, thus improving their language acquisition (Lege & Bonner, 2020). One of the significant advantages of VR in language learning is its accessibility. VR technology allows learners to access language lessons from anywhere, overcoming geographic barriers (Garduno et al., 2021).

It also enables professionals from remote locations to participate in lessons, enriching the learning experience (Lege & Bonner, 2020). The accessibility of VR has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, as students can continue their language learning remotely (Ball, et al., 2021). Additionally, VR facilitates connecting learners from different locations, fostering a sense of community and collaboration (Hu-Au & Lee, 2018).

VR applications, such as gaming and virtual scenarios, allow students to create avatars and interact with peers and educators, providing op- portunities for real language practice (Hu-Au & Lee, 2018). By immersing themselves in a new environment, students can engage in various experiences, situations, and experiments, thereby enhancing their language learning process while reducing costs and resource con- sumption (Panagiotidis, 2021). VR offers a platform for students to engage in authentic language practice, as they can interact with virtual native speakers, participate in realistic conversations, and navigate real-life scenarios (Hamilton et al., 2021). This real language practice in a simulated environment helps students build confidence and fluency in their target language (Liu et al., 2020).

Language learning through VR is not limited to traditional classroom settings. VR can create immersive and interactive language learning experiences outside the classroom, such as virtual field trips or cultural experiences, allowing students to explore and engage with the target language and culture in a more meaningful way (Cardullo & Wang, 2022). These experiences offer opportunities for contextualized lan- guage use, cultural understanding, and global perspectives (Garduno et al., 2021).

contrast, VR can offer a safe space for learners to interact with virtual characters and practice their speaking skills without fear of judgment (Garduno, et al., 2021). By simulating authentic contexts, VR can pro- vide ML2 learners with meaningful language practice and promote active participation in the learning process (Liu et al., 2020). Learners can engage in realistic dialogues, role-play various scenarios, and receive immediate feedback on their ML2 pronunciation and intonation. Another advantage of VR is its potential to foster cultural immersion and contextualized language learning (Garduno et al., 2021). Tradi- tional pedagogy may struggle to provide learners with authentic cultural experiences and exposure to the nuances of the Maltese language and culture. VR can create virtual environments that replicate real-life set- tings, allowing learners to explore Maltese culture, visit historical landmarks, and interact with virtual natives in simulated contexts, while

A purposive sampling method was used in this study to select 25 Maltese teachers as participants for this study (Ames et al., 2019). The sampling strategy aimed to include teachers who had experience and exposure to VR technology and its applications in language learning. Although there was a lack of research and VR apps for the Maltese language, the participants, who taught Maltese at primary, middle, and secondary schools, had explored and experienced various VR apps and tools in the context of language learning.

To enhance the reliability and validity of the findings, member checking was conducted with the participants (Candela, 2019). The participants were provided with the transcripts and were given the op- portunity to review and provide comments or make any necessary changes. It is important to note that both the qualitative and quantita- tive phases of the research explored similar issues, which further strengthens the validity of the study.

An online survey consisting of 9 questions was administered to the 25 focus group participants. The survey aimed to gather quantitative evi- dence on the potential effectiveness of VR tools in teaching ML2. Google Forms were used to conduct the survey, and participants received a link to the questionnaire.

The majority of the participants, 14 individuals (56% of the re- spondents), strongly agreed that VR is effective in facilitating language learning. Additionally, 11 participants (44% of the respondents) agreed with this statement. Notably, none of the respondents expressed a neutral, disagree, or strongly disagree opinion regarding the effective- ness of VR in language learning.

Regression analysis allows researchers to understand the relation- ship between two or more variables by estimating the mathematical relationship between them (Sarstedt & Mooi, 2014). In this case, this research aimed to determine whether a relationship exists between age and opinion on VR tools. It employed linear regression analysis, which assumes a linear relationship between the variables, to analyze the data.

The intercept coefficient of 77.22 represents the expected value of the dependent variable when age is zero, although it lacks a meaningful interpretation since age cannot be zero. Nonetheless, it provides addi- tional insights into the regression model. The F-value and its associated p-value indicate the overall statistical significance of the regression model, suggesting that the age variable significantly influences the opinion on the effectiveness of VR tools.

These findings suggest a positive perception among the participants regarding the effectiveness of VR in facilitating Maltese language learning. However, it is important to consider that these results are based on self-reported opinions and may be influenced by various fac- tors such as individual experiences, perceptions, and preferences. Nonetheless, the overwhelmingly positive responses suggest a general belief among the participants in the effectiveness of VR for ML2 or any other language learning.

engage in conversations with their teacher and peers in a virtual setting (Zheng et al., 2022), which is challenging to replicate in traditional or online classrooms. According to these teachers, VR creates an environ- ment free from disruption and code-switching between English and Maltese, by facilitating focused language practice.

overcome physical barriers in language learning. Teacher 1 highlighted the benefit for students residing in countries with a substantial Maltese community, such as Australia, the UK, and Canada (Attard, 1989), who can practice Maltese with native speakers through VR. In VR, these native speakers can exclusively speak Maltese, allowing students to enhance their speaking skills without the interference of English, which often occurs in real-life conversations due to Maltese bilingualism. Therefore, VR is considered as a valuable tool for students to improve their speaking skills in Maltese.

I feel that VR can bridge the gap between the traditional classroom and the Teams online classroom. It could help students practice and interact with one another on a more advanced level than just face to face on the screen. It gives social involvement and connectedness that distance learning does not deliver.

Several businesses have begun to invest time and money in devel- oping language learning VR games. Mondly, for example, is a VR game that lets players improve their language abilities in various realistic scenarios. Users can talk to a bus passenger, order meals at a restaurant, and check into a hotel. Although this game has its chal- lenges, spanning from technical issues to critiques of a difficult lan- guage learning curve, it would be fantastic if we could have Mondly in Maltese.

Technology is not yet advanced enough to provide a smooth, realistic simulation of speaking activities. Technical challenges will impede VR games for years to come, and given the difficulty of building a fully immersive language learning game, those issues will be amplified. Any audio issues with voice recognition will quickly spoil the user experience.

Six teachers acknowledged the challenge of incorporating VR into lessons and emphasized the importance of striking a balance between using VR and traditional teaching techniques. While recognizing the academic value of VR and its ability to provide exceptional learning experiences, they highlighted the need for a hybrid approach (Radianti et al., 2020) that combines VR with established teaching methods.

While there were similarities between the findings of this study and the existing literature, there were also some differences. The partici- pants did not mention the devaluation of human connection associated with VR, which has been noted in previous studies (Radianti et al., 2020; Yoshimura & Borst, 2021). However, effective communication skills are crucial for language learners and deserve attention. Additionally, the participants did not discuss the potential negative effects of VR on stu- in developing writing skills in the Maltese language. Students often struggle with storytelling and varied writing styles when composing narrative, descriptive, or persuasive essays. However, by providing vi- sualizations of concepts, VR can assist in the development of these skills. For example, when writing an expository essay, a learner using VR can engage in role-playing, explore relevant concepts, and fill out a chart. This hands-on experience allows students to gain insights into how to write this type of essay. Similarly, for descriptive essays, students can wear VR glasses and navigate through a virtual house, observing people and objects to gather vivid details for their writing. Sharing their

Existing research provides strong support for the notion that VR enables detailed observation and access to unique experiences that may not otherwise be available (Fromm et al., 2021). By leveraging VR technology, Maltese learners can enhance their writing skills and engage in more immersive and compelling narratives.

It is important to note that this research has some limitations. Firstly, the participants had some familiarity with VR from their personal ex- periences, but they had not used it in their classroom. Thus, their opinions may be influenced by biases, as their assessments of the po- tential effectiveness of VR tools are not based on direct experience. Secondly, the sample size was small because there are only a few ML2 teachers in Malta, and it is not a compulsory subject in all schools yet. Thirdly, this study relied on the subjective comments of the teachers, which were not objectively tested. Moreover, the participants had some familiarity with VR from their personal experiences but had not used it in their classrooms. Therefore, the findings of this study cannot be generalized.

Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that educators and researchers focus on the development of VR applications specifically tailored to Maltese language teaching and learning. Currently, there is a lack of VR apps available in Maltese, which presents an opportunity to enhance language learning experiences for Maltese learners. By creating immersive and interactive VR experiences that focus on teaching Mal- tese vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, students can engage in a dynamic and engaging learning environment that promotes Maltese language acquisition.

It is also essential to consider the potential health impacts of pro- longed VR use and take appropriate measures to mitigate them. Edu- cators should ensure that students take regular breaks, maintain proper posture during VR activities, and be aware of potential discomfort or adverse effects. By promoting a safe and healthy VR learning environ- ment, international students learning Maltese can fully benefit from the immersive language learning experiences VR offers.

This study employed a mixed methods approach, combining quan- titative and qualitative analyses to investigate the perspectives of 25 educators on the potential of using VR in ML2 classrooms. The educators had prior knowledge of VR but had not yet incorporated it into their language teaching practices due to lack of VR apps in Maltese. The findings revealed that despite the lack of practice of VR in Maltese classes, the majority of educators recognized its usefulness as a tool for ML2 acquisition. Notably, younger educators exhibited a stronger belief in the potential of VR to enhance language learning compared to their older counterparts. The study also identified several issues associated with VR, including technical challenges, the need for further improve- ment of VR apps, and cost considerations. However, it underscored the potential of VR to create a fully immersive language learning experience. The participants demonstrated varying degrees of VR experience and training, exposure to diverse VR language learning apps and tools, active engagement in professional development, practical experience with VR implementation, and exposure to international settings. Nevertheless, the lack of availability of VR resources and research in the context of the Maltese language highlights a potential gap that needs to be addressed to fully leverage the benefits of VR in Maltese language learning. Based on the findings, it is suggested that VR could emerge as one of the most effective techniques for teaching and learning Maltese in the future. Further research and efforts to expand VR resources and support in the ML2 context are recommended to harness the full potential of VR technology.
