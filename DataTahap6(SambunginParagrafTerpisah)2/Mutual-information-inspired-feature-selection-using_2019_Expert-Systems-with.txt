The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de- scribes the fundamentals of MI and CCA and related studies. Section 3 presents the proposed method, mRMJR-KCCA, and its implementation. Section 4 gives the experimental results and the discussions. The conclusion is provided in Section 5.

We experimentally evaluate mRMJR-KCCA using two learning algorithms on the selected subset of features, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random forest (RF) due to their excellent performance in classification applications (Alickovic, Kevric, & Subasi, 2018; Chernbumroong, Cang, & Yu, 2014; Sani, Massie, Wiratunga, & Cooper, 2017). The pair of parameters gamma and c in SVM, and the number of trees in RF are determined in 10-fold cross validation process individually. The results report the aver- age accuracy from 10 times test. At the same time, we compare our proposed method with other available popular FS methods presented in Section 1.
