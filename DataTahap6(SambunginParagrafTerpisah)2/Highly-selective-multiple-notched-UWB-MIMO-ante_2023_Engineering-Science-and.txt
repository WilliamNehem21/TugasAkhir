error rate, several copies of the same signal must be created. This gives the data more chances to reach the receiving antenna unaf- fected by fading. Additionally, limits any interference from the already existing bands very sharply within the UWB spectrum, such as 5G sub-6 GHz, WLAN band, and satellite downlink band by applying a novel parasitic decoupling structure.
