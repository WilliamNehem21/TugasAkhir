The set A will be referred to as the authorized access structure or simply as the access structure, S will be referred to as the secret and I1,... , In will be referred to as the shares (or the shadows) of S. The elements of the set A will be referred to as the authorized groups.

In a perfect secret sharing scheme, the shares of any unauthorized group give no information (in information-theoretic sense) about the secret. Karnin, Greene, and Hellman [20] have proven, using the concept of entropy, that in any perfect threshold secret sharing scheme, the shares must be at least as long as the secret and, later on, Capocelli, De Santis, Gargano, and Vaccaro [7] have extended this result to the case of any perfect secret sharing scheme. In an ideal secret sharing scheme, the shares are as long as the secret.

Goldreich, Ron, and Sudan [15] have proposed choosing p0, p1,... , pn as prime numbers of the same size. Quisquater, Preneel, and Vandewalle [28] have proven that, by choosing p0, p1,... , pn as consecutive primes, the resulted schemes are asymptotically perfect and asymptotically ideal (for technical details, the reader is referred to [28]).

In this case, any A-secret sharing scheme will be referred to as a (C, K)- compartmented secret sharing scheme. The sets C1, C2,... , Cm will be referred to as the compartments of the scheme, the values k1, k2,... , km as the compartment thresholds and k0 as the global threshold of the scheme.
