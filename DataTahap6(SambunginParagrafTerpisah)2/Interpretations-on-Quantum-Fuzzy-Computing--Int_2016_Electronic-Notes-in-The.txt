The uncertainty of the real world is concerned with fundamental concepts of quantum computing by making use of properties of quantum mechanics as the su- perposition, suggesting an improvement in the efficiency regarding complex tasks. In addition, simulations using classical computers allow the development and valida- tion of basic quantum algorithms (QAs), anticipating the knowledge related to their behaviours when executed in a quantum computer. Quantum interpretations come from measurement operations performed on the corresponding quantum states.
