In this section, we illustrate how to model optimization problems using graph transformation systems with time. For a motivating example, we discuss (a slightly modified version of) a job-shop scheduling problem, the Personaliza- tion Machine example discussed in [8]. The example is a simplified version of a case study carried out within the AMETIST project.

matching a specific pattern with another graph. In graph transformation with time [3], a time attribute is a logical clock (typically) with non-negative integer values that can be attached to nodes. The time attribute has a distinguished role to define how the time progresses in discrete steps in a consistent way.

In the guard, we check the existence of nodes and edges of corresponding types (such as, e.g., convCell[cc1] and myCell[p1][cc1]), and attribute conditions (such as personalized[c1] == true). The state variable updates remove the pers hold edge and create a new conv hold edge, moreover, they update the time variable according to the conditions of GTSs with time.
