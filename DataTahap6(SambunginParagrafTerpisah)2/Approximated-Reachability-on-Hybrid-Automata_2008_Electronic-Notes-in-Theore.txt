that the latter can be only over-approximated and under-approximated. Hence, the method applies to a family of hybrid automata significatively more expressive than the one covered by [7]. As an example, we can now consider the evolution of continuous variables according to flows involving trigonometric terms, that can not be dealt with by means of symbolic computation, but are easily amenable to approximation methods (e.g by means of interval arithmetic).

The second loop completes the visit to recover the states of An relevant for certifying the safety of the abstracted dynamical system, according to Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.3. The latter are given by the rest of reachable nodes in An (via an arbitrary path). If also none of these regions belongs to B, the procedure returns

After having introduced in Section 4.1 a framework for the three-valued safety anal- ysis of hybrid automata, in this section we consider stronger properties expressed by means of the temporal logic CTL. Definition 5.1 and Definition 5.2 recapitulate syntax and semantics of CTL formulas on hybrid automata. Note that due to the density of the underlying time framework the neXt operator is omitted [2,10].

We proposed a novel framework for the reachability analysis of hybrid automata. Our method is based on the definition of a succession of abstractions, whose con- struction does not relies on the exact representation of the predecessor (resp. suc- cessor) regions. Nevertheless, our ABB abstractions encode enough information to both prove and falsify safety properties, as well as more general CTL formulas. In particular, we provide efficient (linear) algorithms for the three valued safety analysis on ABB abstractions.
