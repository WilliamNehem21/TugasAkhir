In this work we present an extension of Petri-PDL to deal with Stochastic Petri Nets, the DS3 logic. This system is an alternative to model performance evaluation in a compositional and structural approach. We discuss about its soundness, decidability and completeness regarding our semantics and present a proof of EXPTime-completeness of its SAT problem. A usage example is presented.

In section 2 we present the theoretical and conceptual background motivating our proposal and briefly compare it with other approaches. Section 3 presents the technical Petri Net background; section 4 presents the DS3 logic and discuss its soundness, decidability and completeness with respect to our semantics and section 5 presents the two-person corridor tiling game reduction. A usage example is presented in section 6 and the conclusions and further work are in section 7.
