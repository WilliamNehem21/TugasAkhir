Automata [29] was introduced to capture both probability and the classical process algebraic notion of nondeterminism. Here, a state of an automaton can have several transitions that are chosen in a nondeterministic way, and each transition leads to a probabilistic distribution over action labeled moves. Usually, the model of [29] is known as the non-alternating model, in contraposition with the alternating model of [19], where there is a clear distinction between nondeterministic states, enabling transitions leading to a unique state and that are chosen in a nondeterministic way, and probabilistic states, enabling a unique transition leading to a probabilistic distribution over states.

Process algebras respecting the generative model do not offer any operation of nondeterministic choice. More precisely, these process algebras do not offer any operation introducing nondeterminism. However, in general, also in the generative model weak bisimulation is not a congruence. In fact, many process algebras offer a parametric version of interleaving operation, where the parameter determines the probability to move of each of the two composed processes, and we show by means of a simple example that weak bisimulation is not a congruence with respect to and weak bisimulations. On the other side, p-bisimulations permit to relate two processes when they differ only for probabilities smaller than a given bound p. However, we are not interested here in studying their theory, we simply use p- bisimulations in our proofs.

Proof. Let us note that s has the form (t1 q rec X. c X)  p rec X. b X and s' has the form (t2 q rec X. c X)  p rec X. b X, for some t1 and t2. We can distinguish four cases:
