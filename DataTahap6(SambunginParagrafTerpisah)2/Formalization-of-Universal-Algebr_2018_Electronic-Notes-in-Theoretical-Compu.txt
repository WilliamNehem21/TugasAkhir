The definitions of subalgebras, quotients, and epimorphisms (surjective homo- morphisms) are related by the three isomorphism theorems. Although there is some small overhead by the coding of subalgebras, the proofs follow very close what one would do in paper. For proving these results we also defined the kernel and the homomorphic image of homomorphisms.

The concept of morphism between signatures is related with the interpretability of similarity types in universal algebra (cf. [13]), and has an extensive literature: Fuji- wara [12] introduced this notion as mappings between algebraic systems, Janssen [23], following the ADJ group, called it a polynomial derivor and Mossakowski et al. [26] referred to it as a derived signature morphism, a generalization of the more restricted signature morphisms in the theory of institutions [15].
