Proof. Suppose that Alice is the first to play and colors vertex r first (color 1 in the greedy game). Then Bob can color vertex t2 (color 1). With this, s and t cannot be colored 1 and then Bob can force t1 or t3 be colored with 4 by coloring one of the two black vertices (color 1) in his next turn.

Now suppose that Alice is the first to play and colors vertex s first (color 1). Thus no vertex in {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored 1 and then all black vertices will be colored 1 in the greedy game coloring. Therefore all vertices in {r1, r2, r3, t1, t2, t3} can be colored with 2 or 3 in the game. Moreover, Alice can color r and t in her second and third turns using the colors {2, 3} winning the game.
