In this paper, we propose a novel (k, n) threshold verifiable secret image sharing scheme (VSISS) which generates encrypted shares. The proposed method can identify cheaters and recover the original secret without any deprivation. More- over the probability of guessing of one correct shared image of the proposed method is minimized.

In this section we propose a verifiable (k, n) secret image shar- ing scheme based on the 3rd order LFSR-based public key cryptosystem [13] for verification. Our proposed verifiable secret image sharing scheme (VSISS) consists of three phases: Initialization phase, share generation and reconstruction. Sec- tion 3.1 presents initialization phase, Section 3.2 presents the proposed share generation scheme and Section 3.3 introduces the verification and recovery strategy.

This section introduces a scheme to reconstruct the original secret image from k or more shared images. The members of A = {A1, A2,.. ., An} will recover the secret image. If any k number of participants verify each other and gathers their shares, then the original secret will be reconstructed. The steps

Extra storage and distortion free recovery: To avoid the truncation distortion and lossless recovery, the schemes [6,7] divide one pixel into two and used extra storage to storage than new pixel. On the other hand, the proposed scheme and the schemes [9,10] can recover the original secret image losslessly without extra storage. Though the scheme [8] does not use any extra storage, but recovery is not lossless.
