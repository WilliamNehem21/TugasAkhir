Informally, (M, N ) represents the pairing of M and N , and {M }K represents the encryption of M under K via a symmetric encryption algorithm. Pairing and encryption can be nested, like, e.g., in ({{(m, K)}K1 }K2 , K1).

A probabilistic pattern associated to a ciphertext is obtained by substituting every ciphered block with the corresponding expression in clear associated with the probability of obtaining information about it. Given any computa- tional adversary A (described by a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm) and the initial knowledge represented by expression G, the probabilistic pat- tern associated with expression {m}K is expressed in terms of the probability of obtaining information about m and is formally defined as m.pdec({m}K, G).

the paper we usually assume that set G expressing the initial knowledge of the adversary is empty. When we resort to such an assumption we omit G from the structures. Obviously, it is worth noting that as the adversary gets additional information, the enriched knowledge may be responsible for increasing the estimation given by function pdec.
