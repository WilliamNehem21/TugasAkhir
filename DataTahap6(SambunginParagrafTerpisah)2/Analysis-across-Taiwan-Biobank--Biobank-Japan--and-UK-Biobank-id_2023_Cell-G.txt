Chen, Chen, Feng, Yu, Lin, et al. reported findings from genome-wide analysis in 102,900 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants across 36 human quantitative traits. A total of 1,986 significant loci were identified, and comparative analyses with Biobank Japan, UK Biobank, and previous GWASs revealed 968 novel loci. We also showed the utility of cross-phenotype, cross- population polygenic risk scores in disease risk prediction. These results highlight the potential to advance gene discovery with diverse populations.

Here we present genome-wide analyses for 36 quantitative traits in the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), a prospective cohort study of the Taiwanese population with multi-omics genomic data and longitu- dinal phenotypic and environmental measures (see https:// www.twbiobank.org.tw/, https://www.biobank.org.tw/, and Feng et al.6 for more information). We first performed GWAS for the 36 traits in TWB, and we fine-mapped all genome-wide significant loci to identify putative causal variants. To expand our understand- ing of the genetic architectures of these quantitative traits across populations, we leveraged GWAS summary statistics from BBJ as well as UKBB and large consortium studies (with samples of Eu- ropean ancestries) for SNP-based heritability and genetic correla- tion analyses. We further meta-analyzed TWB and BBJ to maxi- mize the power for genetic discovery in EAS populations. Lastly, we demonstrated that integrating biomarker GWAS across different populations can improve polygenic prediction for disease risk.

statistics from BBJ and UKBB, we found that the genetic archi- tecture for the quantitative traits examined was largely consis- tent within EAS and between EAS and EUR populations. Inte- grating TWB and BBJ GWASs identified a total of 3,825 genetic loci (3,382 for 24 traits from EAS meta-analysis and 443 for 12 traits from TWB alone), among which 968 had not been reported in previous GWASs. We additionally fine-mapped over 200 association signals to a single variant with PIP >95% and identified 24 putative causal missense variants that impli- cated novel genes underlying quantitative traits. Lastly, our PRS analysis demonstrated the potential utility of biomarker GWAS in predicting disease risk and the promise of multi-trait cross-population polygenic prediction.

As an application of the biobank resources, we utilized biomarker GWAS summary statistics from TWB, BBJ, UKBB, and international consortia to predict disease risk. We used a recently developed polygenic scoring methodology, PRS- CSx,39 to jointly model biomarker GWASs from EAS and EUR samples, and we designed a PRS validation and testing strategy to obtain the optimal weights for combining multiple biomarker PRSs into a single predictor. We showed that polygenic predic- tion for disease risk can be improved by incorporating multiple biomarker PRSs derived from GWASs in diverse populations. These results suggest that expanding biobank resources to collect a wider range of biomarkers with larger sample sizes in diverse populations may further improve the clinical utility of PRSs.42

We note that, despite the large number of novel loci identified, the current study was limited to 36 quantitative traits for the genome-wide association analysis and 5 diseases for polygenic prediction that were made available for our study. Expanding the analyses to a wider range of quantitative and disease pheno- types is warranted as the ongoing sample and data collection ef- forts in TWB continue. In addition, the collective sample size of TWB and BBJ remains relatively small compared with genetic studies in EUR populations. Future endeavors on increasing the sample size and phenotype coverage in TWB, in East Asia and in other non-European populations, and improving cross- biobank data harmonization will facilitate genetic discovery for human complex traits.

The data collection of Taiwan Biobank was approved by the Ethics and Governance Coun- cil (EGC) of Taiwan Biobank and the Department of Health and Welfare, Taiwan (Wei-Shu-I-Tzu NO.1010267471). Taiwan Biobank obtained informed consent from all participants for research use of collected data. Only publicly available GWAS summary statistics, without individual-level information, were used from Biobank Japan (BBJ) and UK Biobank (UKBB).

After pre-imputation QC, we used Eagle v2.444 for pre-phasing and Minimac445 for genotype imputation with 1KG phase 3 data as the reference panel. We performed post-imputation QC by retaining variants with imputation INFO >0.6 and MAF >0.5% for the downstream analyses, which included up to 8,190,806 variants for discovery batch 1 and 8,156,315 variants for discovery batch 2, respectively. The imputed dataset included a total of 92,615 samples for loci discovery (27,033 samples for discovery batch 1 and 65,582 samples for discovery batch 2), and 12,997 samples for polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. We further restricted the PRS analysis to 10,285 unrelated individuals that were also unrelated with the discovery GWAS samples. We note that while most of the phenotypes examined in this study were measured on the large majority of the discovery samples, the final analytic sample size of GWAS reduced to 62,901 (17,111 from discovery batch 1 and 45,790 from discovery batch 2) for FEV1, FVC and FEV1R, and 65,360 (19,509 from discovery batch 1 and 45,851 from discovery batch 2) for AFP due to missing phenotypic data.

For SNP-based heritability and genetic correction analyses, we used an earlier release of BBJ GWAS summary statistics from Kanai et al. (http://jenger.riken.jp/en/result),13 because association test statistics from mixed models can bias heritability and genetic correlation estimates when used with LD score regression.48 We extracted BBJ GWAS summary statistics for 20 traits from this earlier release, including BMI, DBP, SBP, WBC, RBC, HB, HCT, PLT, CR, T-BIL, ALT, AST, GGT, ALB, FG, HbA1c, TC, HDL-C, 344,182 from Neale Lab) to predict disease risk. Population-specific PRS for each biomarker was calculated using PRS-CSx,39 a Bayesian polygenic prediction method that jointly models GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations to improve polygenic prediction. Specifically, for a fixed global shrinkage parameter (phi = 1e-6, 1e-4, 1e-2, and 1.0 in this study) that models the overall sparseness of the genetic architecture, PRS-CSx returned posterior SNP effect size estimates for each discovery population (i.e., EAS and EUR), which were used to calculate both an EAS-specific PRS and an EUR-specific PRS in the left-out TWB sample (N = 10,285). The left-out TWB samples for PRS validation and testing are independent from the discovery batch 1 and discovery batch 2 samples, but were recruited following the same procedure as the discovery batch 2 samples with the same data collection and genome-wide genotyping methodologies. However, the left-out samples were released to us later than the discovery samples, which makes it a natural independent validation and testing set for the PRS analyses. We first examined the distribution of the EAS-specific and EUR-specific PRS within the sub-populations in the left-out TWB sample. The three sub-populations were defined

by self-reported paternal and maternal places of ancestral origin of Holo, Hakka, and Northern and Southern Han Chinese (see Feng et al. for details).6 We only retained TWB samples with the same paternal and maternal place of origin for this PRS distribution comparison.
