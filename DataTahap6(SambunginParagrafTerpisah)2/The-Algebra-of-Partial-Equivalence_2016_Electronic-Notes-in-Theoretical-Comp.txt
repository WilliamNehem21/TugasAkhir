PROPs (product and permutation categories [21]) are symmetric monoidal cate- gories with objects the natural numbers. In the last two decades, they have become increasingly popular as an environment where to study diverse computational mod- els in a compositional, resource sensitive fashion. To make a few examples, they have recently featured in algebraic approaches to Petri nets [7,26], bigraphs [8], quantum processes [11] and signal flow graphs [2,4,1].

much. A counterexample is given by cospans represented by  and , which have the same pullback  but express different partitions of 2. The correct approach is subtler: since we only need to rewrite  as  , it suffices to pull back the region of the cospan where all sub-diagrams of shape   lie. Formally, we
