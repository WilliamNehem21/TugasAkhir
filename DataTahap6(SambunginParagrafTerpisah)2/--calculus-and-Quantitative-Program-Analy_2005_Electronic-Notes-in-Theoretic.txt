In the case of classical abstract interpretation the abstract semantics con- structed in this way is guaranteed to be correct. In our quantitative setting the induced abstract semantics is the one closest to the concrete semantics. This is due to the relation between the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse and so-called the least-square approximation, cf e.g. [7,5].
