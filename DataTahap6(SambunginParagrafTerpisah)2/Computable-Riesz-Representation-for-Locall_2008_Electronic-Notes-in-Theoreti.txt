of the Riesz representation theorem [6,4,3,15]. In this article we study the com- putational content of one of these theorems, the Riesz representation theorem for locally compact Hausdorff spaces [3]. For this purpose we use the representation approach (TTE), which has turned out to be particulary natural and flexible among the various models for studying computability in Analysis and related fields [21].
