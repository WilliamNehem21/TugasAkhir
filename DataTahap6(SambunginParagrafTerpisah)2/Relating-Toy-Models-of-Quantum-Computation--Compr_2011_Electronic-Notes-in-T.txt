Mathematical models of physical systems are often complicated. Quantum physics in particular is built over very rich mathematical structures. The efforts to extract conceptual components from these structures, and to analyze the particular quan- tum phenomena supported in such fragments, can be traced back all the way to Birkhoff and von Neumann. Nowadays, such efforts sometimes lead to toy models [35,28,40,13,2].

It is fair to also mention that test spaces are interpreted in many different ways in the literature. We viewed them as a relational version of rays 10 ; many authors view them as an abstraction of bases. This interpretation can also be related using comprehension; but this must be left for another occasion.

There is a sense in which dagger autonomous categories give a semantically richer structure than dagger compact categories. They capture not only the abstract com- position and duality operations, used for building quantum systems and operations, which correspond to the global operations of the dagger compact structure, but also the complementarity relations, which are modeled in quantum logic, and have been presented in dagger compact categories as local structure. Dagger autonomy arises as soon as complementarity is viewed as a part of the global structure of quantum computation.

However, a richer or finer picture does not always provide a better insight. One of the most salient features of the dagger compact structure is that the calculations with it are supported by a very convenient string diagram language. Is there a convenient extension of that language catering for the dagger autonomous structure? Its utility may depend on such a language.
