We work in intensional type theory with one univalent universe U closed under propositional truncation. The rest of this section is devoted to explaining what that means. We follow the terminology used in the HoTT book [28]. For brevity, we will often just give type signatures and elide the term. The details can be found in the accompanying code at https://git.io/v7wtW.

Any type can be truncated to a proposition by freely adding paths. This is the propositional truncation (or (-1)-truncation) which can be expressed as a higher inductive type (HIT). The type constructor _  takes a type A as a parameter; the point constructor |_| coerces terms of type A to terms in the truncation; and the path constructor ident identifies any two points in the truncation, making it a proposition. We must do this as a postulate as Agda does not yet support HITs:

As Christensen [9] explains, a type U is rarely the base of a univalent fibration. Yet, in that same paper, Christensen characterizes a class of types that is always the base of univalent fibrations. We explain this point and exploit it to build a custom univalent subuniverse in the next section.
