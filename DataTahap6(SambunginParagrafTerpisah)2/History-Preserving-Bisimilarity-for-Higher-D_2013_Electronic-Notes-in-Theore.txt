We show that history-preserving bisimilarity for higher-dimensional automata has a simple characterization directly in terms of higher-dimensional transitions. This implies that it is decidable for finite higher- dimensional automata. To arrive at our characterization, we apply the open-maps framework of Joyal, Nielsen and Winskel in the category of unfoldings of precubical sets.

Bisimulation, or rather its underlying semantic model of transition systems, applies to a setting in which concurrency of actions is the same as non-deterministic interleaving; using CCS notation [27], a|b = a.b+b.a. For some applications however, a distinction between these two is necessary, which has led to development of so- called non-interleaving or truly concurrent models such as Petri nets [32], event structures [30], asynchronous transition systems [4, 35] and others; see [40] for a survey.

In this paper we give a geometric interpretation to hp-bisimilarity for HDA, using the open-maps approach introduced by Joyal, Nielsen and Winskel in [23] and results from a previous paper [7] by the first author. Using this interpretation, we show that hp-bisimilarity for HDA has a characterization directly in terms of (higher-dimensional) transitions of the HDA, rather than in terms of runs as e.g. for Petri nets [13].

made in formalisms such as asynchronous transition systems [4, 35] or transition systems with independence [40] which only consider binary independence relations. An unlabeled HDA is essentially a pointed precubical set as defined below. For labeled HDA, one can pass to an arrow category; this is what we shall do in Section 6.

Hence a one-dimensional HDA is a transition system; indeed, the category of transition systems [40] is isomorphic to the full subcategory of HDA spanned by the one-dimensional objects. Similarly one can show [19] that the category of asyn- chronous transition systems is isomorphic to the full subcategory of HDA spanned by the (at most) two-dimensional objects. The category HDA as defined above was used in [7] to provide a categorical framework (in the spirit of [40]) for parallel com- position of HDA. In this article we also introduced a notion of bisimilarity which we will review in the next section.

In this section we recall history-preserving bisimilarity for HDA from [38] and show the main result of this paper: that hp-bisimilarity and the bisimilarity of Def. 3.2 are the same. To do this, we first need to introduce morphisms of homotopy classes of paths and homotopy bisimilarity.

One major question which remains is whether also hereditary hp-bisimilarity can fit into our framework. Because of its back-tracking nature, it seems that simple unfoldings of HDA are not the right tools to use; one should rather consider some form of back-unfoldings of forward-unfoldings. Given the undecidability result of [24], it seems doubtful, however, that any characterization as simple as the one we have for hp-bisimilarity can be obtained.
