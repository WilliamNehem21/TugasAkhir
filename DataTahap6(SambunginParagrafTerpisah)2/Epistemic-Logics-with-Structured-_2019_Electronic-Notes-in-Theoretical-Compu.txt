There are works that use epistemic models in which states have a structure [1,16]. In [1] it is introduced a multi-agent epistemic logic in which states are positions in Rn and the accessibility relations represent the possible states (positions) compatible with the current one. Also in [16,26,27], (dynamic) epistemic logics based on the notion of visibility or observability of propositional variables are presented, i.e, some propositional variable are observable and others are not.

Example 3.4 This example is adapted from [28]. Suppose that a father has three envelopes, each containing: 0, 1 and 2 dollars inside respectively. The father has three children: anna, bob and clara. Each child receives one envelope and do not know the content of the envelopes of the other children.
