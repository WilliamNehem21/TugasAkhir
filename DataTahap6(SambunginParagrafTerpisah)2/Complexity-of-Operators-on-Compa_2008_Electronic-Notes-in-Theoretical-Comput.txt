The computability of compact sets and of operators on compact sets has already been studied in the literature, cf. [13,15,16], also the complexity of some compact sets like Julia sets was analyzed in [2,12]. However, the complexity of operators on compact sets is less explored.

In the last section of the paper we consider the question of computing the convex hull of a compact set. Here in general, the complexity of the operator is again exponential, and we are able to find a connection to the P=NP question even for compact sets that additionally are regular and simply connected. The proof of this connection is influenced by a simular construction in [6], where, among others, the question of finding the maximum value of a real function was considered.

For studying the complexity of examples, it is important to add some remarks about the notation of the numbers used in the definition above. Similar to [8], n should be given in a unary notation, i.e. as a string of length n. Also the grid bound b should be returned in unary. Furthermore, oracle queries have to be written

The result for the complexity of the crossproduct can be shown in a similar way: The only modification is that for an input (n, (d1, .., dk+k' )) we simply call the first oracle with (n, (d1, .., dk)) and the second one with (n, (dk+1, .., dk+k' )) instead of the identical queries mentioned above.

In the previous section we have seen that the projection operator in general has exponential complexity, unless the underlying set is convex. So computing a convex hull of a compact set must also be a complicated operation. Now we have a deeper look into this, especially as we were unable to extend the results for the projection to connected sets.
