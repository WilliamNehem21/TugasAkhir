Domain Theory, a formal basis for the semantics of programming languages, originates in work by D. Scott [17,18] in the mid-1960s. Domain models for var- ious types of programming languages, including imperative, functional, non- deterministic and probabilistic languages, have been extensively studied.

In [25,26,27], for an arbitrary frame L, we call a map between two fuzzy dcpos fuzzy Scott continuous if it is order-preserving and preserves joins of fuzzy directed subsets. Such a category of fuzzy dcpos is cartesian closed. Also, a natural L-topology, called a fuzzy Scott topology, on fuzzy dcpos are defined and studied.

The aim of this paper is to define and study an L-fuzzy topology on fuzzy dcpos. We shall call it an L-fuzzy Scott topology. And then to establish Scott convergence theory for stratified L-filters. Likewise the fuzzy Scott topology, an L-fuzzy Scott topology is an L-fuzzy counterpart of a crisp one.
