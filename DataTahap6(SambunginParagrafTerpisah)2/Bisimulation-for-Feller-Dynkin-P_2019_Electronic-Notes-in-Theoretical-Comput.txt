In this work we aim at a general theory of bisimulation for stochastic systems with true continuous-time evolution. We focus on a class of systems called Feller- Dynkin processes for which a good mathematical theory exists. These systems are the most general version of Markov processes defined on continuous state spaces and with continuous time evolution. Such systems encompass Brownian motion and its many variants.

There are two atomic propositions (denoted P and Q on the diagram), that are satisfied by the final state of some of the branches. The process is a drift at a constant speed to the right. When it reaches a fork, it moves to either branch with probability 1/2 (and stops when he hits an atomic proposition).

Let us now show that this is the greatest bisimulation. Consider two different states x and y. Similarly to what we did for the standard Brownian motion, we can rule out the case where x =0 (and y /= 0) or y =0 (and x /= 0) by simply looking at the function obs.

Or as a fixed-point of some operators on metrics (see [30]). Such a fixed-point metric was defined on jump processes in [19,20]. It seems that some of the details in that work are possibly incorrect, so we hope to fix those details and to adapt similar ideas to our framework.
