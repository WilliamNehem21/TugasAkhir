Now that we have seen additive structure on Kleisli homsets we can conclude from [9] that we have traced monoidal structure in these Kleisli categories. But before we do so we return to Section 3 and re-describe the iterate c# of a coalgebra c in terms of the newly discovered sums. This will be used (in the proof of Theorem 5.2) to show that the induced traced monoidal structure coincides with the coalgebraic trace.
