Characterizations: The morphologies of the HCSTs were observed using optical microscopy (RH2000; HIROX, Japan). An SL200KS goniometer (KINO Industry Co., Ltd, USA) was used to record the changes in the contact angle of the stretching- induced HCSTs. The tensile properties of the as-prepared samples were analyzed using a universal material testing system (Instron 5943; Instron, USA). Relative resistance changes were measured using a Digital Multimeter (Keysight 34470A; Keysight, USA). A G571 air permeability tester (Standard International Group (HK) Limited, China) was used to test the air permeability of the various textiles with a testing area and pressure of 20 cm2 and 200 Pa, respectively, according to GB/T 5453 [33].
