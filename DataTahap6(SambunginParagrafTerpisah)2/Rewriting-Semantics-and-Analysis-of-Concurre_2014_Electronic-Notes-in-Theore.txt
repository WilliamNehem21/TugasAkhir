When calling a function, a triple is pushed on the function stack, consisting of the name of the function, the current environment and the remainder of the computation. Then the current computation is replaced by the body of the function, the environment by the mapping of the arguments to their passed values. When returning, the environment and computation are restored with the function call being replaced by the return value.
