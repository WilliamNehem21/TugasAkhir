and their simulations. The link between the latter and oplax transformations as noticed by Hermida is explained. Section 4 goes into the heart of the matter. A novel model structure on 2-Cat is described. A simulation is then characterized as a right homotopy. The reader unfamiliar with the lore of model categories may wish at this point to consult say the first two chapters of [15] in order to get acquainted with the jargon. Section 5 generalizes the setup to cubical sets and cubical 2-categories. Section 6 draws some conclusive remarks.
