On the one hand, many-valued semantics try to keep the idea of homomorphisms between the language structure and an algebra of truth functions, and allow more than two values in the algebra domain. On the other one Kripke-type semantics maintain only two truth values, but a relation between valuations is introduced. These semantics could seem philosophically controversial but they are powerful and useful technical tools. In fact they can be used to give a mathematical support to basic philosophical notions.

There are different ways to define the semantics of a logic, in the case of non-classical logics the range is very wide. As we said, we will focus only on two types multi- valued semantics and Kripke-type semantics. Let us see some general notions about these semantics.
