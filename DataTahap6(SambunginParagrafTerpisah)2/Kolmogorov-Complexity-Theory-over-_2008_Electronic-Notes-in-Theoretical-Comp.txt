As an application, [28, Corollary 4] presents an alternative proof to a known lower bound in the algebraic complexity theory of polynomials, thus exemplifying the real incompressibility method as a natural counterpart to Fact 1.1d). We will give another application in Observation 4.1.

Remark 2.2 More precisely, any finite information (like, e.g. the number J of real constants following or the length of the input x to simulate M on) can be incorpo- rated in this way without increasing the size of the encoding. This simplifies several putative pitfalls from classical Kolmogorov Complexity like [20, Example 2.1.4]

Now although the latter answer may in general be wrong, the finitely many queries u1,..., uN  H admit a common M beyond which all are reported correctly; and so are the negative ones vj H anyway. Hence for m M, N , g(x, m)= f (x).
