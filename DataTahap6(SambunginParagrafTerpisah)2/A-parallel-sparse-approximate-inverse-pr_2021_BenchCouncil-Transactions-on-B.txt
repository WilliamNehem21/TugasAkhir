In this study, we present an efficient parallel sparse approximate inverse (SPAI) preconditioning algorithm based on MPI and CUDA, called HybridSPAI. For HybridSPAI, it optimizes a latest static SPAI preconditioning algorithm, and is extended from one GPU to multiple GPUs in order to process large-scale matrices. We make the following significant contributions: (1) a general parallel framework for optimizing the static SPAI preconditioner based on MPI and CUDA is presented, and (2) for each component of the preconditioner, a decision tree is established to choose the optimal kernel of computing it. Experimental results show that HybridSPAI is effective, and outperforms the popular preconditioning algorithms in two public libraries, and a latest parallel SPAI preconditioning algorithm.

is assigned to find one subset of J and I, which making many subsets of J and I can be simultaneously obtained. Furthermore, parallelism is also exploited inside each thread group. For the kernel that finds J, the threads inside each warp (thread group) read one column of M in parallel, and store them to shared memory using atomic operation. For the kernel that finds I, a decision tree is established and for any

We present an efficient parallel sparse approximate inverse precon- ditioning algorithm on multi-GPUs in this paper, which is based MPI and CUDA, called HybridSPAI. In our proposed HybridSPAI, a general parallel framework is embraced for optimizing the static SPAI on multi- GPUs, and a decision tree is established to choose the optimal kernel for computing it. The experimental results demonstrate a noticeable performance and high effectiveness of our proposed HybridSPAI.
