We observe that the domain S constructed in Theorem 4.3, though satisfying property (B), is not a simply connected domain. In fact, it contains an infinite number of holes. Whether this construction can be strengthened to make S a simply connected domain, or a multiply connected domain (i.e., a domain with a finite number of holes), is an interesting open question. We do know that the result of Theorem 4.1 also applies to the k-path problem for k > 1. So, we have the following weaker lower bound for simply connected domains S satisfying either property (A) or property (B).
