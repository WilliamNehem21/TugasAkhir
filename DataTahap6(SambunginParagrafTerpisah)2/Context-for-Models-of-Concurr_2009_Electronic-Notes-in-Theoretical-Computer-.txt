Various topological models are being used for studying concurrency. Among them are precubical complexes [7], d-spaces [9,10], local po-spaces [4,8], and FLOW [6]. For a given concurrent system, each of these categories provides a model which captures the relevant computer-scientific properties of the system.

On the local front progress has been made in reducing the path space of a given model using directed homotopies of paths and the fundamental category [9]. One global approach is to pass to the component category [5,13]. In this paper we introduce another global approach, which is perhaps more geometric and which is compatible with the model categorical approach of [1].

The category Pospace has all small limits and colimits. However it is too re- strictive to model many concurrent systems (for example pospaces cannot contain loops). Though all of our examples are in Pospace a better framework for concur- rency is the category LoPospc of local pospaces. A local pospace is a topological space such that each point has a neighborhood which is a pospace and that these local orders are compatible (for a precise definition see Appendix B).

Unfortunately, unlike Pospace, LoPospc does not contain all small colimits. However there is a formal method of enlarging a category to one with all small limits and colimits. 6 Furthermore this larger category has a canonical model struc- ture! [2] For details on how this theory can be applied to LoPospc see the appendix and [1]. In the appendix we give a more precise version of the following theorem (Theorem B.4) which is proved in [1].

Example 5.5 Let A, B, C, B' and C' be as in the previous example, except that the marked points on B and B' are taken to be on the top edge, and the marked points on C and C' are taken to be on the bottom edge. Let D' be the space obtained by attaching C along its bottom edge to the top edge of B.
