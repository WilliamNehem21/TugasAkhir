Runners are somewhat similar to handlers, but one bigger difference is that runners are polymorphic in the value set. For example, handling allows one to extract a value from a nondeterministic computation (a binary wellfounded leaf tree) over a specific value set that carries a binary operation by folding this operation over the leaf labels. (If for us a nondeterministic computation is a nonempty list of values, this operation must be associative.) Running does not allow such things. In our view, the pragmatics of handlers and runners are different: handlers are a programming language construct, but runners are compilation schemes.
