It is shown in [11] that Theorem 3.3 is the best we can produce construc- tively without introducing a principle that, while valid in the standard models (intuitionistic, recursive, classical) of constructive mathematics, appears not to be derivable using only intuitionistic logic and dependent choice. Under certain additional hypotheses, Theorem 3.3 can be strengthened to produce the uniform continuity of the strongly continuous function f ; see [5].

The uniform continuity theorem for continuous mappings from compact metric spaces into metric spaces follows easily from Theorem 3.3 with classical logic. In the same way, a standard classical result about uniform convergence can be obtained from our next application of Proposition 2.3. This needs more definitions.
