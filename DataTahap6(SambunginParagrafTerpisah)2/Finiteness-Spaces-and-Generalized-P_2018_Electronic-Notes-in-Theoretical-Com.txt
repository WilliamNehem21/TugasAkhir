Ribenboim introduced his notion of generalized power series [19,20,21] in order to study rings of arithmetic functions. But the construction is quite general and gives a great many examples, some of which are discussed below. The construction is functorial in nature and thus can be analyzed via category theory. Ribenboim begins with a special class of partially ordered monoids (pomonoids), which he calls strict pomonoids. He considers those functions from the pomonoid to a ring such that the support (the inverse image of the complement of 0) is artinian and narrow (defined below). He demonstrates that the Dirichlet convolution formula lifts to this setting and thus one obtains a ring which can sensibly be thought of as a ring of power series.

of Theorem 4.1 is functorial. Unfortunately, if we consider it from the usual category Pos of posets to any of the categories of finiteness spaces we have considered, this is not the case. Indeed, the inverse image under an order-preserving map of a noetherian subset may be not noetherian. However, the problem disappears if we consider strict maps.

Example 5.2 [Formal power series] Let A bea set (called in this case the alphabet ). Then, let M be the free monoid generated by A. The finiteness space (M, P(M )) has a monoid structure in FinPf (and actually even in FinF) given by the classical monoid structure of M . The only non-trivial part here, is to check that the multiplication

Differentiation provides important operators on power series rings and a natural question is whether one can differentiate the generalized power series that arise in this paper. Indeed, in the commutative case, the category of linearized finiteness spaces provided one of the first examples of differential categories [2], used in the study of models of differential linear logic [6]. It will be of interest to study dif- ferentiation of these generalized series and the extent to which they fit into the differential category framework.
