Length-two string rewriting systems are length-preserving string rewriting systems that consist of length- two rules. This paper shows that confluence, termination, left-most termination and right-most termination are undecidable properties for length-two string rewriting systems. These results mean that these properties are undecidable for the class of linear term rewriting systems in which depth-two variables are allowed in both sides of rules.

Confluence and termination are both generally undecidable for term rewriting sys- tems (TRSs) and for string rewriting systems (SRSs). Hence several decidable classes have been studied. Confluence is a decidable property for terminating TRSs [12], and ground TRSs [16]. The latter result was extended to linear shal- low TRSs [7] and shallow right-linear TRSs [8]. Classes for which termination is a decidable property are investigated and extended: ground TRSs [10], right-ground TRSs [4], TRSs that consist of right-ground rules, collapsing rules and shallow right-linear rules [9], and the related class of shallow left-linear TRSs [18].

SRSs are said to be length preserving if the left-hand side and the right-hand side of each rule have the same length. Since there is a finite number of rules, the number of different symbols appearing in the rules is finite, and fixed for SRSs, and the number of strings with a given length is also finite. Thus the decidability of the following problems for length-preserving SRSs trivially follows.

In this paper, we showed that confluence, termination, left-most termination, and right-most termination are undecidable properties for length-two SRSs which are length-preserving SRSs consisting of length-two rules. Thus all these properties are also undecidable properties for linear TRSs in which depth-two variables are allowed in both sides of the rules. We still have remaining questions concerning (un)decidability results for classes of SRSs obtained by limiting the number of rules.
