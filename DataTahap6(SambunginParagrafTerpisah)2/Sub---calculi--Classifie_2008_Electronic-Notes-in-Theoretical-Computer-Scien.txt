it is a superterm of the whole redex, then there are three subcases: if the unique occurrence of y is outside the redex; if it is in t; or if it is in u. The two first cases are easy; for the last one we use |t|x = 1. In each case, we conclude |v1|y = 1.

As evidenced in Remark 7.2, disjunction is not a well-behaved operation with respect to stability. However, the following proposition exhibits the particular be- haviour of 1, and tends to show that, to some extent, the choice of P(1) is not relevant for the stability of P.

In brief, we have essentially paraphrased previously stated results, in a less gen- eral way. Yet, this paraphrase exhibits an intriguing structure, which does not seem to be directly related to well-known algebraic structures. This should probably be taken as a hint that either this structure is interesting and deserves a thorough study, or there is an interesting structure on top of it that should suggest an interesting generalisation of the notion of subcalculus.
