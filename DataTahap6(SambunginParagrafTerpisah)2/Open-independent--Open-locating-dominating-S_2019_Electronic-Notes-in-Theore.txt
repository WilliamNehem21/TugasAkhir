set of G, such that every vertex in G has at least one neighbor in S, and no two vertices in G have the same set of neighbors in S. When a device may be prevented from detecting an intruder at its own location, it is necessary to install another de- vice in its neighborhood. A natural way to analyze such situations is to make use of open neighborhood sets which may have useful additional properties, such as being open-independent, dominating, open-dominating or open-locating-dominating.

tary prisms, such as independence, distance and domination. For further study on domination parameters in complementary prisms, see [1,3,4,7,8,9,11]. Cappelle et al. [2] described a polynomial time recognition algorithm for complementary prisms and Duarte et al. [5] studied algorithmic/complexity properties of complementary prisms with respect to cliques, independent sets, domination, and convexity. Here we study open-independent, open-locating-dominating sets in the complementary prisms of graphs. Various properties of and bounds on OLDOIND-sets in comple- mentary prisms were presented and the cases of cliques, paths and cycles have been completely solved. Our main result is that if the girth of G is at least five, then the
