The combination of non-determinism and probability is an important but difficult topic of research, which has received much attention. There is a wide variety of possible combinations. We shall not try to give an overview or a historical account and refer to [3] for such an overview and a classification, in coalgebraic terms.

In a next step the notion of convex subset can be defined naturally over a semimodule, namely as a subset that is closed under linear combinations (with scalars adding up to 1). Our first aim is to reformulate the setting of Varacca in terms of free constructions of semimodules. In doing so we slightly extend his work, by formulating it with a semiring as parameter, and with non-finitely generated convex subsets. The latter are needed since a trace is generally not a finite (or finitely generated) set.

We shall consider a concrete state-based system with combined possibilistic and probabilistic behaviour in order to illustrate the calculation of traces of states. This is meant as a sketch of what this paper achieves. Later sections will elaborate the underlying technical details. Hence, possibly, not everything is clear at this stage.
