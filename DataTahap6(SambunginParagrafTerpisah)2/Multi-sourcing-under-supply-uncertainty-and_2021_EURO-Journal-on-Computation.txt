Our paper differs from the above discussed papers in the following important ways. First, unlike many of the above models that focus pri- marily on short-supply of product by suppliers, we account for yields that cause both short-supply as well as excess supply. However, as men- tioned by Dada et al. (2007), the buyer will procure from a supplier at most the quantity he orders with the supplier, although the supplier has an oversupply of product due to a higher yield.

transaction in the spot market. Fafchamps and Hill (2005) find out that while the likelihood of a farmer selling to the market decreases as the market gets farther, the likelihood of selling at the farm gate increases. Aayog (2017) also mentions that directly buying from farmers in India helps farmers and buyers in fetching better prices and in doing away with middlemen.

10 Though we use Normal distribution for supply yields as they are widely used in OM literature (Agrawal and Nahmias, 1997; Anupindi and Akella, 1993; Dong et al., 2021; Gurnani et al., 2000; Schmitt and Snyder, 2012), our model accommodates any probability distribution for supply yields.
