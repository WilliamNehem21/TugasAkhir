The community has advocated the use of algebraic specification and program transformation technologies to improve software productivity and quality for many years [7], and a number of development tools and environments have been proposed for this purpose [3]. However, most of those methods and tools are used only in limited areas such as real-time and embedded systems. Moreover, few works have been done on the implementation of general-purpose EAs for a wide range of problems which are often encountered in a variety of real-world applications.

In this paper, we present a high-level but practical framework for mechanical im- plementation of population-based EAs for complex problem solving. The framework supports algebraic specification of metaheuristic methods and optimization prob- lems, and mechanical generation of algorithmic programs for concrete problems. Using algebraic specification composition and refinement techniques, our approach achieves a high level of abstraction and mechanization without losing performance in detailed implementation.
