Our second motivation stems from the desire to circumvent some of the difficulties connected to classical domain theory. As is well known, in order to get a cartesian closed category of continuous domains, one has to restrict to a subcategory of FS-domains, [13,1]. Unlike general continuous domains, a straightforward characterisation of FS-domains via their Stone dual, for example, is not known. Perhaps as a result of the relative weakness of our tools for FS-domains, certain basic questions about them remain unresolved. We still do not know whether they coincide with retracts of bifinite domains or whether the probabilistic powerdomain can be restricted to this category, [16].

Next we develop the Stone duality of closed relations. The morphisms between open set lattices corresponding to closed relations turn out to be preframe homomorphisms, [2], preserving finite meets and directed suprema. They have been studied in a similar framework before, see [26, Prop. 11.2.5], but the duality with relations seems to be new.

This extends the classical situation of functions between stably compact spaces (or, more generally, locally compact sober spaces), [10, Remark 1.3]. Since the Stone dual of a function has an upper adjoint, perfectness in that situation can be further characterized by the adjoint being Scott-continuous (loc. cit.). Because of Corollary 3.7 we have that a continuous function be- tween stably compact spaces is perfect in the classical sense if and only if the corresponding relation given by the hypergraph is perfect in our sense.
