In [14] the authors describe problems that arise when composing control software in the context of embedded systems used in consumer electronics (CE) products. Many control tasks in a TV, for instance, coordinate devices in the same signal path. This implies a strong dependency upon the topology of the hardware, which is subject to change in new products but also for the same product during its development. In light of such problems the approach taken in [14] is to allow components to communicate using horizontal com- munication interfaces in addition to the vertical control interfaces. The idea is that components controlling individual hardware devices have input and output ports that mirror the hardware and communicate through those.

The activity described in the loop can be going on concurrently with the blanking operation between C and D. We do not need to denote this con- currency explicitly on the LSC because the loop and the blanking operation involve different components. If some component was participating in both, we could use the coregion notation (dotted vertical lines around the concur- rent messages) with the true-concurrent interpretation of [5]. We return to a discussion on coregions in Section 3.

illustrated by means of a small example from embedded software for consumer electronics products. Component interactions were first modelled using LSCs and then formalised using snapshots generated from LSCs. In addition, an underlying objective was to use the mandatory behaviour described in an LSC as the starting point for our component model described elsewhere [7,8].
