An important technical aspect for this approach has been the use of order- sorted theories. In order-sorted theories, narrowing will terminate, providing a finitary unification algorithm, in many cases in which unsorted narrowing will not. Furthermore, even in the case in which both terminate, order-sorted narrowing will often produce a smaller search space. Two interesting examples of this use of order-sorted theories to obtain finitary unification algorithms are the approximate theory for associativity in [7] and the Diffie-Hellman exponentiation theory of [5]. In both cases, narrowing with the corresponding unsorted theories is non-terminating, whereas narrowing with the order-sorted theories does terminate.

We have proposed variant narrowing as a narrowing modulo B procedure that achieves efficiency, in terms of having a potentially much smaller search space than full narrowing, without losing completeness. We have also shown how, when a theory E has the finite variant property, variant narrowing specializes to algorithms for both computing the finite variant and for computing a complete and minimal set of E-unifiers. We have also explained how, under the finite variant assumption, variant narrowing can be used as a key component of a symbolic reachability analysis method for concurrent systems specified as rewrite theories, and in particular for cryptographic protocols specified this way.
