A recurring problem in course scheduling consists in determining which classrooms are to be assigned to each lecture of each course, in such a way that overlapping lectures receive different classrooms [4], where the starting and ending times of each lecture are given as part of the input. This situation is usually modeled by an undi- rected graph G = (V, EG), whose vertices represent the lectures and whose edges join pairs of lectures that cannot receive the same classroom since the corresponding time intervals have nonempty intersection, and by a set C of classrooms. The graph G is usually referred to as the conflict graph associated with the lectures. This prob- lem corresponds to the classical graph vertex coloring problem, as any C-coloring

The facet-generating procedures and the separation algorithm presented in this work can be applied to the standard formulation of the classical vertex coloring formulation. In this case, we must ignore the y-variables in the procedures. It would be interesting to explore whether these ideas can be further refined for the classical vertex coloring problem, in order to get more precise procedures and a more efficient (unified) separation heuristic. It would also be interesting to consider similar facet-preserving procedures for other problems, as these ideas may contribute to provide simpler explanations of existing facets and simpler implementations of cutting-plane-based procedures.
