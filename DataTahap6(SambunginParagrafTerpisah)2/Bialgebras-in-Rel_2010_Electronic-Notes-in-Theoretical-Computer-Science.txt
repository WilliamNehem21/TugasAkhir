We study bialgebras in the compact closed category Rel of sets and binary relations. We show that various monoidal categories with extra structure arise as the categories of (co)modules of bialgebras in Rel. In particular, for any group G we derive a ribbon category of crossed G-sets as the category of modules of a Hopf algebra in Rel which is obtained by the quantum double construction. This category of crossed G-sets serves as a model of the braided variant of propositional linear logic.

In Section 2, we recall basic notions and facts on monoidal categories and bialgebras. In Section 3, we examine some bialgebras in Rel which arise from monoids and groups, and study the categories of (co)modules. Section 4 is devoted to a quantum double construction in Rel, which gives rise to a category of crossed G-sets. We discuss how this category can be used as a model of braided linear logic in Section

Example 2.3 As a classical example, let us consider the category Vectk of vector spaces over a field k and linear maps. Vectk is a symmetric monoidal category whose monoidal product is given by the tensor product of vector spaces, and k serves as the tensor unit. A monoid in Vectk is nothing but an algebra in the standard sense. Similarly, a comonoid in Vectk is what is normally called a coalgebra. Modules, comodules, bialgebras and Hopf algebras in Vectk are exactly those in the classical sense; a detailed account can be found in [23].
