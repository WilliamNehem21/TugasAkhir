For students, Twitter is a media for sharing experiences, sharing emotions and seeking social support. Chen [4] used data from Twitter to understand issues and problems in their educational experiences. The results of the research can be used by education institutions to detect students who have problems in their studies. In academic failure detection topics, using social media as a data source is relatively new. Traditionally, demographic, academic, social network, or combination of those data are used to detect academic failure. To the best of our knowledge, content extraction from English tweet posting to understand student problems is so

Zhang [9] shows 7 factors which are related to student prob- lems: Personal, Family, Peer-Related, Subject/content, Institutional Agent, Institutional, and Social. Four factors were chosen from seven factors for prominent labels: Personal, Relation, Subject and Institutional Agent. Personal label is a label which contains some personal complaints such as sick, confused, etc. Relation label is combination between family and peer-related label which con- tains some relation complaints such as longing for family, having problems with friends, etc. Subject label is a label which contains heavy study load, heavy of material course, etc. Lastly, Institutional Agent label is a label which contains some complaints about lec- turer, faculty, advisor, etc. In this research we use these four labels as category labels. Those labels already cover five labels in [4].

Bag of Word method which is used in [4] has some weakness such as missing word order, neglecting grammar, etc [10]. We pro- pose Indonesian Bigram Word Rule for Multi-label Student Com- plaints (Ina-BWR), a semantic method for identifying Indonesian multi-label student complaints to overcome missing word order and neglecting grammar. Ina-BWR method consists three pro- cesses: preprocess an informal text, identify complaint and identify object.

Preprocessing text data is needed because text data in social media usually informal and unstructured [4,11]. Some studies have been done in preprocessing Indonesian social media data and result some preprocess such as removing punctuation mark, con- verting number to letter, removing letter repetition [11], removing hashtag, converting slang language to formal language [12]. How- ever, on multi-label student complaints, some existing preprocess are needed to be modified such as: not removing hashtag but pars- ing a hashtag, correcting a separate word, correcting a conjunction word, parsing suffix people pronoun and auto-correct word to for- malize a sentences and make the text are ready for complaint and object identification.

Identifying a complaint sentence is done by using bigram word rule. Bigram word rule is developed by adopting bigram word rule for identifying Indonesian opinion which has been conducted by [13,14]. Part of Speech (POS) tagger is used to determine word by word tag label. Some modifications are conducted and additional rules are added to determine a new bigram word rule for multi- label student complaints.

Identifying a complaint object is done by using matching an object word with four corpuses: Personal, Relation, Subject and Institutional Agent. The four corpuses are mainly taken from IndoWordList1 with some additional data from other resources to help object complaint identification process. IndoWordList is a dic- tionary which is used by Microsoft word to spell check Indonesian grammar automatically. Indonesia Natural Language Processing Toolkit (InaNLP) [15] is used to formalize sentences and to give POS tagger for each word and to lemmatize an input word.

The motivations for this research are following: to produce four Indonesian objects corpuses which related to multi-label student complaints and to produce Indonesian pattern rule for student complaints identification which can support another research in the future specially in Indonesian language. There are two main contributions of this paper. First, adding some new preprocess method for multi-label student complaints prob- lems. Second, introducing Ina-BWR, an Indonesian bigram word rule methods to identify complaint and multi-label objects complaint.

For subject label, the domination of complaints in the first semester are: a lot of tasks (34%), material course difficulties (16%), full of schedules (10%) and other course activities such as a lot of laboratory work, a lot of tasks in student orientation, unpre- paredness of midterm exam and final exam, and other issues (40%). For relation label, the domination of complaints in the first semester is about: love relationship (36.73%), difficulty in making new friend relation (30.61%), homesickness (20.41%), and other issues (12.24%). For institutional agent label, the domination of complaints in the first semester is about: delay or absence of lec-

Research using Twitter as data source has been conducted by many researchers. That research consists of sentiment analysis, emotion/mood recognition, opinion mining, topic modeling, trend- ing topic, social network, complaint mining and mining multi-label student problems. Examples of research on sentiment analysis such as sentiment classification in Indonesian Twitter on Jakarta governor election [12], sentiment classification in Indonesian Twit- ter with four classes: positive, negative, neutral and question [11], and implicit sentiment expression by using similar contextual semantics and sentiment [6].

emotion classification by using hierarchical classification [21]. One of opinion mining in Twitter has been conducted by [22] to get topic model by using intention with verb and topic with non- verb (V-BTM: Verb-Biterm Topic Model). Indra [7] compared two methods: document pivot and BN-grams for detecting Indonesian tweets trending topics. Zhao [23] analyzed Twitter data to get bet- ter understand about analytics research weeks in the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC). Chen [4] used student tweets data for mining multi-label student problems in English language. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research about multi-label student problems in Indonesian lan- guage. There are some differences between English and Indonesian language such as syntax, phonemes, pronounciation, meaning, grammar, and tenses [24]. In Indonesian tweets, many informal features which appear in text such as abbreviations, interjections, foreign words, blending of Indonesian and foreign wors, emoji, and etc [25]. For that reasons, many kinds of issues or challenges in multi-label student problems in Indonesian language would be explored to get more precise approach.

Opinion mining is a technique for extracting, classifying, under- standing, and assessing the opinions expressed in various user- generated content [38]. The objectives in opinion mining is to clas- sify text as an opinion or fact [13]. Research in Indonesia opinion mining has been conducted by [13,14]. There are 3 subprocesses in that research: document subjectivity, opinion orientation and target detection. Document subjectivity is sub process to identify a sentence is opinion or not. Opinion orientation is sub process which aims to give opinion orientation (positive or negative). Tar- get detection is a part of opinion mining process for recognizing the target object of the opinion. One of the results of [13] and

InaNLP is a toolkit for natural language processing both on for- mal and informal Indonesian language [15]. InaNLP has nine mod- ules for text processing such as sentence splitter, tokenization, word formalization, morphologically analyzer (stemmer), POS tag- ger, phrase chunker, named entity tagger, syntactic parser, and semantic analyzer. Several modules were built using rule based approach and others using statistical based approach. InaNLP mod- ules can be accessed independently. The accuracies of InaNLP are 93.41% for name entity (NE) tagger and 96.5% for POS Tagger [15].

In this research, word formalization, POS tagger and stemmer modules are used. Word formalization module is used to formalize informal sentences to formal sentences. POS Tagger is used to tag a label for each word in a tweet. Stemmer is used to lemmatize a word and provides its lemma and affixes of the word.

[44] and very effective for document classification [45]. In the first contribution, informal conversation patterns in our data are ana- lyzed and additional preprocessing steps to solve those informal conversation pattern problems are added. In the second contribu- tion, Ina-BWR uses semantic approachs to solve incorrect word order and grammatical error in bag of word method.

The auto-correction process is performed on a word which is not exists in dictionary list. The smallest levensthein distance is used to select the best appropriate candidate. Levensthein is an algorithm which compare two string: source string (ss) and desti- nation string (dt), and then calculates deletion, insertions or substi- tution step which replaces (ss) to (dt) [46].

cies of personal, subject, relation and institutional agent by up to 1.59%, 1.98%, 0.37% and 0.09% respectively. While Ina-BWR com- pared to the best BoW method (Unigram BoW with Ina-BWR addi- tional preprocessing scenario) shows improvement of accuracies for personal, subject and relation by up to 2.77%, 5.31% and 0.68% respectively. Combination of Ina-BWR and Unigram BoW with Ina-BWR additional preprocessing gives the best accuracy for all labels.

gram in all scenarios (with or without additional preprocess). InaBWR gives lowest OOV words because its corpus derived from indowordlist dictionary directly and not depend on training data such as BoW method. Besides word normalization, other strategies are neededed to be conducted on BoW method to improve accura- cies such as synonym matching and replace OOV words by the best similar word using word similarity methods.

The transition from high school to university gives a special experience for student in the first semester. Many complaints on student tweets in first semester show that the students need a social media support, so they can survive in new environtment. In this research, four categories are conducted based on seven aca- demic success factors: Personal, Subject, Relation and Institutional Agent. A new semantic methods, Ina-BWR has been proposed to improve BoW method on two contributions: 1) adding additional text preprocessing such as parsing a hashtag, correcting a separate word, correcting a conjunction word, parsing suffix people pro- noun and auto-correcting word 2) adopting bigram word rule in Indonesian opinion identification and manual corpus assistance. Generally, two contributions in Ina-BWR can improve accuracy in all accuracy metric except on institutional agent. But this drawback can be solved by combining Ina-BWR and the best BoW method (Unigram BoW with Ina-BWR additional preprocessing scenario) which.
