Now, we set to establish some important results concerning the properties of logical formula, which is important for the model checking algorithm. Fol- lowing [2], we use transposition as a useful tool to give some concise proof of properties concerning fresh names. Due to space restriction, most of detailed proofs are omitted. We refer the reader to the full version of this paper for more details. The following definition extends the notion of transposition to predicate.

(including free and bound names) contained in the nodes of G and NA for the number of names and name variables contained in A. Note that names in tag set of the formula does not be included, since it only contributes as a bookkeeping. The following lemma is important, by which we can conclude that provided that each term only appears once in each tag set (just as in our algorithm), the size of tag set is bounded since the STG we consider is finite.
