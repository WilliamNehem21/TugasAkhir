The remainder of this paper is designed in the following man- ner. Section 2 examines the work done in this field. The proposed architecture was defined in detail in Section 3. Section 4 describes the experimental setup used to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, as well as a brief discussion of the findings. Finally, in Section 5, we concluded the discussion by outlining potential research directions.

during quizzes, and the lack of an online agent to support them. In the case of ELRA, VA addressed these issues, and the recommenda- tion method reduced the chances of inappropriate course selection. As a result, participants in the experimental group (whether stu- dents, instructors, or virtual agents) reported higher levels of satis- faction than those in the control group. Besides, the parametric analysis revealed that ELRA users are happier than traditional approach users, with a satisfaction rate of more than 50% versus less than 50% for traditional approach users.
