In the specification the grammar is written as above. Operators Ut, At, Ab, Pr, Fc and Su specify the unit, atoms as term objects, abstractions, pairs, function applications and suspended variables, respectively. For the Fc constructor, the first and second nat arguments represent the super and subscripts of the applied function symbol. In the specification, the function symbols f A and f AC are repre-

An atom as an object term a, is written in Coq as (At a). When necessary, this syntax is used in the pseudo-code describing the specification, otherwise standard nominal syntax will be adopted. Notice that although in nominal syntax two atoms a and d are different by definition, (At a) and (At d) could be the same atom, since in the Coq specification a and d are used as meta-variables ranging over atoms.
