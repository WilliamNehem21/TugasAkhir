It is then quite natural to address the same enumeration problems for hyper- graphs. Intuitively, one would expect that the problems would get much more difficult as this is the case with many graphs problems when generalized to hyper- graphs. It is certainly the case for the problem of finding an asymptotic formula for the number of connected r-uniform hypergraphs with given number of vertices and edges (see [5,1,4,3]).
