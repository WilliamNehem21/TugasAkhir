Vulnerability is defined as an error or event that may directly or indirectly distort the integrity, practicality or privacy in a system, device or service. Many vulnerabilities are detected and declared every year. The administrators of organizations with the resources to terminate vulnerabilities in their systems first focus on the most critical vulnerabilities. The number of companies and systems assessing these risks is quite limited. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), based on the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) open platform, is a quantitative calcu- lation method transforming simple formulae into a value of the severity of vulnerabilities [1]. The availability of standard metrics allows an objective assessment to be performed to compare vul- nerabilities. Therefore, the use of CVSS is very beneficial. CVSS scoring systems. Explaining vulnerability deficits through linguis- tic variables is easier than finding and calculating the basic CVSS scoring parameters [3]. This study aimed to model and estimate CVSS base scores based on a vulnerability description using Fuzzy Logistic Regression (FLR).
