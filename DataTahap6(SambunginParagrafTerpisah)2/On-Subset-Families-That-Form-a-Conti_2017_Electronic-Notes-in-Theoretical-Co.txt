In Lattice Theory, the representations of special type of lattices are always important research topics. Many approaches, such as in terms of families of subsets of a set, topological spaces, formal concepts and information systems [4,5,9,12,13,15], have been used for representing special type of lattices. The most intuitive one is by means of families of subsets of a set.
