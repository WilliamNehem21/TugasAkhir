Magic labelings have applications in communication networks. Such networks consist of devices and communication lines connecting these devices [1,2]. To avoid collision, each communication line has a unique identifier. For security reasons, one must be able to deduce the identifier of a line from the devices it connects. This goal is achieved if the sum of the identifier of the line with the identifiers of the two connecting devices is constant in the whole network. Another application of magic labelings is in the use of radar impulses to measure the distance between objects [1,3].

Our contribution is twofold: we investigate the problem of describing edge-magic labelings in some forests of stars and some forests of caterpillars. A star forest is a forest whose components are stars. We say that a forest of stars is odd if it consists of an odd number of stars. It is easy to see that a 1-regular graph with k edges, which is a star forest, is not super edge-magic if k is even [6, Lemma 1.2]. The following conjecture was posed in 2002.

We are interested in symmetric star forests, which are those such that the num- ber of stars of each size is even except for at most one size. In our first main result (Theorem 2.2), we prove that every odd symmetric star forest has a super edge- magic labeling, providing a positive result regarding Conjecture 1.1. Furthermore, the labeling we show in this result is also special super edge-magic, which is a super edge-magic labeling f of a bipartite graph G[X, Y ] where f (X) = {1, 2,..., |X|}. An open problem regarding such labelings is to characterize the star forests which admit special super edge-magic labelings [12, Problem 2.9].

Proof. Let C be an odd symmetric star forest and p = |C|. The proof is by induction on the number n of vertices of C. If n = p, then C consists of only the centers of the stars. Set f (ci) = i for i = 1,..., p. Trivially this is a standard super edge-magic labeling of C.

First we prove in Claim 3.2 that,  for every edge uv,  we have f (u)+ f (v)+ f (uv)= k for some constant k = k(r, s, p) that depends only on r, s and p. Then, in order to finish the proof, we show that all labels given by f are different and lie between 1 and xp.
