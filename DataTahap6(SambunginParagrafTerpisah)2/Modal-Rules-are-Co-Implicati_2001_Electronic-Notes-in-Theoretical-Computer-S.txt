Similarly to [13], our aim here is to use the duality of algebras and coal- gebras to prove a dual of this theorem for coalgebras. As it turns out, the concept dual to implication is that of a modal rule. Theorem 4.1 establishes that a class of coalgebras is rule-definable iff it is closed under images of mor- phisms and disjoint unions. Theorem 5.2 applies this result to Kripke frames: A class of Kripke frames is definable by rules of infinitary modal logic iff it is closed under images of p-morphisms and disjoint unions.
