The language de ned by a PRCG is based on the notion of range. For a given string w = a1 ::: an 2 T , a pair of integers (i; j) s.t. 0  i  j  n is called a range, and is denoted hi::jiw. In the range hi::jiw, i is its lower bound,

In any PRCG, terminals, variables and arguments of a clause denote ranges. The empty argument denotes an empty range. A terminal t denotes the range hj  1::jiw i w = a1 ::: an and t = aj. More generally, a string of the form XY denotes a range i both X and Y denote ranges that can be concatenated: the concatenation on strings matches the concatenation on ranges.

In a NRCG, a negative predicate call de nes the complement language (w.r.t. T ) of its positive counterpart: an instantiated negative predicate suc- ceeds (i.e., the derive relation ) is extended to allow A( ~) ) ") i its pos- x = x1 x2 x3, y = x1 ux2vx3 for (u; v) 2 Ci, x2 2 Si, for some i, 1   i   n. If  is a derive relation mode (i.e.,  2 fex; ing), the language de ned by K

30 can only be instantiated i X X X , the argument of the rightmost predi- cate call, denotes a range, that is i the three ranges bounded respectively to X1, X2 and X3 can be concatenated. This is possible i X1uX2vX3 = X1X2X3 (i.e., uv = ").
