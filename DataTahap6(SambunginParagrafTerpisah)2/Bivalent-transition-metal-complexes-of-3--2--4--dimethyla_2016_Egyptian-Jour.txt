4-Dimethylamino-benzaldehyde (0.01 mol; 1.5 g), in 50 mL ethanol with 1 mL acetic acid glacial. The ligand was precipi- tated during reflux (3 hrs) and then separated by filtration followed by recrystallization from absolute ethyl alcohol and finally dried in a vacuum desiccator over anhydrous CaCl2. The pureness of the compounds was tested by TLC (Scheme 1).

The DMOL3 program in Materials Studio package [21,22] was used to evaluate the cluster calculations. The simulations of geometry optimization of the isolated solid compounds were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) via the GAUSSIAN 09 program package. The DNP basis sets are of analo- gous class to 6-31G Gaussian basis sets [23]. The DNP basis sets are more precise than Gaussian basis sets of identical size [24]. Based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the RPBE functional [25] was considered the most excellent exchange-correlation functional [26]. The geometric optimi- zation is carried out without any regularity restraint.

with double distilled water, and then the cell was shaken well for 2 min to ensure complete complexation. After this, 2 mL of surfactant (HOL with known concentration) was added and the cell was then inverted upside down strongly twenty five times by hand and was left for five minutes standing for com- plete flotation. Finally the concentration of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions that remained in the mother liquor was analyzed via AAS. The floatability (F %) of Cd(II) or Pb(II) ions was calculated accord- ing to the following relation:
