Definition 2.2 Let C be an Euler diagram and define the Euler Graph of C to be the edge-labelled directed plane multigraph G(C) whose vertices are the points of intersection 4 in proj(C) and whose edges are the curve segments in proj(C). If a curve segment is a simple closed curve, then arbitrarily choose a point on the curve to be a vertex.

{1, 2,..., n} from which all rays intersect each curve exactly once. The fol- lowing generalization of results by Bultena et al. [3] establishes a connection between the Euler Dual and ray monotonicity; they form the basis for our drawing algorithm.

it so that the regions have a specified area. Our solution works for all Euler diagrams that have a region representing the intersection of all curves and for all weight functions. Our method also yields heuristic solutions for many cases where there is no region of common intersection.
