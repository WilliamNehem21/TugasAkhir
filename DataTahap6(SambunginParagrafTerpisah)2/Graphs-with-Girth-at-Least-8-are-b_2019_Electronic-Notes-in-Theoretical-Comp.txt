one by cleaning color c. In a coloring such that we cannot apply this procedure, all color classes have at least one b-vertex. Such a coloring is called a b-coloring of G. Observe that an optimal coloring cannot have the number of colors decreased by the described algorithm; therefore every optimal coloring is also a b-coloring. In [8], the authors define the b-chromatic number of G, denoted by b(G), as the largest natural k for which G has a b-coloring with k colors. In the same article, the authors demonstrated that the problem of finding b(G) is NP-complete in general.

Because of these results, it makes sense to investigate the b-continuity of graphs with large girth. Indeed, in [1] the authors prove that regular graphs with girth at least 6 and without cycles of length 7 are b-continuous, and in [11], they prove that every graph with girth at least 10 are b-continuous. Here, we improve their result to graphs with girth at least 8.

Theorem 1.2 is expected to have a non-constructive part. In the next section, we present the basic definitions and results, in Section 3 we present our proofs, and in Section 4, we make some further comments on the proof and state some open questions.
