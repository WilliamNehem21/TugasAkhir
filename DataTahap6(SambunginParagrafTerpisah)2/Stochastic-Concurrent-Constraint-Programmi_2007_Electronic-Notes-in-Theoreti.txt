Biochemical networks are modeled by biologists giving the list of reactions in which the molecules of the system are involved. Given such list, we can construct easily a model in sCCP; in addition, there is a canonical way to associate a set of ODEs to such list. It is thus reasonable to ask that the ODEs obtained from the sCCP model of a list of biochemical reactions coincide with the usual ODEs. This property has been called preservation of rate semantics in [9]. In the paper, we show that the translation methods for sCCP do satisfy this property. Unfortu- nately, preservation of rate semantics tells nothing about preservation of dynamical behavior, which can be different between the sCCP model and the associated ODEs.

In the language we allow also tell instructions with infinite rate, which are executed instantaneously whenever encountered by an agent. To deal with this kind of instructions and with procedure calls, we need to define two transitions relations: one instantaneous and one stochastic. These transitions are applied in an interleaved fashion: the instantaneous relation is applied until possible, then one step of the stochastic one is executed. Restrictions on the syntax guarantee that the instantaneous transition is confluent and becomes quiescent after a finite number of steps, hence the stochastic semantics is well defined, see [3] for further details.

We have also developed an interpreter for the language that can be used for running simulations. This interpreter is written in Prolog and uses standard con- straint solver on finite domains as manager for the constraint store, cf. [3] for further details. All simulations of sCCP shown in the paper are performed with it.
