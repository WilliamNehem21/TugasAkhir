synthesized type/behaviour. The map turns out to be a retraction of another map, that is related to invertibility of negative connectives. In this way we formalize the common intuition that focalization of positive connectives is dual to invertibility of negative ones.

In Section 2, we first recall the basic objects of ludics, namely designs, and introduce functionals, which work as morphisms between behaviours. In Section 3, we define synthetic signatures and synthetic connectives, which are the starting point for studying focalizing and inverting functionals, that we first introduce in the untyped setting in Section 4. In Section 5, we move to a (semantically) typed setting and reconsider functionals as functions between behaviours (types). Logical behaviours are described in Section 6 together with internal completeness. Finally, we complete our study in Section 7 providing a ludics account of focalization.

We have attempted to analyze focalization in ludics. More specifically, we have detailed how to synthesize behaviours, and internally described focalization as fo- calizing functionals (designs) from unsynthesized to synthesized behaviours. We have also pointed out that every focalizing design is a retraction of an inverting design, which is related to invertibility of negative connectives. This in a way for- malizes the common intuition that focalization of positives is dual to invertibility of negatives.
