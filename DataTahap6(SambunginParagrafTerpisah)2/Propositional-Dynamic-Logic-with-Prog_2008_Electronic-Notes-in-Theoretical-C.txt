One reason for studying propositional modal logics is to distill the essential logical components of the topic considered, e.g. time, certainty, knowledge, or the effect of imperative programs. Another is to develop practical tools for reasoning and implementation. Decidability, preferably of manageable complexity, is central to the second goal, but not to the first. Adding program quantifiers to PDL is of interest as a powerful conceptual framework. Its complexity, however, is on par with full second order logic, far exceeding other propositional formalisms.
