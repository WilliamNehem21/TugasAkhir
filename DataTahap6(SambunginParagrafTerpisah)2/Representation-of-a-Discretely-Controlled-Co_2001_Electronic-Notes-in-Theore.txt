In this paper, we extend this formalism to treat continuous systems. To do this, the continuous variables with their first- and second-order derivatives will be introduced. Using these variables, we can analyze and verify programs that control discretely certain continuously physical or other external systems.

Section 2 shows the formal system and the semantics of TA, the original version of which can be found in [8]. A vehicle control system is then intro- duced and analyzed in Section 3. In this example, we consider the situation of a car merging with traffic at a T junction. We formulate this problem, then formally analyze and verify the conditions under which the merging car does not crash into others.
