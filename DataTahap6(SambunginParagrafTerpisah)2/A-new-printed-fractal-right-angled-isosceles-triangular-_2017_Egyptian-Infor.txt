In this paper we have added a notch to ground plane and then have made the patch fractured, Koch snowflake design is made in this case. With single iteration better gain, return loss, and omnidirectional radiation pattern are achieved. This small size antenna is a good choice for use in the following ranges UWB, PCS, WLAN, WiFi, and WiMAX.

The values of the antenna used are as follows: Wsub = 3.2 cm,  Lsub = 2.2 cm,  a = 2 cm,  Lf = 0.5 cm, Wf = 0.6 cm, Ls1 = 0.025 cm, WS1 = 0.08 cm, Lgnd = 0.2 cm, x = 0.2 cm.

This section discusses the antenna with variations in its design parameters, and the outcomes are obtained by simulating it on CST Microwave Studio Tool. Return loss, gain, bandwidth and radiation pattern are measured. The output criterion of the designed antenna is considered by modifying one design parameter at a time and adjusting the remaining.
