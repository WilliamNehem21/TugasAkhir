We now briefly discuss the motivations for the present work. We rely on a standard Unified Modelling Language (UML) to use formal methods in the software production process. The challenges we approach in this task are the definition of techniques to extract specifications into process calculi from the possibly excessive or incomplete information in the UML description. The final goal is to have a design environment in which the user only interacts with UML in order to perform formal analysis of his/her applications.

In our translation information about branching points will be obtained from state diagrams which describe behaviour of single objects. We restrict a state diagram on a set of transitions representing communications and call it a restricted state diagram. We can talk about branching point for a restricted state diagram if for a given state we have outgoing transitions corresponding to more then one set of branching messages. A skeleton of a state diagram is a restriction of a restricted state diagram on a set of transitions which are belong to some branching point.
