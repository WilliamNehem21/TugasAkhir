It is not difficult to notice that the sets of test constructors shown in Defini- tion 4.2 are related to modal constructors from the BNF grammars shown in Definition 2.2. This is not a coincidence, and indeed the modal logics from Definition 2.2 inspired Definitions 4.1-4.3. This subsection is devoted to giving a formal correspondence between these definitions.
