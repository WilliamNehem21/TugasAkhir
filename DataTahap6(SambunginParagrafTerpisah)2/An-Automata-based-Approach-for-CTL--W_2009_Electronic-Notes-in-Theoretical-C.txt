In model-checking, temporal logics are commonly used to specify properties on symbolic representations of computing systems. The atomic formulas of these logics are usually propositional variables whose truth value depends on the states of the symbolic system. This allows to specify properties on these states but not on the data that can be used in some models s.t. clocks, counters, strings. . . To overcome this problem, several extensions of the linear-time logic LTL with constraints on the data have been considered in the literature [19,2,14]. However, less results are known about their branching-time extensions.

Example 3.1 There are different methods to define such symbolic valuation ab- stractions. A famous one is the region abstraction of timed automata [1]. Several works about extensions of LTL over concrete domains also relies on symbolic val- uation abstractions [2,7,3]. In most of them the symbolic valuations are described by sets of constraints.
