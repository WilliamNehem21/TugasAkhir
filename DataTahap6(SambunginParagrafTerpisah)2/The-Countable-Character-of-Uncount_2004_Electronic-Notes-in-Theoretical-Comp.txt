It is interesting to note that the results in this paper have no pendant in the finite case. In fact, in the finite case, the following is still a conjecture (see DeVos, Johnson and Seymour [5]) even if, in the infinite case (i.e., the case where a and b are infinite), it is a weakening of Proposition 4.8.

cardinality is odd (resp. even). A bond is non-empty cut which is minimal with respect to inclusion. Observe that a cut [A, A]G of a connected graph G is a bond if and only if both A and A are connected.
