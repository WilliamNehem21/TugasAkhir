The expected operating periods of real systems (e.g. oil and gas production networks) can be many years, the number of sources of flow (the oil production wells) may reach hundreds, and the components may number thousands. In addition, to optimise production performance, a large number of alternative design layouts must be analysed in a short period of time.

The momentary output of the system stochastically pruned with probabilities pk(t) at time t, is denoted by QP (t). The expected value of the momentary outputs QP (t) i = 1, 2, ..., n of n stochastically pruned systems (with probabilities pk(t)) is

The expected value of the momentary maximum throughput flow is obtained by dividing the accumulated in the variable SumMomentFlows to the number of stochastically pruned systems. At the end of each simulation trial, the flow ca- pacities of all failed components are restored to their original levels. The proposed algorithm is very simple, very efficient and avoids building a discrete-event simulator for revealing the production availability.

A copy/paste function has been provided, for quickly transferring the parameters from one edge/node to another edge/node. Functions for zooming, panning, auto- arranging, saving and loading of flow networks have also been provided. Attributes of edges and nodes can be viewed and listed on the screen. Nodes and edges can be easily deleted and added to the network, in order to achieve quickly the desired topology.

nents, spare capacity, etc.) make the throughput flow least sensitive to component failures. An important application of the fast production availability algorithm and the developed software tool is in comparing quickly the performance of competing network topologies and selecting the topology with the best performance.
