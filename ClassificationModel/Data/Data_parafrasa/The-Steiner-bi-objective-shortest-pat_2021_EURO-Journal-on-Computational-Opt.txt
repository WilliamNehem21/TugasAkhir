This new model introduces important research opportunities which have been receiving increased attention in recent years (e.g., lai et al. 2016, letchford et al. 2014, huang et al. 2017, ben ticha et al. 2017). Among these opportunities, it raises inquiries about the feasibility of computing the multigraph. It is evident that the arc multiset and their weights cannot be derived by solving simple shortest path problems. The objective of the steiner multi-objective shortest path problem is to address this challenge.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the relevant literature, Section 3 formally introduces the steiner bspp and essential notation, and reports fundamental properties that will be beneficial for the remainder of the paper. In Section 4, our solution method is described. Section 5 proposes enhancements for when the problem is approached in the context of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (vrptw). Finally, Section 6 presents numerical results.

In the context of the one-to-all bspp, the literature employs two main label selection heuristics. In a node-selection strategy (e.g., Brumbaugh-Smith and Shier 1989), all labels representing paths ending at the same node are selected and extended to all successors of this node.

As previously mentioned, this work is driven by the computation of multigraph data within the realm of vehicle routing problems. When two attributes (e.g., time and distance) are present, it generally entails additional constraints on routes. For instance, in the vrptw, time windows restrict customer visit times. These constraints can be utilized in the computation, as demonstrated in the context of the vrptw.

As a result of the initial enhancement, label keys expand more rapidly during the labeling process. The second enhancement tightens the stopping condition, which, along with the first enhancement, limits the number of labels generated during the search. The third enhancement is conducted during preprocessing and facilitates the reduction of the graph's size.

Four road networks (DC, DE, RI, and AK) were extracted by Schultes (2005) from the US Census and correspond to Washington D.C., Delaware, Rhode Island, and Alaska, respectively. In these networks, each road segment is provided with distance and travel time. It is important to note that the road networks in the original data are undirected, and we transformed them into directed networks by duplicating all arcs.

Focused on the scenario of urban deliveries from a distant depot, all but one terminal are randomly selected in the center of the network (a quarter of the network's area). The remaining terminal is randomly chosen near the southwest corner of the network, representing the standard situation for urban deliveries from a distant depot.
