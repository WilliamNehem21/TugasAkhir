In the field of software engineering, the utilization of software components is a well-established approach that presents challenges related to adapting these components dynamically to meet specific user demands. Since these components are designed for broad use, they may incorporate functionalities that do not precisely align with the requirements of individual users.

To address this issue, we propose utilizing moderators to adapt the coordination between components. Moderators are specialized coordination components that manage interactions using petri nets to describe and formalize these interactions. Specifically, we investigate the dynamic adaptation of coordination rules through transformations of the petri nets used to describe a moderator.

Software reuse has long been a fundamental concern in software engineering, leading to the emergence of the notions of interface and modularity, culminating in the concept of software components. The process of composing and assembling components forms the core of software architectures, facilitated by maintaining invariant relationships among the assembled components. The notion of interface abstracts and encapsulates the implementation of components. Our approach to adaptation of coordination builds on this process, aiming to alter the behavior of coordinated components while preserving the invariant contract that binds them together. Specifically, a participant may request the moderator of a conversation to deviate from the prescribed behavioral rules of the protocol in order to adapt to a specific runtime context, with the assurance that the conversation's objectives can still be achieved.

Subsequently, we outline the functionality and properties of coordination components, define adaptations and the associated safety property, and elucidate how this approach can be demonstrated through an e-learning case study.

The primary benefit of coordinating interactions through protocols is to ensure efficiency and predictability with regards to the accomplishment of tasks. However, it is crucial for the rules of a protocol to be adhered to by all participants in order to guarantee that the common objectives of the protocol will be attained. This enforcement of protocol rules is achieved by dissociating participant interventions in a conversation from the task of verifying whether these interventions abide by the protocol rules, which is the responsibility of the moderator.

We propose modeling the control structure of moderators using the petri net formalism, with communication places representing input and output for messages between the moderator and the participants. A high-level petri net formalism is used to process data carried by tokens, allowing the moderator to manage dedicated threads of control for each participant and keep track of their state within the conversation. Applying the petri net formalism to define protocol behavioral rules enables the use of petri net theory techniques and tools to analyze behavioral properties.

We also set the constraint that the petri net of a protocol is a bounded petri net, ensuring a finite number of reachable tokens from the initial marking. This limitation does not impose a restriction on the number of messages a component can send, but it ensures that the moderator can only process a finite number of these messages simultaneously. Additionally, we do not consider protocols that could coordinate an unbounded number of components simultaneously.

We then delve into the precise definition of adaptations within this setting, considering the properties that adaptations should uphold to maintain conversation consistency in accordance with the initial coordination rules, and outlining how these dynamic adaptations can be managed and implemented.

Furthermore, we discuss the concept of safety and its relationship to the broader notion of conformance in labelled transition systems. We posit that an adaptation of a coordination protocol is safe if the entire adapted system, comprising the adapted moderator and the participants, conforms to the non-adapted system. Safety is thus a specialized form of conformance that characterizes conformant adaptations specific to the moderator component.

Finally, we discuss the validation of the safety of an adaptation, noting that it involves a cost as it requires exhaustive exploration of the system state space. However, we suggest that this validation can benefit from advancements in conformance checking, potentially constraining petri net modifications to ensure scalable analysis according to the size of the petri net.
