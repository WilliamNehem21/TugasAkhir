Recent research in the field of embedded system design has proposed a significant shift in the process, advocating for modeling major functionalities at a high level before mapping them to specific technologies such as DSP or ASIC. This modeling is achieved through a set of formalisms encompassing various communication, concurrency, and computation schemes. By decoupling functionality from implementation, tools like Ptolemy II aim to streamline the system design process and expedite the generation of verified designs by utilizing modularity and abstraction. Additionally, automated tools have been successful in generating implementations directly from these high-level models in specific cases.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of how the syntax and semantics of a hardware description language are specified in Maude. Section 3 details the framework for specifying and trace checking co-designs and offers two in-depth case studies as illustrations. Section 4 discusses related work, while Section 5 presents conclusions.

Synchronous digital circuits must adhere to two distinct notions of execution order. Firstly, during each clock cycle, the structure of the combinational network must be respected, and secondly, latches should adhere to a global clock and update simultaneously.

Effective verification of a co-design project should encompass the interactions between hardware and software to ensure system-wide correctness and validate the engineering decisions made during partitioning. It is essential to validate the co-design decisions post-implementation to guide potential redesign efforts. Creating a Maude specification for the semantics of an HDL like ABEL is a foundational step in facilitating co-verification. The robust modeling capabilities of rewriting logic, particularly in Maude, enable the integration of both hardware and software components into a unified mathematical framework, supporting the specification of system properties in a natural language and promoting modular verification efforts.

When attempting to schedule instructions for high performance, an error in our approach resulted in incorrect computations, which was detected and rectified. Additionally, a load-use dependency unintentionally created a pipeline stall, which was promptly identified and resolved.

In the embedded design space, there are industrial tools that allow hardware/software debugging, such as Xilinx EDK, which permits software debugging with GDB and scoping of internal hardware signals when a breakpoint is triggered. However, formal analysis is not supported by these debugging tools.

Lastly, specifying and verifying the properties related to hardware/software interactions and modeling the environments in which embedded systems operate are crucial tasks that should be undertaken together. Although the paper has addressed some real-time and performance issues in the case studies, a comprehensive modeling of environments is beyond its scope. The natural approach for modeling such environments involves viewing embedded systems as real-time, hybrid, and possibly stochastic systems, implying the use of suitable techniques and tools like real-time Maude and probabilistic rewrite theories. This approach should enable the formal specification and analysis of mechanical and sensing interfaces found in control systems.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of integrating hardware and software in the verification process and highlights the need for comprehensive modeling of embedded system environments.
