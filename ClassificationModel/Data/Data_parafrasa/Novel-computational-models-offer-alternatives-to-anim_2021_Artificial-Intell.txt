The appropriate classification of chemicals used in various products such as cosmetics, drugs, pesticides, and household items is essential to ensure eye safety. Eye irritation or corrosion is characterized by damage to cell membranes, coagulation, saponification, and chemical reactivity, all of which occur upon contact between a chemical and the ocular surface (cornea and conjunctiva).

Various in vitro methods have been developed for identifying ocular corrosives or severe irritants, using alternative biological materials such as rabbit corneal cells, isolated bovine corneas, and a monolayer of madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Additionally, three-dimensional human tissue models like the reconstructed human cornea-like epithelium (RhCE) test and the vitrigel-eye irritancy test have been approved for identifying substances not classified for ocular irritation. However, these tests may provide differing coverage of the biology relevant to eye irritation and corrosion compared to human ocular anatomy and physiology.

Computational models, particularly quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, offer a fast and cost-effective means of obtaining reliable predictions for ocular toxicity based on molecular features. These models typically utilize machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict the outcome of testing new compounds in specific assays. However, modeling toxicity is complex, and the quality and volume of the training data are crucial for the trustworthiness of the models.

A dataset of 3,547 compounds was compiled, with 2,401 classified as non-irritant/non-corrosive, 937 as irritant, and 209 as corrosive. Multiclass models were generated using the Global Harmonized System (GHS) classification for 1,248 compounds. The dataset was carefully curated and standardized before calculating molecular descriptors. Descriptors with high correlation and invariant descriptors were removed.

Ensemble decision tree learning algorithm (RF) and instance-based learning process (MUDRA) were used for model generation. Models were validated using a 5-fold external cross-validation procedure, and the predictive power of the models was demonstrated using well-known compounds with severe effects on the human eye.

Additionally, the models were applied to predict the effects of compounds from the COSING database and the Inactive Ingredients Database (IID) on eye irritation and corrosion, identifying potential eye irritants and corrosive compounds.

Finally, the study referenced a previous evaluation of in silico models for ocular irritation and the development of a knowledge-based framework to improve the prediction of severe irritation, highlighting the continuing efforts in this field.
