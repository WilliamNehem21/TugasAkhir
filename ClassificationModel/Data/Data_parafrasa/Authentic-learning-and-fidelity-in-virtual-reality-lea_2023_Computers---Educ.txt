This paper presents a study in which graduate students engaged in learning activities to practice specific skills, such as conducting patient interviews, within a virtual reality learning environment (VRLE). The study examines the collaborative nature and authentic design of the learning experience, based on situated learning theory, which emphasizes learning in authentic contexts. The paper discusses the importance of authenticity, fidelity, and motivation in VRLE, as well as the learning outcomes for the activities and the research methodology employed.

The study emphasizes the significance of an authentic learning environment that reflects real-world tasks and situations. It highlights the pivotal role of replicating real-world complexities in maximizing memory recall and skill transfer. The paper further discusses the concepts of functional and fidelity in designing a realistic learning environment, stressing the importance of closely replicating real-life contexts for effective learning.

The paper suggests that the authenticity of a VRLE impacts cognitive, affective, and social learning processes, underscoring the need to study how media and technology features influence learning in such environments. Furthermore, the role of learner motivation, satisfaction, and enjoyment in VRLE is addressed, emphasizing the impact of authentic learning environments on learner engagement.

The study details the VRLE used to train students in diagnosing mental health issues and the specific skills required for conducting diagnostic interviews. It also discusses the learning outcomes for the VRLE activities, including the administration of assessments and the research design, which combines qualitative and quantitative approaches.

A quantitative analysis was conducted using cognitive and affective scores to compare confidence levels after different learning activities, and the results indicate that the VR-based activity was at par with regular learning activities in developing confidence for learning transfer. The findings also reiterate the perceived realism and authenticity of the VR-based learning activity and environment, supported by both qualitative and quantitative data.

The paper discusses the implications of the study's findings, acknowledging some limitations, including the need for further research to establish a theoretical foundation for the research questions and to generalize the results. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of addressing technology challenges and providing adequate onboarding to the VR platform for learners.

In conclusion, the study demonstrates the benefits of an authentic VRLE in enhancing the learning process and highlights the need for continued research and development in this area to improve technological performance and optimize learning experiences in VR environments.
