This academic paper suggests that the current manual and ad-hoc process for verifying health assessment tools leads to reduced applicability and effectiveness of these tools. To address this issue, the paper proposes the use of a formal approach for the verification of health assessment tools. By applying a methodology originally designed for the verification of use cases to a specific medical standardization guideline, the paper demonstrates that formal verification of medical artifacts can be a cost-effective mechanism to validate and qualify health approaches.

The research focuses on the verification of a standardization guideline for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a disease characterized by skin ulcers caused by parasites. The treatment of CL is challenging due to the lack of effective drugs, high toxicity of available drugs, and a scarcity of cost-effectiveness studies. The paper discusses the implications of using formal methods to verify the CL treatment guideline, showcasing how this approach can identify issues that might otherwise remain undetected and compromise the applicability of the health tool.

The paper is organized as follows: it presents a case study of cutaneous leishmaniasis, provides an overview of the graph transformation-based verification methodology, details the application of the methodology to the health standardization guideline and discusses the issues raised during the verification process, and finally, it discusses the results of the proposed approach.

The verification methodology used in the study is based on graph transformations (GT) and involves constructing a model using entities and actions described in the contents of a use case. This model is then analyzed to detect inconsistencies and ambiguities. The paper also introduces the formalism of graph transformations, describing graph rules and the application of rules to a graph, and provides examples of graphs and rules.

The guidelines for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis consist of instructions that must be followed by a physician. The dense and non-standardized nature of the original text prompted the researchers to translate the document into a typical use case notation, allowing for clearer identification of pre and post conditions, and breaking down multiple actions within a single step into more focused steps.

The paper concludes by presenting the application of the GT-based verification methodology to a medical standardization guideline, highlighting the promising results in identifying and addressing potential problems that could compromise the guideline's applicability. The authors emphasize the versatility of this methodology, suggesting its potential application in fields beyond software engineering.
