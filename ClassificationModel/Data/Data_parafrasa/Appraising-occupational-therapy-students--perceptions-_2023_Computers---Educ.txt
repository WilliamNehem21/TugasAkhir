In the realm of medical education, researchers have explored the potential of virtual reality (VR) to instruct learners on topics such as gastrointestinal endoscopy, anatomy education, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. While studies indicate that the lack of physical feedback limits VR's utility for developing hands-on skills, evidence suggests that a blended learning approach leveraging VR can facilitate foundational anatomy knowledge, clinical reasoning skills, empathy for the patient experience, and preparation for clinical placements with real patients.

The objective of our study was to assess the feasibility and benefits of various VR approaches for educational content and software. To achieve this, our research team developed and obtained a series of educational VR modules. Upon consultation with VR experts, software creators, and fellow researchers, we selected four distinct VR educational modules for the study, based on convenience, feasibility, and long-term potential.

The study participants consisted of students enrolled in the Master of Occupational Therapy (MScOT) program at the University of Toronto. To minimize bias, recruitment and communication were managed by a research team member not involved in teaching the students at the time. Participants were informed that their involvement in the study would not affect their academic standing and were given the opportunity to ask questions before signing up for the VR research study.

A total of 23 MScOT students took part in the study. They tested each of the four VR modules and completed a virtual module questionnaire after using each module. The questionnaire comprised fifteen statements on which participants ranked their perceptions using a five-point Likert scale. Data collection was conducted using Microsoft Forms.

The findings from the individual module questionnaires indicated a strong preference for interactive and immersive learning modules. Participants expressed that the interactive and immersive nature of VR learning provided added value and a safe environment for practicing clinical skills. Moreover, they enjoyed learning with the new technology. The use of head-mounted displays (HMDs) such as the Oculus and Hololens was particularly well-received, as they were found to enhance engagement and motivation to learn.

However, it was noted that the Google Cardboard headset was not as engaging as the other VR modes. Participants also reported uncertainty about adjusting to the technology or having the necessary skills to learn the software.

The study's limitations included a small sample size and potential response bias, as participants who chose to take part may have had a preexisting interest or experience with VR technology. Additionally, the study's mixed use of technology and pedagogies limited its ability to address the impact on learning. Lastly, not all participants completed the final survey, which may have affected the reliability of the conclusions.

In conclusion, while the study supports the potential of VR as a pedagogical tool in medical education, further research is needed to assess its effectiveness compared to traditional methods, and to explore its wider implications.
