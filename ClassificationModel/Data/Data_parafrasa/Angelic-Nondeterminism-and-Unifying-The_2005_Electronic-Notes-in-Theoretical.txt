The concept of angelic nondeterminism is commonly found in unified languages of refinement calculi and concurrent constraint programming languages. In program development, it is manifested through choice constructs that are made to ensure success, if possible. This is often reflected in programming languages through the use of backtracking. The paper explores the concept of angelic nondeterminism within a language designed for defining proof tactics.

The study of angelic nondeterminism has extensively used weakest precondition semantics, with previous research establishing the limitations of the utp relational model in capturing angelic and demonic nondeterminism. The paper introduces a set-based relational model for utp and proposes a predicate transformer model, providing insights into the utp model and offering guidance on the use of binary multirelations for utp. Based on this, a utp theory for angelic nondeterminism is proposed.

The paper also presents an overview of unifying theories of programming, discusses set-based relational and predicate transformer models for utp, enriches the utp with a theory to address angelic and demonic nondeterminism, and provides conclusions and suggestions for future work.

A utp theory characterized by the alphabet including "ok" and "ok'", as well as the healthiness conditions "h1" and "h2" is developed. Furthermore, the paper presents a theory for angelic (and demonic) nondeterminism and establishes a model based on binary multirelations that can capture both types of nondeterminism.

Additionally, the paper discusses the transformation of utp relations into set-based relations and vice versa, and introduces a model of nontermination based on observational variables. Furthermore, the paper presents an isomorphism between predicate transformers and relational models, and describes how it is possible to capture angelic choice using the lattice of monotonic predicate transformers.

The paper also touches on the complexity of defining certain operators in the utp model, emphasizes the need for a more elaborate relational model to capture angelic nondeterminism, and establishes the connection between set-based relations and universally conjunctive predicate transformers. Finally, the paper presents a relational model capable of capturing both angelic and demonic nondeterminism, and outlines its use in an integrated framework covering concurrency and higher-order programming.
