The wireless data gateway collects raw data from position-assistant terminals, analyzes it, calculates the location of the mobile positioning device using different time of arrival (DTOA) and trilateration, and sends the result to the data center. The gateway determines the location of the mobile device when it receives packets from four or more positioning-assistant terminals with the same timestamp, and then stores this information in the data center to ensure location service reliability.

The data center receives location data from the wireless data gateway using a wired cable and utilizes databases that support Oracle, SQL Server, and DB2. It offers web services interfaces to monitoring terminals, providing specific interfaces to accommodate various monitoring terminals using a standard three-layer architecture in the development of web services.

The monitoring terminal displays the building structure during a fire and shows the location of all firemen within the structure, aiding first responders in planning rescue actions. Leveraging location, graphic, database, and software application technologies, the monitoring terminal offers real-time positioning, emergency alarm, and historical movement trace services.

In the event of an emergency, a mobile positioning device sends out an SOS signal, which is received by the wireless data gateway. Upon receiving an alarm packet, the data center alerts all connected monitoring terminals, enabling prompt responses by fire command centers or headquarters. Additionally, the system triggers an alarm if a mobile positioning device remains stationary for a specified period.

The system helps locate and reduce the risks for firemen during rescue activities. If a fireman becomes immobilized, the headquarters can promptly execute rescue operations with the aid of the system's location services.

This paper presents a comprehensive location scenario for building fire rescue by examining current location technology and its application. It discusses five key components: mobile positioning device, positioning-assistant terminal, wireless data gateway, data center, and monitoring terminal, which together form a wireless network utilizing short waveforms and IEEE standards for data transmission. The data center and monitoring terminal can be hosted on the same computer server.
