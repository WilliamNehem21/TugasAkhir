A method for reducing symmetries on-the-fly by utilizing the lexicographic order of metarepresentations of maude terms is introduced. Additionally, a technique using supplementary data to verify strong properties not directly expressible in propositional temporal logic is presented. Both techniques involve straightforward transformations of rewrite theories. These methods are applied to verify a strong-consistency property of a client-server protocol, which is a simplified version of the chain-replication protocol.

The approach involves a built-in total order on metarepresentations of terms, enabling manipulation of these metarepresentations to construct the least element of the orbit of a state with respect to the lexicographic order on metarepresentations. This results in space reductions during execution, searches, and model checking of the specification.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background on Maude, particularly related to object-based specifications. Section 3 presents the specification of the simplified chain-replication protocol. Section 4 discusses the on-the-fly symmetry reduction technique and its application to the protocol. Section 5 introduces and describes a technique using auxiliary data to verify the strong-consistency property of the protocol. The paper concludes with Section 6.

The size of the state space was determined using the search command in the Maude system, which allows for exploration of the state space in various ways. It returns all states (for finite state spaces), states satisfying a specified property, or the first n states it finds for a specified n, along with the number of states examined in obtaining the result.

Most distributed systems include identical components, and exploiting symmetry in systems with identical components is discussed in the paper. The effect of permuting indices on the rules of the specification is examined, particularly for the client-server protocol where permutations on indices induce automorphisms on states.

Additionally, the paper presents specialized definitions for specifications that require different treatment of terms representing indices. For example, the specification of the client-server protocol incorporates permutations of indices and counters, with the property of interest being more complex and not directly expressible in linear temporal logic. To address this, the specification from Section 3 is transformed to facilitate verification of this property.

In summary, the paper outlines an on-the-fly symmetry reduction technique that constructs a representative of a state's orbit based on the lexicographic order of metarepresentations of terms. It also introduces a technique using auxiliary data to verify strong properties that are not directly expressible in propositional linear temporal logic. These techniques enabled the verification of a strong-consistency property for different instances of a simplified chain-replication protocol, albeit at the cost of a larger state space.
