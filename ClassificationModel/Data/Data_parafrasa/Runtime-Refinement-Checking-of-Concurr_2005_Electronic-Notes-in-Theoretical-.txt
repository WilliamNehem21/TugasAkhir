The paper introduces the use of state transition systems to provide semantics for concurrent data structure implementations and specifications. It describes the formalization of state transition systems and the concept of refinement in Section 2 and presents a runtime verification technique for a concurrent multiset implementation in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the technique for checking refinement at runtime, while Section 6 covers related work and Section 7 concludes the paper.

The focus of the paper is on concurrent implementations of data structures written in object-oriented languages, where the data structure offers multiple publicly accessible operations, each implemented as a method. The paper introduces the concept of public methods and delineates the sets of thread identifiers representing application threads and worker threads involved in the data structure operations.

The paper explains the concept of atomic runs, which are defined as concatenations of fragments of a run, where only one application thread performs actions within each fragment. It also introduces the idea of deterministic atomic state transition systems, where runs with the same first state and signature have the same last state, ensuring that every trace is produced by a unique run.

The paper describes the complexities of refining the implementation of concurrent data structures to match their specifications, particularly illustrating the challenges in verifying refinement at runtime. It discusses the need for additional validation of refinement and presents the use of commit points in the implementation as a means of efficient runtime checking. The paper also highlights the potential for design improvements and the reuse of logging mechanisms from distributed systems for the purpose of verification.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the limitations and challenges in checking refinement at runtime, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive criterion for runtime checking. It suggests the use of auxiliary variables and stronger correctness criteria to enhance runtime verification and highlights the potential of such criteria to expose errors and provide early warnings.

Overall, the paper underscores the importance of runtime checking of refinement in concurrent data structure implementations and specifications, and presents various techniques and challenges associated with this verification approach.
