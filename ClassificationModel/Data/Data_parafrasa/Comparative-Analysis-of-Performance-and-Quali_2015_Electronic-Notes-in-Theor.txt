The use of fire has brought significant benefits to humanity, but instances of uncontrolled wildfires burning large areas of vegetation around the world have been observed. This paper discusses Evolutionary Statistical Systems (ESS), which has two operational versions and one under development. The first version uses a unique population and parallel evaluation, while the second version increases parallelism with multiple populations and migration. The under development version uses differential evolution as an optimization method, known as Differential Evolutionary Statistical System (DESS).

The paper provides a brief description and classification of the implemented versions of ESS, followed by a detailed description of how ESS and ESS-IM operate. It also presents the experiments conducted for a comparative study, describes the work environment, and presents the results, concluding with future work.

Evolutionary metaheuristics are optimizing algorithms that use a set of candidate solutions (population) to create new search points within a solution space. These methods are inspired by natural evolution theory and have been successfully applied in various scientific areas.

ESS operates on a master/worker model, where the master process distributes individuals to the workers for parallel fitness evaluation. In ESS-IM, there are two levels: a monitor node controls the prediction process in level 1, while level 2 follows a master/worker model with a master node and n workers. Both ESS and ESS-IM are based on parallel evolutionary algorithms and exhibit non-deterministic behavior due to the stochastically generated seeds for individual generation.

The paper discusses the threats to the validity of the empirical study and how they were addressed, particularly emphasizing the need for a fair comparison of the methods. The study conducted 30 runs for each experiment with each method to ensure reliable conclusions. Parameter settings for both methods were standardized to avoid bias.

The results show that the new implementation of ESS-IM in CS-monitor-1 mode significantly improves the quality of prediction but at the expense of decreased speed-up compared to other operation modes. Future studies will focus on optimizing computational resources to improve performance gains in the mode that provides the best quality of prediction. Additionally, other metaheuristics like DESS will be evaluated as part of future work.
