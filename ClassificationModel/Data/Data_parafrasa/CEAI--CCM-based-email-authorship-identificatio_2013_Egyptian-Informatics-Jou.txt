Computer mediated communication (CMC) refers to written communication conducted using computers and is widely used, with email being one of the most prominent forms of CMC. Other types of CMC include online messages, blogs, forums, and instant messaging services. Email in particular has remained a key mode of written communication, especially in recent decades, due to its speed and asynchronous nature, making it a preferred method of communication for a broad spectrum of internet-connected users. Its versatile usage ranges from formal to informal communication, with email serving as a significant source of written communication. Notably, the use of email for criminal activities has been observed, prompting the need for systems to identify individuals using computer technology for illegal purposes.

As part of authorship analysis, a mapping function is defined over a set of features, emails, and authors, wherein unique features are extracted from each author's emails during training, and a model is constructed. During testing, a test email is compared to the features of all users and assigned an author with the closest similarity. This process is detailed in section 3 and exemplified using algorithms.

Authorship analysis entails identifying the true author of a text based on their writing style, utilizing linguistic techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning. The application of authorship analysis techniques to software forensics involves authorship identification, authorship characterization, and similarity detection.

Historically, authorship analysis research dates back to early investigations comparing the writing styles of English authors. A study conducted by De Vel et al. considered the email authorship as a topic authorship categorization problem, initially using a small corpus of emails from a newsgroup, resulting in promising outcomes. Further surveys and analyses have explored the use of stylometric features for authorship attribution methods.

Zheng et al. presented a framework for authorship identification in online messages, extracting various writing style features and employing a machine learning classification algorithm, which achieved high accuracy. Yule's work identified sentence length and vocabulary richness as valuable features for authorship identification, which are still considered relevant today.

In addition to baseline features, unique stylometric features found within individual writing styles, such as ending punctuation marks, have been observed to play a role in authorship identification. Furthermore, the extraction and selection of features are crucial steps in preparing data for authorship identification tasks, as demonstrated through algorithms and feature extraction procedures. Evaluation criteria, such as stratified 10fold cross-validation, are employed to assess the accuracy of authorship identification methods.

Overall, research in authorship analysis continues to explore and refine methods for identifying and attributing authorship based on writing style, leveraging a range of linguistic, statistical, and machine learning techniques to address the complexities of authorship identification in various textual contexts.
