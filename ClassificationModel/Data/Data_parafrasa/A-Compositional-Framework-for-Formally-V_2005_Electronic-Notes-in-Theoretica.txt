This paper introduces a tool-supported framework for demonstrating that the combination of behaviors of individual parts of a complex system ensures a desired global property of the entire system. The framework includes a compositional inference rule formally introduced and encoded in the logic of the PVS theorem prover. The paper also discusses methodological considerations for using the inference rule, and demonstrates its application by proving a meaningful property of a simple but significant control system.

The framework, called Trio, is illustrated using a simple example involving a reservoir and a controller. It presents a compositional inference rule for the Trio language, specifically considering compositional specifications following the rely/guarantee paradigm. This rule is used to derive formal properties of a composite system introduced earlier in the paper.

To establish formal semantics for rely/guarantee specifications, the paper introduces a new temporal operator within the logic of the PVS theorem prover. The encoding process involves mapping the modular features of Trio onto the PVS language and developing strategies to automate the proof-conduction of Trio specifications in PVS.

Each Trio class is mapped onto a PVS theory, with genericity naturally translating from Trio to PVS. However, the paper notes that certain features of the Trio language, such as inheritance and visibility management, cannot be accurately translated into corresponding PVS constructs. It suggests that front-end tools should be developed to facilitate the proper translation of these features from Trio to PVS.

The paper also describes a two-step refinement process used to specify the behavior of the reservoir system, leveraging Trio inheritance mechanisms. Furthermore, it explains how assumptions made in the Trio language must be proved from the formulas of other components when composing classes with other modules.

In summary, the paper presents a compositional, tool-supported framework for the Trio specification language, based on an inference rule encoded into the PVS theorem prover. The framework is demonstrated through an example of a control system, showcasing the application of the compositional inference rule and the supporting strategies developed for the PVS-based tool.
