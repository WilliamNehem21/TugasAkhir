The detection of pedestrians has broad applications in various fields such as autonomous driving, intelligent monitoring, and robotics, and has long been a focal point in the domain of computer vision. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in pedestrian detection technology due to the evolution of deep learning and the introduction of numerous large pedestrian datasets. These developments have notably enhanced detection accuracy and speed. However, contemporary pedestrian detection methods still struggle to match human performance, particularly when addressing challenges like occlusion and scale variations. Consequently, solving the issues of occlusion and scale is a crucial objective in pedestrian detection research.

This paper aims to review the progress in pedestrian detection research, focusing on methods for calculating the confidence of bounding boxes in regression and utilizing multiple convolution layers with different scales to improve multi-scale object detection and enhance accuracy. Notably, the integration of convolutional neural networks (CNN) into object detection, as exemplified by the introduction of R-CNN by Ross Girshick et al. in 2014, has been pivotal. Subsequent developments, such as the introduction of the region proposal network (RPN) in 2015, and the adoption of deep learning technologies in methods like Faster R-CNN, MSCNN, YOLOv4, CSP, and SAF-RCNN, have further advanced pedestrian detection capabilities. These newer approaches leverage deep features, providing superior generalization ability and robustness compared to hand-designed features.

The varied poses and appearances of pedestrians, as influenced by clothing and environmental factors, pose a significant challenge to pedestrian detection. Additionally, adverse weather conditions and low-light settings can considerably impede detection accuracy. Moreover, occlusion, whether intra-class among pedestrians or inter-class with other objects, remains a major obstacle to accurate pedestrian detection. Another significant challenge lies in detecting pedestrians of different scales and achieving real-time detection while maintaining high accuracy.

The paper also discusses various pedestrian datasets and evaluation metrics, with a particular focus on occlusion and scale issues and their corresponding solutions. Furthermore, it outlines the evolution of feature descriptors from hand-crafted features to deep features and highlights several recent methods for improving pedestrian detection performance.

To address the complexities of pedestrian detection, recent research has proposed a multitude of innovative methods. These include novel network architectures and modules, attention mechanisms, feature fusion approaches, and context information utilization, among others. Additionally, advancements in detection algorithms, such as YOLOv3-Z, EfficientLiteSet, HAPNet, MB-CSP, and others, have demonstrated promising results in addressing challenges related to multi-scale detection and occlusion in pedestrian detection.

In summary, pedestrian detection research has seen remarkable progress in recent years, driven by the evolution of deep learning technologies and the introduction of innovative methodologies. However, many challenges persist, and ongoing research efforts continue to push the boundaries of pedestrian detection capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in pedestrian detection, offering valuable insights into the key challenges and advancements in this field.
