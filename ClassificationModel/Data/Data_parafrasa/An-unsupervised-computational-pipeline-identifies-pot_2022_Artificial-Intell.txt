To reestablish normal gene expression in genes that are disrupted by a disease, it is essential to identify drugs with molecular signatures that are enriched in disease-related genes. In this study, an inverted gene set enrichment analysis (iGSEA) was conducted using the drug signatures from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) to identify disease-related genes. For each dataset, the normalized enrichment score and p-value were calculated to measure the enrichment magnitude and its statistical significance. The resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to obtain the false discovery rate (FDR). Additionally, an investigation was carried out to assess whether the gene targets of two drugs interact within the human protein-protein interactome. The study aimed to determine whether the drugs exert overlapping exposure (indicating similarity in chemical, biological, functional, and clinical profiles) or complementary exposure (indicating distinct topological and pharmacological characteristics). Complementary exposure is desirable as it suggests that the drugs may synergistically cooperate in treating the disease.

Furthermore, the study involved an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to evaluate whether the identified genes represented the investigated diseases. This analysis aimed to verify if the enriched biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and phenotypes were consistent with existing knowledge.

The impact of a drug on disease was evaluated by examining its effect on the expression of disease-related genes in relevant cell lines. Through iGSEA, a total of 843 significantly enriched drugs for Huntington's disease (HD) and 600 for multiple sclerosis (MS) were identified from the LINCS expression datasets.

However, it should be noted that a small proportion of the drugs proximal to the identified disease-related genes were present in the LINCS database (21.9% for HD and 13.7% for MS), limiting the number of molecules that could be investigated and proposed.

The study also reported specific drugs that showed promise for the treatment of HD, such as selisistat, lisuride, and valproic acid. Additionally, the study presented a comprehensive analysis of drug combinations for HD and MS, identifying numerous potential repurposable drugs and their combinations for both diseases.

It is important to emphasize that while these results are preliminary and require experimental validation, they offer valuable insights that could potentially enhance the management of HD and MS.
