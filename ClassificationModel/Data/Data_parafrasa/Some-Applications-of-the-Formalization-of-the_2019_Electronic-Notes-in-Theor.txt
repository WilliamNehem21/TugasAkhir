The significance of context-free languages in computer language processing and formal language theory cannot be overstated. The pumping lemma for context-free languages, a fundamental tool for demonstrating the existence of non-context-free languages, is a pivotal concept in this domain. In this paper, we present a formalization that extends the pumping lemma to establish the non-context-free nature of several well-known languages. Additionally, we use these results to construct a formal proof of the property that context-free languages are not closed under intersection. Notably, all formalization has been mechanized in the Coq proof assistant.

The findings presented in this work are consequential for several reasons. Firstly, they leverage the previous formalization of the pumping lemma and represent the first languages proven to be non-context-free using a computerized theorem prover. Prior to this, all claims of non-context-free languages were supported by text-based proofs, as typically found in academic literature. Therefore, this work pioneers the application of mathematical formalization in this area. Secondly, the results introduce thought-provoking considerations regarding the conversion of text proofs into formal proofs. Thirdly, they serve as valuable instructional material for teaching the theory of context-free languages within a logical and formal framework, utilizing interactive theorem provers such as Coq.

This work is part of a comprehensive project aimed at formalizing context-free languages and grammars. It began with the formalization of closure properties for context-free grammars, progressed to the formalization of context-free grammar simplification, and culminated in the Chomsky normalization of context-free grammars. The formalization of simplification enabled Chomsky normalization, which in turn facilitated the formalization of the pumping lemma and subsequently led to the results presented here.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the statement and applications of the pumping lemma for context-free languages, while Section 3 discusses the approach adopted for the formalization of languages. Subsequently, Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 respectively present formalizations of three different well-known languages using the discussed approach. Each of these sections includes a text proof of the non-context-free nature of the language, a discussion about the formalization of such a proof, and considerations about the complexity of text and formal proofs. In Section 4, we describe our formalization of the non-closure of context-free languages under intersection, a result built on the formalization described in Section 3.3. Finally, Section 5 presents the concluding remarks.

Furthermore, the paper details the formalizations of specific languages (square, prime, anbncn) and their corresponding proofs, shedding light on the intricacies and challenges encountered during the formalization process. The formal proofs are considerably longer and more complex than their text counterparts due to the need to consider and explicitly address various cases and combinatorial problems.

Overall, the formalization of these languages and their non-context-free nature is a significant achievement, contributing to the advancement of formal language theory and providing invaluable material for educational purposes.
