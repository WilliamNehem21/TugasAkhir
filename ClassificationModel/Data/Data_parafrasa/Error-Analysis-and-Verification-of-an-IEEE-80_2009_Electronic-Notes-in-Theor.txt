In this paper, we utilized Akbarpour's general hierarchical methodology for formally modeling and verifying DSP (digital signal processing) designs. Our objective was to verify an implementation of the IEEE 802.11a physical layer OFDM modem using the HOL theorem prover. The verification process encompassed all levels of abstraction, from real, floating-point, and fixed-point number systems down to register transfer level (RTL) hardware implementation. Both the design specification and implementation were modeled in formal logic, and mathematical theorems were proven to ensure correctness. Notably, we identified a bug in the modulation block, where the implemented constellation deviated from the IEEE standard specification. Additionally, new expressions for round-off error accumulation during number system conversions were derived, and a formal error analysis of the OFDM modem was conducted using HOL.

Section 3 of the paper provides details about the OFDM modem implementation and the verification methodology used. The verification of RTL blocks of the OFDM system is described in Section 4, while Section 5 outlines the error analysis of the OFDM modem and its formalization using HOL. The paper concludes by offering insights into potential future research directions.

Although previous research has explored the design and implementation of the IEEE 802.11a physical layer, notably in the context of OFDM systems, the use of theorem proving for verification has not been extensively studied. For instance, prior work includes the development of a coded OFDM system for telemetry applications and the exploration of error analysis in digital filters and FFT algorithms using different arithmetic systems, including fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic. Traditional mathematical analysis and simulation have also been employed to assess the error in algorithms like FFT and digital filters.

The primary aim of employing formal verification in our study was to detect design bugs. While no bugs were found in the blocks, it was noted that the constellation used in the QAM block did not adhere precisely to the standard. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the use of formal methods in verifying parts of the OFDM RTL blocks, acknowledging the impracticality of verifying the entire design using theorem-proving tools due to the presence of numerous IP blocks.

Furthermore, the paper presents a comprehensive analysis of rounding errors in the OFDM design across different number domains, supported by the formalization of real and imaginary parts of FFT-IFFT expansion and the derivation of theorems related to arithmetic operations. By leveraging established theories such as realtheory, booltheory, ieeetheory, floattheory, fxptheory, and wordtheory, the paper substantiates a strong relationship between mathematical models and their formal counterparts.

Moreover, the paper addresses concerns related to security and soundness in HOL theorem proving, emphasizing the tool's ability to validate the type of terms and functions entered into the system and mitigate the risk of defining incorrect theorems. The use of an oracle mechanism is discussed as a means to enable arbitrary formulas to become elements of the "thm" type, with tags attached to theorems to track their origins and ensure soundness.

In summary, this paper demonstrates the application of formal verification techniques, specifically theorem proving, in verifying an implementation of an OFDM modem based on the IEEE 802.11a standard for wireless communication. The study focused on formally modeling and verifying specific RTL blocks within the OFDM design, resulting in the identification of a bug in the QAM modulation block.
