While machine intelligence has not yet achieved the full range of cognitive capabilities of human brains, it is feasible to separate the task of driving from cognitive activities and delegate certain low-level, complex, and long-lasting cognitive functions to machines by simulating brain processes. The ultimate aim of autonomous driving is to replace human drivers and relieve them of the tedium of driving. This paper provides an overview and analysis of the background, significance, research status, and key technologies of autonomous driving, including research on brain cognition during driving and sensor integration in intelligent vehicles.

In recent years, the rapid progress in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, automatic control, navigation, and sensor technology has brought about significant changes in the field of automotive industry. The emergence of autonomous driving represents a disruptive innovation in the automotive sector, aiming to achieve intelligent driving and fundamentally alter the interaction between vehicles and drivers, rather than focusing solely on changes in vehicle dynamics. This transformation is anticipated to turn vehicles into personalized, mobile sharing platforms.

In 2013, McKinsey & Company identified advanced robotics and autonomous driving technologies as two of the twelve transformative technologies shaping the future economy. The development of autonomous vehicles relies on the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, automatic control, and sensor technology, making it an ideal testing ground for cutting-edge research. Unmanned driving technologies have garnered significant attention from governments, research institutions, and businesses due to their immense potential in civilian, military, and research domains.

In the mid-1980s, Europe initiated research on autonomous driving, focusing on the independent mobility of unmanned vehicles within traffic streams rather than on the coordination of vehicles and road infrastructure. The Prometheus program, launched in 1987, marked a significant milestone, with unmanned vehicles such as VAMP and VITA-2 driving on highways at speeds reaching 130 km/h. Since 2006, Europe has conducted the European Land-Robot Trials (ELROB) to assess the capabilities of land robots, including autonomous vehicles, in military and civilian scenarios. These trials have played a pivotal role in advancing autonomous driving technologies in Europe.

In China, the development of autonomous driving technologies has lagged behind that of other countries. Motor companies have shown limited enthusiasm and engagement in these technologies, with the cooperation between these companies and research institutions mostly restricted to providing vehicle platforms and mechanical modifications, lacking deeper involvement. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of tests involving unmanned vehicles in complex driving scenarios, with most tests being confined to regular highways.

Despite the current limitations, it is indeed feasible to offload driving tasks from human cognitive activities and employ machines to perform low-level, complex, and long-lasting cognitive functions by simulating brain processes. By formalizing driving cognition and ensuring the accuracy and completeness of driving processes, there is potential for machines to replicate or even surpass human driving capabilities, leveraging their characteristics such as attentiveness and endurance. In the formalization of brain cognition during driving, certain cognitive tasks, such as audio-visual perception, attention, memory, decision-making, and interaction, are handled by human brains, while driving coordination skills are delegated to automated systems and vehicle dynamics, akin to the role of the cerebellum in the human brain.

Our long-term memory stores essential knowledge, experiences, and operational models, analogous to the driving map and driving operation model in autonomous vehicles. The driving map records precise geographic information relevant to driving, while the driving operation model encompasses standard driving maneuvers for autonomous vehicles. These serve as the a priori knowledge for the autonomous driving system. Additionally, our working memory temporarily stores pertinent real-time information and prior knowledge, which are integrated to provide an information pool for analysis and decision-making. Similarly, the autonomous driving system integrates real-time sensor information and driving prior knowledge in a formal language to represent the driving state.

Furthermore, human brains also possess characteristics such as emotions and personality, which influence driving behavior. However, these attributes are not included in the design of autonomous driving systems, raising concerns about the safety of such systems in real-world driving scenarios. Additionally, the types, quantities, and placement of sensors, as well as the information processing modules in autonomous driving test platforms, vary extensively, indicating the need for a standardized approach to formalizing driving cognition and designing a universal software framework for autonomous driving. 

Our research group has been dedicated to year-round research and experimentation in autonomous driving, having completed 20 unmanned driving experiments covering a total distance of 20,000 km along inter-city highways. Notably, we were among the leading participants in China's Intelligent Vehicles' Future Challenge matches and successfully completed an unmanned driving test for passenger cars over a 32 km stretch of the Zhengzhou-Kaifeng City Expressway in Henan Province in August 2015, with the vehicle reaching its destination without manual intervention and passing third-party evaluations.
