Regarded as a menace to information systems for various reasons, covert channels pose a significant security threat by enabling the covert transmission of information. Additionally, they pose an economic threat by allowing the transmission of information using existing systems without incurring the associated costs. Covert channels typically rely on obscured resource usage, which can significantly impact system performance.

Non-interference violations have been addressed through methods such as typing and process algebra to classify data and processes according to security levels. High-level processes can access all data and communicate with other high processes, while low-level processes are restricted from accessing high-level information, directly or indirectly.

The connection between games and covert channels may not be immediately apparent. However, nodes of high-level Message Sequence Charts (hMSCs) can be viewed as vertices of an arena, with covert channel users representing one player and the protocol representing the other. Winning strategies for the protocol involve preventing information transmission to certain zones, and defining strategies for data transmission.

To identify zones where data transmission is possible, winning zones for the sending instance and the protocol must be computed. Sink nodes and connected components controlled by the protocol are identified as winning zones for the protocol.

An algorithm is used to add specific strategies to sets x and y, which terminate with a finalized set of nodes for each.

The existence of a maximal winning strategy is proven, with the understanding that such strategies are not necessarily unique. However, the proof does not provide the most efficient algorithm to compute such strategies.

Theorem 6.2 demonstrates the relationship between a high-level Message Sequence Chart (hMSC) and the associated arena, with a strategy for the winning set computed on the arena. If the associated transducer is functional, an interpretation exists, but ambiguous transducers do not make covert information passing impossible, they merely introduce noise.

Efforts are underway to compute the capacity and rates of noisy covert channels using information theory. In asynchronous systems, the computation of capacities and rates is complicated by the fact that all encodings are not performed in constant time. However, an efficient strategy may be identified without needing to remember the order between visited nodes, only the visited nodes since the last visit of an encoding node.
