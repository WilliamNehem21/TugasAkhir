The control of platoons in intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs) has attracted considerable attention due to its potential to decrease fuel consumption and enhance the efficiency of transportation systems. Despite the emergence of several effective platoon control strategies, practical challenges persist. The information exchanged over public vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks is vulnerable to malicious intrusions and cyberattacks, which can make ICVs susceptible. Traditional platoon control methods often struggle in ICVs with a focus on security, particularly in scenarios where heightened security assurances are required.

Ensuring secure platoon control is crucial, especially when malicious vehicles in the network disregard established communication protocols and provide misleading information, thus jeopardizing platoon coordination and potentially leading to collisions. It is imperative to develop innovative control algorithms and detection mechanisms capable of addressing this malicious behavior, as they are essential for the safety and security of platoon systems. Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) has gained attention for its exceptional capabilities in managing constraints and optimizing computational resources. However, existing DMPC methodologies lack the necessary focus on security-sensitive operations, highlighting the need for a unified and resilient DMPC-based strategy to safeguard ICVs against cyberattacks.

To address these challenges, the authors developed a Resilient Distributed Model Predictive Platoon Control (RDMP2C) framework for constrained ICVs. This framework enables vehicles to detect and identify malicious information, ensuring that they consistently meet the desired platoon control objectives. By integrating optimal control with DMPC optimization, their approach ensures superior control performance and constraint adherence.

The paper establishes sufficient conditions for the recursive feasibility of the RDMP2C algorithm and the stability of the closed-loop ICV system. The method is the first attempt to concurrently address the cybersecurity, constraints, and control performance of constrained ICVs under potential attacks, maintaining closed-loop stability and security even during byzantine attacks with reduced reliance on network robustness.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents basic preliminaries and formulates the resilient platoon control problem. Section 3 introduces distributed detection algorithms for byzantine attacks. Section 4 proposes the RDMP2C framework for constrained ICVs, while Section 5 proves theoretical properties, including recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability. Section 6 presents simulation results, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

The paper explores a secondary verification algorithm that enhances the resilience of the system to a higher number of byzantine attacks without increasing the robustness threshold of the network, offering a new approach compared to existing attack detection methodologies.

Discussion on optimality and constraint satisfaction is also included. The proposed DMPC-based platoon control gradually converges to the optimal control input and achieves suboptimal platoon control performance, handling physical constraints and achieving a trade-off between optimality and constraint satisfaction.

The paper emphasizes the importance of ensuring safety and rational driving exploration and exploitation for the online evolution of autonomous driving, introducing corresponding modeling methods for these principles, including predictive safe-driving envelope modeling and a rational exploration and exploitation scheme.

In summary, the paper presents a resilient DMPC-based platoon control framework for constrained ICVs under f-local byzantine attacks. It also outlines potential directions for future research, such as extending the RDMP2C framework to handle constrained ICVs in more complex environments and applying it to address the flexible ICV platoon problem. Additionally, the paper suggests exploring advanced machine learning methods for detecting adversarial cyberattacks on ICVs in real-world situations.
