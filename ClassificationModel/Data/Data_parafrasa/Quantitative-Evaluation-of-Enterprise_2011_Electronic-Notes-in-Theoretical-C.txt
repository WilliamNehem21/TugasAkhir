This study presents an evaluation of eight popular digital rights management (DRM) products available in the market, focusing on their functions and quantitative impact on organizational operations. The research defines a set of metrics to assess the costs and impact of implementing DRM products and employs stochastic models to quantitatively evaluate these factors. The findings indicate that while DRM products enhance security by encrypting digital assets and providing centralized control over information, they also impose productivity costs on staff. The study identifies non-productive time (NPT) as a key outcome of these security mechanisms, which is integrated into the stochastic modeling process.

The authors express gratitude to Simon Parkin and Rouaa Yassin Kassab at Newcastle University, as well as to anonymous reviewers from the workshop committee, for their valuable input and feedback during the research and writing stages.

Moreover, the study highlights the increasing significance of internal staff behavior in information security incidents, with a notable rise in security breaches resulting from employee negligence and misuse of access rights. This underscores the growing threat posed by internal attacks and emphasizes the need for organizations to address these concerns. DRM systems are proposed as a solution to mitigate these risks and safeguard digital information within companies and organizations.

Furthermore, the paper explains the concept of DRM and its role in controlling access rights to digital content, both internally and externally. It underscores the need to assess the benefits of DRM products against the associated costs and challenges faced in quantitatively evaluating their impact on organizations. The adverse effects of DRM on operational efficiency, such as hindering user productivity through authentication processes, are highlighted as a key concern.

Additionally, the study provides a comprehensive review of eight leading DRM products, focusing on their administrative models, content management, user monitoring, and rights management features. It also emphasizes the common encryption mechanisms employed by these products to ensure data security and compliance with regulations.

Lastly, the paper discusses the use of stochastic Petri nets and stochastic activity networks (SANs) to model the impact of DRM products on organizational operations, particularly in terms of non-productive time and efficiency reduction. The findings reveal that while DRM products enhance information security, they also introduce productivity challenges for authorized users, ultimately affecting the overall operational efficiency of the organization.
