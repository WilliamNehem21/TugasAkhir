The use of ontologies and semantic web technologies is a powerful means of representing and encoding knowledge, enabling its integration, exploration, recovery, and reuse. This paper presents an initial ontology-based approach, referred to as "sak-sir," based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard, for integrating, sharing, and retrieving knowledge from diverse sources. As a proof of concept, the approach is applied to share, integrate, and retrieve knowledge from a previous AKM tool developed by the authors, focusing on capturing the complete evolution of a software architecture design process (SADP).

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background information on ontologies, semantic web technologies, and the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard. Section 3 introduces the "sak-sir" approach and identifies and characterizes potential sources of SAK. Section 4 applies the approach to integrate the AKM metamodel and repository of the traced tool, and retrieve SAK from historical SA projects. Section 5 discusses related work, while Section 6 presents the conclusions.

Ontology-based techniques are increasingly used for semantic searches and providing a common understanding for various terminologies, making knowledge readily available for future use. The paper refers to a prior effort in constructing an ontology for software architecture knowledge (SAKONTO), which encompasses concepts, relations, and constraints to represent knowledge from general, contextual, design, and reasoning categories.

AKM tools typically have associated repositories to store and manage architectural knowledge (AK). The data models of these repositories define architectural constructs and relationships, representing knowledge used or generated during software architecture design and analysis. Depending on the knowledge source, different techniques and mechanisms are applied for retrieval, such as natural language processing (NLP) for textual documents or parsing of web pages. Domain-specific ontologies may be created to integrate knowledge sources and facilitate the integration stage of SAK.

Several layers of the ontology network are defined, including the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard ontology layer, the software architecture domain layer, and the architectural knowledge model layer. Human intervention is crucial at the integration stage, with the role of an ontology engineer or expert being necessary to ensure the quality and expressiveness of the knowledge model.

The "sak-sir" approach aims to integrate heterogeneous knowledge sources, provide knowledge retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities, and enable the sharing of SAK among different organizations and individuals. The ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard ontology serves as the basis for defining the SAK ontology network, which has been validated through integration with the traced tool's metamodel and repository. This integration has allowed for the representation of knowledge about the evolution of SADP while maintaining compliance with the standard.
