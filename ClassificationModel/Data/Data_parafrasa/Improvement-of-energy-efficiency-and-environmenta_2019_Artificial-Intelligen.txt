According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2018, global fisheries and aquaculture production totaled approximately 171 million tons in 2016, with fisheries accounting for 47% (80 million tons) and aquaculture for 53% (91 million tons) of the total production. The report also indicated that Iran was the largest producer of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), with a production of 167,830 tons. Specifically, 40% of the rainbow trout in Iran was produced in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari (22,803 tons), Lorestan (22,106 tons), and Kohgiluyeh-o-Boyer-Ahmad (19,500 tons) provinces (Anonymous, 2018).

Constraints in fishing and limited access to water resources have resulted in higher utilization of available resources in aquaculture. However, increased use of non-renewable resources could potentially compromise energy efficiency and exacerbate environmental issues. Therefore, managing and reducing energy consumption through measures such as chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery, labor, water, and electricity inputs is crucial for improving energy efficiency and mitigating climate change. This approach not only benefits the environment but also lowers production costs, which is significant for consumers. Consequently, enhancing energy efficiency has been integrated into production strategies (Schnapp, 2012).

The assessment of a system's status in terms of energy input and yield can be effectively achieved using energy indices. However, these indices alone are insufficient for determining how the system can be improved. For example, the energy ratio (ER) of a system may improve with a two-fold increase in yield and a 1.5-fold increase in energy input. In spite of an improved ER, higher energy emissions could still occur due to the nutrient release associated with fish growth, as estimated by nutrient-balance modeling (Cho and Kaushik, 1990).

Emissions from fish growth-related nutrients can be quantified through the nutrient-balance modeling approach, which has been adapted and validated for modeling rainbow trout. This method has also been utilized for developing an emissions inventory of rainbow trout, encompassing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and solid emissions. The release of nutrients and theoretical oxygen demand per ton of trout can be calculated using the chemical oxygen demand of protein, carbohydrates, lipids, ash, and fiber emitted (Anonymous, 2018).

Environmental impact categories can be categorized using various methods, with the CML2 baseline 2000 considered in this study. Ten impact categories based on the CML2 baseline 2000 include abiotic depletion (AD), acidification (AC), global warming (GW), eutrophication (EU), ozone layer depletion (OLD), human toxicity (HT), freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FAE), marine aquatic ecotoxicity (MAE), terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), and photochemical oxidation (PHO). To facilitate comparison, normalization was used to make the categories non-dimensional, with the assistance of SimaPro software (Anonymous, 2003).

In the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, an inefficient Decision Making Unit (DMU) can become efficient by reducing input quantities without decreasing output (input-based model) or increasing output quantities while maintaining input quantities (output-based model). Given that the quantities of inputs are controlled by trout producers and various factors affect the output, the input-based model was selected for this study. The DEA model expressed through constant returns to scale (CRS) and variable returns to scale (VRS) includes technical efficiency (TEF), pure technical efficiency (PTE), and scale efficiency (SEF).

Furthermore, PTE represents the desired efficiency, and SEF is the ratio between actual efficiency and desired efficiency. TEF is a combination of both SEF and PTE. Notably, a difference of 13 DMUs between TEF and PTE can be attributed to inappropriate production scale. Additionally, TEF scores of 46 DMUs and PTE scores of 33 DMUs were in the range of 0.4 to 0.99.

Considering the environmental impact of trout production, fish oil contributed 80%, 73%, and 62% of the human toxicity (HT), freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FAE), and ozone layer depletion (OLD), respectively, in the Lordegan region. In the Ardal region, wheat gluten and rapeseed meal accounted for 37% and 43% of the total contribution to terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), respectively, while in the Lordegan region, these inputs accounted for 16% and 36% of the total contribution to TE. Lastly, in the Lordegan region, direct emissions from feed consumption, diesel fuel, natural gas, and labor represented 24% of the total contribution to photochemical oxidation (PHO).
