The academic paper discusses a hierarchical data acquisition methodology and macro-observation performance in accordance with the IEC 61724 standard. The authors have successfully utilized a control and monitoring application for integrated facility management of photovoltaic plant installations, which can also be easily adapted for other renewable energy generation installations and remote automation applications.

The paper is structured as follows: section 2 presents the automation system architecture, section 3 describes the main control and automation services provided, section 4 details the solar park installation, monitored signals, and implemented alarms, section 5 provides application screenshots to illustrate the implemented services, and section 6 presents the technology used to build the application and the database schema.

The data center, also known as the automation level, communicates with the bottom level and is responsible for monitoring and controlling all installations in a centralized manner. The service back-end within the data center is designed to collect, store, and manage data from all remote installations. It can be scaled to accommodate any number of measurement points and can provide external interfaces to other software entities based on customer needs. The service back-end is also designed to interoperate with third-party controllers and PLCs, and includes modules for communication adapter, application logic, notification server, and reporting server. All necessary data are stored in a database.

At the management level, a front-end interface capable of operation with a standard web browser is presented to the operator and end-users. The paper also discusses the calculation of derived parameters, the recording and presentation of the current status of internal and external entities, and the hierarchical status propagation within the solution.

The paper further covers the automatic generation of reports, the operation of solar parks/pv plants based on the photovoltaic effect, and the implementation of alarms related to power loss and battery performance. The proposed PV management system has been implemented in Visual Studio 2010 with Framework .NET 4, using the object-oriented C# language. The application consists of three projects, including a web site, a WCF service library project for implementing the web service of the application, and a mail sender web service for sending notification emails when an alarm is created. Graphical representations are implemented using charting controls embedded in Framework 4.0.

The authors have tested the system with real data collected and monitored from a 2mwp PV plant installation over a period of one year, which included several monitored signals such as active, reactive, and apparent power, air and module temperature, battery, humidity, and wind speed.
