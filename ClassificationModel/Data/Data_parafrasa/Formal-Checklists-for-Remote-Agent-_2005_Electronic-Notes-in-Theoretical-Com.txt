For several years, NASA has conducted robotic deep space missions heavily reliant on software for mission operations. These missions involve integrating physical and software systems, which are both complex and costly to develop and deploy. In response to this challenge, the Mission Data System (MDS) framework has been created to provide an architecture, tools, and libraries of reusable components specifically for the design and implementation of space mission systems, with a focus on robotic deep space missions.



The framework utilizes a state-based approach to system design and a goal-oriented approach to operation. System state, encompassing device operating modes, health, resource levels, and dynamic information, forms the basis for mission operation decisions. Meanwhile, mission goals outline the desired outcome of a mission operation to ensure successful mission completion. Mathematically, a goal represents a prioritized constraint on the value of a state variable during a specific time interval.



The framework employs estimators to compute state values, which are then communicated in messages, tested for constraint satisfaction by controllers, and used by goal-elaborators. Additionally, the framework includes modules for handling constraints, defining reasons for success or failure, and specifying messages for interfacing state variables with the environment.



In the context of the rover system, the framework addresses the need to refine interfaces and specify the communication of data between components. State variables, such as position and heading, are identified and their measurement and control methods are determined to achieve the system's goals.



Efforts have been made to systematically specify the control structures for interactions between the controller, actuator, sensor, estimator, and state variables, as well as with the framework scheduler. Through initial model development and testing, several challenges and gaps in the documentation were discovered, leading to ongoing refinement and adaptation of the framework.
