Change points refer to sudden shifts or abrupt variations observed in time series data. Detecting these change points is beneficial for effectively modeling and forecasting time series. Change point detection algorithms are specifically designed to identify time points where a process undergoing a temporal evolution has encountered a change. These time points signify alterations in the process responsible for generating the data points. Change point detection is widely applied in diverse fields such as quality control, navigation system monitoring, seismic data processing, and medicine.

A survey conducted by Aminikhanghahi and Cook elaborated on the various algorithms used for detecting change points in time series data. The survey discussed the application areas of change point detection algorithms, encompassing both supervised and unsupervised approaches, as well as accuracy metrics.

Enose, which stands for electronic nose, comprises a set of gas sensors that measure the surrounding gas atmosphere, including scents, flavors, and non-odorous chemicals. Enoses function based on the general principle that alterations in the gaseous environment elicit characteristic changes in the sensor properties, contingent on the enose technology and the chemical sensor or sensor array utilized. These sensors are typically composed of metal oxides, conducting polymer composites, and intrinsically conductive polymers.

A proposition is made for the matrix form cusum as a straightforward multivariate extension of the classic cusum algorithm. This approach involves conducting all calculations in matrix form, which significantly reduces computation time while maintaining approximately the same level of accuracy as the one-dimensional cusum. The algorithm can be implemented in two ways, providing either a uniform change point that represents the average of detected change points across all channels, or separate change points for each channel. Although averaging the detected points across all channels may lead to less precise change points, it increases robustness for channels that did not react to a scent and do not contain meaningful data.

In a study involving the measurement of scent sources with a ChemPro100i, both from an open plate and a sealed flask at a frequency of 1 Hz, a total of 30 data sets were gathered, with each scent source being measured in 5 sets of 5 minutes. A 3-minute break was taken between measurements of two sets to allow the drift tube to be flushed with ambient air until the ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) readings returned to the baseline. The ground truth points were manually selected by visually inspecting the time series plots. Marked points and the detected change points contributed to the mean absolute error (MAE) scores. However, even in cases where no change points were present, the algorithms still yielded random points that affected the MAE scores of specific data sets. To address this issue, modifications were made to the algorithms, involving the calculation of differences between the maximum and minimum values for each channel based on the initial sample. Additionally, if the difference was less than 0.05 pa, the channel was excluded from the calculation, with the threshold value of 0.05 being chosen based on an analysis of all the data sets.

The Shewhart control charts, cusum, and Bayesian online change point detection algorithms demonstrated reliable performance, but they needed to be run on each channel separately. The Bayesian online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm generally performed well when change points were clearly visible. Consequently, these algorithms were deemed suitable for the detection of change points in IMS readings. The multivariate max-cusum and matrix form cusum algorithms, which calculate all channels simultaneously, were found to be the fastest and most reliable among all the considered algorithms.
