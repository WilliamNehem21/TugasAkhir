Insufficient availability of documentation has led to a lack of trust, compounded by the hiring of unreliable representatives, resulting in a time-consuming and unaccountable loan-granting process. Blockchain technology has been proposed as a solution to this problem, with successful applications in various sectors such as finance, identity, supply chain, and certification. Traditional database systems are inadequate in addressing trust and security issues. Research indicates that blockchain offers a trust-free system with privacy and security assurances. To address these issues, a microfinance application framework called "micro chain" is proposed to utilize blockchain technology for ensuring trust, transparency, privacy, and security, thereby reducing fraud and enhancing productivity in the microfinance industry.

Chapter 2 provides an in-depth explanation of blockchain, smart contracts, KYC, and identities in blockchain, followed by the detailed proposed design in Chapter 3. The implementation of the proposed design is outlined in Chapter 4, while the experimental results are presented in Chapter 5. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the conclusions drawn from the article.

The proposed lending model aims to eliminate intermediary parties like banks from the loan management process, significantly reducing processing time. The use of blockchain ensures secure transactions, preventing defaults and offering higher interest rates for lenders and lower interest rates for borrowers compared to traditional banks.

The history of blockchain development traces back to 1982 when David Chum proposed a protocol similar to blockchain. Subsequent work by mathematicians Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in 1991 laid the foundation for a non-tamperable document timestamps system, augmented with the integration of Merkle trees into the design. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the first decentralized blockchain, which was later implemented the same year.

Smart contract programs are created, distributed, managed, and updated, forming a part of blockchain or other distributed ledger technology, and are utilized in various payment systems and digital exchanges, including those that operate with Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Despite their name, smart contracts are not legally binding agreements, but rather programmatically execute business logic to perform specific tasks, processes, or transactions based on predefined criteria. Legal action is required to link their execution to legally binding agreements between parties.

The key objective of the lending model is to establish a secure peer-to-peer connection between the money lender and borrower, storing transactional data in a highly secure platform. The model consists of two primary participants: the money lender and the money borrower, fostering a peer-to-peer connection between them. The use of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are securely stored, reducing the risk of data manipulation or deletion.

In the current document verification process for KYC, the involvement of multiple parties poses a high risk of document misuse or database hacking, which could compromise the integrity of the verification process. To address these concerns, an improved verification model is proposed, incorporating an additional layer of verification from the company's side to confirm the association between the citizen and the respective KYC ID.

Blockchain technology, beyond its applications in cryptocurrencies, has demonstrated disruptive potential and is being increasingly adopted across various industries. In the financial sector, the use of blockchain and smart contracts has garnered attention due to their potential for low-cost, high-speed, transparent, and secure transactions, prompting the development of blockchain-based payment solutions by solution providers.
