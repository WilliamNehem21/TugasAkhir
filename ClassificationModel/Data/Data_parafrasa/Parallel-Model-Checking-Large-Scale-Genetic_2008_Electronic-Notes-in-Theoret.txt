Research on cells conducted using computational methods has the potential to significantly decrease the necessity for costly and protracted laboratory experiments. The utilization of model checking for the assessment of biological networks has garnered considerable attention. However, one of the primary practical limitations lies in the size of the model. This paper presents findings on the parallel model checking of genetic regulatory networks using the divine model-checker, with a focus on the ability to check linear time properties on large networks.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the behavior of intricate living systems represents the chief challenge in systems biology. Recent focus has been directed towards scrutinizing the intricate biochemical regulatory networks that oversee a living cell's response to its ever-changing surroundings. Stress responses to environmental stimuli result from the interaction of several complex, dynamic modules acting on different time scales. These networks are formidable in both size and complexity, with a human cell containing approximately 10,000 substances involved in 15,000 different types of reactions, giving rise to a complex cellular network with intricate feedback loops.

The study reports on the parallel model checking of genetic regulatory networks utilizing the divine model-checker, employing the discretization method proposed and implemented in Genetic Network Analyzer (GNA). A crucial feature of this method involves the simulation of ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems with unknown reaction rate coefficients. The distributed state space generator is interwoven into the divine tool, enabling the on-the-fly generation of transition graphs, thereby facilitating the analysis of properties of even larger networks compared to the explicit representation utilized in GNA.

Considering the complexity of the biochemistry that governs living organisms, nontrivial physical properties must be given due consideration in models. A myriad of mathematical approaches are available for biochemical modeling, varying in the level of abstraction they offer. This paper focuses on the traditional deterministic approach based on ODE, with an emphasis on an approximative discrete simulation of ODE solutions, which proves useful for analyzing genetic networks with unknown exact values of reaction rate coefficients.

The paper presents a proof that each solution trajectory starting within certain concentration bounds never exceeds the maximal concentration value of any substrate. Additionally, it is asserted that any solution trajectory starting outside these bounds will eventually enter and remain within them. This implies that the partitioning of any PL model must always be finite.

The paper underscores that the space complexity of the symbolic simulation algorithm grows exponentially with the number of state variables, rendering it unfeasible to construct the entire state space representing all possible system behaviors. While GNA allows for the limitation of the constructed state space to states reachable from a given initial condition, handling the relevant part of the state space in large systems remains a daunting task. Furthermore, the exponential increase in explicit state space significantly complicates the analysis of large models.

The GeneSim state generator integrates methods for encoding the implicit representation of qualitative simulation, facilitating its integration with divine distributed on-the-fly state space analysis algorithms.

The paper describes experimenting with exploring the state space using OWCTY to verify if the simulated models conform to specified behavioral properties. The experiments involved modifying a four-variable model of genetic regulation and generating a scalable artificial model with varying numbers of variables. The experiments were conducted on a cluster comprising up to 20 homogeneous workstations, with tests scaled for different numbers of nodes.
