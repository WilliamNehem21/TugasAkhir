The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work, while Section 3 introduces a multilevel classification of security concerns in cloud computing. Section 4 discusses the concept of dynamic security contracts, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

The security aspects of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) are analyzed in the paper, focusing on vulnerabilities in publicly available Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and methods for mitigating them. The proposed tool, Amazon Image Attacks (Amazonia), utilizes publicly available interfaces to exploit vulnerabilities and extract sensitive information, such as passwords and credentials, from AMIs. The extracted information can be used for various malicious purposes, including initiating botnets, creating backdoors, or accessing the source code of web services available on AMIs.

The authors also discuss a user-centric security architecture for cloud-based applications, allowing users to control their security across different cloud providers and subscribe to multiple security solutions based on the criticality of the services. Data privacy challenges in cloud computing, including integrity, authorized access, and availability, are addressed, and the Cisco Secure Data Center framework is proposed as a multilayer security mechanism to address these challenges.

The paper further explores attacks on cloud interfaces, including signature wrapping attacks and advanced cross-site scripting (XSS) techniques, which can lead to unauthorized access and theft of sensitive information. The security concerns for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) layers are discussed, emphasizing the interdependency of these layers and the potential security risks associated with attacks on cloud services, virtualization, and utility computing.

Specific examples of attacks on different cloud services are provided, including attacks on web services, web portals, authentication mechanisms, and virtualization. The risks associated with these attacks are classified based on their potential impact and severity, highlighting the importance of dynamic security measures that adapt to changes in the cloud service being targeted.

In summary, the paper covers a range of security concerns in cloud computing, including vulnerabilities in cloud services, virtualization, and utility computing, as well as the potential impacts of attacks on different layers of the cloud infrastructure. It emphasizes the need for dynamic security measures to address evolving threats and protect sensitive data in shared resource environments.
