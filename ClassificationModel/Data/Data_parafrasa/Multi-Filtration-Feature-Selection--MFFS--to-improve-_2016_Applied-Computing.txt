The increasing importance of data mining for healthcare applications is evident in the prediction of the usefulness of surgical procedures, clinical tests, medication procedures, and the discovery of associations among clinical and diagnosis data. With the availability of diverse medical data and advanced data mining techniques, there is a unique opportunity for medical data mining to significantly impact patient care.

This research aims to show that the selection of more significant features from raw medical datasets can assist physicians in making accurate diagnoses. The focus is on aggressively reducing dimensionality to enhance prediction accuracy. The method employs an efficient strategy of ensemble feature correlation with ranking method, resulting in remarkable dimensionality reduction in medical datasets.

Various feature selection methods have been explored, including a novel method based on the normalization of mutual information measurement to estimate the potential of features. Redundancy demoting (RD) is another proposed approach that improves feature ranking by identifying and demoting redundant features. Hybrid schemes that combine wrapper-based and filter-based approaches have also been studied to offer superior classification accuracy.

The problem of classifier bias towards attributes with more values has been addressed by employing symmetrical uncertainty (SU), which overcomes the bias problem by dividing information gain by the sum of the entropies of feature subsets.

The study also discusses the application of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in medical data mining, utilizing a backpropagation network with specific learning rate and momentum parameters for training.

The proposed multi filtration feature selection (MFFS) method has been demonstrated to outperform existing counterparts in terms of the number of selected features, classification accuracy, and computational time. MFFS effectively eliminates irrelevant and redundant features, providing a small set of reliable features for physicians to make informed decisions.
