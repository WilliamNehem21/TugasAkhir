The rest of the paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 presents a review of cluster-based key management mechanisms, including their advantages and disadvantages. In Section 3, the paper delves into a detailed discussion of the proposed cluster hash key-based key management for cluster-based networks, along with its system model. Section 4 outlines the simulation results of the proposed scheme, which involves evaluating the network in an environment with an increased number of malicious nodes. Finally, Section 5 provides the conclusion of the study.

Lin You et al. introduced a key management scheme for wireless sensor networks that utilized a key distribution scheme called Deployment Knowledge Hash-Chain Key Distribution (DKH-KD). This approach established pairwise keys based on the number of hash chains, with the pairwise key being derived from reverse hash chain values. While this method improved the efficiency of pairwise key establishment, it also significantly increased the computational cost during the rekeying process.

Ehdai et al. proposed a 2D hash-based scheme, which involved using two hash functions to address security issues in sensor networks. The scheme was efficient in combating node capture attacks and reduced energy consumption. However, it also led to an increase in computational overhead due to the rekeying process.

Anita et al. presented a novel hybrid key management scheme designed to establish secure communication in wireless sensor networks, which aimed to reduce computational overheads and ensure high-level security in communication networks. While the work demonstrated enhanced network performance, it was noted to be challenging to implement in real-time scenarios.

After generating the master key (KM), node A needed to obtain its pairwise key to communicate with destination node B. Assuming node A wanted to communicate with node B securely by establishing a pairwise key (Kpair), each node in the cluster was expected to have a pairwise key obtained from the established hash chain (HC). The process for establishing a pairwise key was outlined as follows:

- Phase 1 involved generating the master key (KM) and activating it before the sensors were deployed in the network.
- Phase 2 described key predistribution, which ensured network security.
- Phase 3 was used for creating a secured link at a multi-hop distance. In the first phase, the key distribution phase, an initial key (Ki) was generated and pre-distributed to each node in the network during deployment. Each node (SNi) then generated the master key (KM) with Ki and a one-way hash function (KH).
