This research outlines a plan to investigate the impact of inductive reasoning ability (IRA) on the comprehension and utilization of program visualization (PV) systems. Unlike current PV systems, which provide the same visualization regardless of the user's knowledge or abilities, the proposed study aims to explore how IRA can be utilized to adapt visualizations to accommodate different students. The initial phase of the research aims to examine the correlation between IRA and the ability to answer program-related questions during program visualization, with the ultimate goal of exploring the potential benefits of employing IRA modeling in adaptive PV systems.

The paper commences with an overview of existing research on inductive reasoning ability in Section 2. Section 3 provides a description of Jeliot 3 and the modifications made to support the experiment described in Section 4. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential implications of the study's findings.

The concept of pattern finding, as described by Holland et al., involves detecting co-variation from a collection of samples or past experiences. Additionally, research conducted by Heller et al. suggests that problem-solving skills in physics stem from reflective practices that extract knowledge from previous experiences with similar problems or sample problem solutions.

Jeliot 3 is a program visualization system designed to animate the execution of Java programs. It has been utilized as a teaching aid in classrooms and as a learning tool for students, including in distance education settings. However, challenges have been identified in using Jeliot 3 in these contexts. In traditional classrooms, average-performing students appear to benefit the most from program visualization tools, whereas both the weakest and strongest students may not find Jeliot 3 as helpful. The complexity of the visualizations may pose challenges for the weakest students, while the strongest students may not require visualizations to the same extent, potentially hindering their learning experience.

In the context of distance education, students studying independently may encounter learning and motivation difficulties. To address this, visualization tools should not only be motivating but also offer support to help students overcome barriers, potentially serving as a substitute for a teacher's explanation of program visualization and related programming concepts.

Furthermore, for experimental purposes, user model concepts will be linked to the corresponding week of the programming course, with students required to answer pre-test questions before learning a new concept and post-test questions after learning the concept. In the second week, students will be introduced to Jeliot 3 and the experiment, utilizing a web-based version connected to an online student model that updates in real-time as questions are answered.
