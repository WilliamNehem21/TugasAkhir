The well-established concept of critical pairs already enables the detection of static conflicts, a crucial capability for various applications, and it is currently integrated into agg. However, the conventional approach to constructing critical pairs is not very efficient. This paper presents the innovative concept of essential critical pairs, which enables more efficient conflict detection. This concept is based on a new conflict characterization that precisely identifies the cause of each conflict between the rules of the system. The introduction of this new conflict characterization allows for an optimization of conflict detection, as the set of essential critical pairs forms a subset of all critical pairs in the system, leading to a reduction in the number of representative conflicts to be computed statically. The paper demonstrates that there exists an essential critical pair representing each conflict in the system, and each essential critical pair is unique in terms of its conflict reason, thereby representing each conflict not only minimally but also uniquely. The main contributions of this paper include a characterization of conflicts, the completeness and uniqueness of essential critical pairs, and a local confluence lemma based on essential critical pairs. The theory of essential critical pairs serves as the foundation for the development and implementation of a more efficient conflict detection algorithm in the future.

For transformation systems that fall within the framework of adhesive high-level replacement categories, the straightforward approach used to compute the set of all critical pairs in a graph transformation system, as per the standard definition, is typically employed. This computation is crucial for applications such as graph parsing, conflict detection in graph transformation-based modeling and model transformation, and refactoring. However, there is currently a lack of theory that enables the efficient implementation of conflict detection. Therefore, this paper focuses on addressing this issue.

Previous work has already discussed optimizations that lead to more efficient conflict detection in graph transformation systems. However, these optimizations were limited to conflicts induced by a pair of rules where one of the rules does not delete. This limitation is significant, as many conflicts are induced by a pair of deleting rules. This paper addresses this limitation by formulating a characterization of conflicts that covers all types of conflicts, including those induced by a pair of deleting rules. Furthermore, this conflict characterization enables the identification of the conflict reason for each conflict.

The concept of critical pair, as introduced in previous work, represents each conflict within its minimal context. In some cases, however, different critical pairs may express the same type of conflict. Leveraging the uniqueness of each conflict reason, as mentioned earlier, it becomes possible to further reduce the set of critical pairs to a subset of essential critical pairs. This subset represents each type of conflict that may occur in a graph transformation system in a minimal and unique manner. This uniqueness property, combined with the constructive definition of conflict reason, facilitates the optimization of detecting all conflicts in a graph transformation system.

Regarding the technical details mentioned in the paper, such as the "boundary bi" and "context ci," along with the definition of an initial pushout over li and injective graph morphisms, the paper establishes the initial pushout over li with the given boundaries and contexts and injective graph morphisms.

The paper presents three key properties: first, it demonstrates that every conflict in the system can be expressed by an essential critical pair (completeness); second, it asserts that each essential critical pair is unique with respect to its conflict reason span; and third, it proves a local confluence lemma based on essential critical pairs.

The paper highlights that local confluence analysis based on essential critical pairs is more effective than the standard techniques based on traditional critical pairs. In a future paper, the authors intend to build upon this foundation by providing an efficient and correct construction of all essential critical pairs for each pair of rules, along with a corresponding algorithm that enhances the current critical pair algorithm of agg. Additionally, the paper assumes and aims to verify that an extension of this theory to graph transformation with non-injective matches is possible, provided that the conflict condition is slightly generalized. Furthermore, future work will explore the occurrence of new conflicts and the necessary critical pair notion to describe conflicts in graph transformation systems with application conditions and constraints, as well as the more general case of typed, attributed graph transformation systems.
