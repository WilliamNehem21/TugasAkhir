Quasi-uniformities are derived from uniformities in a way similar to how quasi-pseudo-metrics are derived from pseudo-metrics, except that the symmetry condition is dropped. These spaces were initially explored in the context of topological groups and have garnered attention in the field of computer science since the pioneering works of Smyth and Sunderhauf. A major technical challenge lies in establishing a rigorous theory for non-symmetric spaces and defining non-symmetric convergence. It is hoped that drawing on the analogy with enriched categories, which are essentially non-symmetric objects, will be fruitful in addressing this challenge. In this vein, the connection established in this paper facilitates the transposition of the categorical Cauchy-completion to the topological bicompletion.

It is important to acknowledge the recent work that addressed these ideas effectively. However, it is currently uncertain for the author whether the general framework developed in the later paper can naturally describe the Cauchy completion, and thus our work may diverge on this point.

Another difficulty that was encountered was in identifying the appropriate change of base functors, which should induce morphisms in a 2-category of enrichments over different bases that allows for a Cauchy completion. The definition of these functors was arrived at through careful examination of the changes of base induced by quasi-uniformly continuous maps.

The rest of the paper delves into technical details and presents the aforementioned results. It is structured around two core areas – enriched category theory and topology – with the aim of ultimately reconciling them. The approach involves commencing from enriched categories and progressing halfway, then restarting from quasiuniformities and proceeding with the other half, with abstract quasi-uniformities serving as the convergence point.

In Chapter 4, a 2-category of enrichments over different bases is defined, specifically focusing on the case where the base monoidal categories are partial orders. Super monoidal functors between monoidal biclosed complete partial orders are introduced for this purpose, contributing to the definition of the 2-category enr(h).

This chapter also provides a brief overview of enriched category theory, featuring elements that are well-known or part of folklore. These are included for completeness and to establish notations. The chapter introduces the cauchy-completion of categories enriched over monoidal closed partial orders, and surprisingly, this notion is accessible without relying on deep results in enriched category theory such as Yoneda, indexed colimits, or free cocompletions. For a comprehensive understanding of enriched category theory, readers are referred to [citation].

In the subsequent sections (4.1 and 4.2), a 2-category of enrichments over different bases is developed to encode quasi-uniform spaces and their morphisms, with a focus on enrichments over monoidal closed complete partial orders. The specific nature of the base monoidal categories is omitted in this discussion.

Finally, a proof is presented, establishing that the map 'a' described earlier defines an abstract quasi-uniformity and demonstrating the isomorphism between the canonical abstract quasi-uniformities c(a) and c(a) and the cauchy-completion c(a) of c(a).
