Concurrent constraint programming (CCP) is characterized by the use of partial information as a key component, where processes interact by exchanging partial information in the form of constraints, such as "x < 42". One of the noteworthy and unique aspects of CCP is its amalgamation of the traditional operational perspective of process calculi with a declarative one based on logic. In essence, process terms in CCP can be interpreted both as computing agents and logic formulas, enabling the utilization of a wide range of techniques from both process calculi and logic. This makes CCP an advantageous framework for describing and reasoning about biological systems.

Furthermore, the ntcc process calculus provides reasoning techniques for validating whether a given process "p" satisfies a specific property "f". The calculus offers a linear-temporal specification logic and an associated proof system, enabling formal reachability analysis, which is pivotal in the context of biological systems. For example, the regulation of bacterial transcription can be regarded as a reachability analysis problem within a gene regulatory network to determine the possibility of gene expression.

By leveraging the features of ntcc, biological systems can be modeled as processes and their properties as linear-temporal formulas within a unified framework. This approach provides a descriptive language for biological systems closely linked with powerful reasoning techniques. Additionally, the ntcc theoretical framework can be translated into software tools, as demonstrated by the prototype developed by the avispa research group.

The ntcc process calculus employs time operators to capture behavior over intervals, encompassing asynchronous, persistent, and eventual behaviors. These operators enable the expression of dynamic conditions, unbounded delays, and system-wide rules. The strong connection between Computational Tree Logic with Time (CTL) and ntcc facilitates a logic-based verification methodology for biological systems alongside the observational approach provided by operational semantics. This allows for both simulations and formal proofs of essential properties of ntcc processes.

The study showcases the utilization of ntcc for modeling and verifying biological systems through a case study of the sodium-potassium pump. The pumping process of the pump is represented as an ntcc model, and a non-trivial property is verified using ntcc reasoning techniques.

The model integrates details of the pump's operation, including specific phases of the pumping process, ideal concentrations of sodium and potassium, and other relevant variables. Additionally, the model incorporates variables to account for contextual factors, such as the presence of a drug in the environment that inhibits the pump's activity.

The use of partial information constructs in the model contributes to a more precise description of the behavior of the sodium-potassium pump, offering flexibility and extensibility in system specifications. Moreover, the associated temporal logic is adept at capturing the essential properties to be verified, including those involving partial information explicitly.
