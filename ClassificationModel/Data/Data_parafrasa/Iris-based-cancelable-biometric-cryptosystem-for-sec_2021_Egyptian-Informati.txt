The paper highlights the issue of biometric template compromise, emphasizing that while a compromised password can be changed, a compromised biometric template cannot. It suggests using cancelable biometric systems to protect biometric templates by storing irreversible transformed versions, ensuring that leakage of the cancelable template does not reveal information about the original biometric template. The paper introduces biometric cryptosystems (BCS) as a combination of biometrics and cryptography, discussing their use in binding or generating an encryption key to biometric data.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work in secure healthcare data solutions and biometric cryptosystems, while Section 3 proposes a new cancelable iris-based biometric cryptosystem scheme. Section 4 provides experimental results and security analysis, and Section 5 presents the conclusion and outlines future work.

The authors Zhang et al. propose an ECG-based authentication method for the smart healthcare system, utilizing a hybrid ECG feature extraction method for patient recognition. However, the scheme's performance is affected by alterations in ECG signals due to cardiac disease in patients.

Yang et al. propose a cancelable finger-vein based biometric cryptosystem for securely storing patient healthcare data on a healthcare card, using BCH error correcting codes. Nevertheless, the maximum key length achievable is limited to 63 bits, deemed insufficient for modern cryptographic algorithms such as AES.

Hao et al. present a method to generate a cryptographic key from iris code, employing a combination of Hadamard and Reed-Solomon codes for error correction. The cryptographic key cannot be generated with an iris template or auxiliary data alone.

Ruthgeb et al. develop a two-factor authentication system based on iris biometric, using an XOR operation between a random number and iris code to generate an iris template during enrollment and matching/authentication phases. The system's security depends on the secrecy of the random number.

The paper also discusses biometric cryptosystems based on iris and proposes an access control mechanism utilizing biometric iris and fingerprint matching on a smart card, addressing constraints such as low storage and limited processing power.

The authors conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of their proposed iris-based cancelable biometric cryptosystem, using the CASIA-IrisV3-Lamp database. They utilized the first iris image of the left eye from 100 users for training and the third image of the left eye from the same users for testing.

On the healthcare smart card, the first information stored is a cryptographic hash of the encryption key, while the second is encrypted healthcare data using the AES algorithm. The paper suggests that the proposed scheme offers secure and authenticated iris-based cancelable biometric cryptosystem for user authentication and secure encryption of healthcare user data. The use of Reed-Solomon codes to bind the cancelable iris template with the secret key prevents attackers from performing cross-matching attacks or obtaining the secret key from stolen iris templates. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can successfully produce a key of a maximum length of 252 bits, with the far rate of 0% and the false reject rate of 7%, compared to the previous maximum key length of 63 bits with the far rate of 0% and the false reject rate of 63%. The security analysis indicates that the adversary is unable to obtain the secret key from the data stored on the smart healthcare card, ensuring the system's reliability and security.
