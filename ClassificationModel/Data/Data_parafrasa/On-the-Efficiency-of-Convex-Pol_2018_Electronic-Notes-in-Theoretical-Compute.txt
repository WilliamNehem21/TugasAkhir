The domain of convex polyhedra holds a significant position among the numerical domains used for program analysis and verification. While it is often the most natural choice in terms of precision, its worst-case exponential complexity makes it impractical in many scenarios. Consequently, there has been a concerted effort to explore simpler domains that offer reasonable precision while requiring fewer computational resources. Nevertheless, there are instances where employing convex polyhedra is feasible, particularly due to recent advancements in their implementation. After reviewing existing approaches to reduce computational overhead when working with this domain, we will introduce novel techniques aimed at enhancing its efficiency without compromising precision.

We plan to discuss new algorithms and implementation methods designed to decrease the computational resources necessary for working with convex polyhedra. We will focus on strategies that have the potential to improve analysis efficiency without sacrificing precision. These techniques, developed through ongoing collaborations, have all been integrated into the Parma Polyhedra Library. While our work is still ongoing, we have conducted preliminary experimental evaluations. Initial results are promising, indicating both the absence of precision losses and significant efficiency gains.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces some notation and terminology, and offers an informal presentation of the DD method. Sections 3 and 4 describe ongoing work related to the domain of convex polyhedra, with Section 3 discussing the use of domain wrappers to enhance efficiency in specific contexts, and Section 4 presenting a new approach for representing and manipulating NNC polyhedra. We conclude in Section 5.

The double description method, developed by Motzkin et al., allows the combination of a polyhedron's constraints and generators into a DD pair (c, g) by utilizing the duality principle. We focus on the conversion from constraints to generators for presentation purposes, omitting detailed discussions of polyhedral cones, homogenization, the lattice of faces, and adjacency. Another potential optimization involves the approximation of invertible affine assignments, but the use of domain operators computing affine images is restricted by the Apron interface layer to the PPL domains.

Our preliminary experimental evaluation, passing all of the regression tests of the PPL, demonstrates significant efficiency improvements on numerous benchmarks. Notably, unexpected efficiency gains were observed on topologically closed tests as well.

Despite the theoretical complexity bounds, the domain of convex polyhedra proves to be a viable option in various contexts, supported not only by recent implementation progress but also by the identification of common efficiency issues that static analysis tools using this domain should avoid. We propose domain wrappers that automatically address some of these efficiency issues, and outline a new idea for representing and manipulating NNC polyhedra that shows potential for improved efficiency compared to current implementations.
