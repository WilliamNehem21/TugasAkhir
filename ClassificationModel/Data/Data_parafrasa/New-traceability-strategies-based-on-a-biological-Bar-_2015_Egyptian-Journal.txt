Nowadays, food safety is considered a critical issue for the importation of food into the European Union (EU). EU regulations require traceability for all imported food items. Historically, the food industry had simple traceability systems, but with the increased implementation of current good manufacturing practices (GMP), traceability has become important in the production chain. Traceability refers to the ability to retrieve the history or geographical origin of a product or its components through a standardized method. Developing countries, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, face difficulties in implementing documentary traceability systems, leading to the development of new traceability strategies. To monitor the farming types of peach fruit products during processing, the study proposes the identification and validation of biological markers linked to the original habitat of these fruits.

The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to northwest China, specifically in the region between the north slopes and the Tarim Basin of the Kunlun Shan mountains, where it was first cultivated. It produces an edible, juicy fruit known as a peach. The species name P. persica reflects its widespread cultivation in Persia. Classified within the genus Prunus, which also includes cherry and plum, the peach is part of the family Rosaceae and is grouped with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished by the corrugated shell of the seed.

To preserve the initial microflora of the fruits, samples were collected directly from the trees using gloves and stored in sterile bags in October 2012. The collected samples were then refrigerated and transported via plane to CIRAD Montpellier in France. Bacterial and yeast DNA were extracted from the fresh fruits, and the farming types and harvest dates of the samples were defined.

Lactobacillus coryniformis was identified as the main bacteria in the conventional farming type of peach. This strain is a significant lactic acid bacteria and is known for its ability to convert lactose into lactic acid, creating an acidic environment that inhibits the growth of harmful pathogens and favors plant growth. Furthermore, these bacteria may have therapeutic properties, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities.

Tremella flava (TF) was revealed as the predominant yeast in the conventional farming type of peach. This species has anti-inflammatory and anti-infection properties, leading researchers to suggest its potential use as a natural alternative for inflammation and infection. The differences in microbial environments were influenced by farming types, and the processing system types applied also influenced the microbial populations of peach fruits. Common bacteria and yeast bands were observed in the DGGE gel in all of the peach fruit samples.

Statistical analysis revealed a strong relationship between the bacterial and yeast populations and the farming mode, demonstrating significant environmental differences between the different farming types for Jordan peach fruits and their impact on the bacterial and yeast ecology. This statistical relationship highlights the influence of farming mode on bacterial and yeast populations.
