Photomicrographs of the prostate revealed a significant reduction in the size of glandular tissue in the treated groups, while glandular hyperplasia was observed in the negative control. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels showed a statistically significant decrease (p<0.05) in the treated groups compared to the negative control. Treatment with the extract/finasteride resulted in a significant decrease in testosterone levels, comparable to those in normal rats. Rats induced with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and treated with S. afzelii/finasteride showed a marked increase in the levels of antioxidant enzymes compared to the negative control. S. afzelii effectively alleviated the exogenously induced prostatic hyperplasia by causing extensive shrinkage of glands and stroma, and exhibited antioxidant properties, indicating its potential as a prophylactic treatment.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) refers to the non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, characterized by the proliferation of cellular elements such as epithelial and stromal cells into discrete masses or nodules. The resulting enlargement of the prostate gland can lead to compression of the urethra, causing urinary difficulties. BPH is considered a normal part of the aging process in men, becoming histologically apparent in about 40% of men in their fifties and nearly 90% of men in their eighties. The actual cause of BPH remains unknown.

Alternative therapies such as herbal medicine have been historically popular for treating BPH due to their natural origins, accessibility, and perceived safety and affordability. Phytotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of BPH may consist of single or multiple plant extracts.

Treatment with the extract/finasteride led to a significant decrease in the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH) compared to the untreated groups, while marked recovery in enzyme levels was observed with the extract treatment, showing a dose-dependent increase. The improvement in enzyme activity was more pronounced in the extract-treated group compared to the control drug-treated group. Furthermore, in rats simultaneously induced with BPH and treated with the extract, enzyme levels were within the normal range, with higher activity observed in SOD. Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) evaluation revealed an increase in peroxidative activity in the untreated groups, while the extract/finasteride-treated group showed a marked decrease in peroxidative activity, comparable to normal levels.

The inhibitory activity of S. afzelii on experimentally induced prostatic hyperplasia was evaluated in male Wistar rats. The BPH-induced rats exhibited weight loss and a significant increase in prostate weight compared to the uninduced rats. Prostatic weight increase is considered a critical indicator of BPH enlargement, which is characterized by proliferation of the cellular elements of the prostate, including stromal and epithelial components. Treatment with S. afzelii/finasteride led to extensive shrinkage of glands and an increase in fibro-muscular matrix density, effectively attenuating prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, treatment with the extract/finasteride boosted appetite, which had been suppressed during BPH induction.

The study demonstrated S. afzelii to be effective in ameliorating exogenously induced prostatic hyperplasia by causing extensive shrinkage of glands and stroma, and exhibiting antioxidant properties, supporting its therapeutic use in treating BPH by herbalists.
