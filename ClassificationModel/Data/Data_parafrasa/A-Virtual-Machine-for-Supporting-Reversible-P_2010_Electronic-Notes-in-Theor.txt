The symbol "h" represents choice in the context of the discussed constructs. Informally, the selection construct can execute any action "si" for which the corresponding guard "gi" is true. If no guard is true, the entire construct has no effect and acts as a skip.

While the analysis demonstrates the claimed functionality, the description of "sr" involves an irreversible step: "v:= e." The paper also discusses how purely reversible updates can be performed, and presents an analysis of reversible updates in terms of assignment statements, with a separate treatment of reversible updates in terms of injective functions provided by Yokoyama et al.

The Reversible Virtual Machine (RVM) is based on Forth, which offers a stack-based virtual machine and an interpreter allowing operations to be entered from a console or read from a file. A simple yet extensible compiler permits the definition of new operations in terms of existing ones. The RVM enables the use of local variables and nested scopes, with stack frames held on the parameter stack, although their use is not obligatory.

The virtual machine comprises a nucleus and a utilities layer. The nucleus definitions are written in either Forth or a structured version of GNU Assembler. Compilation of the nucleus generates a monolithic GNU Assembler program, which can be linked with programs written in other languages, primarily C. The nucleus provides an interactive Forth system that can extend itself through incremental compilation due to its ability to parse the input stream and compile code.

In RVM-Forth, a specific syntax is used for the choice construct, and the paper provides details on how backtracking and forward execution are handled within the reversible execution model.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the type theory and representation of types, declaration syntax, and operations within the RVM, along with a specific example illustrating the usage of the defined constructs.

Finally, the paper describes the implementation of the high-level nondeterministic choice construct in RVM-Forth using the "random-choice" operation, as well as addressing potential issues and considerations related to multiple independent random values.
