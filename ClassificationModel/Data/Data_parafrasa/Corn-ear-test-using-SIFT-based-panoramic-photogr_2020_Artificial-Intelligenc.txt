Several methods have been proposed for nondestructive measurement of corn ears, but there is a scarcity of techniques in this area. The application of machine vision and panoramic photography for corn analysis has gained traction in high throughput farming and is receiving growing attention.

The SIFT algorithm can detect and describe features in images, identify extreme points on spatial scales, and extract position, scale, and rotation invariants. The algorithm transforms image data into scale-invariant coordinates based on local features (Lowe, 1999). Its main components include detecting scale space extremes, determining key point directions, generating SIFT feature vectors, and feature matching (Lowe, 2004).

In this study, 10 corn ears were synthetically segmented, leading to varying numbers of connected kernels, which impacted the counting process. The adhesion of kernels was attributed to the similarity in grayscale values between the kernels and the gaps. To address this, a grayscale transformation was performed on the original corn ear area to enhance the contrast and facilitate further segmentation.

To isolate the irrelevant background from participating in the grayscale transformation, the distribution probability ek of each gray level in the corn ear area image was calculated. If the probability ek was less than a threshold g, the corresponding gray level was designated as fa, and the area within the range [0, fa] was identified as the background region. Conversely, if ek was greater than 1 - g and the corresponding gray level was fb, the area within the range [fa, fb] was selected for grayscale transformation.

The study utilized 10 ear corn samples, each labeled from 1 to 10, corresponding to different corn varieties. The results from manual and algorithmic tests for corn ear radius and length were compared across the 10 samples.

The algorithm measured the median of all connected domain areas in the binary image. The algorithmic test for length-width ratio was the median of the length-width ratios of the largest circumscribed rectangles of all connected domains in the binary image. The accuracy of the algorithm for kernel area was found to be 95.36%, and the accuracy for length-width ratio was 97.42%.
