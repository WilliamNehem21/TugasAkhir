Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), particularly in India, where the burden of CVD is known to be very high. However, despite consistent evidence from epidemiological studies on cardiovascular risk factors among adolescents worldwide, there is a lack of data specific to Indian adolescents. The growing prevalence of adolescent obesity has been identified as a major contributor to the development of hypertension in adulthood, and there is also evidence suggesting a genetic component to elevated blood pressure in children. Several studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and skinfold thickness with conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease in the Indian population. Additionally, ethnic differences in risk factors for hypertension have been documented in studies involving both adults and children.

Various anthropometric indices, such as BMI and WC, have been widely used to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and there is increasing advocacy for the use of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio, and skinfold thickness indices to assess adverse cardiometabolic risk profiles in adolescents. However, the performance of these anthropometric indices in identifying adverse cardiovascular risk profiles has been examined using different statistical methods. In this study, principal component factor analysis (PCFA) was employed to extract uncorrelated factors from inter-correlated variables in order to quantify the magnitude of cardiovascular risk among Punjabi adolescents aged 10 to 18 years in urban areas of Punjab, one of the economically advanced states in India.

A total of 3060 adolescent subjects (1530 boys and 1530 girls) were recruited from various districts of Punjab for the study. The study, approved by the ethical research committee of Guru Nanak Dev University, involved the measurement of various anthropometric parameters such as height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and skinfold thickness. The data were collected from adolescents enrolled in private higher secondary schools through a classroom selection process.

The findings of the study revealed significant differences in anthropometric measurements and cardiovascular risk factors between boys and girls. PCFA showed that the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors is more important than identifying any single trait due to the heterogeneous nature of cardiovascular-related phenotypes. However, the study has some limitations, including inconsistent loading patterns for different variables, the cross-sectional nature of the study, and the observation that certain risk traits with low eigenvalues were eliminated from the analysis but may still be important predictors.

This study contributes to the understanding of cardiovascular risk factors among Punjabi adolescents and underscores the need for further research in this area. It is important to examine the association between risk factors and cardiovascular diseases, and PCFA is a sophisticated statistical method for identifying these associations.
