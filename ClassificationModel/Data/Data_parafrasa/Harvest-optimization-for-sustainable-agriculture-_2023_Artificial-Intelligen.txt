The tea production process involves harvesting tea three times a year, with farmers starting their work from sunrise and continuing to harvest tea until the afternoon. The harvested tea is then transported to designated purchase locations, where it is weighed and the sales process is completed. It is important to consider the capacity constraints of the purchase locations and the factory in order to avoid issues such as sun exposure, which can lead to the rejection of tea by the factory and result in wastage. Efficient harvest scheduling with consideration of these constraints is crucial for maximizing national efficiency in tea farming.

In this study, a model for tea harvest scheduling is presented. The paper discusses the harvest scheduling problem and reviews relevant literature before presenting a sample application and the study's results. The model takes into account the capacity of purchase locations to minimize the number of expeditions and ensure efficient use of factory resources. However, the model does not currently consider the day preferences of the farmers.

The study evaluates the impact of considering farmer preferences in harvest scheduling. By randomly modifying the weekly harvest days for selected farmers and analyzing the resulting preference matrices, the study demonstrates that incorporating farmer preferences can improve the success of the scheduling model. It is noted that while the weekly success rate remains unchanged, the model that considers farmer preferences offers a more dominant solution, indicating the potential for minimizing the impact on factory resources.

Considering the capacity of purchase locations is emphasized as crucial for avoiding harvest losses, optimizing the use of receiving places, and maintaining the sustainability of farmer-factory relationships. The study also suggests the possibility of making low-capacity purchase locations inactive on certain days to improve shipping efficiency. Additionally, two mathematical models are developed for tea harvest scheduling, with one focusing solely on optimizing factory resources and the other aiming to accommodate both factory resources and farmer preferences. A case study is conducted to compare the scheduling models in terms of factory vehicle expeditions and adaptation to farmer day preferences.

The results show that considering farmer day preferences can increase the adaptation rate from 52.13% to 97.65% without changing the number of expeditions made by factory vehicles. This finding suggests that taking farmer preferences into account can enhance sustainability and incentives in agriculture without negatively impacting factory operations or efficiency.

The study also suggests potential areas for future research, such as including vehicle routing and personnel scheduling problems in tea harvest scheduling, as well as examining the effect of flexible purchase locations on farmers' adaptation rates. It is proposed that larger, more complex problems can be addressed using heuristic methods as the models become more intricate.
