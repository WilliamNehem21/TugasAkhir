The specification of a security policy that includes both permissions and prohibitions can result in conflicts, where a subject is simultaneously permitted and prohibited from performing a specific action on a given object. This issue has been explored through a comparative approach. Initially, we examined access control models based on rules, specifically rule-based access control (Rule-BAC), and identified weaknesses in managing conflicts within this model. Rule-BAC models were found to be inadequate in providing a decidable solution to redundant rules and potential conflicts. To address these limitations, a more structured model, called Organization-Based Access Control (OR-BAC), was introduced.

In the context of access control models that allow for both permissions and prohibitions, conflicts may arise, leading to situations where the system is unable to determine whether to allow or deny access. To resolve conflicts, it is necessary to define a conflict resolution strategy. This strategy determines how the system handles conflicts by either discarding positive or negative authorizations. As a result, the resulting access control policy depends on the chosen conflict resolution policy, empowering the security officer to define their own conflict resolution strategy in order to establish a relevant access control policy.

When implementing a policy, it is crucial to address conflicts to ensure that access can be appropriately granted or denied. A conflict resolution strategy involves deriving actual authorizations from prima facie authorizations, where authorization rules are associated with priorities to evaluate their significance in conflicting situations. Unrelated rules and exceptions are also introduced to address potential conflicts between permissions and prohibitions.

The OR-BAC model introduces an organizational perspective, where access control policies are specified using organizational access control predicates. Hierarchies of roles, views, activities, and contexts are associated with inheritance of permissions and prohibitions, introducing complexities related to conflicts management. Prioritized OR-BAC and automatic assignment strategies are suggested as approaches to resolve conflicts within the OR-BAC model.

Considering other works in this domain, various models have explored managing conflicts through different approaches, such as conflict resolution policies, modal logic, and possibilistic logic. Nevertheless, the integrated nature of conflict resolution strategies in the OR-BAC model provides a flexible and effective means of managing conflicts.

The advantage of managing conflicts within an OR-BAC model is demonstrated, particularly in the context of organizational-level security policies. The proposed conflict resolution strategy assigns priority levels to organizational permissions or prohibitions, addressing redundancies and potential conflicts. Moreover, the proposed approach is well-suited to address conflicts in the interoperability of organizations managing different security policies.

Future work may involve extending the approach to manage conflicts between administration rules within the context of adOR-BAC, an administration model for OR-BAC. Additionally, further exploration is warranted to address conflicts arising from delegation rules.
