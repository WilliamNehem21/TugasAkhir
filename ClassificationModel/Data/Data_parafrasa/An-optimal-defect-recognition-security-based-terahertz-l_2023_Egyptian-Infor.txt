This academic paper discusses the use of terahertz imaging technology, which is non-ionizing and has minimal side effects on humans, but suffers from poor resolution leading to blurred and noisy images. The paper proposes an accurate and efficient intelligent defects recognition method as a solution. The proposed method, called the dual-graph attention convolution network (DGACN), aims to improve defect detection in terahertz images.

In addition to DGACN, the paper also reviews various other techniques used for defect recognition, such as convolutional siamese point net (CSPN), deep feature interaction network (DFINET), and others. These techniques employ machine learning, deep learning, and other methods for applications in different fields such as medicine, security, and mining.

The paper emphasizes the need for a different approach to terahertz image defect recognition, focusing on using the differential evolution search algorithm for optimization. The authors also discuss the use of a residual network structure and object detection mechanisms for feature extraction and classification tasks.

Furthermore, the paper addresses the scarcity of terahertz image databases and the challenges of training models due to limited data. It describes the augmentation of the training dataset and the performance improvements achieved through this process.

The paper also compares different object detection models, including YOLOv3 and RetinaNet, in the context of terahertz image defect detection. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each model and the experimental results obtained.

Finally, the paper introduces the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for reconstructing blurred terahertz images to improve precision and recall in defect detection. It describes the process of preparing clear-blurred image pairs for training the GAN and references a method for generating synthetic clear-blurred image pairs.
