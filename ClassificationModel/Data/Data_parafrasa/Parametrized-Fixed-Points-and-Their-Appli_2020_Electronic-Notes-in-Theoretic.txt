The main idea of proposition 4.4 provides substantial information, and by delving into its definitions, we can derive several corollaries. The first corollary represents a specific case of [30, theorem 4.4.8] when the identity functors n and m are involved, and this corollary will play a crucial role in defining the interpretations of recursive session types in section 7.

In the context of programming languages, the ultimate purpose of semantics is to facilitate users in reasoning about programs. It is valuable to have a set of fundamental properties for the mathematical objects used to define semantics. In our case, the semantics of recursive types led to the introduction of a dagger operation in section 4, and we examined its 2-categorical properties. We now demonstrate how these 2-categorical properties imply a broad range of fundamental properties that are useful for reasoning about recursive types. In particular, we establish that they imply the conway identities [10, 12] up to isomorphism, and these conway identities in turn imply a set of properties that are beneficial in the context of programming language semantics.

The conway identities, along with an additional identity, serve to axiomatize the class of iteration theories [10, remark 3.4]. Furthermore, Hasegawa [20, theorem 7.1] and Hyland [5, p. 281] independently discovered that a cartesian category possesses a trace operator if and only if it has an external dagger operator satisfying the (cartesian) conway identities.

We define an o-category k as having strict morphisms if it includes zero morphisms and 0ab is the least element of k(a, b) for all objects a and b. We further define k to support canonical fixed points if it possesses an initial object, strict morphisms, and is o-cocomplete. The full subcategory of o, denoted as cfp, consists of o-categories that support canonical fixed points, and it is 2-cartesian closed [16, theorem 7.3.11].

In the context of semantics, for many of the categories utilized, the least fixed point operator induces a dagger operation that satisfies the conway identities. This work has been extended to 2-cartesian closed categories, and sufficient conditions have been provided for a dagger on horizontal morphisms to satisfy the conway identities. However, the 2-cartesian structure of daggers and the impact of daggers on vertical morphisms have not been thoroughly explored.

Simpson and Plotkin presented an axiomatic treatment of dagger operations that satisfy the conway identities, and they offered a purely syntactic account of free iteration theories. They also provided a precise characterization of the circumstances under which the iteration theory axioms are complete for categories with an iteration operator.
