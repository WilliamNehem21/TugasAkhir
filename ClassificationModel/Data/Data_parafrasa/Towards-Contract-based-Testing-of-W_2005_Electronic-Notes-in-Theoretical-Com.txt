The primary assumption is self-evident, as it is essential for all types of systems and can be validated through unit testing. The second assumption stems from the fact that loosely coupled distributed systems cannot be effectively tested through integration. Instead, the specifications need to provide adequate information.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the concept of design by contract. In Section 3, the application of this concept to web services is explored, along with the introduction of a visualization of contracts through graph transformation rules. Section 4 deliberates on the use of contracts for testing, and Section 5 provides the conclusion.

A contract delineates the obligatory actions of both parties, regardless of the means by which they are accomplished. Typically, a contract is defined by assertions and associated concepts. An assertion is a boolean expression involving software entities, stipulating a property they must satisfy at specific stages of software execution. For instance, an assertion might encompass the affirmation of a certain integer having a positive value or a certain reference not being void during runtime.

At the implementation level, a contract comprises a boolean expression in the implementation language, utilizing functional features (such as access to fields, method calls, basic types, and operations), and specific operators to denote pre-conditions (e.g., "pre") and post-conditions (e.g., "post").

Present-day web services predominantly rely on object-oriented programming languages. While most of these languages solely support syntactic contracts, some, like Eiffel, inherently integrate behavioral contracts with pre- and post-conditions, and invariants. Nevertheless, there are various approaches to augment existing languages with behavioral contracts, such as iContract, JML, or JContract for Java. An example of JContract is provided.

The foremost limitation of the first two levels lies in their difficulty to comprehend and articulate for humans. An ideal solution would be a visualization for contracts that facilitates documentation and communication among developers. The succeeding discussion centers on the model-level specification of contracts to elucidate the authors' concepts.

Design by contract serves as a formal approach to specify the behavior of operations. Employing design by contract at the implementation level embeds specification information directly into the code. However, it remains necessary to test the implementation against its specification, prompting the question of how design by contract can aid testing â€“ for instance, in establishing, selecting, and executing test cases.

The paper focuses on functional tests, namely black-box tests derived from contracts, which ensure that the delivered product aligns with its specification. Thus, it is rational to utilize the provided contracts for both the generation of test cases (i.e., sample input data) and for testing oracles (i.e., checks for output conformance).

Rather than manually deriving test cases, the authors contemplate using the Jtest tool by Parasoft for this purpose. Jtest, a Java-based unit testing tool, is designed to facilitate the testing of components before their integration into an environment. Jtest collaborates with JContract, analyzing its implementation-level contracts to generate test cases and oracles automatically, thereby enabling automated unit-level functional testing.
