Hyperspectral imaging spectrometers are skilled at gathering a vast number of wavelength bands within a given spatial area on a surface, resulting in high-dimensional data characterized by significant spectral information. This enables the differentiation of similar materials based on distinct spectral signatures. However, researchers have observed that the resulting high dimensionality of hyperspectral datasets can lead to the Hughes phenomenon, lowering classification accuracy due to information redundancy. To address this issue, two broad categories of methods, namely feature extraction and feature selection, have been proposed.

Feature extraction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), aim to reduce high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space. Conversely, feature selection methods focus on creating a subset of the original data by eliminating redundant features. In the context of hyperspectral remote sensing, these features correspond to the spectral bands. Selecting informative bands can effectively reduce dimensionality and enhance classification accuracy.

Mutual information (MI) techniques have shown promise in achieving high accuracy with fewer bands in hyperspectral datasets. This paper specifically investigates MI for band selection and introduces an algorithm for selecting informative bands from hyperspectral data while demonstrating improved classification performance. The algorithm's benefits include reduced false positives, swift band selection, and higher accuracy compared to previous approaches.

The paper consists of several sections. It begins with an overview of related works in hyperspectral band selection and classification. Next, it presents the architecture of the MI-Otsu method and explains the proposed algorithm. Then, the results obtained from the study are illustrated and discussed. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions.

The study proposes an adaptive MI concept integrating entropy and statistical methods to enable hyperspectral image fusion. The AVIRIS hyperspectral dataset is employed to experiment with different band cutoffs using kernel classification techniques. The MI technique is further enhanced by focusing on neighboring bands to avoid redundancy through the application of a complementary threshold technique. The study introduces spatial entropy-based MI to identify highly informative bands, with a specific focus on the AVIRIS Indian Pines scene dataset, resulting in improved classification accuracy.

Various approaches for hyperspectral band selection are explored, including search-based methods and clustering of spectral curves. Additionally, algorithms such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, pairwise class discriminability, hierarchical dimensionality reduction, and non-Gaussianity are utilized for band detection and classification. Techniques like Jeffries-Matusita distance method, interband correlation coefficient method, shared nearest neighbor clustering, and maximum information minimum redundancy discrete gravitational search algorithm (MIMR-DGSA) are also discussed, each presenting unique methods for band selection and dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral image classification.

Furthermore, multi-objective-based models, utilizing weakly Pareto-optimal problem and boundary intersection adaptive penalty-based approach, are employed for hyperspectral band subset identification. These models combine information measures and fuzzy rough set to select potential bands, as well as integrate determinantal point process search algorithms to identify informative band subsets.

The paperâ€™s comprehensive literature review emphasizes the role of MI in band selection for hyperspectral imaging and highlights the efficacy of Shannon entropy-based MI. The study demonstrates the use of various entropy measures, such as joint, conditional, and relative, to estimate MI and select informative bands.

The experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms, including MI-Otsu, demonstrates high classification accuracy on the AVIRIS dataset, particularly when employing relative entropy MI-Otsu. The results indicate the potential for improved performance through novel extraction or classification methods with selected bands, as well as nonlinear spectral unmixing techniques.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions to the field of hyperspectral band selection and classification by proposing and evaluating various algorithms to enhance classification accuracy and reduce dimensionality in hyperspectral datasets.
