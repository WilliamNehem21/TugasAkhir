To enhance the clarity of the forthcoming implementation section, we will recap the key concepts of the parallel algorithms being utilized. However, we will narrow the focus of our explanation to the algorithm for l1, opting for illustrative examples rather than formal definitions. For additional details, please refer to [cite sources].


The algorithms previously mentioned have been implemented in a system known as uppdmc, which is developed in C++ and leverages the message passing standard MPI for inter-computer communication. This implementation is independent of prior Haskell or C++ implementations and places a stronger emphasis on performance. The current iteration primarily serves to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of parallel model checking in practical applications.


While certain algorithms from [cite sources] can operate in an on-the-fly manner, the current iteration of uppdmc only partially utilizes this capability. Particularly in the measurements outlined in the subsequent section, our work is based on transition systems that have been pre-generated. This decision is driven by practical considerations - for the purpose of comparing our system with existing model checkers, we rely on the precomputed transition systems available in the VLTS benchmark suite. It is relatively straightforward to adapt our system to function in an on-the-fly manner.


The game graph module serves as the defining data structure of the model checker. Game graph nodes are hashed and stored based on their subformula to avoid redundancy in storing the subformula in each node. Grouping nodes by subformula simplifies the process of identifying the initial nodes of a component, as all initial nodes within a component share the same subformula. Notably, the parallel algorithm operates on components of the game graph in a sequential manner, underscoring the importance of having access to the initial nodes of components.


The labeling of nodes in the coloring algorithm follows a specific pattern. For instance, an or-node transitions to a green state when one of its successors is green, and to a red state when all of its successors are red. However, verifying the latter condition can be resource-intensive when successor nodes and parent nodes are located on disparate computers. Consequently, it is advisable to maintain information about the colors of children in the parent node to circumvent this issue. Nonetheless, in the context of our algorithm, a more efficient approach can be taken: the algorithm implies that successors change their color only once. Thus, it suffices to simply count the number of red and green successors, given that the total number is known.


The transition system and game graph data structures are engineered to offer reasonable time and memory efficiency, but they are not optimized from a memory usage perspective. Our primary focus has been to assess the practical viability of the algorithm rather than integrating it with more efficient data structures such as Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). This remains a potential area for future research and development.
