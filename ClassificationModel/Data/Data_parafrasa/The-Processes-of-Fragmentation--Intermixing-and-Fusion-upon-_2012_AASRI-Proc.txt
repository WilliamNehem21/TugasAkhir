Based on the findings from experiments on dissimilar metal joints, such as copper-tantalum and iron-silver, the reasons for the mixing of immiscible suspensions during explosion welding have been elucidated. The study revealed that the interfaces are not smooth, and instead contain inhomogeneities like cusps and local melting zones, which play a crucial role in the process. It was discovered that granulating fragmentation leads to the partitioning of initial materials, serving as the primary channel for dissipating input energy. In joints with metals possessing normal solubility, the local melting zones form true solutions, whereas in joints with metals lacking mutual solubility, they form colloidal solutions. The solidification process can lead to the danger of emulsion, causing delamination, while suspension can contribute to the dispersion hardening of the joint.

Moreover, in addition to the transitional zone, there are regions of copper and tantalum. TEM analysis demonstrated that these regions do not undergo melting and exhibit a typical structure resulting from severe plastic deformation, including cellular and stripped structures, high dislocation density, and recrystallized areas.

The use of different welding processes for the same copper-tantalum pair yielded valuable insights, as it was observed that the interface differed in shape depending on the welding regime. However, in all cases, the interface contained cusps and local melting zones, indicating its non-smooth nature.

The concept of granulating fragmentation, which occurs near the interface, was found to be distinct from traditional fragmentation, involving dislocation and twin generation, formation of different structures, and recrystallization, and occurring at a distance from the interface. This understanding of the two types of fragmentation forms the basis of a new approach to describing welded joint structures.

As an application of this research, a chemical reactor vessel scheme was created using carbon steel-copper-tantalum composite material produced through explosion welding. The inner shell, made of tantalum for corrosion resistance, was welded to the outer shell of carbon steel with a copper interlayer. The specific welding parameters differed from those used in the current investigation.

Finally, it is worth noting that this research received financial support from several organizations, including the Russian Foundation for Basic Research and the Ural Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
