This academic paper explores the use of bio-inspired features (BIF) for analyzing different facial parts to estimate human age from facial images. The study focuses on the eye wrinkles, whole internal face (excluding the forehead area), and the entire face (including the forehead area) using various feature shape points. The analysis reveals that eye wrinkles, which cover 30% of the facial area, contain the most significant aging features compared to the internal face and the whole face. The study also conducts extensive experiments on the FG-NET database by increasing the number of missing pictures in older age groups using the MORPH database to improve the results.

The paper addresses the challenges of estimating human age from facial images due to the wide degree of variation in both shape and texture, as well as the influence of factors such as expression changes, speaking, age progression, and lighting variations. Despite the potential useful applications of automatic age estimation, little work has been done to date. The age estimation framework presented in the paper is based on biologically-inspired features (BIF), which have shown promising results for age estimation and gender recognition.

The paper is organized into sections outlining the related work, the bio-inspired model, the proposed age estimation framework, and the results obtained from the FG-NET database and the MORPH dataset. Additionally, the paper discusses how age estimation is viewed as a regression problem in some works, where facial features are extracted by using active appearance models (AAMs) that incorporate shape and appearance information together.

The study also describes the process of analyzing eye wrinkles, internal face area, and the whole face using a specific number of landmark points, and outlines the construction of separate statistical shape models based on these points. The paper further discusses the process of fitting landmark points on incoming face images, as well as the findings regarding the coverage and importance of aging features in different facial areas.

Regarding the performance of the age estimation model, the paper reports the mean average errors (MAEs) for different facial parts in the FG-NET database and compares them to the errors of other methods. The results show that the age estimation framework using BIF performs favorably compared to other methods. Additionally, the paper discusses how the performance of the age estimator is enhanced by increasing the number of missing images in the FG-NET dataset age groups and proposes future work to explore more powerful modeling techniques for age estimation.

Overall, the paper discusses the use of bio-inspired features for age estimation from facial images and presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the proposed method.
