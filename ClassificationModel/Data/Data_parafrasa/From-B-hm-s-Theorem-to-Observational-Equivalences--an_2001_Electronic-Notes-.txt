The computational behaviors of terms can be viewed in two main ways. One approach involves placing the term within a context and observing certain properties such as termination. The other approach focuses on reducing the term to obtain meaningful information, which naturally leads to a tree representation of the implicit information contained in the original term. This paper provides an informal overview of the role of Böhm's theorem in these observations of terms.

The implication of Böhm's theorem is that, given a context c[], if c[] is such that a context like (xy:c[])i, where ix:x and (x:xx)(x:xx), then it is reducible to a normal form when receiving m, and diverges when receiving n. In other words, the theorem asserts that, given two distinct normal forms, there exists a context c[] such that c[m] converges to a value, while c[n] does not terminate.

The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, the behaviors of terms within pure-calculus contexts are examined with respect to different choices of what is assumed as the set of values. On the other hand, section 3 discusses calculus extensions that allow discrimination of terms in a manner similar to well-known tree representations of terms. Conclusions are drawn in section 4.

The term is computed by the leftmost-outermost strategy, where the term is first reduced to its head normal form, and then the normal forms of its subterms are recursively computed. The coinductive definition corresponds to the gradual building of the possibly infinite normal form by the same strategy, similar to how an irrational number is built by its successive rational approximations. This leads to the definition of approximate or partial terms, and correspondingly approximate or partial Böhm trees, denoted by "?" for the subterms that have not yet been computed.

Furthermore, it is noted that the nondeterministic choice operator gives too much freedom for replacing variables, which can be controlled by adding a standard numerical system. Additionally, the paper discusses different kinds of reduction, such as head reduction and weak head reduction, and their associated normal forms.

In summary, the paper provides insights into the computational behaviors of terms within different contexts and their connections to tree representations, while also discussing implications of Böhm's theorem in these observations.
