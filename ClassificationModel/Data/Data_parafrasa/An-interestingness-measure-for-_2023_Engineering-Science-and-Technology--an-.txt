It is essential to consider quasi-functions in the evaluation process, especially when individuals have received education from multiple universities, as standard confidence and PCA confidence measures do not account for this issue, causing them to underestimate the strength of a logical rule.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 discuss related work and preliminaries, respectively. Section 4 introduces a measure for evaluating all combinations of functions and quasi-functions in the body of horn rules. Section 5 presents the results and discussions on performance evaluation. Finally, the paper concludes and provides remarks for future work in Section 6.

The paper discusses the concept of association rules, where, for example, a computer and mouse are often purchased together or with a certain level of confidence. It stresses the importance of predefined minimum support and confidence thresholds for generating interesting association rules from a database.

The paper also delves into the differences between knowledge bases (KB) and RDF knowledge bases (RDF KBs), highlighting how the latter, also known as knowledge graphs, represent semantic data at an instance level.

Additionally, the paper discusses the distinction between functions and quasi-functions in a knowledge base, with a particular emphasis on the impact of quasi-functions in the body of a logical rule. It proposes a confidence measure, called "cor (categories of relations) confidence," which takes into account different types of atoms, considering both the functions and quasi-functions in a rule. This measure aims to address the limitations of standard confidence and PCA confidence measures by considering the impact of quasi-functions.

Furthermore, the paper presents an algorithm for calculating the denominator of the cor confidence formula, which accounts for the impact of quasi-functions in the body of a rule. The approach is illustrated through examples, demonstrating the importance of considering different categories of relations for assessing rule quality in knowledge bases.

The cor confidence measure is found to group instances of atoms according to the subjects when there are quasi-functions in a horn rule, effectively measuring the quality of a horn rule. It is shown to be more appropriate for evaluating the interestingness of a rule, especially when there are quasi-functions present.

The paper concludes by comparing the cor confidence measure with PCA confidence, demonstrating that the former provides a more effective evaluation by considering the categories of relations in the rule. It emphasizes that the cor confidence measure advances current research on confidence measures for knowledge bases by considering categories of relations for the first time.
