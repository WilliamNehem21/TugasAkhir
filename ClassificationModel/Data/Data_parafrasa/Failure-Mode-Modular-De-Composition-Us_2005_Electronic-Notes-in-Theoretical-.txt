This academic paper does not focus on the reliability of the system, such as mean time between failure, but rather on the potential resultant states of the system as a result of component failures. The safety of industrial plants, especially those that are potentially dangerous or explosive, is of greater importance than their reliability. The underlying principle is that a system should be capable of detecting faults and reverting to a safe operational mode without human intervention, enabling human assessment and repair of faults afterward.

Consider a complex system constructed from components grouped into modules, which are then combined to form sub-systems and eventually the final system. If each module/sub-system is modeled and has a finite number of failure modes, the significant number of checks to be considered can be significantly reduced.

For example, when a capacitor in the power supply fails, resulting in a high ripple noise level, this does not need to be individually considered for each component. Instead, it becomes another well-defined failure mode of the power supply, which must be taken into account in terms of its impact on other modules. Most modules, such as a heating element, would not consider this failure mode as a fault.

The paper discusses the use of predefined Euler diagrams as templates for generating more complex Euler diagrams. The work described here expands on this concept by introducing an additional stage, which involves converting a spider diagram into a new diagram where each spider is represented as a set. This new diagram is then included in higher-level diagrams.

The ability to have a default spider will aid in creating practical module models. For example, in the case of a power supply, for most combinations of failure modes, the power supply will simply not function, but for specific combinations of failures, it will operate in predefined but incorrect modes.

The subsequent step involves considering a system that depends on the power supply, such as a microprocessor. The microprocessor will operate correctly when provided with DC and will be damaged by mains voltage. It will not be affected by the presence of AC voltage for the heating element via the relay.

The relay can fail in two modes: it can become welded in the "on" position, or it can fail to respond to a turn-on signal from the microprocessor's IO line. The heating element can also go open circuit, causing it to stop functioning. The relay depends on both the microprocessor and the power supply (the AC part) to function correctly.

When dealing with double failure modes, the same bottom-up technique can be used to check for double failures within the components. This approach will likely result in the creation of additional failure modes per module, as the binary cross-product of failure modes will generally be larger than that of single failure modes.
