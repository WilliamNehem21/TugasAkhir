Numerous frameworks have been suggested for grid scheduling systems, with a focus on the autonomous behavior, intelligence, learning capability, and adaptability of agents. Specifically, agent-based grid scheduling addresses the development of software agents for resource discovery, job scheduling, resource management, and allocation of computing resources on a computational grid. This paper introduces a novel agent-based grid scheduling framework with high levels of robustness, performance, efficiency, scalability, and heterogeneity.

To achieve this, a flexible, scalable, and adaptive grid infrastructure is needed to enable dynamic composition of loosely coupled heterogeneous resources. One way to accomplish this is through the use of multi-agent systems, as agents can adapt to the grid environment and provide robust and scalable services. Hence, the proposed research introduces an agent-based robust grid scheduling framework for grid infrastructure that aims to achieve efficiency, performance, quality of service (QoS) provisioning, and robustness objectives.

Grid scheduling involves the ordering of tasks on compute resources as well as coordinating communication between them. This process can be divided into two phases: the selection of appropriate resources for job allocation and the placement of jobs onto the selected resource queue for execution.

While various initiatives have been undertaken to enhance the efficiency of computational grids, the proposed resource management system for scheduling jobs on heterogeneous and distributed resources (Nimrod-G) remains in its early development stages. In addition, an agent-based resource management system (Arms) for grid computing, proposed by other authors, employs a technique of service advertisement and discovery to represent local grid resources and provide high-performance computing power.

Furthermore, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning method called ordinal sharing learning (OSL) is suggested to address load balancing in computational grids. This method utilizes an ordinal distributed learning strategy and an information-sharing mechanism to achieve effective load balancing and scalability. However, this approach does not consider inter-task synchronization, dynamic scheduling, and robustness features.

The paper also proposes an agent-based approach to integrating services and resources, employing service and resource agents with behavioral rules that can be modified based on interactions with other agents and the operating environment. Additionally, a decentralized grid environment requires consideration, as resources are geographically distributed and owned by various parties, making centralized grid scheduling less practical.

In the proposed framework, a grid consumer, representing users of the grid, requests computing resources based on the nature of their jobs, which are then partitioned into computational tasks by an agent responsible for considering reliability, robustness, and availability of computing resources. A robustness agent is introduced to ensure the reliability of job execution and coordinate with robustness services to gather parameters and ensure task execution correctness, reliability, and completeness.

Moreover, a core grid management layer is established to implement agent-oriented robustness services, which monitor task execution and grid resource status, predict faults, and influence task scheduling in the grid. The primary aim of this framework is to provide a robust grid scheduler capable of handling uncertainties in a grid computing environment, thereby contributing to efficient and effective job computation despite the constant changes in the grid environment.

The architecture introduced in the paper involves three peer agents coordinating to provide input for a task control agent, offering the advantage of continuous input provision even if one agent fails. This architecture is designed to support a robust scheduler and is based on a hierarchical multi-layer and hierarchical agent-based architecture.

In summary, the paper proposes an agent-based scheduling framework for grid computing, designed to offer robustness and address uncertainties in a grid computational environment, such as the heterogeneity of jobs, resources, and network conditions.
