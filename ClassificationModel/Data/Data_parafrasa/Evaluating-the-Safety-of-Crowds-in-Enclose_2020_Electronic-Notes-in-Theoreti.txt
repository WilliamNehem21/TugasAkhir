This paper builds upon prior research that utilized Markovian agents (MA) to model and analyze human behavior in a closed environment during a panic situation. The new study introduces a more intricate scenario involving crowd movement in a stressful situation, managed through visual signals located in various office areas. Each individual has designated roles, and evacuation follows prescribed guidelines communicated to all members.

Abu Bakar et al. review various modeling techniques, including agent-based simulation (ABS), social force simulation (SFS), and a hybrid of the two, for fire evacuation in confined spaces. However, the actual simulation is deferred to future work. The article provides an in-depth discussion on modeling human behavior, dynamic crowd simulation, stress, and fear models. Different approaches, such as those based on the leader-follower paradigm, are also examined within the context of a collective adaptive system (CAS) through a leader's perspective and an agent acting as a follower. The model is further analyzed using the process algebra Paloma.

The study discusses cellular automata, based on a finite grid representation of the environment, for modeling obstacles and offers computational advantages. However, it may not be well-suited for applications requiring speed and individual tracing.

The paper introduces an intelligent reactive strategy, along with belief, desire, and intention, to enable autonomous decision-making in agents. These agents interact, react, and may collaborate or compete, contributing to the emergence of global states within the environment.

The utilization of Markovian agents (MA) is highlighted, characterized by stochastic behavior described through a discrete-state continuous-time finite continuous time Markov chain. MA's interactions with the environment are flexible, enabling a versatile description of obstacles and other features through message-based communication and individual perception functions.

The formalism of Markovian agents is explored to describe spatially distributed systems where agents have a finite number of states, and their dynamics are governed by transition kernels. Markovian agent models (MAMs) based on this formalism can capture distributed systems with distinct local behaviors for each agent.

The paper introduces the concept of parametric transitions, which represent events based on the agent's location and model actions induced by the operating environment. Additionally, the solution process is detailed, including state space computation and the generation of transition matrices for class instances.
