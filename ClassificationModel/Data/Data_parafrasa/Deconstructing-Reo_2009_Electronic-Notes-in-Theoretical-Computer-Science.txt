The coordination in reo arises from combining the behavioral restrictions of the basic elements, like channels, in a component connector. However, understanding and implementing reo has been difficult due to the interaction between the local nature of the channel metaphor and the non-local nature of constraint propagation through composition. This paper shifts the focus away from the channel metaphor and instead emphasizes the behavioral constraints resulting from the composition of basic elements in reo. It describes the semantics of reo as a constraint satisfaction problem, offering a clear and intentional description of connector behavior in terms of synchronization and data flow constraints. Additionally, this approach opens the door to new implementation techniques based on constraint propagation and satisfaction. By decomposing reo into constraints, a new computational model for connectors is provided, allowing for the modeling of interaction with an unknown external world beyond what is currently feasible in reo.

Reo is commonly presented as a coordination language based on channels, where component connectors are built compositionally from basic elements, typically two-ended channels. The behavior of connectors is described in terms of constraints imposed by the channels and their compositions. The constraints include the acceptance and offering of data by input and output channel ends, as well as the passing of data between channel ends in the direction of data flow. These interactions are constrained to occur only through the channels.

Constraint automata and connector coloring form the basis for semantic models, implementations, model checking, and visualization tools for reo. Constraint automata define the semantics of each basic element and their compositions, capturing synchronization and data flow in an automata-based model. Connector coloring involves assigning different colors to ends where data flows and does not flow, with each basic element having a set of possible colorings that describe its behaviors. The semantics of a connector is determined by matching the colorings of the basic elements, ensuring that data flows into a node align with the flow out of the node.

One challenge with existing research on reo is the limited consideration of interaction with unknown external entities, such as data transformers or filters whose details are computed externally. These external primitives are precluded by the current constraint automata models.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a different perspective on reo, where a reo connector is viewed as a set of constraints governing synchronization and data flow at the channel ends connected to external entities, rather than as a channel-based circuit. The paper proceeds to elaborate on reo, describe the encoding of reo-style coordination as a constraint satisfaction problem, and outline the reformulation of reo as iterative and interactive constraint satisfaction. It also presents related work and conclusions.

The paper also mentions the stateful channels fifoempty1 and fifofull(d)1 fifo1, which represent buffers with specific constraints on data acceptance and offering. Additionally, it discusses the interaction with primitives and the evaluation of function symbols in the context of the constraint-based approach.

The paper concludes by proposing future work to explore the efficient implementation and increased expressiveness of reo using constraints, as well as the potential for integrating other constraint-based notions such as service-level agreements. It also mentions the exploration of parallelism inherent in constraints.
