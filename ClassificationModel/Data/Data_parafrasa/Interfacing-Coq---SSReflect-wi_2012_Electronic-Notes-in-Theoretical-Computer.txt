Translating inductive constructions (PCIC) to Coq can be a straightforward process, but representing data from computer algebra systems such as GAP poses a central challenge. The objects of PCIC are terms, including proofs, which are constructed from smaller terms. The issue arises when interpreting non-PCIC data packaged in OpenMath objects, as this data may not correspond to terms since computer algebra data are typically given rather than constructed. This makes it difficult to provide a constructive proof of how the values in the OpenMath object were obtained.

It is possible to formally assign mathematical meaning to objects of Strong OpenMath, a subset of OpenMath, raising the possibility of mapping Strong OpenMath objects to PCIC through formal analysis. However, there is currently no apparent way to restrict or convert the set of objects generated by GAP to Strong OpenMath.

To faithfully translate an OpenMath object to PCIC without axioms, it is necessary to represent the object in terms of PCIC. For instance, if GAP computes a group of permutations, a constructive definition of such a group in PCIC is needed, rather than the likely external representation of the group as arrays of numbers in GAP. While it may be partially achievable by using existing group-theoretic definitions in SSReflect, many constructive objects of this kind rely on proofs of algebraic properties, making fully automated translation impossible. Thus, some form of user interaction is still required.

In a type-theoretic proof system, type-checking involves deciding whether a typing judgment is derivable according to the system's rules, which is generally undecidable. However, for most systems of interest, including injective ones, type-checking is decidable, and this task can be delegated to the type-checker module in proof assistants.

The mechanism provided by canonical structures allows for the application of a function to a well-typed term and partially unknown arguments, providing the known value of this projection applied to the arguments. Type checker uses purposely marked instances of records when attempting to solve unification problems.

A similar mapping from a polynomial to an OpenMath dictionary field should also be provided, with mappings represented by Coq terms containing the names of OpenMath dictionaries and dictionary fields. These identifiers are processed by a tactic to obtain respective string values for XML field names.

To represent an OpenMath object as a Coq term, users should define translation rules for the corresponding entries in the OpenMath content dictionaries in Coq. However, the representation of an OpenMath object in Coq largely depends on the context, making it impractical to have a fixed set of translation rules. Instead, users should be provided with the means to define appropriate mappings.
