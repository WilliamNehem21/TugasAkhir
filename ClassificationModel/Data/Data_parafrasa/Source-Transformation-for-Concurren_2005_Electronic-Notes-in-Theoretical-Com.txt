Concurrent programming presents distinct challenges for ensuring quality, with the complexities of deadlock, livelock, and divergence being particularly difficult to detect and debug. Various tools have been developed to aid designers and developers of concurrent applications, such as Verisoft, which is tailored to specific implementation languages like C++. 

The Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) package is commonly used for implementing concurrent applications in networked environments, such as client-server systems, within e-commerce and distributed settings. While Java RMI offers a higher level of abstraction by concealing low-level concurrency details, it does not exempt developers from addressing concurrent access to remote objects. Furthermore, concurrency issues with Java RMI may become more challenging to identify.

There are several tools available to assist in the creation of correct concurrent applications, some of which are based on abstract models for code generation, while others analyze the source code directly. Verisoft, for instance, can explore the state space of concurrent C++ programs and allows developers to specify invariant assertions alongside detecting deadlock, livelock, and divergence. However, it is limited to analyzing C++ programs with inter-process communication and does not directly support other programming languages and concurrency methods.

The paper elaborates on how Java code using RMI can be transformed into C++ code for analysis by Verisoft. The authors discuss the benefits of working with Verisoft, particularly its ability to analyze source code directly, reducing the likelihood of modeling inaccuracies and simplifying the correlation of analysis results back to the original code. 

Partial order reduction is also discussed as an effective technique to mitigate the state explosion problem by avoiding the examination of all interleavings of concurrent events.

The paper outlines the different tools and libraries used in the experiment, details the transformation process from Java to C++, and explains the development of a simple garbage collection algorithm for C++. Additionally, examples of the transformed code and experiments performed using Verisoft are presented, along with a discussion of related work, conclusions, and future directions.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the challenges and solutions in analyzing concurrent applications, particularly the transformation of Java RMI code to a format analyzable by Verisoft, demonstrating the potential of this approach for analyzing complex distributed systems.
