Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of numerous small sensor nodes with limited battery power. One of the most critical issues for WSNs is the development of routing techniques to conserve energy (1,2). Each sensor is constrained in terms of energy, processing power, and sensing capability. Therefore, a network composed of these sensors contributes to a more robust, reliable, and accurate system.

Excessive use of available energy leads to poor network performance. Consequently, energy in these sensors is a scarce resource and must be efficiently managed. In this study, we propose an algorithm to be implemented in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, where a Merged Layer Technique (MLT) for node deployment in the network assists in enhancing power economy in WSNs. In this approach, nodes are randomly deployed in two layers with the same energy and the same probability of head selection. The two layers consist of sensor nodes belonging to the same set but in different groups. Following the LEACH principle, the sensor nodes transmit their sensed data to the Cluster Head (CH), which then transmits aggregated data to the Base Station (BS). The Merged Layer concept network demonstrates superior results compared to the LEACH protocol.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews related work, Section 3 describes the heterogeneous sensor network system, Section 4 analyzes the sensor network model, Section 5 presents the MLT protocol, Section 6 discusses simulation results of the proposed protocol in terms of energy consumption, number of live nodes per round, separate base station location for two-layer sensor nodes, and comparative result graphs. Finally, Section 7 concludes the proposed algorithm and outlines future works.

Additionally, a Cluster Head Relay (CHR) routing protocol for heterogeneous sensor networks is proposed, which involves the use of two types of sensors to form a heterogeneous network with a single sink: a large number of lower-energy sensors and a small number of higher-energy sensors. The CHR protocol partitions the heterogeneous network into clusters, where both types of sensors work collaboratively to forward data packets towards the sink.

Furthermore, an energy-efficient cluster head election protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks is introduced to reduce energy consumption and balance the energy usage of cluster heads. This protocol includes a multi-hop routing algorithm for cluster heads and the integration of a minimum spanning tree algorithm, resulting in improved network lifetime compared to the LEACH protocol.

In summary, the proposed algorithms aim to improve the power economy and lifetime of WSNs through efficient energy management and the integration of heterogeneous properties.
