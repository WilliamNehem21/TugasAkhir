The research primarily focuses on the lazy, call-by-name calculus (CBN) within the untyped and simply typed settings. It presents a formal and detailed development of the theory of CBN within the context theory, demonstrating a small additional overhead in the paper's proofs. Additionally, the study compares this approach with similar case studies in other metatheoretical reasoning approaches for higher-order abstract syntax.

While there are trade-offs, one of the crucial theoretical concerns is the consistency of the axioms in any axiomatic approach. The paper proves the soundness of the theory of contexts and refers readers to a full proof of this consistency, utilizing a model of functor categories.

The theory of contexts effectively handles the metatheory of CBN, providing straightforward encoding of syntax, semantics, and type systems, with the exception of encoding substitution as a relation. This approach enables the statement and proof of fundamental results, such as the functionality of substitution.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the calculus of inductive constructions, an extension of the calculus of constructions, and explores its utility as a logical framework. It also addresses challenges related to higher-order abstract syntax and inductive types, particularly concerning exotic terms, and discusses the potential use of higher order constructors for types not defined as inductive.

The article also discusses Coq, an interactive proof assistant, and its usage for constructing and verifying proofs. It elaborates on Coq's features, such as top-down proof search and tactics, and its capability to ensure the soundness of proofs.

Moreover, the paper touches upon the encoding of a (capture-avoiding) context and the theory of contexts' two-part composition involving the definitions of "occurrence" predicates and the presentation of the -expansion axiom schema.

The work further extends the theory and metatheory of CBN by introducing simple types and discusses the derivation of the theory of contexts for the -calculus from well-formedness predicates in Isabelle. It also draws connections between nominal logic and the theory of contexts and discusses the challenges of combining higher-order abstract syntax and induction.

The paper emphasizes that the arguments presented in the research are applicable to proof assistants based on inductive type theories similar to CIC, such as Lego or Plastic. However, it notes that the theory of contexts is inconsistent with the axiom of unique choice (AC!). Finally, the paper explores interesting theoretical issues related to the use of the theory of contexts, pointing out that some properties of CBN do not necessarily rely on the entire theory of contexts and discussing constraints imposed by CIC's soundness for proving the totality of substitution.
