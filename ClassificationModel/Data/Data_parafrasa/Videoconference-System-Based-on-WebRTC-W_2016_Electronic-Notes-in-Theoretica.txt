This paper introduces a system featuring a unique videoconference room where three users can share audio and video using their web browsers without requiring any additional plugin downloads. Additionally, the system allows another user to participate in the videoconference by making a phone call from the PSTN to contribute their voice. This system leverages the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) API, which is part of the HTML5 specifications, to facilitate real-time communication and address network issues such as NAT (Network Address Translation) by enabling negotiation of media types and formats.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background information on the project and outlines related projects with similar characteristics. In Section 3, the principles of the approach are explained, while Section 4 details the operation of the system. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future perspectives.

Before WebRTC, numerous videoconferencing systems were available, such as Cisco Webex, which is a comprehensive solution primarily oriented towards the business sector. However, unlike Cisco Webex, the system described in this paper is based on WebRTC, requiring no additional software downloads for users. Moreover, while Cisco Webex relies on its own infrastructure for telephone services, the system in this paper utilizes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk, allowing users to utilize their own trunk and not depend on specific infrastructure or rates.

To connect with the PSTN, the system uses an Internet Protocol Private Branch Exchange (IP PBX) server running Asterisk software, which operates with a SIP trunk registered by a telephony carrier. An audio mixing and distribution module is designed to collect and mix the voices of users in the videoconference room, with the mixed audio then sent to the IP PBX using a SIP User Agent programmed with JSIP. At present, the prototype is limited to three web users in the videoconference room and can only handle one simultaneous phone call.

The open-source IP PBX server software Asterisk is employed to provide the web application with a connection to the PSTN. Since version 11, Asterisk has incorporated WebRTC functionalities, allowing it to send and receive multimedia streams through SIP over WebSockets. To enable WebRTC features in Asterisk, the libsrtp module is installed to add a security layer by encrypting media streams with SRTP (Secure Real-Time Protocol), as mandated by WebRTC security standards.

To initiate the system, the Asterisk server must be started before any other element and registered in the SIP trunk. Subsequently, the web and signaling servers can be activated using a command prompt.

The SDP messages exchanged between users when establishing a WebRTC session show the audio codecs supported by web browsers (Opus, G722, PCMU, PCMA) and the limited video codecs (VP8, H264).

In summary, this project aimed to design and implement a web application allowing the creation of a videoconferencing room with the capability to make and receive calls to/from the PSTN, with a primary focus on utilizing WebRTC. The project successfully demonstrated the unification of the telephone network and the internet, fulfilling the overall and specific objectives. It is concluded that a functional implementation of a videoconferencing room with an integration to the PSTN has been achieved.
