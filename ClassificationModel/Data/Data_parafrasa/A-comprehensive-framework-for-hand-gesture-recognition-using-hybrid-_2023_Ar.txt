An alternative approach, described in the literature, involves using raw data directly and applying machine learning (ML) algorithms to recognize gestures. This technique has been explored using deep learning with over 30,000 features, as well as using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM). Utilizing raw data offers the advantage of faster processing compared to conventional algorithms used for image detection, and with sufficiently large datasets, efficiency can be significantly improved. However, not all features extracted from the sensor are useful, and manually identifying the most effective features can be challenging. To address this issue, feature selection techniques can be employed to narrow down the dataset to specific features that yield the best results.

In recent years, metaheuristic algorithms have emerged as promising methods for solving complex optimization problems. These algorithms leverage intelligent search strategies and adaptive techniques to effectively navigate intricate search spaces and handle non-linear objective functions. Their broad applicability has demonstrated considerable potential in tackling various real-world challenges and advancing optimization methodologies.

To explore the effectiveness of these algorithms for gesture recognition, the study proposes a technique for dimensionality reduction using a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm. The reduced dataset is then fed into a deep neural network (DNN), which is further trained using the same hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for gesture classification. The remaining sections of the paper include a discussion of recent related work, details of dataset generation and pre-processing, a proposed technique for feature selection, classification methodology, and a thorough analysis of experimental results.

The focus of the study is on feature selection, which plays a critical role in enhancing the quality of features for various ML tasks. Dimensionality reduction techniques are crucial in data mining and machine learning, as they aim to select the most relevant subset of features from an original dataset, resulting in improved learning performance, model interpretability, lower computational costs, and greater learning accuracy.

The study also introduces a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called Spotted Hyena-based Chimp Optimization Algorithm (SSC) for feature selection, which outperforms existing algorithms across multiple metrics. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance, consistency, and stability in dimensional reduction for gesture recognition tasks. Furthermore, the study applies the SSC algorithm to train a DNN for gesture classification, achieving outstanding performance with a 98.7% accuracy rate, which highlights the effectiveness of the algorithm for optimizing the training process of complex machine-learning models.
