The advancement of drone technology has significantly enhanced the capabilities of flying vehicles, making them an important asset in modern society. With the anticipated increase in drone presence in the airspace, the likelihood of security incidents, including both malicious acts and accidents, is also expected to rise. Consequently, the need for establishing a framework for drone digital forensics investigations and standardizing the processes for collecting and processing evidence is imperative.

The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows. Firstly, we provide an overview of existing drone technology and relevant forensics tools, followed by a discussion on primary sources and types of evidence in drones, along with an overview of potential forensic cases. We also present a prioritized list of evidence for each case to aid the forensic investigator. In addition, we examine forensic models, standards, and the primary challenges in drone forensics investigations, followed by a gap analysis. The paper concludes by summarizing key findings and identifying open issues for further development in the field.

One critical component of a drone is the flight controller, which contains various sensors and software necessary for autonomous operation and complex flight scenarios. The presence of multiple devices in the unmanned aircraft system (UAS) provides ample potential for evidence collection, as each device likely has a storage unit containing details about the drone's activity and its operator. Moreover, the manuscript explores the potential cases of physical attacks involving drones, both as the perpetrator and the target.

The paper emphasizes the necessity of standards to ensure conformity and mutual compliance across geographical and jurisdictional borders. Although numerous standards and practices for digital forensics exist, none specifically address the unique challenges of drone forensics investigations. Furthermore, the lack of encryption and authentication in many drone models poses significant hurdles for forensic investigation.

The authors highlight the complexity of drone forensics investigations, given the unique physical nature and control duality of drones, which are not adequately covered by existing standards. They propose the need for a standardized procedure to conduct digital forensics investigations on drones, as the increased use of drones across various domains is expected to make such investigations commonplace in the near future.
