The emotional state of a learner in e-learning has generated significant interest in recent years. Predicting a learner's emotional state can improve learning outcomes through targeted interventions. Various techniques, such as video, audio, and bio-sensors, have been developed to anticipate emotional states, but they have limitations in ensuring privacy and security. To address these challenges, the authors propose a fusion technique called squirrel search and rider optimization-grounded deep LSTM for affect prediction.

The proposed deep LSTM model, trained using the new fusion technique, classifies emotional states such as frustration, confusion, engagement, wrathfulness, based on the interaction log data of the e-learner. The study analyzes the correlation between the course and student ID, predicted state, test marks, and course completion status. The proposed fusion technique outperforms existing methods, achieving a prediction accuracy of 0.962 and a correlation of 0.379. This improved performance can help students benefit from e-learning opportunities.

The emergence of e-courses has expanded learning opportunities and the sharing of educational resources. However, research suggests that e-learners may be less engaged and retain less knowledge compared to traditional in-person instruction. Monitoring student moods and engagement is more challenging in digital learning platforms, necessitating the development of predictive learning analytics to enhance the effectiveness of online education.

The study examines various methods and technologies for predicting affective states, such as data mining, cognitive science, multimodal learning, and psychology. It highlights the use of features derived from learner activity records to predict student performance and identify at-risk students. Additionally, the study introduces a new algorithm that demonstrates improved performance compared to existing methods.

The paper reviews previous research on affective state prediction methods and presents a novel approach for predicting affective states using a fusion-based technique. It also discusses methods for gathering and analyzing data to predict emotional states.

Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of predicting learners' affective states in e-learning environments and proposes a novel approach for achieving this goal. It provides insights into the challenges and opportunities in this field and suggests potential strategies for improving the effectiveness of online education.
