In ad hoc networks, direct communication between any pair of nodes within a single hop is not possible. This limitation, referred to as the "neighbors communication problem" by H. Shi and M. He, can be mitigated by selecting an appropriate graph structure that is applicable to arbitrary network topologies. Various clustering algorithms differ in the types of clusters they generate, some employing cluster-heads for cluster formation and maintenance, and possibly routing, while others do not utilize cluster-heads at all. Gateways, which relay messages between clusters, may belong to multiple clusters if overlapping clusters are allowed. Certain clustering algorithms create cliques, where every node is within one hop distance from every other node.

In the context of key establishment, a previously agreed-upon secret is required to encrypt the new session key. Key predistribution is another method, where the key is predetermined by the initial key material. It is crucial to prevent an active adversary from deceiving honest participants or gaining access to future session keys through compromised past session keys. The independence of long-term and short-term secrets is important when an additional long-term secret is present, such as private keys in a public-key algorithm or authentication passwords.

Terminating Gateway Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) protocol, known for its general key structure, can describe the key structure of any bipartite group Diffie-Hellman key agreement, where the resulting keys are used recursively as the new exponents. To enhance computational efficiency, the TGDH protocol has been extended to utilize pairing-based cryptography, specifically bilinear pairings in a ternary key tree, applicable to two-party and three-party key agreement protocols.

Arbitrary Topology Generalization of Diffie-Hellman (AT-GDH) utilizes a spanning tree that only includes the links used in the initial key agreement, effectively avoiding the neighbors communication problem by conducting Diffie-Hellman key exchanges solely with one-hop neighbors. AT-GDH can be employed in any connected network topology with bidirectional links, as a spanning tree can always be constructed in such a network.

However, AT-GDH does not incorporate group key management mechanisms or explicitly authenticate the resulting key. The number of synchronous rounds required for AT-GDH to gather and distribute the blinded keys is twice the height of the tree, which is assumed to be logarithmic to the number of nodes in the network. Di Crescenzo and colleagues offer a different perspective on the arbitrary topology problem by analyzing the performance of key agreement protocols in relation to the physical topology of ad hoc networks. This includes a topology-driven simulation of the logical network over any arbitrary ad hoc network graph, using auxiliary protocols to generate efficient embeddings of logical networks over arbitrary ad hoc networks.

A generic model for key establishment in clustered ad hoc networks involves nodes forming clusters, followed by the formation of a backbone or key tree from the clusters, and eventually initiating the initial key agreement. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange, whether bipartite or tripartite, is commonly used as a basis for group keying. Rhee et al. present a hierarchical key management architecture for mobile ad hoc networks, utilizing implicitly certified public keys and a two-layered hierarchy, while also proposing a multilevel hierarchy involving cluster keys and super-cluster keys.

Hybrid key management introduces clustered key establishment, where each cluster selects a cluster-head to engage in key agreement with other cluster-heads before distributing the key to the cluster. This method is efficient when dealing with large cliques, but it necessitates relayed messages and can impact communication complexity by adding extra links to the path.

Further research is needed to explore the efficiency and security of these proposed key agreement methods, and to address the challenge of group key maintenance in mobile ad hoc networks.
