fueled by the omnipresence of event logs in transactional information systems(cf. wfm, erp, crm, scm, and b2b systems), process mining has become a vivid research area[5,6]. until recently, the information in these event logs was rarely used to analyze the underlying processes. process mining aims at improving this by providing techniques and tools for discovering process, control, data, organizational, and social structures from event logs, i.e., the basic idea of process mining is to diagnose processes by mining event logs for knowledge. so far, process mining research has focussed on process discovery and process improvement. in this paper, we focus on the application of process mining to security issues.



the idea of process mining is not new[2,5,7,8,13,23,24,26,29,33,36] and most techniques aim at the control-flow perspective. however, process mining is not limited to the control-flow perspective. for example, in we use process mining techniques to construct a social network. for more information on process mining we refer to a special issue of computers in industry on process mining and a survey paper. in this paper, unfortunately, it is impossible to do justice to the work done in this area.
