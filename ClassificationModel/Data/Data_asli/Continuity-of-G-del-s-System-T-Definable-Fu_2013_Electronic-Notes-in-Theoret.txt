related work. the idea of computing continuity information by applying a function to effectful arguments goes back to longley, who passes exceptions to the function. a similar approach is described in an example given by bauer and pretnar.



this concludes the full, self-contained, mltt proof in agda notation, given from scratch. because mltt proofs are programs, we can run the two corollaries to compute moduli of(uniform) continuity of t-definable functions. because mltt itself has an interpretation in zf(c), in which types are sets in the sense of classical mathematics, the results of this paper hold in classical mathematics too. because



to illustrate the concrete sense in which the above formal proof is constructive, we develop some experiments. these experiments are not meant to indicate the usefulness of the theorem proved above. they merely make clear that the theorems do have a concrete computational content.
