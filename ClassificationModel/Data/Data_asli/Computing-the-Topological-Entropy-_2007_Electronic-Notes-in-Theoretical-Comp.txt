adler, konheim and mcandrew introduced topological entropy, being one of a couple of invariants of topological conjugacy. since then, topological entropy grew to a useful tool for classifying concrete dynamical systems according to conjugacy. later on, dinaburg and bowen gave a new definition using metric spaces. it turned out that both definitions coincide if the topology is generated by the metric.



x. due to the perron-frobenius theory of nonnegative matrices, the calculation of the topological entropy is possible for a wide class of shifts. therefore, the question arises if the calculation can be made effective. there have been several attempts in calculating the entropy of(general) dynamical systems, see sented, building the mathematical basis for computing the entropy. finally, in section 6 the focus is on the main subject: computing the topological entropy effectively. in the following section 7, a specific class of shifts is examined, having an easy to manage entropy characterization. the last section 8 is devoted to some discussion.



where a1,..., as are irreducible square matrices and in each block row> g there is at least one matrix with block column strictly less than the block row which is not the zero matrix. the normal form is unique up to permutations of blocks and of indices within each diagonal block.



there are n! different permutation matrices p for an irreducible n by n square matrix. therefore, following the steps of construction of the normal form presented in, it is clear that there exists an algorithm computing the normal form provided the matrix a as input. due to proposition 5.1, the following theorem holds.
