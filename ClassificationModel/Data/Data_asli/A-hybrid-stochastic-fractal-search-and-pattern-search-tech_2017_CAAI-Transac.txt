(itae), integral of squared error(ise), integral of time multiplied squared error(itse) and integral of absolute error(iae). detailed expression of various objective functions, their comparison on the system performance are available in literature[21e23,27,28]. it has also been shown in several studies that itae objective function provides better system performance compared to other integral based alternatives[35,36]. hence itae is chosen in the present paper as objective function which is expressed as:



process to generate random fractals. given an initial particle positioned at the beginning, new particles are then created arbitrarily in random manner around that point. diffusion process enhances the ability of algorithm to find the global minima, as well as avoids to be struck in local minima. in the next update process, the positions of points are updated in the group depending on the other points position in the group. in this process, few best particles from the diffusing process are taken, and the remaining particles are rejected. besides well-organized examination of the search space, the algorithm uses gaussian random approaches to update thus introducing diversification properties in sfs algorithm.



obtained in 25 runs are selected as the integral gains. in the next step, ps is applied to fine tune controller parameter. the final controller parameters found by sfs algorithm are used in ps algorithm as starting points. the ps is implemented with following
