the notion of trace in a monoidal category has been introduced to give a categorical account of a situation occurring in very different settings: linear algebra, topology, knot theory, proof theory... with the trace operation understood as a feedback operation.



partially traced categories were later introduced to account for cases where the trace is not always defined, and it was shown that partially traced category can always be seen as a subcategory of a totally traced one. we give a new proof of this representation theorem, using a construction that is different from the original one. however, since they satisfy the same universal property they are naturally isomorphic.



in section 3.2 and section 4.1, we will show that the original partially traced category embeds in this quotiented category, via an embedding reflecting the partial trace. finally, we show that our construction enjoys the expected universal property in section 4.2.
