because the complexity of large systems is normally uncontrollable, it is necessary that a method for developing such systems is compositional(vertically or horizontally) in order to avoid combinatorial explosion in specifying and verifying them, e.g.[10,19,3,2,16,4,5,15]. the compositional method allows one to build up a large system by composing existing systems with the defined constructors and reduce the problem of correctness for a complex system to similar and simpler correctness problems for the subsystems.



which we denote by the process p, for one production step. if there is a car available for p then p will either get the car, adjust the motor, mount the windscreen, control the car, and put the car on the conveyer band or p will get the car, mount the windscreen, adjust the motor, control the car, and put it back. then p may start again. the first option can be specified by



[4,5] studied the compositionality of a choppy logic, which is an extension of classic propositional temporal logic(ptl for short) by introducing a chop operator. defined a modal process logic which has compositionality. but the logic can only express regular properties of processes.
