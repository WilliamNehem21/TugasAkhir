way we obtain an(infinite) stream over 2={0, 1}. from this example we derive a general principle: fractal structure of a certain shape enables us to symbolically represent the shape, using infinite streams. the current paper is all about making this principle formal.



example 3.1[the module mi for the unit interval] the combinatorial specifiidentifying two points, one from each copy. it is made formal as the module mi cation for the unit interval i is informally: i is the union of two copies of itself, displayed below left; it is taken from. the display is according to the legend



remark 3.2 in[16, 17] what we have called a combinatorial specification is called a self-similarity system; and the induced coalgebraic fractal(i.e. a final coalgebra) is called the solution of the self-similarity system. their symbolic/combinatorial nature is not emphasized there.



the directions of further developments are different, too. in the current paper we focus on a metric extension, relating a coalgebraic fractal with a metric fractal induced by an ifs-like specification. in contrast, leinster pursues mostly a topological extension: he endows a coalgebraic fractal with canonical topological structure. based on this, in leinster presents recognition theorems: they tell if a given topological space is a solution of a certain self-similarity system or not.
