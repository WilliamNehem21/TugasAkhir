l-systems which were introduced in the seventies to model biological development initiated the use of parallel rewriting of strings and enriched both formal language theory and life sciences with major developments[4, 7]. splicing systems are another model recently introduced by head on biological considerations. these systems are intended to model certain recombinant behavior of dna molecules and are of current interest and study.



on the other hand, in syntactic approaches to generation and recognition of images or pictures considered as digitized arrays, several two-dimensional grammars have been proposed and studied. extending the l-system type rewriting to arrays, a generative model was proposed in. in, an elegant generalization of the concept of local and recognizable string languages to twodimensional picture languages has been done. recently, krithivasan etal extended the concept of splicingto arrays and defined array splicingsystems.



splicing system which is simple to handle is compared with other generative mechanisms of picture languages. some closure results under geometric operations and language theoretic operations are considered. the study initiated in this paper might prove useful to analyze better the structure of images.
