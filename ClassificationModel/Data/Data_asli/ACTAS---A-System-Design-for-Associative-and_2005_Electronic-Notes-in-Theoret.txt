l is recognized by a. to overcome the above problem there have been several studies, such as:(1) to find a subclass, i.e. sufficient conditions, of r in which regularity is preserved, and(2) to extend the tree automata framework so that a wider class of tree languages can be handled. decidable subclasses of such trs that effectively preserve regularity have been investigated in[16,17].



theorem 2.1[12,14](1) the class of tree languages recognizable with actree automata are closed under union and intersection.(2) the class of tree languages recognizable with regular ac-tree automata are closed under boolean operations.(3) the membership problem and the emptiness problem for actree automata are decidable.



the signature of the term model is specified by declaring ac-symbols(e.g. ac: f) and also declaring constant function symbols(e.g. const: a,b). according to the syntax, the other constant symbols are recognized as state symbols. the tree automaton a is specified in the second module, named a, example) and the receiver(bob), and then to send from the initiator to receiver a message encrypted by the session key. the protocol consists of the three steps: alice first chooses a number r and sends it to bob together with an integer h(k(alice), r). we suppose that no one else can retrieve k(alice) only from h(k(alice), r). at the second step bob returns h(k(bob), r) to alice. because of the exponentiation in the implementation of h, one can assume
