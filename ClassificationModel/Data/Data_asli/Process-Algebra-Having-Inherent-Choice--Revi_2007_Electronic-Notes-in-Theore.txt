process algebras, see for an overview, are standard formalisms for compositionally describing systems based, e.g., on synchronous communication on an abstract level by the dependencies of their observable communication. they serve as a domain for semantical foundations of programming or modeling languages and are also used as modeling languages.



in some settings the scheduler can be restricted by further constraints, like priority or fairness assumptions. they can be interpreted as a refinement of an abstract level where no constraint on the scheduler is enforced. this allowance to describe a more detailed scheduler is orthogonal to the problem of handling the interaction of inherent nondeterminism with the resolvable nondeterminism of an underspecified scheduler.



in probabilistic process algebras, see for an overview, choice operators are extended with a distribution determining the way the different sides are favored. randomized choice operators are special kinds of inherent nondeterminism. nevertheless, it is important to examine inherent choice operators, which do not contain a distribution, for their own, since sometimes the distribution is not known and sometimes it does not exist at all(cf. examples 1.2 and 1.3). note that approaches trying to embed pure inherent nondeterminism into probabilistic settings lead to unnecessarily complex models and thus unnecessarily increase the cost of verification.
