in this paper we first study the difference between weak normalization(wn) and strong normalization(sn), in the framework of first order orthogonal rewriting systems. with the help of the erasure lemma we establish a pumping lemma, yielding information about exceptional terms, defined as terms that are wn but not sn. a corollary is that if an orthogonal trs is wn, there are no cyclic reductions in finite reduction graphs. this is a stepping stone towards the insight that orthogonal trss with the property wn, do not admit cyclic reductions at all.



in particular, the reduction graph g(t) of t is a sub-trs. here the set of terms consists of t and all of its reducts. another sub-trs that we will use below is the family f(t) of t, where the set of terms consists of t and all subterms of reducts, i.e., the universe contains t and is not only closed off under reduction but also under taking subterms. it is important that sub-trss, including f(t) and g(t), are considered as trss in their own right, for which the usual notions and theorems apply, e.g., that orthogonal trss are confluent.



proof assume r is an orthogonal trs, t a term in r, and g(t) has an infinite reduction but not an infinite expansion. now suppose for a proof by contradiction, that t does not contain a term without normal form in its family. in other words, the sub-trs f(t) has the property wn. f(t) is an orthogonal trs, in which t is an exceptional term, because t has an infinite reduction and wn holds. so by theorem 4.4(ii) t is starting point of an infinite ladder. note that all the points in the ladder are in fact reducts of



proof let t be a cyclic term in r. suppose t does not have a term without normal form in its family. that is, f(t) is an orthogonal trs with property wn. then by theorem 5.1, f(t) is acyclic, contradiction.
