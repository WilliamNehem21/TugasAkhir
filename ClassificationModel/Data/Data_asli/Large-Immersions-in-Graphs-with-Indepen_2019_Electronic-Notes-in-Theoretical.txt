the minor order and the immersion order are not comparable. the class of planar graphs, while excluding k5 as a minor, contains all cliques as immersions. on the other hand, the class of graphs with maximum degree at most 3, while excluding k4 as an immersion, contains all cliques as minors.



however, the two relations do share some important similarities. both of them are well-quasi-orders, as proved by robertson and seymour[18,19]. additionally, if a graph g contains a graph h as a topological minor then g contains h both as a minor and as an immersion. possibly inspired by such similarities, lescure and meyniel and, independently, abu-khzam and langston proposed the following conjecture.



the remainder of this extended abstract is dedicated to the proof of theorem 1.5. theorem 1.6 relies on similar ideas, but is more complicated. we refer the interested reader to for the proof of theorem 1.6, and the proof of theorem 1.7.
