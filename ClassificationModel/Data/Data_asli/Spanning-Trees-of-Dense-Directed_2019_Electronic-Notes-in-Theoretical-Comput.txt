moreover, we can prove(by a simple application of the second moment method) that almost every tree satisfies case(ii) of theorem 2.2. this fact, combined with theorem 2.3, immediately implies that almost every tree is contained in every digraph of high semidegree.



we conclude this section describing how we can deduce theorem 2.1 from theorem 2.2. we first introduce a few definitions and a lemma. a path decomposition p of a tree t is a collection of edge-disjoint subpaths of t such that each edge of t is contained in precisely one path of p; we say that p is bare if each path of p is bare. in other words, two paths in a bare path decomposition of a tree are only allowed to intersect at their endvertices. we write p(t) for the smallest size of a bare path-decomposition of t, and l(t) for the number of leaves of t. in particular, if t is a path then p(t)= 1, and if t is a star then p(t)= l(t). it is not difficult to prove the following lemma.



recall that the statement of theorem 2.2 has two cases for the structure of t. the proof is different for each case, although both follow a similar outline. for the sake of simplicity, below we assume t falls into case(i) of theorem 2.2.
