various topological models are being used for studying concurrency. among them are precubical complexes, d-spaces[9,10], local po-spaces[4,8], and flow. for a given concurrent system, each of these categories provides a model which captures the relevant computer-scientific properties of the system.



on the local front progress has been made in reducing the path space of a given model using directed homotopies of paths and the fundamental category. one global approach is to pass to the component category[5,13]. in this paper we introduce another global approach, which is perhaps more geometric and which is compatible with the model categorical approach of.



the category pospace has all small limits and colimits. however it is too restrictive to model many concurrent systems(for example pospaces cannot contain loops). though all of our examples are in pospace a better framework for concurrency is the category lopospc of local pospaces. a local pospace is a topological space such that each point has a neighborhood which is a pospace and that these local orders are compatible(for a precise definition see appendix b).



unfortunately, unlike pospace, lopospc does not contain all small colimits. however there is a formal method of enlarging a category to one with all small limits and colimits. 6 furthermore this larger category has a canonical model structure! for details on how this theory can be applied to lopospc see the appendix and. in the appendix we give a more precise version of the following theorem(theorem b.4) which is proved in.



example 5.5 let a, b, c, b' and c' be as in the previous example, except that the marked points on b and b' are taken to be on the top edge, and the marked points on c and c' are taken to be on the bottom edge. let d' be the space obtained by attaching c along its bottom edge to the top edge of b.
