in section 4, we generalize topological-sheaf semantics of by applying(a). employing the same notations and the same types of semantic structures as in, we identify a right formulation of the notion of a sheaf that works not just over a topological space but also over a more general neighborhood structures. the resulting semantics subsumes neighborhood semantics with constant domains as a subclass(namely, of constant sheaves), bringing it to the sheaf level via(d). 3 moreover, it properly subsumes kripke-sheaf semantics as well, since the kripke sheaves are just the neighborhood sheaves with relational accessibility. thus, on the sheaf level, neighborhood-sheaf semantics subsumes and unifies not only topologicalsheaf semantics via(a) but also kripke-sheaf semantics via(b), in just the same way that neighborhood semantics subsumes and unifies topological and kripke semantics on the propositional level.



in subsection 2.1, we reviewed the common features of kripke, topological, and neighborhood semantics for propositional modal logic. in this subsection, we do the same for first-order logic. to interpret propositional modal logic, possible-world semantics takes a set x; we extend this, to interpret first-order modal logic, by taking instead the category sets/x of sets over x.



topological semantics interprets propositional modal logic by adding a topology and]= int to a set x of worlds. extending this, topological-sheaf semantics interprets first-order modal logic by adding topologies and]= int to the semantic structures we reviewed in subsection 3.1, namely sets over x; specifically, instead of taking objects, products, and arrows in sets/|x|, 8 it takes those in lh/x, the category of sheaves over a topological space x.
