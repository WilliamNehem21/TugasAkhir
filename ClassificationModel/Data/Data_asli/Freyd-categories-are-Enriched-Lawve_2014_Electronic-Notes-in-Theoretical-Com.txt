definition 2.1 a doctrine is a set d of small categories. a d-limit is a limiting cone whose diagram is indexed by a category in d. dually a d-colimit is a colimiting cone whose diagram is indexed by a category in d. we write dop for the doctrine



the relationship between monoidal actions and enrichment is widely understood(e.g.) and has proved useful in studying algebraic theories and notions of computation(e.g.,[10, ch. 6],,). proposition 2.7 is the main step towards our two main theorems.



c(x, y)= v(i, c(x, y)). an enrichment of an ordinary category c in v is defined to be a v-enriched category c whose underlying ordinary category is c. for example, if v is a symmetric monoidal closed category, then the closed structure provides an enrichment of v in itself.
