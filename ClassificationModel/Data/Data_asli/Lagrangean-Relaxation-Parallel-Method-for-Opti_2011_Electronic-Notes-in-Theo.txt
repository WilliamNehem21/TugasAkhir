lagrangean relaxation, as mentioned in[14,15] was used in the implementation of an exact algorithm for tsp, later on it was successfully employed for solving other problems. as stated in[7,12,9], lr was established as a powerful tool. in[13,23,28], detailed information can be found on the lr technique as well as a rich variety of additional references.



summarizing, lr is a technique which uses concepts from the duality theory[18,27] to deal in especial way with a set of constraints of a given problem. the constraints considered complex are transferred to the objective function which is assessed through especial penalty parameters called lagrangean multipliers. thus a primal problem is transformed into a relaxed problem, where the structure of resulting constraints, in general, generates sub-problems which can be solved with greater ease than the primal problem.



. the feasible region of the problem is bound by the constraints(2),(3) and the others which include integrality and non negative constraints, here represented by the set x. it is assumed that the problem would be easily solved in the absence of constraints(2).



the planning and discretization horizons obviously define the size of the problem to be dealt with, since the larger the planning and discretization horizons the larger the amount of data and the larger the dimension of the problem. in a parallel environment is used to deal with the problem in question and it was considered as a motivation to approach the parallelization of the heuristic method discussed in this paper. however unlike what was presented in the aforementioned proposal here the parallelization implemented is the lagrangean relaxation in terms of sub-problem cg to solve which a master-slave model is implemented on a cluster of work station linked by a network.
