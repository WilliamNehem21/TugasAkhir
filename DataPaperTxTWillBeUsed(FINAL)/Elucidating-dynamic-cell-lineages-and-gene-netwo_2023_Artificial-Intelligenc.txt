Dynamic Gene Networks
Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies provide researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to exploit cell heterogeneity. For example, the sequenced cells belong to various cell lineages, which may have different cell fates in stem and progenitor cells. Those cells may differentiate into various mature cell types in a cell differentiation process. To trace the behavior of cell differentiation, researchers reconstruct cell lineages and predict cell fates by ordering cells chronologically into a trajectory with a pseudo-time. However, in scRNA- seq experiments, there are no cell-to-cell correspondences along with the time to reconstruct the cell lineages, which creates a significant challenge for cell lineage tracing and cell fate prediction. Therefore, methods that can accurately reconstruct the dynamic cell lineages and predict cell fates are highly desirable.
In this article, we develop an innovative machine-learning framework called Cell Smoothing Transformation (CellST) to elucidate the dynamic cell fate paths and construct gene networks in cell differentiation processes. Unlike the existing methods that construct one single bulk cell trajectory, CellST builds cell trajectories and tracks behaviors for each individual cell. Additionally, CellST can predict cell fates even for less frequent cell types. Based on the individual cell fate trajectories, CellST can further construct dynamic gene networks to model gene-gene relationships along the cell differentiation process and discover critical genes that potentially regulate cells into various mature cell types.





Introduction

A comprehensive understanding of complex biological processes such as tissue development and regeneration requires the investigation of cell differentiation across a wide range of samples and experimental time points [1]. The cell differentiation process includes the differen- tiation of stem cells into different mature cell types [2,3]. Such a pro- cess is dynamic and continuous, including rapid changes in gene expres- sions and cell types over time. To profile such cell differentiation behav- iors, single cell RNA-seq sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has been developed rapidly [4‚Äì7]. In particular, scRNA-seq enables researchers to observe the gene expressions of all cells simultaneously (Fig. 1a) in both static or time-course experiments (Fig. 1b). The static scRNA-seq experiment takes a snapshot of all cells and their gene expressions at one time [8,9], whereas the time-course scRNA-seq experiments take snapshots at multiple time points. Using scRNA-seq, researchers can ob- serve the behavior of individual cells in cell differentiation processes
over time. Cell lineage tracing has been widely used to predict dynamic cell fates by indicating the ancestor and posterity cells in cell differenti- ation processes. For example, during a stem cell differentiation process, the multipotent stem cells can develop into multiple cell lineage end- points (Fig. 1c). Despite the effectiveness, quantifying the dynamic cel- lular changes of cell development is still challenging due to the following technical limitations [10]. In time-course scRNA-seq experiments, cells are sacrificed and sequenced at each time point. Thus there is no cell- to-cell correspondence information for cells between two time points, which creates a significant challenge in constructing cell lineages and elucidating the dynamic cell behaviors in the differentiation process. Moreover, it is very challenging to align different cells sequenced in two adjacent time points since expressions of cells are high-dimensional and noisy, and the number of cells in each time point is large. Such a large sample and high-dimensional and noisy data problem render many classical methods, such as Euclidean distance or Pearson correlation, invalid [11,12].

One natural approach to surmount the challenges is to order cells into a continuous cell trajectory. Many methods have been proposed to achieve this goal in static scRNA-seq experiments. In these methods, re- searchers construct a pseudotime to order cells chronologically [13‚Äì19]. Despite their effectiveness, such methods may fail in the following cir- cumstances [20]. First of all, most existing trajectory inference methods construct a bulk cell trajectory, i.e., the mean trajectory of the popula- tion cells across time rather than that of individual cells.
However, some individual cells‚Äô behaviors may oscillate up and down around their mean expressions or severely deviate from them. Cell differentiation behaviors are dominated by cells with major cell types, and patterns with less frequent might be hidden in the dataset. Sec- ond, individual cell developing trajectories may follow different com- plex topologies, including loops or alternative paths during the devel- opment. For example, analysis approaches in [21], and [22] used dimen- sion reduction methods to identify a low-dimensional space of the gene expression space before constructing cell trajectories [23,24]. Those methods may introduce a significant bias and are hard to validate, as cells are ordered based only on the selected reduced dimensions. Fi- nally, the cells may not be synchronized at the same developing time points. Cells within the same time point can be expressed at different developing stages. In this situation, the bulk cell trajectory that takes the average pattern of cells at different stages might result in unreliable scientific discovery.
In this article, we propose a novel analysis framework named Cell Smoothing Transformation (CellST) to overcome the aforementioned limitations. The CellST framework elucidates dynamic cell fates and con- structs gene networks in the cell differentiation process. In the CellST framework, we propose a cell lineage tracing method, which aligns two individual cells between any adjacent two time points via the optimal transport technique. The optimal transport technique is a mathemati- cal tool initially developed to identify the transport map between two probability measures with the minimum transport cost [25]. Recently, this technique has gained increasing importance in various applications such as subsampling [61], suÔ¨Écient dimension reduction [59], feature screening [57], and graph comparison [55]. Consequently, it has be- come a powerful tool for modeling cell dynamics [27‚Äì29]. See Zhang et al. [29,60] for recent reviews. Those aligned cells can potentially rep- resent individual cell lineages, tracing cell differentiation behaviors by constructing cell-to-cell trajectories (Fig. 1d). We then use a smoothing spline model to predict cell fate trajectories and reduce both cell-cell variations. The smoothing spline method models the gene expression patterns in the aligned cell lineages from the previous step and builds the estimated individual cell fate trajectories. Lastly, we narrow down our focus to utilize the gene expression patterns from those cell fate trajectories to construct dynamic gene networks (Fig. 1e). The dynamic gene networks are constructed by estimating the dynamic relationship of pairwise gene expression patterns using the functional concurrent mod-

Our major contribution is developing the first analysis framework (CellST) to construct cell lineages and predict dynamic cell fates at the individual cell level, which can help researchers better observe cell be- haviors in the differentiation process. In contrast, the existing methods only estimate the bulk trajectory in scRNA-seq experiments. Those anal- ysis methods may overlook the hidden patterns in the cell differentiation process to create a spurious cell differentiation trajectory. We illustrate this problem by using a simulated time-course cell dataset indicating the disadvantage of bulk cell trajectories (Fig. 2). The cell-to-cell tra- jectories are able to overcome the disadvantage and identify the real gene expression patterns in cell development. Under some cell develop- ment and differentiation circumstances, cells‚Äô average expressions show an increasing pattern if we only construct one average cell trajectory to order cells (Fig. 2a). However, when individual cells are aligned at different time points, the individual cell lineages‚Äô average expressions reflect unique decreasing patterns, which are in contrast to the bulk tra- jectory (Fig. 2b). This means some cells start at a lower expression level, and the expression keeps going down over time. Those cell development patterns can be easily misled by the average cell trajectory and thus re- flect spurious cell differentiation behaviors. Furthermore, we propose the dynamic gene networks based on the individual cell fate trajecto- ries to estimate the dynamic gene-gene relationship and critical genes in the differentiation process. The empirical performance of the pro- posed framework is evaluated by several simulated and real experiment studies.

We define the optimal transport map ùêìùë° ‚à∂ ‚Ñùùëë ‚Üí ‚Ñùùëë , where ‚Ñùùëë can be interpreted as the domain space for ùê±ùë° or ùê±ùë°+1. In this optimal transport problem, one constraint for the transportation map ùêìùë° from a measure ùúáùë° to a measure
ùúáùë°+1 is the so-called measurement-preserving, i.e., ùêìùë°#ùúáùë° = ùúáùë°+1. Among
all the measurement-preserving maps, the optimal ùêìùë° is the one that
minimizes the transportation cost.
Since we can only observe gene expressions for sample cells at each time point, we focus on the case where the probability distributions are
discrete. The distributions ùúáùë° and ùúáùë°+1 for gene features at time points ùë°
and ùë° + 1 are defined as:

ity, we first consider the equal-size mapping, i.e., ùëõùë° = ùëõùë°+1 = ùëõ. Notice that in this case, the transport between ùêóùë° and ùêóùë°+1 is a one-to-one as- signment with permutation, Œ£ then can be regarded as a permutation matrix with the (ùëñ, ùëó)th element:

work can be modified to account for more general cell-to-cell relation- ships. Specifically, we consider the following two general scenarios. First, the number of cells may vary at different time points, and as a result, some cells may need to be reused when constructing cell-to-cell lineages. This can lead to multiple lineages passing through a single cell at specific time points. Second, cells may exhibit different proliferation rates at the same time points, i.e., the numbers of new cells produced by two cells at the same time point could be significantly different. This could result in the varying proportions of cell groups across time. To ad- dress these general assumptions, we present a comprehensive discussion of our generalized methods and experimental results in the supplemen- tary materials.

related to the choosing of the smoothing parameter ùúÜ. We choose the smoothing parameter ùúÜ and estimate random effect ùêõ by Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) [31,34]. Since there are ùëë gene expression pat- terns over ùë° time points for the cell fate trajectories, the smoothing spline
model estimates one expression pattern for individual cells and smooths the expression patterns.

The cell alignment and cell-to-cell corre- spondences were constructed using the CellST based only on the gene expression information of cells at each time point and no information

2.2. Test diÔ¨Äerentially expressed genes
We integrate a functional ANOVA test method [35] in our frame- work to estimate deferentially expressed genes based on the con- structed cell fate trajectories. For each gene in those cell fate tra- jectories, we consider independent vectors of the random function
to learn the patterns of genes when more genes are simulated in each cell. Similarly, increasing cell numbers will also increase the aligning accuracy since cells can be treated as information replicates to enhance the accuracy. We also compared the accuracy of coupled cells with the Euclidean distance and Pearson‚Äôs correlation. Those two methods are the most commonly used distances or similarity measures for gene ex- pression analysis. [40‚Äì42]. The accuracy comparison results (Fig. 3b) show the CellST method achieves the best cell aligning accuracy in the simulation settings. In summary, the cell aligning method achieves high accuracy and captures the significant gene expressions when aligning cells and constructing individual cell correspondences at two different time points. Accurate cell alignment is crucial for the down-streaming

CellST estimate cell fates in two simulated pathways
To investigate the effectiveness in predicting the individual cell fates, we simulated a time-course scRNA-seq data with 13 experimental time stamps, and 160 cells were simulated at each time stamp. This simu- lation dataset has two pathways with distinct development expression patterns, and each pathway contains 100 genes. The first pathway was created using the contact inhibition genes that keep cells growing into only a layer one cell thick (mono-layer) [43,44].

Results

We evaluated the performance of the CellST framework on cell lin- eage tracing and cell fate prediction in both simulated and real scRNA- seq experiments. The simulation analysis was conducted in two sce- narios: Firstly, we simulated scRNA-seq datasets with cells at two time points to only investigate the accuracy of constructed cell-to-cell corre- spondence between time points. Secondly, we simulated a time-course scRNA-seq dataset with multiple time points to examine individual cell differentiation patterns in the cell fate trajectories. For real scRNA-seq
an equilibrium expression over time. We simulated the second pathway according to the cellular division process, which is more active in cells under mitosis and less active in cells in interphase [45]. Eighty cells con- tain only the contact inhibition pathway at each time point, and eighty cells contain only the cellular division pathway.
To observe and predict the dynamic cell fates, we utilized cells‚Äô experimental time information and built individual cell fate trajecto- ries using CellST. The cell lineages between adjacent time points were constructed using cell lineage tracing in CellST (Fig. 4a). Those con- nected cells were then smoothed using the smoothing spline technique in CellST to estimate the cell fate trajectories. Fig. 4b illustrates the es- timated individual cell fate trajectories (red curves). Based on the two distinct pathways, the two types of cells are automatically well sepa- rated by CellST. The expressions of cell fate trajectories were compared

with the benchmark pathway expression patterns (black curves). The expression of cell fate trajectories illustrates consistent patterns with the benchmark expression of the two simulated pathways over time. In addition to the consistency, we observed that cells have unique behav- iors over time from the cell fate trajectories. Some cells grow slower and have lower expression values, while others grow faster and have higher expression values than the simulated average development pat- terns. The cell fate trajectories predict the unique cell development be- haviors by smoothing the constructed cell lineages to reduce cell-cell variance.
Next, we performed a comparative analysis of CellST with the ex- isting trajectories analysis method ‚Äútradeseq‚Äù [46]. The ‚Äútradeseq‚Äù is a trajectory-based method to estimate the dynamic expressions of dif- ferentially expressed genes. By comparing the gene expression patterns constructed by CellST and tradeseq (Fig. 4c), we notice that the tradeseq method constructed two similar expression patterns for a simulated gene expression (dotted curves), while the CellST method built two distinct expression patterns (black and red curves). Those constructed dynamic gene expression curves by CellST are also consistent with the simulated benchmark expressions by showing distinct expression patterns. When constructing the cell fate trajectories, the CellST method can automati- cally classify cells that contain different pathway expressions and con- struct cell correspondences within the same pathway.

Real scRNA-Seq Experiments

CellST construct accurate cell lineages
We applied the proposed method on a single cell mouse hematopoi- etic system experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of constructing cell lineages [47]. The dataset includes three experimental time points and the cells defined a continuous state map spanning from multipotent
progenitors (MPPs) to nine mature cell types, including erythrocytes (Er), megakaryocytes (Mk), basophils (Ba), mast cells (Ma), eosinophils (Eos), neutrophils (Neu), monocytes (Mo), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), Ccr7+ migratory DCs (migDCs), and lymphoid precursors (Ly) (Fig. 5a). We constructed the cell developing lineages for neutrophils (Neu) cell type and compared the results with the benchmark cell pseudo-time from the original experiment (Fig. 5a). CellST connected cells through the three experimental time points to represent the de- veloping process‚Äôs penitential cell lineages. Specifically, we estimated an empirical transportation cost for the individual cell correspondence between two time points using the gene expressions in cells and then aligned cells by selecting pairs with the smallest transportation cost.
Since cell development is a gradual process and cells within the adja- cent time points tend to have similar gene expression profiles, we mea- sured the differences from cell pseudo-time in all constructed cell lin- eages. We compared the distribution of cell pseudo-time with Pearson‚Äôs correlation method, which has been widely used to measure similar- ity between two cells [40‚Äì42]. Comparing with Pearson‚Äôs correlation method, we observed that CellST constructs cell lineages with higher cell similarities, in which the changes in pseudo-time of connected cells are gathering near zero (Fig. 5b and c). The results indicate that CellST can observe the gradually step-wise developing behaviors of cells at each time point. CellST constructed cell lineages based on the cell-cell correspondence connection to represent the cell-developing behaviors throughout the time points.

Discover critical genes in zebrafish cell embryogenesis

To further investigate individual cell differentiation behaviors and gene-gene relationships, we performed CellST on a zebrafish embryoge- nesis scRNA-seq dataset. This dataset contains 38,731 cells and 11,588

genes of early zebrafish development using Drop-seq [39]. Samples in the dataset are from the high blastula stage (3.3 hours post-fertilization) when most cells are pluripotent, to the six-somite stage (12 hours post- fertilization), when many cells have differentiated into different cell types. We observed that cells were clustered together at the beginning high blastula stage and differentiated into different cell types in later development stages. Since we are constructing cell trajectories for mul- tiple cell types simultaneously, the proliferation rates potentially vary across cells. To address this, we utilize our generalized CellST method to construct cell fate trajectories (Fig. 6a), which capture the unique individual cell development behaviors under more general scenarios. This method also enables us to estimate the proliferation rate for each individual cell. The histograms of the normalized proliferation rates at different time points are presented in Fig. 6b. Note that the mean of the normalized proliferation rates at each time point equals 1, while the variance indicates the heterogeneity level of the proliferation rates among cells at the corresponding time point. We notice that this hetero- geneity is significantly high in the early stages of the cell differentiation process and decreases gradually over time.
Unlike the bulk cell trajectory, the CellST cell fate trajectories
achieved full cell development coverage for all cells. The full coverage indicates that the cell fate trajectories can reveal less frequent cell de- velopment patterns overlooked by the bulk cell trajectory. The CellST
constructed cell fate trajectories throughout the stages and illustrated the unique individual cell development behaviors. The cell fate trajec- tories return each cell‚Äôs potential cell fate paths into different cell types throughout the 12 developmental stages.
Furthermore, as cells developed into multiple cell types at the 12.0- 6-somite stage (last developmental stage), we built trajectory groups to those cell fate paths by CellST according to the cell types in the last developmental stage. We constructed the dynamic gene networks (Fig. 6c) for each group of cell fate trajectories. In those dynamic net- works, we observed some genes that behave significantly differently from other genes (Fig. 6c) as cells developed into different cell types. For instance, MYF5, MYOD1, and KRT18 genes appeared to behave dif- ferently in two of the trajectory groups in later developmental stages. The MYF5 is a protein with a key role in regulating muscle differen- tiation or myogenesis, specifically the development of skeletal muscle [48,49], and MyoD1 is a key regulator that orchestrates skeletal mus- cle differentiation through the regulation of gene expression [50,51]. Moreover, KRT18 regulates the epithelial cell differentiation process [52,53].
We then visualized and validated the expressions of those critical genes (Fig. 6d and Fig. 6e). The expressions of MYF5 and MYOD1 genes are significantly higher in trajectory group 5 versus in other trajectory groups, which is consistent with the discovery in the CellST dynamic

networks. KRT18 is highly expressed in trajectory group 15, which is also consistent with the CellST dynamic network results. Additionally, we performed functional deferentially expressed gene tests based on the CellST cell fate trajectories. We discovered a total of 268 differentially expressed genes in this zebrafish cell development process dataset. We performed gene ontology annotations to those genes (Table 1), and the function of those genes is highly related to regulating the cell develop- ment/differentiation process.
Those results proved that the cell fate trajectories and dynamic gene networks in the CellST method can be used to discover critical genes in a cell differentiation process. We also demonstrated the CellST cell fate trajectories have full coverage on different cell lineages even in some rare cell types since the trajectories track individual cell behav- iors. Lastly, those individual cell fate trajectories reflect unique gene expression patterns when cells develop into different mature cell types.

Discussion

Understanding the dynamic of cell differentiation throughout a pe- riod is crucial for future research in scRNA-Seq analysis. We devel- oped a novel machine learning analysis framework, CellST, to build cell fate trajectories and dynamic gene networks for time-course scRNA-seq datasets. The cell fate trajectories enabled researchers to observe the individual cell development behaviors and better use the benefit of the single cell sequencing technology. Compared to the existing bulk single- cell trajectory, we brought the cell development analysis into a more
precise and unprecedented resolution. The dynamic gene networks esti- mated the dynamic relationship of genes and discovered potential criti- cal genes during cell differentiation processes.
There are three major advantages of the CellST analysis frame- work. Firstly, the cell lineages were constructed with high accuracy and provides unique individual cell differentiation behaviors between time points. Secondly, since the trajectory tracks individual cells, the cell fate trajectories will have full coverage on different cell lineages even in some rare cell types (Fig. 6a). Thirdly, the dynamic gene networks analysis in the CellST framework can accurately estimate gene-gene re- lationships and discover critical genes in the cell differentiation process. Through the simulation and real dataset analysis, We constructed cell fate trajectories in single cell RNA-seq experiment and various dynamic cell differentiation behaviors were observed.
