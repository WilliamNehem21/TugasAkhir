Introduction

finite alphabet 𝛴. A factorial language satisfies the following condition: In this paper, we study arbitrary regular factorial languages over a if a word 𝑤1𝑢𝑤2 belongs to the language, then the word 𝑢 also belongs to it. For the set of words 𝐿(𝑛) of the length 𝑛 belonging to a regular factorial language 𝐿, we investigate the depth of decision trees solving
the recognition and the membership problems deterministically and nondeterministically. In the case of recognition problem, for a given
word from 𝐿(𝑛), we should recognize it using queries each of which,
for some 𝑖 ∈ {1, … , 𝑛}, returns the 𝑖th letter of the word. In the case of membership problem, for a given word over the alphabet 𝛴 of the length 𝑛, we should recognize if it belongs to 𝐿(𝑛) using the same
queries.
For a given problem (problem of recognition or membership prob- lem) and type of trees (solving the problem deterministically or non-
deterministically), instead of the minimum depth ℎ(𝑛) of a decision
tree of the considered type solving the problem for 𝐿(𝑛), we study the smoothed minimum depth 𝐻 (𝑛) = max{ℎ(𝑚) ∶ 𝑚 ≤ 𝑛}.
For an arbitrary regular factorial language, with the growth of 𝑛,
the smoothed minimum depth of decision trees solving the problem
of recognition deterministically is either bounded from above by a
constant, or grows as a logarithm, or linearly. These results follow immediately from more general, obtained in [1] for arbitrary regular languages.
For other cases (decision trees solving the problem of recognition nondeterministically, and decision trees solving the membership prob- lem deterministically and nondeterministically), with the growth of
𝑛, the smoothed minimum depth of decision trees is either bounded
from above by a constant, or grows linearly. In the conference pa-
per [2], a classification of arbitrary regular languages depending on the smoothed minimum depth of decision trees solving the problem of recognition nondeterministically was announced without proofs. In the present paper, we consider simpler classification for regular factorial languages with full proof. Results related to the decision trees solving the membership problem are new.
As corollaries of the obtained results, we study joint behavior of smoothed minimum depths of decision trees for the considered four cases and describe five complexity classes of regular factorial lan- guages. We also investigate the class of regular factorial languages over
the alphabet 𝐸 = {0, 1} each of which is given by one forbidden word.

the study how the depth of decision trees solving the recognition and the membership problems deterministically and nondeterministically depends on the length of words. This way is more complicated, but

closed languages over the alphabet 𝐸 is a proper subclass of the class language, which is not subword-closed. Therefore the class of subword- of regular factorial languages over the alphabet 𝐸.
The main difference between the present paper and [5] is that, in the latter paper, we do not assume that the subword-closed lan- guages are given by deterministic finite automata. Instead of this, we describe simple criteria (based on the presence in the language of words of special types) for the behavior of the minimum depths of decision trees solving the problem of recognition deterministically and nondeterministically. Differently formulated criteria for the behavior of the minimum depth of decision trees solving the recognition problem require very different proofs. One more difference is that in [5] we directly consider the minimum depth of decision trees.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we consider main notions, in Section 3 – main results, and in Section 4 – two corollaries of these results.

Main notions

In this section, we discuss the notions related to regular facto- rial languages and decision trees solving problems of recognition and membership for these languages.

Regular factorial languages
Let 𝜔 = {0, 1, 2, …} be the set of nonnegative integers and 𝛴 be a
node are labeled with pairwise different letters, 𝑞0 is a node of 𝐺 called starting, and 𝑄 is a nonempty set of the graph 𝐺 nodes called final.
A path of the diagram 𝐼 is an arbitrary sequence 𝜉 = 𝑣1, 𝑑1, … , 𝑣𝑚,
𝑑𝑚, 𝑣𝑚+1 of nodes and edges of 𝐺 such that the edge 𝑑𝑖 leaves the node
𝑣𝑖 and enters the node 𝑣𝑖+1 for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑚. We now define a word 𝑤(𝜉) from 𝛴∗ in the following way: if 𝑚 = 0, then 𝑤(𝜉) = 𝜆. Let 𝑚 > 0 and let 𝛿𝑗 be the letter attached to the edge 𝑑𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑚. Then
𝑤(𝜉) = 𝛿1 ⋯ 𝛿𝑚. We say that the path 𝜉 generates the word 𝑤(𝜉). Note
that different paths which start in the same node generate different
words.
We denote by 𝛯(𝐼 ) the set of all paths of the diagram 𝐼 each of which starts in the node 𝑞0 and finishes in a node from 𝑄. Let
𝐿𝐼 = {𝑤(𝜉) ∶ 𝜉 ∈ 𝛯(𝐼 )}.
We say that the diagram 𝐼 generates the language 𝐿𝐼 . It is well known that 𝐿𝐼 is a regular language.
The diagram 𝐼 is called complete over the alphabet 𝛴 if exactly
|𝛴| edges leave each node of 𝐺. Note that these edges are labeled with pairwise different letters from 𝛴. Such diagram corresponds to a complete DFA [8]. The diagram 𝐼 is called reduced if, for each node of 𝐺, there exists a path from 𝛯(𝐼 ), which contains this node. Such
each regular language over the alphabet 𝛴, there exists a complete over diagram corresponds to a reduced DFA [8]. It is known [8] that, for the alphabet 𝛴 diagram, which generates this language. Therefore, for
each nonempty regular language, there exists a reduced diagram, which generates this language.
Let 𝐿 be a regular factorial language and 𝐼 = (𝐺, 𝑞0, 𝑄) be a
reduced diagram that generates the language 𝐿. Since the language 𝐿 is factorial, we can assume additionally that each node of the graph 𝐺 is final — it will not change the language generated by 𝐼 since with each word the language 𝐿 contains each prefix of this word. The diagram
𝐼 will be called f-reduced if it is reduced and each node of the graph
𝐺 is final. Further we will assume that a considered regular factorial language 𝐿 is nonempty and it is given by an f-reduced diagram, which
generates this language.
We will not consider nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to rep- resent regular factorial languages since the study of NFA is essentially more complicated task.

Decision trees for recognition and membership problems

Let 𝐿 be a regular factorial language over the alphabet 𝛴. For any natural 𝑛, denote 𝐿(𝑛) = 𝐿 ∩ 𝛴𝑛, where 𝛴𝑛 is the set of words over the alphabet 𝛴, which length is equal to 𝑛. We consider two problems related to the set 𝐿(𝑛). The problem of recognition: for a given word from 𝐿(𝑛), we should recognize it using attributes (queries)
𝑙𝑛, … , 𝑙𝑛, where 𝑙𝑛, 𝑖 ∈ {1, … , 𝑛}, is a function from 𝛴𝑛 to 𝛴 such that

words. A word 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴∗ is called a minimal forbidden word for 𝐿 if
𝑤 ∉ 𝐿 and all proper factors of 𝑤 belong to 𝐿. We denote by 𝑀𝐹 (𝐿) the language of minimal forbidden words for 𝐿. It is known [7] that a factorial language 𝐿 is regular if and only if the language 𝑀𝐹 (𝐿) is regular. In particular, a factorial language 𝐿 with a finite set of minimal forbidden words 𝑀𝐹 (𝐿) is regular. In this paper, we study arbitrary
nonempty regular factorial languages.
It is well known that each regular language can be represented by a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) [8]. As in [8], we will consider not only complete DFA with total transition function but also partial DFA with partial transition function. Such DFA can be represented by its transition diagram (diagram for short) [9].
A diagram over the alphabet 𝛴 is a triple 𝐼 = (𝐺, 𝑞0, 𝑄), where 𝐺

A decision tree over 𝐿(𝑛) is called deterministic if it satisfies the
following conditions:

Exactly one edge leaves the root.
For any node, which is not the root nor terminal node, the edges leaving this node are labeled with pairwise different letters.

Let 𝛤 be a decision tree over 𝐿(𝑛). A complete path in 𝛤 is any sequence 𝜉 = 𝑣0, 𝑒0, … , 𝑣𝑚, 𝑒𝑚, 𝑣𝑚+1 of nodes and edges of 𝛤 such that
𝑣0 is the root, 𝑣𝑚+1 is a terminal node, and 𝑣𝑖 is the initial and 𝑣𝑖+1 is
the terminal node of the edge 𝑒𝑖 for 𝑖 = 0, … , 𝑚. We define a subset
𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉) of the set 𝛴𝑛 in the following way: if 𝑚 = 0, then 𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉) = 𝛴𝑛.

Decision trees solving recognition problem deterministically

Let 𝐼 = (𝐺, 𝑞0, 𝑄) be a f-reduced diagram over the alphabet 𝛴. A path of the diagram 𝐼 is called a cycle of the diagram 𝐼 if there is at
the last node of this path. A cycle of the diagram 𝐼 is called elementary least one edge in this path, and the first node of this path is equal to
if nodes of this cycle, with the exception of the last node, are pairwise different.

Let 𝑚 > 0, the attribute 𝑙𝑛
𝑗
be attached to the node 𝑣𝑗 , and 𝑏𝑗 be the
The diagram 𝐼 is called simple if every two different elementary

letter attached to the edge 𝑒𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑚. Then
𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉) = {𝑎1 ⋯ 𝑎𝑛 ∈ 𝛴𝑛 ∶ 𝑎𝑖 = 𝑏1, … , 𝑎𝑖  = 𝑏𝑚}.

Let 𝐿(𝑛) ≠ ∅. We say that a decision tree 𝛤 over 𝐿(𝑛) solves the problem of recognition for 𝐿(𝑛) nondeterministically if 𝛤 satisfies the
following conditions:
Each terminal node of 𝛤 is labeled with a word from 𝐿(𝑛).
For any word 𝑤 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛), there exists a complete path 𝜉 in the tree
𝛤 such that 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉).
For any word 𝑤 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛) and for any complete path 𝜉 in the tree 𝛤 such that 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉), the terminal node of the path 𝜉 is labeled with the word 𝑤.
We say that a decision tree 𝛤 over 𝐿(𝑛) solves the problem of recog- nition for 𝐿(𝑛) deterministically if 𝛤 is a deterministic decision tree, which solves the problem of recognition for 𝐿(𝑛) nondeterministically.
Examples of decision trees illustrating the considered notions are presented in Fig. 1.
We say that a decision tree 𝛤 over 𝐿(𝑛) solves the problem of
membership for 𝐿(𝑛) nondeterministically if 𝛤 satisfies the following
conditions:
Each terminal node of 𝛤 is labeled with a number from the set
{0, 1}.
For any word 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴𝑛, there exists a complete path 𝜉 in the tree
𝛤 such that 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉).
cycles of the diagram 𝐼 do not have common nodes. Let 𝐼 be a simple diagram and 𝜉 be a path of the diagram 𝐼 . The number of different elementary cycles of the diagram 𝐼 , which have common nodes with
𝜉, is denoted by 𝑐𝑙(𝜉) and is called the cyclic length of the path 𝜉. The
value
𝑐𝑙(𝐼 ) = max{𝑐𝑙(𝜉) ∶ 𝜉 ∈ 𝛯(𝐼 )}
is called the cyclic length of the diagram 𝐼 .
Let 𝐼 be a simple diagram, 𝐶 be an elementary cycle of the diagram
𝐼 , and 𝑣 be a node of the cycle 𝐶. Beginning with the node 𝑣, the cycle
𝐶 generates an infinite periodic word over the alphabet 𝛴. This word will be denoted by 𝑊 (𝐼 , 𝐶, 𝑣). We denote by 𝑟(𝐼 , 𝐶, 𝑣) the minimum period of the word 𝑊 (𝐼 , 𝐶, 𝑣). The diagram 𝐼 is called dependent if there exist two different elementary cycles 𝐶1 and 𝐶2 of the diagram
𝐼 , nodes 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 of the cycles 𝐶1 and 𝐶2, respectively, and a path 𝜋
of the diagram 𝐼 from 𝑣1 to 𝑣2, which satisfy the following conditions:
𝑊 (𝐼 , 𝐶1, 𝑣1) = 𝑊 (𝐼 , 𝐶2, 𝑣2) and the length of the path 𝜋 is a number di- visible by 𝑟(𝐼 , 𝐶1, 𝑣1). If the diagram 𝐼 is not dependent, then it is called
independent. Next theorem follows immediately from Theorem 2.1 [1], which is a similar statement that holds for all regular languages.

Theorem 1.	Let 𝐿 be a nonempty regular factorial language over the alphabet 𝛴 and 𝐼 be a f-reduced diagram, which generates the language 𝐿.
Then the following statements hold:
If 𝐼 is an independent simple diagram and 𝑐𝑙(𝐼 ) ≤ 1, then 𝐻 𝑟𝑑 (𝑛) =

For any word 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴𝑛 and for any complete path 𝜉 in the tree 𝛤 such that 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉), the terminal node of the path 𝜉 is labeled with the number 1 if 𝑤 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛) and with the number 0, otherwise.
We say that a decision tree 𝛤 over 𝐿(𝑛) solves the problem of mem- bership for 𝐿(𝑛) deterministically if 𝛤 is a deterministic decision tree which solves the problem of membership for 𝐿(𝑛) nondeterministically. Let 𝛤 be a decision tree over 𝐿(𝑛). We denote by ℎ(𝛤 ) the maximum number of nodes in a complete path in 𝛤 that are not the root nor terminal node. The value ℎ(𝛤 ) is called the depth of the decision tree
𝛤 .
We denote by ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛) (ℎ𝑟𝑑 (𝑛)) the minimum depth of a decision tree
𝑂(1).
If 𝐼 is an independent simple diagram and 𝑐𝑙(𝐼 ) ≥ 2, then 𝐻 𝑟𝑑 (𝑛) =
𝛩(log 𝑛).
If 𝐼 is not independent simple diagram, then 𝐻 𝑟𝑑 (𝑛) = 𝛩(𝑛).
Decision trees solving recognition problem nondeterministically
Let 𝐿 be a nonempty regular factorial language over the alphabet
𝛴. For any natural 𝑛, we define a parameter 𝑇𝐿(𝑛) of the language 𝐿. If 𝐿(𝑛) = ∅, then 𝑇𝐿(𝑛) = 0. Let 𝐿(𝑛) ≠ ∅, 𝑤 = 𝑎1 ⋯ 𝑎𝑛 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛), and
𝐽 ⊆ {1, … , 𝑛}. Denote 𝐿(𝑤, 𝐽 ) = {𝑏1 ⋯ 𝑏𝑛 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛) ∶ 𝑏𝑗 = 𝑎𝑗 , 𝑗 ∈ 𝐽 }

Lemma 2. Let 𝐿 be a nonempty regular factorial language over the alphabet 𝛴. Then ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛) = 𝑇𝐿(𝑛) for any natural 𝑛.
Proof. First, we prove that ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛) ≥ 𝑇𝐿(𝑛). Let 𝛤 be a decision tree over
𝐿(𝑛), which solves the problem of recognition for 𝐿(𝑛) nondeterministi-
cally and for which ℎ(𝛤 ) = ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛). Let 𝑤 be a word from 𝐿(𝑛) for which

such that 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉) and the terminal node of the path 𝜉 is labeled with

𝐽 = {𝑖1, … , 𝑖𝑚}. Then 𝐿(𝑤, 𝐽 ) = {𝑤}.
Therefore 𝑚 ≥ 𝑀𝐿(𝑛, 𝑤) = 𝑇𝐿(𝑛). It is clear that ℎ(𝛤 ) ≥ 𝑚. Thus,
ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛) = ℎ(𝛤 ) ≥ 𝑚 ≥ 𝑀 (𝑛, 𝑤) = 𝑇 (𝑛).

We now prove that ℎ𝐿 (𝑛) ≤ 𝑇𝐿(𝑛). One can show that, for each
𝑤 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛), we can construct a complete path 𝜉𝑤, which satisfies the following conditions: the number of nodes in 𝜉𝑤 that are not the root
of the word 𝑊 (𝐼 , 𝐶1, 𝑣1). We now define two words of the length 𝑟𝑏𝑐:
𝑢 = 𝛾𝑏𝑐 and 𝑤 = 𝛽𝛾𝑐(𝑏−1). It is clear that 𝑢 ≠ 𝑤.
Consider the sequence of numbers 𝑛 = 𝑎 + 𝑖𝑟𝑏𝑐, 𝑖 = 1, 2, …. Let

paths 𝜉𝑤, 𝑤 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛), we obtain a decision tree, which solves the problem
of recognition for 𝐿(𝑛) nondeterministically and which depth is equal
to 𝑇𝐿(𝑛). Thus, ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛) ≤ 𝑇𝐿(𝑛) and ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛) = 𝑇𝐿(𝑛).  □

If 𝐼 is an independent simple diagram, then 𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) = 𝑂(1).
If 𝐼 is not independent simple diagram, then 𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) = 𝛩(𝑛).
Proof. (a) Let 𝐼 be an independent simple diagram and 𝑐𝑙(𝐼 ) ≤ 1. By
Theorem 1, 𝐻 𝑟𝑑 (𝑛) = 𝑂(1). It is clear that 𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) ≤ 𝐻 𝑟𝑑 (𝑛). Therefore
𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) ≥ 𝑛∕(2𝑟𝑏𝑐) for large enough 𝑛. The inequality 𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) ≤ 𝑛 is obvious. Thus, 𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) = 𝛩(𝑛). □
Note that in general case (when we consider not only factorial languages) the classification of reduced diagrams depending on the minimum depth of decision trees solving the problem of recognition nondeterministically is more complicated [2]. In particular, there exists

was proved that 𝑀𝐿(𝑛, 𝑤) ≤ 𝑑(4𝑑 + 1) for any word 𝑤 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛). Therefore

are different and they have the same length 𝑏𝑐.
If |𝐿| < ∞ or 𝐿 = 𝛴∗, then 𝐻𝑚𝑑 (𝑛) = 𝑂(1) and 𝐻𝑚𝑎(𝑛) = 𝑂(1).
Proof. It is clear that ℎ𝑚𝑎(𝑛) ≤ ℎ𝑚𝑑 (𝑛) for any natural 𝑛.

𝑖 ∈ 𝜔⧵{0}. The set 𝐿(𝑛𝑖) contains the word 𝛼𝛾 and the words 𝛼𝛾 𝛽𝛾
for 𝑗 = 0, … , 𝑖 − 1. It is easy to show that 𝑀𝐿(𝑛𝑖, 𝛼𝛾𝑖) ≥ 𝑖: to distinguish the word 𝛼𝛾𝑖 from the words 𝛼𝛾𝑗 𝛽𝛾𝑖−𝑗−1, 𝑗 = 0, … , 𝑖 − 1, we need to use at least one letter from each of 𝑖 words 𝛾 appearing in 𝛼𝛾𝑖. Therefore
𝑇𝐿(𝑛𝑖) ≥ 𝑖 and, by Lemma 2, ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛𝑖) ≥ 𝑖 = (𝑛𝑖 − 𝑎)∕(𝑏𝑐). Let 𝑛 ≥ 𝑛1
and let 𝑖 be the maximum natural number such that 𝑛 ≥ 𝑛𝑖. Evidently,
𝑛 − 𝑛𝑖 ≤ 𝑏𝑐. Hence 𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) ≥ ℎ𝑟𝑎(𝑛𝑖) ≥ (𝑛 − 𝑏𝑐 − 𝑎)∕(𝑏𝑐). Therefore
𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) ≥ 𝑛∕(2𝑏𝑐) for large enough 𝑛. The inequality 𝐻 𝑟𝑎(𝑛) ≤ 𝑛 is

Let 𝑤 ∈ 𝐿(𝑛) and 𝜉 be a complete path in 𝛤 such that 𝑤 ∈ 𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉). Then the terminal node of 𝜉 is labeled with the number 1. Beginning with the first letter, we divide the word 𝑤 into ⌊𝑛∕𝑡⌋ blocks with 𝑡 letters in each and the suffix of the length 𝑛 − 𝑡 ⌊𝑛∕𝑡⌋. Let us assume that the number of nodes labeled
with attributes in 𝜉 is less than ⌊𝑛∕𝑡⌋. Then there is a block such that

Let 𝐼 be a dependent simple diagram. Then there exist two different
elementary cycles 𝐶1 and 𝐶2 of the diagram 𝐼 , nodes 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 of the cycles 𝐶1 and 𝐶2, respectively, and a path 𝜋 of the diagram 𝐼 from 𝑣1 to
𝑣2, which satisfy the following conditions: 𝑊 (𝐼 , 𝐶1, 𝑣1) = 𝑊 (𝐼 , 𝐶2, 𝑣2)
and the length of the path 𝜋 is a number divisible by 𝑟(𝐼 , 𝐶1, 𝑣1). Let us remind that, for 𝑖 = 1, 2, 𝑊 (𝐼 , 𝐶𝑖, 𝑣𝑖) is the infinite periodic word over the alphabet 𝛴 generated by the cycle 𝐶𝑖 beginning with the node 𝑣𝑖,
from the block. We replace this block in the word 𝑤 with the word
𝑤0 and denote by 𝑤′ the obtained word. It is clear that 𝑤′ ∉ 𝐿 and
𝑤′ ∈ 𝛴(𝑛, 𝜉), but this is impossible since the terminal node of the path
𝜉 is labeled with the number 1. Therefore the depth of 𝛤 is greater than or equal to ⌊𝑛∕𝑡⌋. Thus, ℎ𝑚𝑎(𝑛) ≥ ⌊𝑛∕𝑡⌋. It is easy to construct a decision tree over 𝐿(𝑛) that solves the problem of membership for 𝐿(𝑛) deterministically and has the depth equals to 𝑛. Therefore ℎ𝑚𝑑 (𝑛) ≤ 𝑛.

Languages over alphabet {0, 1} given by one forbidden word

Let 𝐸 = {0, 1}, 𝛼 ∈ 𝐸∗, and 𝛼 ≠ 𝜆. We denote by 𝐿(𝛼) the language over the alphabet 𝐸, which consists of all words from 𝐸∗ that do not contain 𝛼 as a factor. This is a regular factorial language with
𝑀𝐹 (𝐿(𝛼)) = {𝛼}. The following theorem indicates for each nonempty word 𝛼 ∈ 𝐸∗ the complexity class T𝑖 to which the language 𝐿(𝛼)
belongs.
Theorem 5.  Let 𝛼 ∈ 𝐸∗ and 𝛼 ≠ 𝜆.
If 𝛼 ∈ {0, 1}, then 𝐿(𝛼) ∈ T2.
If 𝛼 ∈ {01, 10}, then 𝐿(𝛼) ∈ T3.
If 𝛼 ∉ {0, 1, 01, 10}, then 𝐿(𝛼) ∈ T4.
We now describe a f-reduced diagram 𝐼 (𝛼) that generates the lan- guage 𝐿(𝛼) for a nonempty word 𝛼 ∈ 𝐸∗. Let 𝛼 = 𝑎1 ⋯ 𝑎𝑛, 𝛼0 = 𝜆, and
𝛼𝑖 = 𝑎1 ⋯ 𝑎𝑖 for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛 − 1. The set 𝑃 (𝛼) = {𝛼0, 𝛼1, … , 𝛼𝑛−1} is the
set of all proper prefixes of the word 𝛼. Then 𝐼 (𝛼) = (𝐺, 𝑞0, 𝑄), where the set of nodes of the graph 𝐺 is equal to 𝑃 (𝛼), 𝑞0 = 𝛼0, and 𝑄 = 𝑃 (𝛼). For 𝑖 = 0, … , 𝑛 − 2, an edge leaves the node 𝛼𝑖 and enters the node 𝛼𝑖+1. This edge is labeled with the letter 𝑎𝑖+1. For 𝑖 = 0, … , 𝑛 − 1, an edge leaves the node 𝛼𝑖 and enters the node 𝛼𝑗 ∈ 𝑃 (𝛼) such that 𝛼𝑗 is the longest suffix of the word 𝛼𝑖𝑎̄𝑖+1, where 𝑎̄𝑖+1 = 0 if 𝑎𝑖+1 = 1 and 𝑎̄𝑖+1 = 1 if 𝑎𝑖+1 = 0. This edge is labeled with the letter 𝑎̄𝑖+1. It is easy to show that 𝐼 (𝛼) is a f-reduced diagram over the alphabet 𝐸. From Theorem 10 [7] it follows that the diagram 𝐼 (𝛼) generates the language 𝐿(𝛼).
Let 𝛼 ∈ 𝐸∗ ⧵ {𝜆} and 𝛼 = 𝑎1 ⋯ 𝑎𝑛. We denote by 𝛼̄ the word 𝑎̄1 ⋯ 𝑎̄𝑛.
It is easy to prove the following statement.

𝛼.
The diagram 𝐼 (0) is depicted in Fig. 8. This is an independent simple f-reduced diagram with 𝑐𝑙(𝐼 (0)) = 1. Therefore 𝐿(0) ∈ T2. By Lemma 6, 𝐿(1) ∈ T2.
The diagram 𝐼 (01) is depicted in Fig. 9. This is an independent simple f-reduced diagram with 𝑐𝑙(𝐼 (01)) = 2. Therefore 𝐿(01) ∈ T3. By Lemma 6, 𝐿(10) ∈ T3.
Using Lemma 7 we obtain that, for any word 𝛼 ∈ 𝐸∗ of the length greater than or equal to four, 𝐿(𝛼) ∈ T4. □
