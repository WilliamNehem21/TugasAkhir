Introduction

The large coal-fired power generation system was composed of many complex subsystems, and there were high-dimensional nonlinear associative relationships among various operating parameters. To determine the relationships among parameters under different operating conditions, and reconstruct the system operating state, thus the optimum controllable parameters of the boundary condition can be obtained, and then the operation optimization strategies can be formulated. All of this can be summarized as the analysis of complex systems modeling.
Due to the characteristics of large span thermodynamic state, large flow, high hear flow density and large scale equipments etc, the nonlinear scale effect on energy transport, conversion and quality dissipation in

different levels of systems, processes and unit equipments of the large coal-fired generating units was obvious. At the same time, there were strong relationships between the power generation energy consumption and the environment, resources, loads.
As the main way of energy production, large-scale coal-fired units, including (ultra) supercritical units, will bear rapid peak regulation operation, frequent change of working conditions in long time, stand the test of factors such as complex coal quality, the cold junction and environment etc. Its energy consumption level has distinct time-varying characteristics. Considering the characteristics of large coal-fired generating units, as well as the coupling effects of external factors, it was an important foundation of achieving energy saving of coal-fired power generation process to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution of unit energy consumption within the scope of total working conditions. However, due to the characteristics such as mechanism complexity, nonlinear, time-varying, large time delay, strong coupling, uncertainties and random disturbances of the equipment, systems and process, the traditional mechanism modeling method was difficult to establish the exact energy consumption space-time distribution model.
The data in unit generating process database can reflect the operating conditions and characteristics of operating variables, process equipment and process directly or indirectly, and the data mining technology provides a powerful tool for knowledge discovery in databases. From the vast amounts of data, it can dig out useful information and knowledge, thus the powerful decision supports for the energy consumption online monitoring of large-scale coal-fired units, optimization of energy-saving operation and management can be provide.
In response to these characteristics, features were extracted from real data of thermal power units though attribute reduction method based on fuzzy rough set (FRS) in basis of data mining technology in the paper. The relationship was analyzed among variables, between variables and energy consumption distributes, to reduce attribute table, drop redundant data. That provides the important research base for real unit energy consumption characteristics analysis in depth.

Fuzzy rough sets theory

Classical rough set theory proposed by Pawlak, was used to depict the incompleteness and uncertainty. It can classify information which was inaccurate, inconsistent and incomplete for effectively, and discover hidden knowledge, reveal the potential law.
The function of knowledge classification of the rough set theory was achieved through attribute reduction. Attributes (characteristics) of the information system was not equally important, or even some of the attributes was redundant. The system will be mostly simplified by reducing attribute of knowledge in maintaining the system’s ability of classification, deleting irrelevant or unimportant attribute knowledge to extract the most relative characteristics and variation of the properties.
The following was the relevant definition of the reduction of knowledge in rough set theory. Information system S=<U, CUD, V, f >, U was a non-empty objects set; C and D were the properties sets. Namely the condition attribute set was C and decision attribute set was D; V was a set of attribute value ; f was an information function. namely f :U×(CUD)→V. It specifies the object's property values of U in each group.
In the given knowledge base K= (U, S), U was universe of discourse, S was the equivalence relation clusters on U. Then for each subset X⊆U and equivalence relation R<IND (K),
R*(X) =U {x<U :[x]R⊆X}	(1)

X was R’s lower approximation.
The dependence of two attribute sets between C and D was defined as


γC(D)=|POSC(D)|/|U|	(2)

POSC(D)=C*(D);|U| represents the entire collection of the number of objects.
For the condition attributes ai<C, ai on the importance of D was defined as

γai (D)= γC(D)- γC-{ai } (D)	(3)

The classical rough set theory can only deal with discrete or symbol-based property information system. The large-scale coal-fired unit energy consumption decision table (Table 2) based on the unit's actual operating data (shown in Table 1) was continuous real-value in this paper, and they need to be reduced by attribute discretization methods. But the discretization process will bound to lose some important information to have a negative impact on the classification results. Therefore, the reduction method based on fuzzy rough set theory attributes were adopted in the paper, fuzzy sets were used to replace the precise set, the fuzzy similarity relation was introduced to instead equivalence relations on the universe of discourse, the classical rough set theory was extended to fuzzy rough sets.

Theoretical verification of the results

Plant system was a complex thermal system composed of many subsystems (equipment) which connected by specific way, working under multi-boundary conditions, completing the process of energy conversion thermal energy to mechanical energy and ultimately to electricity.
Thermal system with specific device structures, material properties and system structures conducts the process of combustion, heat transfer, mass transfer and flow through each device inside and shows corresponding running state parameters in the constrained conditions such as uncontrollable boundary conditions (such as power generation load, the local meteorological conditions, coal quality, etc.), controllable boundary conditions (such as the turbine initial operating parameter, circulating water flow, boiler primary or second air flow, etc.),system structures and device characteristics. These state parameters were ultimately expressed as the thermal and economic performance indicators of the unit’s thermal efficiency or power consumption rate.
The most fundamental indicators of energy performance of thermal power units usually expressed as the coal consumption rate bsn :
b  	123
sn	    (1  )

b i  m  g  p	i
(12)

Where,b ,i ,m ,g ,p ,i respectively were boiler efficiency, cycle thermal efficiency, mechanical efficiency, generator efficiency, pipeline efficiency and auxiliaries electricity consumption rate.
To specific unit, equipment structure, material properties and system structure, even specific defects have

been fixed. So bsn
can be expressed by function of system boundary conditions:

bsn  f (Ng ,Txrw , Dw , P0 ,T0 ,Trh , Ccoal )
(13)

Where,
Ng ,Txrw , Dw , P0 ,T0 ,Trh ,Ccoal
respectively  were  load,  circulating  water  inlet  temperature

(determined by the cooling tower performance and the ambient temperature), the circulating water flow, main steam pressure, main steam temperature, reheat steam temperature, coal characteristics.
Therefore, the 10 attributes based on fuzzy rough set attribute reduction algorithm were extracted as input variables. The conclusions were consistent with the theoretical analysis; the key parameters affecting the unit energy consumption were the unit boundary condition parameters for the operation. This method provides an important basis for further study on optimization of unit consumption characteristics and operating parameters.
