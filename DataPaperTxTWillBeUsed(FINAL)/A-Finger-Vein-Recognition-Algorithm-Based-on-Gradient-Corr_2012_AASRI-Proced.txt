Abstract

Finger vein authentication plays an important role in the field of vascular certification because of its simplification and high efficiency. In this paper, a finger vein recognition algorithm based on gradient-correlation is presented. Firstly, a method based on histogram statistics is given to recognize whether finger vein images or not. Secondly, matched filter based on maximum curvature model is adopted to extract the gradient image of finger vein. Finally, cross-correlation between two gradient images is figured out to estimate their similarity. The maximal correlation is used to decide whether matching or not with threshold. Experimental results show that FAR and FFR are 0.375% and 1.20% respectively. This algorithm is simple, efficient, insensitive to noise,

Introduction

With the information era’s coming, people pay much more attention on the Information Security. The development of science and technology presents some drawbacks of the traditional identification methods, such as smart cards and passwords. However, finger vein recognition, as one of the biometric technology, has some kind advantages of non-contact, live identification, high security and inner-feature, etc.

Processor DM6437DSP clocked @ 600MHz was implemented in the system that consists of image acquisition part and DSP board, is shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3 respectively. The DSP board contains image processing module, storage module and matching module. All the procedures including finger vein registration and authentication are performed on DSP.

Image Acquisition

Image acquisition part is made up of a CMOS camera and 6 LEDs that emit ~850nm near-infrared light. Optical filter added to capture a distinct image sized 355x288, 8 bit for each pixel. One original image is shown in Fig.4. Before discrimination, as Sun [5], a rotational alignment was done, and the effective area of finger vein was shown as Fig.5.

Image Discrimination

In a mature authentication product, specific algorithm is terribly needed to tell the available image. One kind of an algorithm, based on histogram statistics as shown in Fig. 6, could realize the function.

Fig.6 Histogram Analysis Flowchart

The criteria mentioned in the flowchart are result analysis of many experiments. A finger vein image shall rigorously meet the following criteria.
Probability summation of the first 6 subparagraphs should not be greater than 5%.
From 7th to 18th ones, 5 adjacent subparagraphs probability summation greater than 40% should be found.
From 7th to 22nd ones, the probability summation should be greater than 80%.
Beyond 25th ones, the probability of every subparagraph should be less than 1%.

Gradient Image Extraction

Considering the venous distribution characteristics, image grey distribution corresponds with the maximum curvature model. 12 angle operators in research [9] were too many. To raise speed, 4 new angle operators (0˚,45˚,90˚,135˚), were raised as follow:

Convolutional filtering was performed through the image using the operators mentioned. After that, 4 images, sized J*K, were obtained with pixel value f0(x, y), f1(x, y), f2(x, y), f3(x, y). Accordingly, the gray value f(x, y) of the gradient image, as shown in Fig.7, was calculated as follow:
J	K

f(x,y)   max[f O(x,y),f 1(x,y),f 2(x,y),f 3(x,y)]
x1 y 1

Matching Algorithm

The gradient image could intuitively reflect the difference between vein images. The advantage of maximum cross-correlation is not sensitive to noises. Two steps as Fig.8 & Fig.9 performed the matching.



Fig.8 Step 1 of Matching Process	Fig.9 Step 2 of Matching Process

Img1 was defined as gradient of registration image f(x,y ) and its mean value is f while Img2 defined as gradient of test image g(x,y ) and its mean value is g . Img1 and Img2 sized J x K.
Set Img2 as a template and then match with Img1 from f(O,O). Point f(u,v ) is the position g(O,O)moves to just as shown in Fig.8. Then correlation 1 is calculated between the intersection regions as follow:
J	K


γ 1(u,v) 

Set Img1 as a template and then match with Img2 from g(O,O). Point g(u,v ) is the position f(O,O)moves to just as shown in Fig.9. Then correlation 2 is calculated similarly as 1 .
Finally, 98 coefficients were obtained, maximum of 1 and 2 are used to evaluate matching degree:

  max(1 ,2 )

Experimental Results
Experiments show that the accuracy is high and this algorithm could tell the true finger vein image from non-finger vein images like pencil images. Images from 40 different fingers were captured and some fingers out of them were captured for 70 times. Totally 588 images were used to make up the vein library.


False Rejection rate (FFR) evaluation

70 vein images of one same finger were processed with 1:1 matching mode and 4900 coefficients obtained.
In different thresholds, False Rejection Rate is shown in Table 1. Only   T , image would be accepted.

Table.1 FFR evaluation


False Acception Rate (FAR) evaluation

40 vein images of different fingers were processed with 1:1 matching mode and 1600 coefficients obtained.
In different thresholds, False Acception Rate is shown in Table 2. Only   T , image would be rejected.

Table.2 FAR evaluation

According to table 1 and table 2, threshold is rational to be 0.4, a good recognition rate obtained. On the grounds of FFR and FAR, a testing index of matching algorithm, the Receive Operating Characteristics Curve shown in Fig.12, demonstrates the relationship between FFR and FAR in different thresholds.

Fig.12 Receive Operating Characteristics Curve

ROC curve is close to the x axis that means the precision rate of the algorithm is high. In the same experimental conditions, whichever threshold is used to measure FFR and FAR in research [5], its recognition


rate is worse. Research [6] FAR is 0.7% that almost twice of the FAR in this work, while its FFR is 1.05% that is approximately equal to this work.

8. Conclusion

This work presents an algorithm for finger vein authentication. Experimental results show that FFR and FAR are 0.375% and 1.20% respectively. Fewer steps improve the processing speed, especially suitable for the finger vein authentication system based on DSP. In the later product research and development, we will be dedicated to optimize the pre-processing algorithm, especially reduce the noises caused by light source.
