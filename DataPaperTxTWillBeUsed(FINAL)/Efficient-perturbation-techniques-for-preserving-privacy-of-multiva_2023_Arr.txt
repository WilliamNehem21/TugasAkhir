Cloud data is increasing significantly recently because of the advancement of technology which can contain individuals’ sensitive information, such as medical diagnostics reports. While deriving knowledge from such sensitive data, different third party can get their hands on this sensitive information. Therefore, privacy preservation of such sensitive data has become a vital issue. Data perturbation is one of the most often used data mining approaches for safeguarding privacy. A significant challenge in data perturbation is balancing the privacy and utility of data. Securing an individual’s privacy often entails the forfeiture of the data utility, and the contrary is true. Though there exist several approaches to deal with the trade-off between privacy and utility, researchers are always looking for new approaches. In order to address this critical issue, this paper proposes two data perturbation approaches namely NOS2R and NOS2R2. The proposed perturbation techniques are experimented with over ten benchmark UCI data set for analyzing privacy protection, information entropy, attack resistance, data utility, and classification error. The proposed approaches are compared with two existing approaches 3DRT and NRoReM. The thorough experimental analysis exhibits that the best-performing approach NOS2R2 offers 15.48% higher entropy and 15.53% more resistance against ICA attack compared to the best existing approach NRoReM. Furthermore, in terms of utility, the accuracy, f1-score, precision and recall of NOS2R2 perturbed data are 42.32%, 31.22%, 30.77% and 16.15% more close to the original data respectively than the NRoReM perturbed data.





Introduction

Because of the rapid growth of cloud technology and its storage ability, a big volume of data is being used constantly in this era of in- formation technology. A substantial amount of data is transmitted and received on a daily basis via communication channels due to the rapid advancement of data gathering methods [1]. These data may contain many valuable and sensitive information such as commerce [1], edu- cation [2], banking [3], healthcare [3,4], lifestyle, habits and personal preferences [4]. People are often reluctant to give personally identi- fiable information. Such reluctance to provide personal information constrains the accessibility of vital data for knowledge discovery [5,6]. Data mining is the key technique of expertly identifying previously unknown patterns and information from data [7]. Many data mining techniques have made it possible to extract information from massive amounts of data [8]. Many companies and organizations utilize this data to make decisions in order to increase customer contentment [8]. The knowledge that is retrieved is crucial for modeling subsequent business operations. As a result, it is envisaged that during data mining operations, individual privacy should be protected and the data set’s
utility is anticipated to remain quite consistent with that of the actual data. Other big data repositories, such as crimes [9], epidemics [10], medical reports, customer information, and social physics [11] need the data to study human behavior and forecast events that are primarily centered on people. Therefore, protecting individuals’ privacy while conducting analysis chores has become a crucial issue that necessitates forceful answers.
Let us think about the illustration in the Table 1 to highlight the privacy and utility scenario. It contains the customer ID, account num- ber, amount of transaction and current balance of three customers of an organization. The customer ID, account number, amount of transaction and current balance of customers are highly sensitive and private. The organizations typically do not divulge any details about their clients. However, sometimes it may be important to evaluate this data to gain insight into the organization’s and the customers’ condition. The companies must study the customer information provided with a specific level of modification to achieve these goals of utility and

data set altogether. So, the primary goal of data mining strategies based on PPDM is to develop methodologies that may change the original data while maintaining the privacy of the underlying information during the data mining process [5].
Privacy and data utility are two opposing factors in data mining. It is almost difficult and a huge challenge for any algorithm to be better than all other algorithms in terms of privacy, utility, complexity and so on [15]. Different research initiatives in the subject of PPDM are being examined to deal with this burgeoning challenge. There are different perturbation techniques, such as noise addition [16], conden- sation based approach [17], random projection-based approach [18] and many others. All these approaches have some limitations. The noise addition based perturbation approach generates random noise in the data set’s particular columns [5]. There is another perturbation strategy which is based on randomization. Although this technique is straightforward, attacks based on reconstruction are a threat for this technique. On contrary, in another technique based on condensation, there is a privacy concern because it is highly likely that the perturbed data can be used to deduce the original data [19]. A few of the original data points are projected into a different space than the origi- nal multidimensional space in a random projection-based perturbation strategy [18]. Projection perturbation can preserve graphical fidelity because data set from different spaces can be merged more accurately than those from euclidean space. [20]. Consequently, the protection of sensitive details is mostly concentrated on various phases of a data mining task in other existing systems [5]. Several studies have also focused on the utility of data, such as in [5,21].
In this paper, two approaches namely NOS2R (Normalization, Scal-

in Table 3. Analyzing Tables 2 and 3, it is realized that the modified data in Table 2 is sufficiently similar to the original data. As a result, data mining algorithms find it quite simple to bring out information that closely resembles the actual data. However, it is difficult to hide the original data because the perturbed data is almost similar to the original one. On the other hand, it is observed that the revised data are very different from the original data in Table 3. Furthermore, some of them are negative. As a result, data mining algorithms have a great difficulty retrieving information unlike to the original data. However, in this scenario, approximating the information is difficult, which guarantees some privacy. As can be seen from Tables 2 and 3, one transformation fails to protect privacy but preserves the utility, while the other fails to keep up its utility but is able to safeguard privacy. A significant challenge in data mining is the trade-off between privacy and utility.
Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) is one of the well-known trends in privacy field. It is motivated by one of the information era’s most important policy issues: the right to privacy. PPDM has been formed as a subject of study in which data mining techniques can be uti- lized to examine private confidential information about persons while protecting their privacy [5]. It is all about improving ‘‘traditional’’ data mining and making it more privacy conscious by employing unique privacy-preserving approaches that will create accurate data mining predictions, show fascinating data patterns, while also safeguarding privacy and data utility [13]. It has been extensively researched in the context of big data. In PPDM, the information that can be extracted from a modified data set by current data mining methods is virtually identical to what can be extracted from the actual data set [5,13]. The main objective of PPDM techniques is to ensure individual pri- vacy while still considering data utility [1,5,6]. PPDM has two major concerns [5,14]. Firstly, the original data can only be accessed by the owner or authorized users [1] and only they can alter confidential raw data in a way that differs from the original database. Thus the privacy is protected. Second, such information ought to be eliminated from the
ization, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection and Rotation) based perturbation have been proposed which maintain data utility and preserve privacy at the same time. Normalization is used to have a standard scale for every data point in the data matrix [5]. In this work, z-score is used as a normalization approach. Scaling is the technique of adjusting data. The coordinate points of the original data change as a result of scaling. It also changes the size of the data. Shearing deals with changing the geometric property along axes. The shape of the object is modified via shearing. In multi-dimensional space, rotation transformation preserves geometric attributes such as length, inner product, shapes such as hyper plane, and hyper curved surfaces. Data utility can be achieved by improving data perturbation parameters for scaling, shearing, reflection and rotation in a systematic way [3]. The privacy of the approach was then assessed in terms of privacy guarantee, attack resistance and an increase in entropy [3].
The remaining portion of this paper is organized as Section 2 summarizes the existing work which are related to this research work. Section 3 represents the overview of perturbation techniques. The metrics used for analyzing privacy and utility are discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, the proposed approaches NOS2R and NOS2R2 are de- scribed. Section 6 represents the experimental analysis and provides a comparative analysis of the performance. In the last section, our research work is concluded.

Related work

Individuals’ information has become pervasive in today’s world. In case of big data, there are a lot of potential as well as a lot of risk and on the other hand, a slew of security and privacy issues [22]. So, the researchers’ mission of safeguarding privacy has been challenging. Several methodologies have been applied by various studies conducted over the last few years to discover solutions to this problem while maintaining utility and preserving privacy.
In [23], Chamikara et al. offers a perturbation algorithm called DISTPAB to preserve the privacy of horizontally partitioned data in a distributed context. This strategy reduces computational limitations by



dispersing the burden of privacy preservation across a dispersed ecosys- tem with resource-constrained devices and high-performance comput- ers, taking advantage of the asymmetry of resources. But this work has a limitation i.e. it works only for horizontally partitioned data. So when some vertically partitioned data appears, this method cannot maintain the utility and privacy trade-off.
For sensitive data mining, a method called NRoReM is proposed by Paul et al. in [5]. This data perturbation approach consists of four stages. At first normalization, secondly geometric rotation, then linear regression, and finally scalar multiplication was followed. The exploratory study of privacy protection, attack resistance, information entropy analysis, data utility, and error analysis reveals that NRoReM protects individual privacy as well as data utility on a greater level. However, when scalar multiplication is used for better privacy, the size of the data set is altered, which sometimes results in a decrease in utility in some cases.
A method for protecting privacy is represented in [24] which is based on distance matrix. Its aim is to secure common comparable data that is disseminated among many organizations. In circumstances where the amount of data in each organization is limited and the data bias is substantial, the suggested method robustly integrates scattered data that is of the same quality as linked raw data. Furthermore, this proposed method can be used with data that has been corrupted by noise. Even after introducing noise, the statistics of the original data could still be calculated which is a threat and it necessitates a more robust method of privacy protection.
To alter and restore data, a method called RPCM is devised in [25] that leverages reversible data concealment mechanisms. According to the observations, when dealing with perturbed data, RPCM keeps al- most similar knowledge as it does in original data and when the degree of data disruption grows, the risk of privacy leakage does not increase. In [26], a new data perturbation technique is proposed named Range Noise Perturbation (RNP). Data set is perturbed four times in this procedure. In the first step, it analyzes a group of attributes for perturbation; in the second, it selects a range noise value; and in the third step, it figures the range and determines the noise. The perturbed attributes are then used to update the data set. However, there is still a risk of privacy and utility trade-off because this method depends on the range noise value.
The paper [27] introduces a Bayesian-based PPDM approach for classification. This method is a data perturbation method which is algorithm-independent, implying that the perturbed data can be used directly by traditional classification methods. Experiments show that this strategy is effective at securing privacy while maintaining data utility. A semi-supervised privacy-preserving clustering approach is proposed in [28]. The method of this study learns a large margin nearest cluster metric using convex optimization utilizing a limited quantity of supervised data. The method then applies multiplicative perturbation on the original data based on the learned metric, which might change the distribution shape of the original data and therefore protect privacy information while assuring good data usability. Despite that, the inner-site sharing of the LMNC (Large Margin Nearest Cluster) metric within the distributed system, any site that acquires access to the modified data of others is endowed with the capacity to retrieve the corresponding original data.
Torra proposed a new approach microaggregation [29]. This method involves using a clustering algorithm to protect the data set, and then
parameters 𝑚1 and 𝑚2 are used for fuzzy partition and membership replacing each of the data with the cluster representative. Here, two
degrees respectively. So erroneous or faulty value of these parameters can still affect the balance between privacy and utility. The k-means technique is utilized in [30] to propose a Reversible Privacy-Preserving k-means Clustering (kRPP) algorithm that protects the clustering in- formation of a data set. When the noise ratio or noise offset ratio is increased, the inserting noises to a cluster with a minimal total distance in the kRPP method has no significant effect on centroids movement.
However, kmeans algorithm is not suitable idea for protecting privacy because this algorithm can worsen the attack resilience.
The authors of [31] suggested a data perturbation approach that follows min–max normalization. The technique starts with choosing the sensitive features and then applying min–max normalization to them. The altered attributes and the actual data are then blended in and some assessment is performed using this data. In this approach, min– max normalization has been used which is not suitable for the full feature data set. The security is jeopardized by the significant changes in the values’ positions in the matrix. The authors of [8] suggested an approach which follows 3D rotation transformation. The technique is accomplished by rotating the attributes of data in a set of triplets. Then the angle of rotation is determined by thresholding to the variance of the attributes [32]. The balance between privacy and utility can be hampered because it uses a mixture of clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation for a better privacy at the expense of utility.
𝑃 2𝑅0𝐶𝐴𝑙 is a privacy-preserving technique suggested by the authors
of [4]. For balancing privacy and utility in data sets, this method
makes use of rotation and condensation characteristics. In one version of this method, kmeans was used. This kmeans algorithm delivers better utility, but sometimes privacy suffers and attack resistance declines. A non-reversible perturbation method namely PABIDOT is proposed in [3] that uses optimal geometric transformation for privacy preser- vation of huge data. It uses multidimensional geometrical alternation, reflection, translation, and rotation to disrupt a data set, followed by randomized expansion and random tuple shift out.
For the sake of stream data mining privacy, two data perturbation methodologies are presented in [6] which use random projection, ran- dom translation, and two distinct additive noise structure in a coalition. Independent noise, which is produced for each individual entry, is one of the noise types. The other type of noise accumulates during the course of a stream’s lifetime.
In [33], the authors proposed a new data perturbation algorithm, SEAL (Secure and Efficient data perturbation Algorithm utilizing Lo- cal differential privacy) which relies on Chebyshev interpolation and Laplacian noise. SEAL offers a fair balance of privacy and utility with high efficiency and scalability. In [34], the sensitive information of individuals is perturbed via a fuzzy data transformation technique. The technique uses a fuzzifier to transform linguistic data from crisp values so that the inference engine can compare them to the fuzzy rules which had already been stated. Then using a defuzzifier, perturbed data is then translated from the generated linguistic values to crisp values. In this approach, while perturbing the data, privacy is preserved, but the utility can be neglected.
Another approach namely RG+RP is proposed in [35] which con- sists of two stages. Each individual’s data is perturbed in the first stage by running it through a nonlinear function called repeated Gompertz (RG); in the second stage, a specific random projection (RP) matrix is used to project the perturbed data to a lower dimension in a (almost) distance-preserving manner. Random projection avoids independent component analysis (ICA) attacks and ensures clustering accuracy, while maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation attacks are mitigated by the nonlinear RG function. The recovery resistance of the proposed two- stage randomization method is evaluated in terms of MAP estimation assaults.
The authors of [36] discussed a method called value swapping. There exists no erroneous information as a result of value swapping. While retaining data set wise properties, methods like value swap- ping [36], condensation [19], random projection [35] and additive noise [6] sacrifice the secrecy of individual records by substituting sensitive information with less sensitive records.
Most of the existing methods still lacks in balancing the privacy and utility. Still a trade-off between utility and privacy has been noticed. In our work, the two proposed approaches follow a combination of normalization and some different transformations. When undergoing these various transformations, normalization aids in maintaining the



Euclidean distance between data points as closely as possible to the original data. And the combination of normalization and the transfor- mations helps to preserve geometric features including length, inner product, hyper-plane forms, and hyper-curved surfaces. As our methods go through several stages of transformations, more data is being dis-

The variance of actual and altered data values has traditionally been used to characterize the secrecy of a perturbation method [44]. Secrecy is defined as follows:

are able to provide significant degree of privacy and keep the utility at the same time.
Overview of perturbation technique
There are various number of innovative and effective approaches for preserving privacy. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages of its own [37]. For obtaining individual’s privacy, several of the pertur- bation techniques employ many changes to the original data streams. Data privacy can be protected using these perturbation techniques and also the data utility is expected not to be overlooked. However,

VD uses the relative value difference in the Frobenius norm to express changes in original data items [45]. When the initial data values of a data matrix are altered, it is defined as the following equation in Frobenius norm [45].

approaches [5]. This classification is determined by the position of computing for data mining performance. The perturbation method is well-suited to both centralized and distributed computing applica- tions [38]. Perturbation techniques alter the original data before data mining activities. In most circumstances, individual records cannot be recovered, but aggregate distributions can [5]. All aggregated distri- butions are significant for data mining and analytical jobs. However, adversaries will have a difficult time extracting concealed information about individuals from the skewed published data [39]. There are two types of data perturbation techniques [40] — unidimensional

Utility of data

Utility generally means the amount of important data about a data stream which is necessary for data mining activities [5]. We employed two utility metrics in this study, which are described next.

Accuracy
It represents how many instances are correctly predicted with re- spect to total observations. The percentage of appropriate results made by data mining algorithms is measured by accuracy [5,46]. Hence, the accuracy is defined as follows:

F1-score
The F1-score combines the precision and recall into a single metric by taking their harmonic mean. A balance between recall and precision can be established by F1-Score [5,46]. If precision P and recall R, then F1-Score can be defined as Eq. (12).

Precision
Precision is the probability that a data is relevant once the algorithm has returned it [48]. A model’s total number of positive predictions divided by the proportion of true positives is known as precision [49]. Precision can be written in regards to true positives and false positives (FP) as follows [49]:

Then scaling transformation is used to alter the data matrix 𝐷1𝑚×𝑛

Recall can be defined as the likelihood of retrieving a relevant data [48]. Recall is the ratio of true positives to total number of actual positives [49]. Recall can be written as follows [49]:
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =	𝑇 𝑃	(14)
𝑇 𝑃 + 𝐹 𝑁
Proposed approach

The proposed NOS2R approach consists of normalization, scaling, shearing and reflection. Then the NOS2R2 approach is the combination of NOS2R and 3D rotation transformation. The NOS2R algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1.
The proposed approach starts by using the data matrix 𝐷𝑚×𝑛 as
input, where n represents the total number of attributes and m repre-
sents the total number of instances. At first, the data set is normalized
The process of transformation entails changing and moving the current points. Scaling is applied to alter or modify an object’s size. Scaling factors are used to make the shift [12]. The item size will either be increased or decreased depending on the scaling factor [51]. The data size increases if the scaling factor is greater than 1. It is known as magnification [12,51]. The data size is decreased when the scaling factor is less than 1 which is called reduction [12,51]. Thus the data distortion is materialized by the magnification or reduction of the data value. The general form of scaling transformation can be written as Eq. (16) [12]:
𝑃 ′ = 𝑆.(𝑃 )	(16)

an attribute, z-score normalization helps to re-scale it. For rescaling, the attribute’s mean and standard deviation is used [5]. As a result, it generates a characteristic with a unit variance, zero mean, and good handling of outliers. It can be defined by the following Eq. (15) [50].

Similarly, when shearing is done along the Z direction, the coordinate of Z remains unchanged while the coordinate of X and Y are changed. For the explanation let us see the shearing matrices as shown in Table 6 [52].

𝑃 ′(𝑥′, 𝑦′, 𝑧′) is the altered data point.
𝑥′ = 𝑥	(17)
𝑦′ = 𝑦 + 𝑆𝑦 ∗ 𝑥	(18)
𝑧′ = 𝑧 + 𝑆𝑥 ∗ 𝑥	(19)
Similarly, shearing along Y axis performs the data alteration as follows [52]:
𝑥′ = 𝑥 + 𝑆𝑥 ∗ 𝑦	(20)
𝑦′ = 𝑦	(21)
𝑧′ = 𝑧 + 𝑆𝑧 ∗ 𝑦	(22)
Again, data contortion is transpired through shearing along Z axis by the given equations [52]:

be written as Eq. (26) [12]. Thus reflection changes the coordinate points of the original data.
𝑃 ′ = 𝑅𝑓 .(𝑃 )	(26)
The reflection matrices along planes are given in Table 10. The reflec- tion transformation takes place through step 6 to step 8 of algorithm
1. The reflected data matrix of our example is shown in Table 11. This resultant data matrix of reflection transformation is the per-
turbed data set using the NOS2R method. And finally the rotation transformation is applied on the resultant data matrix of Algorithm 1 according to Algorithm 2.
In this study, 3D rotation was accomplished using the double rota- tion matrices shown in Table 12 [8]. Therefore for rotating the data set using geometric multiplication, three attributes of the relevant data set

𝑥′ = 𝑥 + 𝑆
∗ 𝑧	(23)
must be executed simultaneously. As an execution unit, we employed

𝑥	three sequential attributes (𝐴𝑖, 𝐴𝑗 , 𝐴𝑘) ∈ 𝐷8

and termed it a triplet.

NOS2R algorithm. At first, 𝐷2𝑚×𝑛 is transformed using 𝑆ℎ𝑥 and 𝐷3𝑚×𝑛 is The shearing transformation is done through step 3 to step 5 in the generated. Then 𝐷3𝑚×𝑛 is transformed using 𝑆ℎ𝑦 and 𝐷4𝑚×𝑛 is generated. After that, 𝐷4𝑚×𝑛 is transformed using 𝑆ℎ𝑧 and 𝐷5𝑚×𝑛 is generated. The
corresponding data matrices after shearing along X, Y and Z axis are
given in Table 7, Table 8 and Table 9 respectively. To do so, let us use
𝑆𝑥=2, 𝑆𝑦=2.5 and 𝑆𝑧=3.
After shearing, reflection is done. The data value that is reflected
always takes shape on the opposite side of the mirror. As the distance
the reflected point 𝑃 ′ and the mirror, the reflection transformation can between a data point P and the mirror is same as the distance between
Triplet production is simple if the number of attributes is like 3t in total, where t = 1, 2, 3, etc. When there are 3t + 1 number of attributes, the third attribute is combined with the first two to form a triplet. For
example, if the final attribute is n, the attributes of the triplet are [n−2,
n−1, n]. The triplet can be created by combining the attribute n−2 with n−1 and n, if there are a total of 3t+2 attributes. Then the attributes of the triplet are [n−2, n−1, n]. Here, 𝑡1 = [Customer ID, Account number, Amount of Transaction] and 𝑡2 = [Account number, Amount of
Transaction, Current Balance] are the triplets used in our example. Due

created using the sequential first three attributes. By setting 𝜃 = 0.1 Multiple rotation angles are produced once the initial triplet is to 360, a 3D rotation matrix 𝑅𝜃 is produced. In line 6 of Algorithm 2, a rotation is done by the matrix multiplication of (𝐴𝑖, 𝐴𝑗 , 𝐴𝑘) and 𝑅𝜃

Various classification techniques are used by different classifiers [53]. We have used one benchmark classifier named Decision Tree (DT) [54]. A decision tree is a tree-based method where each path leading from the root is characterized by a data separating sequence up until a Boolean result is attained at the leaf node [54]. In these tree structures, the leaves stand in for class labels and the branches signify the combinations of features that result in those class labels [55]
We have used MATLAB R2020a as the implementation platform. The existing methods 3DRT and NRoReM and the proposed methods NOS2R and NOS2R2 are implemented using MATLAB R2020a. We also calculated the privacy metrics using MATLAB. After that,for the classification model, Weka 3.8.5 has been employed to generate data

Analysis of privacy

We have studied the privacy-preserving performance of NOS2R and NOS2R2 utilizing the metrics which were described in Section 4.1. Again an increase in information entropy and ICA attack analysis [41] was evaluated to measure its privacy-preserving capabilities. The pro- posed NOS2R and NOS2R2 approaches are mostly related to NRoReM

are then calculated in line 8 by computing 𝜈𝑎𝑟(𝐴𝑖 −𝐴′), 𝜈𝑎𝑟(𝐴𝑗 −𝐴′ ) and
why, in this work, NOS2R and NOS2R2 are compared to 3DRT and

𝑖	𝑗

𝜈𝑎𝑟(𝐴𝑘 − 𝐴′ ) respectively. Step 9 of Algorithm 2 compares variances 𝜈1,
𝜈2, and 𝜈3 to the security thresholds st =[𝛿1, 𝛿2, 𝛿3] where 𝛿1, 𝛿2, 𝛿3 > 0
and the inequalities are 𝜈1 > 𝛿1, 𝜈2 > 𝛿2 and 𝜈3 > 𝛿3. We applied
the security thresholds to ensure that the rotated triplet’s attributes
fulfill a minimum variance. For other triplets, these security criteria might be different. Every triplet may differ in variance range because of this. Then the variances and the angles are selected for which the inequalities become true. The covariance matrix of the relevant triplet’s components was then added to the resulting difference matrix’s covariance matrix to calculate the overall variance. Then in line 12 of
Algorithm 2, 𝜃𝑚 is calculated that yields the highest total variance. Then
this 𝜃𝑚 was used to generate the final perturbed data set.
After applying rotation, the resultant data set is the final perturbed data set of NOS2R2 approach. The perturbed data set of our example
is shown in Table 13 where we have used Z axis as rotation axis and 𝜃
= 38◦ as the angle that provides maximum variance.
The block diagrams representing NOS2R and NOS2R2 are given in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respectively.
NRoReM.

Privacy protection
NOS2R and NOS2R2 both have the potential to protect individuals’ privacy. The secrecy level for NOS2R and NOS2R2 are higher than that of both existing approaches which we have used in this study. Table 15 shows the secrecy level comparison.
The mean Friedman test ranks are provided in the final row of Table 15. A lower FMR value denotes a lower level of secrecy, whereas a higher value denotes a higher level of secrecy. According to the exper-
iment’s test statistics: chi-square 𝜒 2 value of 28.08 and the probability
value p is less than 0.00001. The 𝑝-value shows that the variations
in secrecy levels between 3DRT, NRoReM, NOS2R and NOS2R2 are significant. We can conclude from the Friedman Mean Rank (FMR) data that NOS2R offers better secrecy than 3DRT and NRoReM. And NOS2R2 provides the greatest secrecy level. As reported by our study, both NOS2R and NOS2R2 offer better secrecy across all the data set compared to NRoReM and 3DRT. Even NOS2R2 provides higher secrecy than our proposed first method NOS2R. So our proposed both methods

work well than the existing 3DRT and NRoReM approach. And among all the methods NOS2R2 method is superior.
VD, RP, and CP should have higher values for improved privacy protection; however, the value of CK and RK should be lower [45].
Table 16 shows the value of VD, RP, RK, CP and CK. Here, it is seen that, at least two of the metrics show that the NOS2R strategy protects more privacy compared to 3DRT and NRoReM for 90% the data set and NOS2R2 works better for all the data set. Similarly, in case of

Attack resistance
There are various sorts of attacks which are addressed against data perturbation methods. One of the attacks is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which aims to recreate the original data from the altered data [41]. The attack resistance of NOS2R and NOS2R2 is evaluated against an ICA attack because it is based on matrix multiplication. When there is a bigger difference between the altered and actual data, the ICA attack becomes more challenging.
Table 17 shows the values for ICA attack analysis. The values represent the standard deviation of the difference between the ICA- reconstructed data and the initial data. The last row shows the FMR
Here the chi-square 𝜒 2 value and the probability value, p are 22.35 and values for the comparison of the existing and proposed approaches.
0.000055 respectively, where p demonstrates the significance of the variations in ICA attack resistance among all the methods. According to our analysis, NOS2R offers 33% higher resistance against ICA attack than 3DRT and 11.5% higher resistance than NRoReM. And NOS2R2 is the most resistant method against ICA attack. NOS2R2 is 39.2% more resistant to ICA attack than 3DRT and 15.5% more resistant against ICA attack than NRoReM. So our proposed both methods work better than the existing 3DRT and NRoReM approach. And among all the methods NOS2R2 method is superior in case of attack resistance.

Increase in information entropy
Information entropy indicates the amount of information contained in an event. The average rate of information production from a random source of data is known as information entropy. Shannon’s entropy can be used to calculate the information entropy of a data set. The formula of Shannon’s entropy is given in Eq. (27) [3].

of X, with X = < 𝑥1, 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑛 >. 𝑃 (𝑥𝑖) represents the probability of where H(X), a discrete random variable which denotes the entropy occurrence of 𝑥𝑖 and  denotes the summation over X.
Using Eq. (28) [3], the average information entropy increase are
determined.

three metrics, for 80% the data set, NOS2R protects more privacy than 3DRT and NRoReM; NOS2R2 offers more privacy for all the data set. Again, using four metrics among those five demonstrate that NOS2R and NOS2R2 provide higher level of privacy for 70% the data set and 90% the data set respectively than both existing approaches which we have used in this study. Moreover, NOS2R2 is compared against 3DRT, NRoReM and NOS2R.
It is seen that, at least two metrics demonstrate the superiority of NOS2R2 than others for all of the data set and that of for 90% of the data set for at least three and four metrics.
Here, 𝐻 (𝑥𝑖) is the entropy for every attribute of the original data set. Similarly, 𝐻 (𝑥′) stands for every attribute’s entropy of the altered data
set. AIE represents an average increase in information entropy. When the AIE values are greater than 0, it means that the altered data set have more impurities than the original data set. Fig. 3 shows the AIE for 3DRT, NRoReM, NOS2R, and NOS2R2. The bar chart shows that, the entropy level is greater for NOS2R compared to NRoReM and 3DRT for 90% the data set. Also, NOS2R2 provides higher entropy than 3DRT, NRoReM and NOS2R for 90% of the data set. Our experimental analysis says that, NOS2R provides 6.94% higher entropy than 3DRT and 3.44% higher entropy than NRoReM. Furthermore, NOS2R2 provides 17.72% higher entropy than 3DRT and 15.48% higher entropy than NRoReM.

Table 19
Absolute accuracy differences.




Analysis of utility

From Table 18, it is seen that the accuracy of NOS2R and NOS2R2 are more similar to that of the original data than NRoReM and 3DRT. For over 70% data set, NOS2R outperforms NRoReM and 3DRT. And for 80% data set, NOS2R2 approach performs on a greater scale.
The absolute differences in classification accuracy shown in Table 19 demonstrate this analysis. Table 19 displays the differences between the accuracy found in the altered data set by 3DRT, NRoReM, NOS2R and NOS2R2 and that of the original data set.
From this accuracy difference, it can be said that the accuracy of NOS2R is 28.62% closer to the original data than 3DRT and 16.81% closer than NRoReM. As well, NOS2R2 is 50.5% closer to the original data than 3DRT and 42.32% closer than NRoReM.
It is also obvious from the analysis of Eq. (29) that the utility of NOS2R and NOS2R2 approach are maintained. The classification accuracy of the original data set, Ro, and the perturbed data set, Rp, are both expressed in Eq. (29). The value of e indicates the lowest level
over which the utility of the classifiers can be maintained.
𝐸 = 𝑅𝑝 − (1 − 𝑒)𝑅𝑜	(29)
For this analysis, e is set to 0.03068. Then it is observed that the classifier is able to maintain the utility in case of NOS2R and NOS2R2; however fail in case of 3DRT and NRoReM for this lowest value of e. That is why e is set to 0.03068. In Fig. 4, this is depicted.
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑛 values are plotted along the 𝑦-axis of the graph in Fig. 4 and
are calculated as follows: At first, the minimum error returned for each
is made using the value of minimum error for every method. These 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑛 strategy is identified. This is carried out for every data set. Next, a plot
that  𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑛   is  positive  for  greater  values  of  e. values are displayed against e which initializes at 0.1 since Fig. 4 shows
The utilities of the data set that the classifier, decision tree return, are maintained if Eq. (29) shows that the value of error E ≥ 0. As a result, we found that the utility of NOS2R and NOS2R2 can be maintained for e = 0.03068 but fail for 3DRT and NRoReM, as shown in Fig. 5. If we further decrease the value of e and set at 0.03067, then the utility for NOS2R2 is preserved but fail for 3DRT, NRoReM and NOS2R as well for this value of e. This is shown in Fig. 6.
The 𝑦-axis in Figs. 5 and 6 shows 𝐸𝑚, the minimum error. It has been
found that NOS2R and NOS2R2 perturbation successfully preserves
the utility of the entire data set for the lowest value of e = 0.03068. However, it turns out that 3DRT and NRoReM do not preserve 100% utility for the same value of e.
Besides accuracy, f1-score analysis is helpful to evaluate the effec- tiveness of classification algorithms on a larger scale. The bar chart in Fig. 7 shows that where analysis of accuracy compromises, the NOS2R approach provides 43.65% better result than 3DRT and 22% closer f1- score to original data than NRoReM. Again the NOS2R2 perturbation method outperforms all of the 3DRT, NRoReM and NOS2R approaches in terms of f1-score. NOS2R2 results in 50.25% closer f1-score to origi- nal data than 3DRT and 31.22% closer f1-score compared to NRoReM.

Furthermore, Precision is another important metric for utility eval- uation. The bar graph in Fig. 8 demonstrates that, NOS2R algorithm yields precisions that are 48.03% and 21.89% better than 3DRT and NRoReM respectively. Similarly, NOS2R2 approach generates preci- sions which are 53.93% and 30.77% closer to original one in compar- ison to 3DRT and NRoReM respectively.
In addition to the other utility metrics, recall analysis is also of utmost significance. Fig. 9 illustrates the recall values for the existing and proposed methods. From Fig. 9, it can be found that the recall values for NOS2R is 21.4% and 16.15% closer to original one than that of 3DRT and NRoReM methods respectively. All of the 3DRT,

NRoReM, and NOS2R techniques are outperformed by the NOS2R2 perturbation method while evaluating recall values. NOS2R2 algorithm offers 39.85% and 35.82% better recall values than 3DRT and NRoReM respectively.
Hence, we see that the existing approaches are outperformed for the majority of the data set by NOS2R and NOS2R2. A comparative summary has been provided in the Table 20. Thus our methods provide better balance between privacy and utility. Our proposed methods work much better than the existing methods. But in case of big data there is an uncertainty regarding the amount of time these approaches will take.

Discussion and shortcomings

For most of the data set, NOS2R and NOS2R2 surpass 3DRT and NRoReM, but they fall short in a few instances. NOS2R is a four stage
data perturbation technique and NOS2R2 is five stage data perturbation technique. The improved performance is a result of all phases of NOS2R and NOS2R2. Normalization helps to maintain a close rela- tionship of euclidean distances of the data points. Normalization is followed by scaling transformation. Scaling can be used to modify an object’s size. The coordinate values can be multiplied by scaling factors to achieve this. The original coordinate X can be multiplied by a scaling factor to get the modified coordinate X’. Then shearing transformation is done. Shearing also causes a change in object’s shape and the data value and a new shape is appeared. Thus shearing play a vital role in preserving privacy as the data value is changed and a new shape is appeared. Again, geometric reflection and rotation are isometric transformations [56]. NOS2R uses scaling, shearing and reflection transformation. and NOS2R2 uses rotation along with these transformations. Rotation and reflection are strict isometric transforma- tion. Scaling is not isometric transformation, but it still can maintain

the similarity [56]. Thus scaling, rotation and reflection are used to maintain the utility. But in our work, to increase the level of privacy, a 3D rotation matrix with a mixture of clockwise and counterclockwise
directions has been employed (for example, the 𝑧-axis is counterclock-
wise, the other two axes are clockwise). The rotated data points’ spatial representation therefore varies in a number of ways which conflicts with maintaining utility. Several new study directions have been made possible by this work. To begin with, other transformations or methods can be applied with this work to compare the utility and privacy preservation. The proposed approaches might be used for other data mining tasks, such as regression, clustering, and so on. Currently, we have used numerical data to validate our methods. Adapting these methods to deal with categorical data can be potential avenue for future research. Again, investigating alternative attacks is another crucial topic for future research. ICA attack analysis has been employed in
this work. Further attacks can be put under consideration for a better analysis.

Conclusion

The main goal of this research work is to perturb the data for preserving privacy along with maintaining the utility at the same time. Data perturbation techniques are applied to multivariate data set in or- der to change the original data items. The recent perturbation methods frequently address the trade-off between privacy and data utility. The proposed NOS2R and NOS2R2 approaches perturb all the features of the data set. The data items are standardized using a normalization process, which is followed by scaling, shearing, reflection and rotation. Thus the data elements are distorted. But the data set’s geometrical shapes remain constant. This property facilitates in maintaining the original data set’s utility and the composite transformation significantly



increases privacy to a significant level. Then the results of the proposed methods are compared with the other existing methods. And the pro- posed two methods provide better results than the existing methods. NOS2R and NOS2R2 perturbation approaches maintain data utility and preserve individual privacy on a larger scale for 90% data set. However, the work proposed in this paper can be well extended with feature reduction in multiparty clustering scenarios.
