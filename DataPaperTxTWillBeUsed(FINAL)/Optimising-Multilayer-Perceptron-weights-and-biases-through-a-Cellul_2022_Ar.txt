Medical data classification
In recent years, technology in medicine has shown a significant advance due to artificial intelligence becoming a framework to make accurate medical diagnoses. Models like Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) can detect implicit patterns in data, allowing identifying patients conditions that cannot be seen easily. MLPs consist of biased neurons arranged in layers, connected by weighted connections. Their effectiveness depends on finding the optimal weights and biases that reduce the classification error, which is usually done by using the Back Propagation algorithm (BP). But BP has several disadvantages that could provoke the MLP not to learn. Metaheuristics are alternatives to BP that reach high-quality solutions without using many computational resources. In this work, the Cellular Genetic Algorithm (CGA) with a specially designed crossover operator called Damped Crossover (DX), is proposed to optimise weights and biases of the MLP to classify medical data. When compared against state-of-the-art algorithms, the CGA configured with DX obtained the minimal Mean Square Error value in three out of the five considered medical datasets and was the quickest algorithm with four datasets, showing a better balance between time consumed and optimisation performance. Additionally, it is competitive in enhancing classification quality, reaching the best accuracy with two datasets and the second-best accuracy with two of the remaining.





Introduction

Nowadays, it is impossible to imagine advances in medicine without talking about artificial intelligence. The incredible amount of data from different sources, such as medical images, data from clinical examinations, sensors and many others, outperforms by far the human capacity to process and analyse them [1]. For example, an average radiologist technician analyses about 215,000 radiography in about 40 years, while an artificial intelligence method processes that amount in about an hour [2].
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) undoubtedly are one of the arti- ficial intelligence methods that more contributions to the medical field have reported [3]. Examples of applications of ANNs to medicine are: diagnosis of diseases [4,5], prediction of treatments behaviour [6–8] and preventive medicine [9,10].
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) [11] is a kind of ANN in which calculus units, called neurons, are organised in three types of layers. Each neuron is connected to all the neurons of the following layer, and data flow from the first to the last layer. Connections between neurons have a weight representing the strength of the linkage. In addition, both
hidden and output neurons have a bias that acts as a threshold of activation of the neuron.
What became attractive from the MLP was its ability to be a universal classifier that adapts to different distributions, features and complexities of data [12]. This quality is highly desirable in the medical field, considering that medical data can have noise, be imbalanced in the distribution of the classes and can have errors of registration [13]. The MLP effectiveness depends on its learning process, which iden- tifies the weights and biases values that minimise the classification error of training samples. The Back Propagation Algorithm (BP) is the standard way to make the MLP learn. However, BP has several weaknesses that can lead to a divergence in the MLP learning process, such as, a tendency to get stuck in local optima or dependency on initial
values of hyperparameters [14,15].
In recent years, metaheuristics have gained attention as alterna- tives to the BP method. They are iterative algorithms able to find high-quality solutions in a reasonable time. One of their highlighted characteristics is that they can be applied to different kinds of prob- lems without needing specific knowledge [16,17], which makes them

suitable for solving complex optimisation problems such as the learning process of the MLP [18,19]. Studies have demonstrated that meta- heuristics can perform well in training MLP models, even when a large number of weights and biases must be optimised [20,21].

Nevertheless, evolving large-dimensional solutions could be challeng- ing for genetic operators, causing the optimiser to diverge. To address this problem is necessary to design new genetic operators that, by using external information such as the stage of the evolutionary process, can speed up and enhance the convergence of the algorithm [26].
In this paper, the CGA is used as an alternative to finding the optimal weights and biases of the MLP for medical data classification. A new crossover operator, called Damped Crossover (DX), is proposed to improve the performance of the CGA at traversing the search space. The purpose is to obtain a reliable method for training the MLPs and improving classification quality. The main contributions of this work can be summarised as follows:

A CGA is used for the optimisation of weights and biases of the MLP.
A novel genetic crossover operator called Damped Crossover (DX) is introduced. It uses the damped harmonic oscillation function and information related to the best current solution and the stage of the evolutionary process to determine the direction and magnitude of recombination.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) belonging to the feed-forward neural network family. The MLP has a set of processing units called neurons that transform data to get an expected output [27].
Internally, neurons are organised by three well-differentiated layers. The first layer contains the input neurons, which receives the input
data and redirect them to the following layer. The number of input

mathematical functions. An MLP can be configured with one or more hidden layers, according to the complexity of the problem. Finally, the output layer receives the data transformed by the hidden layer and returns a result. The amount of neurons in the output layer depends on the codification of the expected result.
MLP is hierarchical and fully connected, meaning that neurons of one layer interact with all the neurons of the following layer by weighted connections, e.g., each input neuron is connected to all the neurons in the hidden layer.

The activation operation applies a mathematical function to map the result of the summation operation. This function is known as the
the expected binary output 𝑦𝑙 . The idea is, for negative samples 𝑦1,𝑙 has
to be near to 0 and for positive samples near to 1 [15].
Since MSE is a quadratic function, it strongly penalises when the MLP output is far from expected. It is the reason why MSE has been widely used as a fitness function to optimise weights and biases by metaheuristics [14,30].

Traditional approaches to train the MLP

Learning is the process through which the ANN acquire knowledge. It is why they can perform and be effective in classification and regression tasks. In MLP, learning is reached by training the neural network, which is an iterative process for determining the optimal weights and biases to reduce the error between the obtained and the expected output.




/ig. 1. Example of structure of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).


One of the most conventional training methods for MLP is Back Propagation (BP) [31]. It starts setting random values for weights and biases. Classified samples (referred to as training set) are presented to the MLP to get an output value. Then, the error between the obtained and the desired values is calculated and propagated backwards to correct weights and biases. These steps are repeated until an acceptable error is reached [29].
The basic BP algorithm uses a first-order gradient descent for the optimisation of the MLP. Other existent approaches for optimising MLP are conjugate gradient [32] that is based on a second-order minimisation method, Quasi-Newton Method [33], Gauss–Newton [34] or Levenberg–Marquardt [35] that is based on the approximation by least-squares [15].
Although conventional approaches have shown to be effective in most of the problems they were applied to, there were situations in which they stuck in the same error value of MLP during extended peri- ods or even stuck in local optima. Furthermore, their success strongly depends on the initial values of weights, the values of momentum and the learning rate, which can provoke divergence if they are not right defined [14]. Finally, conventional methods put aside biases, focusing just on the values of the weights [15,36].
Considering the disadvantages of traditional methods, in this paper, an MLP optimiser based on the Cellular Genetic Algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal combination of weights and biases values to improve the classification quality.

Related works

In the latest years, it has been demonstrated that metaheuristics are able to be applied for training MLPs, reaching even better results than traditional mathematical methods [37]. This motivated different authors to train MLPs by metaheuristics for different problems in real life, getting featured results.
The work by Kaveh et al. [38] uses the Biogeography-Based Op- timisation algorithm (BBO) to train an MLP that classifies sonar data into three different classes: noises, reverberation, and clutter. A novel mutation operator is introduced in this work to enhance the exploration capability of the BBO. Results have demonstrated that the proposal of new operators can positively impact the behaviour of the algorithm, increasing the resulting classification performance. Qiao et al. [39] also worked with sonar data, proposing a modified Whale Optimisation
Algorithm (WOA) to train an MLP that classifies sonar signals in real- time. This work introduces new ways to control the balance between exploration and exploitation during the evolutionary process using mathematical functions. This approach shows how the mathematical approach could help guide the seeking process of the metaheuristics in large search spaces. Results show that the proposal outperforms literature algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and speed of convergence.
An application to the field of robotics was made by Jalali et al. [40], who compared a set of nature-inspired algorithms to determine the optimal weights and biases of an MLP used for autonomous robot navigation. Considered algorithms were the Moth–Flame Algorithm (MFO), the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), the Grey Wolf Opti- miser (GWO), the Cuckoo Search (CS) and the Multi-Verse Optimiser (MVO). The evaluated algorithms overcame the traditional approaches BP and Levenberg–Marquardt, demonstrating that metaheuristics per- form a better exploration and local-optima avoidance.
Mansouri et al. [41] implement a GWO hybridised to an Evolu- tionary Strategy (ES) algorithm to train an ANN to detect unusual sensor networks behaviour. The GWO is used when accuracy is critical, and ES is used when it is preferred to perform quickly detections. Results demonstrated that both approaches perform as expected, being the ANN capable of accurately recognising anomalies in industrial sensor networks. It also shows that different metaheuristics can provide distinct behaviour tailored to the particular context of the problem.
For the energy production problems, Aladejare et al. [42] developed an ANN trainer based on the PSO to predict the higher heat value of coal, biomass and other solid fuels to determine their energy con- tent. The ANN trained by PSO exhibits satisfactory predictive ability compared to multilinear and multi nonlinear models in the literature. Several proposals in the literature addressed classification problems over medical datasets from different specialities by using metaheuristics
for training ANNs.
In [43], a Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm (BOA) is used to train an MLP. Results showed that the BOA reached a performance similar to the existing approaches. Tests have just focused on the Parkinson and vertebral dataset, which suggests that different complexities and distributions of data need to be considered to confirm that the method can train the MLP effectively in complex situations. Furthermore, the author used the canonical version of the BOA, which suggests that bet- ter results would be achieved if a specific modification to the algorithm



is proposed. Another bio-inspired algorithm in the literature is the pro- posal by Das et al. [44] in that a Velocity Enhanced Whale Optimisation Algorithm (VEWOA) trains an ANN to classify data related to breast cancer, cervical cancer, and lung cancer. The VEWOA raises that each whale has to have a velocity, calculated as in PSO, where positions of the best and the previous positions of particles are considered. Results were compared against different machine learning approaches and the canonical WOA, making it difficult to observe whether this approach enhances the performance of metaheuristics specifically designed for MLP training.
Kumar et al. [45] propose an Inertia Motivated Gray Wolf Optimisa- tion Algorithm (IMGWO) that trains an MLP to classify data concerning breast cancer, heart disease, hepatitis and Parkinson’s disease. The IMGWO introduces a new method of calculating the balance between exploration and exploitation using a non-linear function. It also pro- poses to use velocity concepts similar to the PSO. The number of eval- uations required for the IMGWO to converge is significantly higher than the one used in the literature, indicating that those changes could have a negative effect on the convergence capacity of the algorithm. The IMGWO performed better than the canonical version of GA, PSO, and GWO. Despite this, comparisons didn’t make with the metaheuristics prepared to train MLPs, resulting in an unfair comparison.
Sharifi et al. [46] compared the GA and the PSO in defining the initial weights and biases of an MLP for detecting thyroid func- tional disease. After the initialisation phase, the MLP is trained by the Levenberg–Marquardt method. Results demonstrated that GA and PSO could contribute to accurate diagnoses, being the GA better than the PSO at improving the classification quality.
Salman et al. [47] compare GA, PSO and Fireworks Algorithms (FWA) at optimising weights and biases of an MLP for the classification of five benchmark medical datasets. Metaheuristics were tried over different MLP architectures, which contributed to understanding how metaheuristics performance could be affected by ANN architectural decisions and different parameters configurations. Results show that architectural changes did not significantly affect the performance of the algorithms. Nonetheless, increasing the iterations performed by each metaheuristic reported improvements in classification quality. Results inherently imply that metaheuristics perform well even when many weights or biases have to be optimised.
Bhattacharjee in [48] proposes five different hybridisations between GA and PSO to train an MLP that classifies human glioma from molec- ular brain neoplasia data. This paper provides an interesting point of view about how PSO and GA can be combined and which combination provides the best results. This work established that hybridisations between PSO and GA can report good results due to the synergetic effect generated.
In [49] authors compare eleven recently-proposed metaheuristics for training an ANN to classify fifteen different medical datasets. Al- gorithms included in the experiments were the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), the Ant Lion Optimiser (ALO), the BBO, the Equilibrium Opti- miser (EO), the MFO, the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), the PSO, the Sine–Cosine Algorithm (SCA), the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), the Trigonometric Mutation Differential Evolution (TDE), the WOA, a hybrid SSA with PSO, a hybrid SSA with SCA and the deterministic method for training ANN Levenberg–Marquardt. Evaluations focused on seven different classification quality metrics. Metaheuristics have proven to be highly effective in training ANNs. However, the evalu- ation has not considered the BP, overlooking one of the widely used options for training an ANN. The authors highlighted the EO among the metaheuristics, which obtained better values when considering all the classification metrics. Besides, the parameters of the EO were selected by observing which configuration provides the best results. The other algorithms were configured by adaptive approaches or setups used in literature, suggesting that comparisons could have been unfair.
Orozco et al. [50] applied multi-objective CGA to optimise an MLP. The multi-objective approach is focused on optimising the architecture
and weights of the connections of the MLP but not the biases. The method was tested over two breast cancer medical datasets, and the CGA was configured with standard genetics operators. The proposal has reached similar results to algorithms of the literature. However, since the algorithm did not take biases into account, new approaches should be raised for optimising all MLP parameters.
After analysing all these contributions, it seems clear that very few approaches design and evaluate new operators to improve numerically the search along with the problem space. In this paper, a CGA approach is proposed to address the problem of optimising the weights and biases of the MLP. The idea is to take advantage of the properties of the CGA for better exploration and exploitation, such as the slow spread of the best solution and exploitation in neighbourhoods. In addition, a novel specially designed crossover operator is proposed. The aim is to make the evolutionary process more accurate as it runs and to consider the best solution in neighbourhoods that do not have it. To the best of our knowledge, no presented work has encompassed the components of this paper.

Cellular genetic algorithm

The Cellular Genetic Algorithm (CGA) [22] is a decentralised evolu- tionary algorithm based on the canonical Genetic Algorithm (GA) [51] that differs in how the population is managed. In CGA, individuals are distributed on a toroidal mesh where border individuals, in columns or rows, are connected to those on the opposite border.
During the evolutionary process, where the genetic operators are applied, individuals can interact just with their neighbours. Neighbours are the closest individuals determined by a type of neighbourhood, considering the Manhattan distance. Through the use of neighbour- hoods, CGA is able to conduct a local search process within each one, which facilitates the discovery of better near solutions (exploitation of the search space). It is possible because genetic operators are applied to neighbourhoods as they were isolated from the whole population. In addition, neighbourhoods are superposed, which implies that an individual takes part in more than one neighbourhood. Thus, an in- dividual spreads the improvements in its genes throughout all of the neighbourhoods it belongs to. This quality provokes the slowly spread of better solutions through the population, enhancing the exploration process.
Fig. 2 presents the way in that CGA evolves a given individ- ual (white circle). First, the neighbourhood of the individual to be evolved is obtained. In Fig. 2, the type of neighbourhood used is called Compact-9 or C9, which includes all the individuals in the mesh surrounding the individual to be evolved (marked with black circles). Genetics operators are applied to two individuals from the neighbour- hood. The resulting individual is evaluated, and a replacement policy is applied to decide if it will replace the individual being evolved.
A more profound point of view of the operation of the CGA is presented in Algorithm 1. Three well-differentiated stages can explain the evolutionary process carried out:
Initialisation stage: It involves lines 2 to 4. The population is randomly generated and then evaluated. Next, the auxiliary
variable 𝑡, which is used to count the number of evaluations
performed, is initialised.
Evolutionary stage: It goes from line 5 to 15. If the stop condi- tion is not reached (checked on line 5), the iteration is performed. Per step in the iteration, an individual and its neighbourhood are selected. Genetic operators are applied to them, generating two new individuals. After performing the fitness evaluations (line 11), the selected individual is replaced if one of the gen- erated individuals is fitter. This process is shown in Fig. 2 and is performed on all the individuals in the population. In line
13, the auxiliary variable 𝑡 is increased to reflect the number of
evaluations performed. The evolutionary stage is repeated while
the stop condition is not met.

The advantage of using the vector representation is that it results in a straightforward encoding and decoding process because elements of the individual do not need to be decoded to be applied to the MLP.

3.2. The damped crossover

This work proposes a novel crossover that considers different fea- tures of the evolutionary process that can lead the population to reach points of the search space near to a global optimum. The crossover operator is called The Damped Crossover (DX) because it is inspired by the damped harmonic oscillation function, which describes how an oscillating object tends to an equilibrium point as time runs [52].
The DX operator is based on two premises. The first one is that the knowledge acquired by the best individual during the evolutionary process is essential. So, this information must be considered when parents are crossed. The second premise is that influence from parents and the best solution has to be more specific as the evolutionary process runs because it is supposed that the solutions are near-optimal at the latest iterations.
In a given execution, the DX generates the 𝑖th elements of two
offspring 𝑂𝑓 1 and 𝑂𝑓 2 by using Eqs. (7) and (8) respectively.

Individual representation

In literature, three kinds of individuals representation are used for MLP weights and biases optimisation: vector, matrix or binary [14].
The vector is used in this work. It represents each individual as a real array with a dimension equal to the total number of weights and biases in an MLP. Each element of the array corresponds to either a weight or a bias value. An example of this kind of representation, based on Fig. 1, is presented in Fig. 3.
𝑖	𝑖	𝑖
𝑂𝑓 2𝑖 = 𝑝2𝑖 + 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑖	(8)
where 𝑝1𝑖 and 𝑝2𝑖 are the 𝑖th elements of the parents 𝑝1 and 𝑝2 respec- tively. 𝑖𝑛𝑐 is the increment performed over each element, calculated
by Eq. (9).
𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑖 = 𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑓𝑖 × (1 + 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜)	(9)
𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑓𝑖 is the difference between the 𝑖th element of the best individual (𝐵𝐼𝑖) and the average of the 𝑖th element of parents. It is obtained
by Eq. (10).
𝑝1𝑖 + 𝑝2𝑖
𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑓𝑖 = 𝐵𝐼𝑖 −	2	(10)




 

/ig. 4. Behaviour of damped harmonic oscillation function, presented in Eq. (11).

𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 is determined by Eq. (11). It applies the damped harmonic oscillation function to determine how big the influence of parents and the best individual will be. This function provides a desirable
behaviour because it applies more variable changes at the beginning of the evolutionary process but is more precise at the end, doing minimal changes to the influence of the best individual and the parents.
𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = 𝐴 × 𝑒(−𝐶𝑡) × sin (𝑃 + 99.75 × 𝑡)	(11)
where 𝑡 is the number of evaluations performed at the moment of the execution of the DX. 𝐴 is the initial amplitude of the function set to

Experiments configuration

This section presents the experimental setup. It provides informa- tion related to the evaluations to be performed, considered algorithms, standard configurations of the MLP and characteristics of the used datasets.
Comparisons were performed against different variations of the CGA, introduced in Section 4.1, and state-of-the-art algorithms. Consid- ered algorithms and their configurations are presented in Section 4.2. The MLP uses the sigmoid function as the activation function. The fitness function for the learning process performed by metaheuristics is the MSE, also known as cost function in the ANN scope [43,53]. The structure of the MLP is always the same. The number of input
neurons (𝑛) matches the number of features of the dataset. The MLP
neurons (𝑚) is determined by Eq. (12), following the rule established is configured with a unique hidden layer where the number of hidden

𝑚 = 2 × 𝑛 + 1	(12)
Each weight and biases values are restricted to the interval [−1,1]
according to the values handled in other approximations [30,54,55].
The training dataset aims to present the greatest amount of samples to the MLP to identify the optimal weights and biases values and obtain a reliable classification model. It is the only dataset involved in the training phase in traditional methods, so it is also used for the training process made by metaheuristics [14,37]. The test dataset is used when the metaheuristics have finished their training phase to corroborate the ultimate performance of classification reached by the MLP, observe its generalisation ability and confirm whether there was or not over-fitting.
The stop condition for all the algorithms is to reach 10 000 fitness evaluations. Due to the non-deterministic nature of metaheuristics, 30 independent runs are executed for each algorithm and with each dataset [53–55]. The tables in the results section mark a result with boldface when it is the best and with italic when it is the second-best according to the used performance metric. The Wilcoxon rank-sum [56] test is applied to check whether the differences between the CGA variations and the other algorithms are statistically significant or just a matter of chance. The statistically significant differences are high-

Algorithms are executed in the Toko cluster1 with an AMD Opteron/ Epyc processor (64 cores and 128 GB of RAM). The operating sys- tem is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Metaheuristics are implemented using the jmetalpy [57] library, and for MLPs the neurolab2 library is utilised.

CGA operators

Experiments compare the CGA configured with the Damped Crossover(DX) against other configurations that vary the genetic op- erators. Crossover operators used for experiments are:
Adjusted Crossover (AX): It was proposed by Yasojima et al.
[58] to deal with two problems of the crossover operators for real-coded solutions. The first problem is that crossover methods may be stuck in local optima or reach not feasible solutions. The second problem is that generated solutions are limited to
the values of their parents. To deal with it, elements 𝑂𝑓 1𝑖 and
𝑂𝑓 2𝑖 of first and second offspring, are generated by Eqs. (13)
and (14).
𝑂𝑓 1𝑖 = 𝑝1𝑖 + ((𝑝1𝑖 − 𝑝2𝑖) × 𝛼) × 𝑔𝑖	(13)
𝑂𝑓 2𝑖 = 𝑝2𝑖 + (𝑝1𝑖 − 𝑝2𝑖) × 𝛼 × 𝑔𝑖	(14) where 𝑝1𝑖 is the element 𝑖 of the first parent, 𝑝2𝑖 is the element 𝑖
of the second parent. 𝑔𝑖 is the gradient value of the element 𝑖. It
is 1 if the value of the element 𝑖 in the fittest parent is bigger than in the other parent. Otherwise 𝑔𝑖 is −1. Finally, 𝛼 is the weight of the crossover. In this paper, 𝛼 is 0.02 as recommended in [58].
Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX): It was proposed by Deb and Agrawal [59]. SBX simulates the single-point crossover of binary
representations. The elements of the offspring 𝑂𝑓 1𝑖 and 𝑂𝑓 2𝑖 are
obtained by Eq. (15) and Eq. (16) respectively.
𝑂𝑓 1𝑖 = 0.5 × [(1 + 𝛽𝑞 ) × 𝑝1𝑖 + (1 − 𝛽𝑞 ) × 𝑝2𝑖]	(15)
𝑂𝑓 2𝑖 = 0.5 × [(1 − 𝛽𝑞 ) × 𝑝1𝑖 + (1 + 𝛽𝑞 ) × 𝑝2𝑖]	(16)

where 𝑝1𝑖 is the element 𝑖 of the first parent, 𝑝2𝑖 is the element 𝑖
of the second parent and 𝛽𝑞 is an ordinate obtained by Eq. (17).
In order to increase the rigour of evaluations and observe if DX crossover can improve the performance of the CGA, twelve possible variations of CGA are obtained by combining crossover and muta-

CGA variations are produced using four different mutation operators that vary in the strategy to diversify the population. The mutation operators are:

Bat Algorithm (BAT) is a metaheuristic proposed by Yang and Gandomi [63]. It is based on the behaviour of bats, which detect prey by an echolocation mechanism. In the algorithm, each bat moves through the search space by modifying its speed and based

more precise movements will be made.
Uniform Mutation (UM): In this case, the element 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑡 is substi- tuted by a mutated value 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑡+1 obtained by Eq. (20).
𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑡+1 = 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑡 + (𝑟 − 0.5) × 𝑢	(20)
With a random number 𝑟 ∈ [0, 1] and the disturbance level of the operator 𝑢 set to 0.5. If the value generated is out of the range
delimited by the lower and the upper bounds, the new value will be one of the bounds.
Polynomial Mutation (PM): This mutation operator was pro- posed by Deb and Agrawal [62]. A polynomial probability dis- tribution is used in this proposal to mutate each element of the
individual (𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑡), taking into account the lower (𝑙𝑏) and upper (𝑢𝑏)
bounds. Eq. (21) is used to obtain the new value 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑡+1 for the 𝑖th

ones with the aim of another bird to breed them. If the host bird realises that an egg is not its own, the host can destroy the egg or leave the nest. The algorithm mimics this behaviour, considering that a cuckoo egg is laid in a nest if it is better than the egg in the nest.
Differential Evolution (DE) proposed in [65], the DE evolve a current individual by generating each element of a new individual considering a differential weight and the elements of three par- ents selected by a selection method. The new individual replaces the current one if it is better.
Genetic Algorithm (GA) [51] is a metaheuristic based on the Darwinian theory of the evolution of species. In GA, a population evolves by iterations called generations. Three genetic operators are applied. The selection operator selects a set of individuals to go on to the next generation or be recombined by the crossover operator. The crossover operator exploits the shared space of two individuals. Finally, the mutation operator performs random changes to increase the diversity over the population.
Gray Wolf Optimisation (GWO) [66] is a bio-inspired algorithm based on the hunting mechanism of the grey wolf and the leader-

Moth–/lame Optimisation (M/O) [67] is based on the moth behaviour. Moth usually navigates in the direction of the moon because it is an efficient way to go through considerable dis- tances. But, due to the artificial lights, moths get disoriented and

the perturbation applied to elements of the individuals.
Random Mutation (RM): This operator is one of the simplest ways to mutate real-coded individuals. It mutates the value of
an element 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑡 by generating a completely new value between

the lower bound (𝑙𝑏) and the upper bound (𝑢𝑏) of the element, considering a random number 𝑟 in the range [0, 1]. For this, it
uses Eq. (24).
𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑡+1 = 𝑙𝑏 + (𝑢𝑏 − 𝑙𝑏) × 𝑟	(24)
Multi-Verse Optimisation (MVO) was developed by Mirjalili et al. [68]. It performs optimisation by mathematically mod- elling the concepts of white hole for exploration, black hole for exploitation of the search space and wormhole for local search.
Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) was proposed by Kennedy et al. [69]. PSO works imitating the behaviour of different organ- isms like bird flocking. It begins generating a swarm of particles distributed in the search space. At each iteration, the position and velocity of each particle are updated according to its previous position and the position of the best particle.

4.4. Classification measures





Table 1 presents a summary of the configuration for each considered algorithm. All the CGA versions use the same parameters configuration. Parameters utilised by state-of-the-art algorithms are established based on previous works oriented to adjust weights and biases of the MLP with metaheuristics [30,55,70,71].

Datasets

A set of classification quality measures evaluates the performance of every MLP trained by the considered algorithms. Each metric provides a different point of view about how well the classification was performed, taking as a basis the amounts of True Positives (TP) or positive in- stances classified as positive, False Positives (FP) or negative instances classified as positive, True Negatives (TN) or negative instances classi- fied as negative and False Negatives (FN) or positive instances classified as negative.
Accuracy: it is the proportion of instances well classified to the total amount of instances. This metric is calculated by Eq. (26).

Evaluations of the MLP optimised by metaheuristics were performed
using five different medical datasets obtained from the UCI machine learning repository.3 Each dataset is described in the following para-

Experiments are divided into two parts. The first part analyses the convergence ability of each metaheuristic to optimal points of the search space and their time consumption. The second part evaluates the quality of the classification of the MLP configured with the weights and biases yielded by the metaheuristics.

Fitness and time analysis

This section begins with an analysis of the numerical performance of metaheuristics. Then, a comparison of the time consumed in seconds to reach the stop criteria is presented. Tests are made by applying the algorithms to the five considered benchmarks datasets during the 30 independent runs.
Table 3 reports the mean fitness and the standard deviation reached by the evaluated algorithms. The first column contains the considered algorithms, and the results obtained are presented in columns two to six. Results show that the CGA configured with DX crossover and the
UM mutation (DX+UM) overcomes the other metaheuristics in three
out of the five datasets (Breast, Diabetes and Parkinsons). A possible
explanation for these results could be that the UM does not apply a significant disturbance over the genes, contributing to finding better near solutions and not diverting the seek. Furthermore, UM is not influenced by the number of evaluations done (already considered by
the DX), which helps when the algorithm is stuck. DX+UM also reached
the second-best solution for liver and vertebral datasets, falling behind
the MVO, which got the best average of fitness values in both instances. These results appear to be related to how the neural network learns, which can be affected when a small number of attributes is used for
so if those attributes are noisy. Beyond that, the DX+UM kept very near training, as in liver and vertebral datasets. Results could be even worse
the best results obtained by the MVO, meaning that it achieves minimal values of MSE.
In general, DX variations have shown similar behaviour, suggesting that the DX characteristics of taking into account the best current solution and making more minor changes as the population evolves can increase in a significant way the exploration and exploitation capability of the CGA.
Table 4 shows the results of the statistical analysis obtained by applying the Wilcoxon rank-sum test over the fitness value obtained by each algorithm. The table compares the DX variations of the CGA (located in columns) against the other metaheuristics (placed in rows). Each table cell contains a set of five symbols, representing the result

DX+NUM and DX+PM have shown a similar performance, overcom-
and SBX as crossover operators. The DX+RM performed a little worse ing the BAT, CS, DE, GA, GWO, MVO, and all the CGA versions using AX
than the other DX variations. These results confirm the capability of the CGA and, specifically, the DX operator to be a robust alternative in that featured results are obtained most of the time they are executed.
The convergence curves for DX+UM (which obtained the best fitness
results) compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm are presented from
evolutionary process advance. As can be seen, the DX+UM converges Figs. 5(a) to 5(e). Each plot shows how fitness is enhanced as the
to minimal values of the fitness function (MSE) rapidly, independent of the dataset to classify. Furthermore, it reached the minimal value of MSE in four datasets and was the second-best with the liver dataset (Fig. 5(c)). The second algorithm that better converges to optimal
points is the MVO which performed similarly to the DX+UM and was
the best with the liver dataset. The worst algorithm was the CS, which
appears to be stuck in local optima in all the datasets.
Finally, Table 5 shows the average and standard deviation of time consumed (in seconds) by each algorithm to reach the stop condition. The first column shows the considered metaheuristics, and the follow- ing columns inform the results of the time evaluations for each dataset. The best algorithm was the CGA with the DX crossover and the NUM
mutation in four datasets. The second-best was the DX+PM which stood
out in the same datasets as DX+NUM. However, all the DX variations
have spent similar execution times, showing that they can reach op-
timal points of the search space quicker than the other approaches. The CS performed better in the parkinsons dataset, but it is irrelevant because CS could not reach acceptable fitness values. The MVO, which had the best average fitness with liver and vertebral datasets, showed considerable high execution times (except with the Parkinson dataset), reflecting that the DX variations are better at balancing time consumed and performance.
Results presented in this section have demonstrated that the CGA variations can successfully tackle optimising weights and biases of the MLP, reaching fitness values comparable to or even better than other state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the results suggest that the characteristics of the DX crossover, of considering the best solution and the number of evaluations carried out, enable the CGA to achieve featured results in a short period of time, being even better than using a different crossover operator.

Table 6 shows the average of the accuracy values and the standard deviation obtained by the MLP configured with weights and biases generated by metaheuristics. Results were calculated using the test subset of every dataset.
Metaheuristics have overcome the mean accuracy of the Back Prop- agation algorithm (BP) in all the considered datasets. Focusing on the
DX variations, the DX+UM has stood out in two out of the five datasets
(Breast and Diabetes) and has had the second-best mean accuracy in two other datasets (Parkinson and Vertebral). The GWO has emerged as the best solution with Liver, Parkinsons and Vertebral datasets. Because the algorithms that achieved the best fitness value did not reach the best accuracy with these datasets, it is evident that there is no relationship between fitness value and accuracy. As can be seen, all the metaheuristics have obtained very similar results. In particular, CGA with DX crossover has proven to achieve competitive accuracy results with all the datasets.
Table 7 displays the mean of the Sn and the Sp for the DX variations and the algorithms of the state-of-the-art. The best results are marked with bold font, and the second-best is marked with italic font.

classifying positive and negative samples. Metaheuristics performed better at determining negative samples, suggesting they could learn patterns from a few samples (48 samples). But, the performance with positive samples was poor, which might have been related to noise in the data. In particular, BP appears to better tolerate noise in the Parkinson dataset.
Finally, with the vertebral dataset, the DX+RM showed the best
result on sensitivity and an acceptable specificity value, which suppose
a better classification. GA and GWO shared the best result of specificity. All the previous analyses indicate that CGA using the DX crossover offers better capabilities for exploring and exploiting solutions than the other approach, which enhances the classification ability of the MLP. It is necessary to remark that all the metaheuristics overcame the typical
BP, except in the Parkinsons dataset.

Conclusion

This work proposes a CGA approach to determine the optimal weights and biases of a MLP to classify medical data accurately. The idea was to take advantage of the properties of the CGA that im- prove exploration and exploitation of the search space. One of the main contributions of this paper was the Damped Crossover (DX), a specially designed crossover operator, which based on the damped harmonic oscillation function, determines the magnitude and direction of recombination between two parents, using external information as the knowledge of the best solution and the stage of the evolutionary



process. DX operator has demonstrated to improve the exploration and exploitation of the search space of CGA even more.
Experiments use five well-known benchmark medical datasets. Com- parisons are against state-of-the-art algorithms and CGA versions con- figured with well-known genetic operators. Two aspects were eval- uated, the convergence capability of the algorithms and the quality of classification achieved by the MLP optimised by the evaluated metaheuristics.
In general, DX variations have demonstrated that they can rapidly converge to optimal points of the search space. Regarding MSE values,
the CGA+DX was the best in three out of the five considered datasets
and the second-best in the remaining two. The DX operator combined

Considering the times consumed by each algorithm, the DX variations were the best in four out of five datasets, overwhelming even to the CGA with other crossover operators. It is reliable proof that the DX operator performs its task efficiently, making the CGA work quicker.

the-art algorithms. These results suggest that the optimisation process depends on the fitness function definition, because minimal values of MSE do not necessarily imply better accuracy values. Despite that, these results confirm that DX variations can have a featured performance in optimising weights and biases of the MLP, being able to improve the classification.
Besides, metrics of classification quality showed that solutions CGA variations with DX crossover get competitive results of specificity and sensitivity, deriving in a level of learning and generalisation com- parable to other approaches. Specifically, DX variations highlight in the Breast dataset by reaching the second-best result. With the other datasets, the performance was very similar to the state-of-the-art algo- rithms.
To conclude, results demonstrate that the CGA can be a robust and reliable tool for identifying the optimal weights and biases of the MLP for classifying medical data.
For future work, extending the CGA application to optimise the parameters and structure of neural networks is proposed. Furthermore, it is desirable to study alternatives to MSE function as fitness functions to obtain a better relationship between the fitness function of the metaheuristic and the accuracy reached by the MLP.
