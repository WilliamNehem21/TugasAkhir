Introduction

We are concerned in this paper with inventory-production control problem that can be represented as an optimal control problem with one state variable (inventory level) and one control variable (rate of manufacturing) subject to time of deterioration. In inventory-production models, two factors of the problem have been of growing interest to the researchers, one being the deterioration of items and the other being the variation in the demand rate with time. In the early stage of the study, most of the deterioration rates in the models are constant, such as Padmanabhana and Vratb (1995), Bhunia and Maiti (1999), Al-khedhairi and Tadj (2007) and Baten and Kamil (2009. We are especially interested in the application of optimal control theory to the production planning problem with Gumbel distribution deterioration items. The optimal control theory has been applied to different inventory-production control problems where researchers are involved to analyze the effect of deterioration and the variations in the demand rate with time in logistics. Various authors attacked their research in the application of optimal control theory to the production planning problem. Some

of them are: Hedjar et al. (2004, 2007), Bounkhel and Tadj (2005), and Awad El-Gohary et. al., (2009). In this context, Pontryagin maximum principle has been used to determine the optimal production cost control by (Bounkhel and Tadj, 2005; Tadj et al., 2006; Benhadid, Tadj and Bounkhel, 2008). But no attempt has been made to develop the inventory model as an optimal control problem and derive an explicit solution of an inventory model with generalized extreme value distribution (e.g. Gumbel) deterioration using Pontryagin maximum principle. The continuous review policy of optimal control approach is also to be novel in this framework. There seems to be no literature on the optimal control of continuous review manufacturing systems with generalized extreme value i.e. Gumbel distribution deterioration items rate.
In the present paper, we assume that the demand rate is time-dependence and the time of deterioration rate is assumed to follow a Gumbel distribution as well as a non-negative discount rate is considered for the inventory systems. The novelty here is that the time of deterioration is a random variable followed by Gumbel distribution and we consider the problem of controlling the production rate of a continuous review manufacturing system. This paper develops an optimal control models and utilizes Pontryagin maximum principle by Pontryagin et al. (1962) to derive the necessary optimality conditions for inventory systems. The paper also derives explicit optimal policies for the inventory models where items are deteriorating with Gumbel distribution that can be used in the decision making process. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Following this introduction, section 2 discusses Gumbel distribution with its applications and the associated deterioration rate function. In section 3 we explain the first inventory-production model with necessary assumptions. The similar developments are conducted for the second and third models. Section 4 develops optimal control problems. In section 5 we study the optimal control of the system and derive explicit solution of the models. In section 6 the illustrative examples of the results are given. Finally the last section concludes the paper.

where   R is the location parameter and  0,  is the scale parameter and  ,  is the
shape parameter. The shape parameter  governs the tail behavior of the distribution. The family defined by
  0 corresponds to the Gumbel distribution. The probability density function of Gumbel distribution corresponds to a minimum value

with initial condition x(T )  0 and the non-negativity constraint u(t)  0,	for all t 0,T  where the

fixed length of the planning horizon is T,

We want to keep the inventory x(t) as close as possible to its goal xˆ(t) , and also keep the production rate

Assumptions

We assume that the production deteriorates while in stock and the demand rate varies with time. The firm has set  an  inventory  goal  level  and  production  goal  rate.  Since  the  constraint u(t)  y t   0,  for all t 0,T  with the state equation x is non-decreasing. Therefore, shortages are
not allowed in this study. Finally assume that the instantaneous rate of deterioration of the on-hand inventory follows the three parameters generalized extreme value distribution and the production is continuous.

Development of the Optimal Control Model
In order to develop the optimal control model, define the variables z(t), z˜(t) and  (t) such that
z(t)  x(t)  xˆ(t),	(6)
z˜(t)  u(t)  uˆ(t),	(7)

and
(t)  uˆ(t)  y(t)   1 expt    /   xˆ(t).	(8)


Adding and subtracting the last term
1 expt    /   xˆ(t) from the right hand side of equation (8) to

the equation (4) and rearranging the terms we have
d  x(t)  xˆ(t)  [  1 expt    /  (x(t)  xˆ(t))  u(t)  y(t)   1 expt    /   xˆ(t)]dt
Hence by (6)


dz(t)  [  1 expt    /   z(t)  u(t)  y(t)   1 expt    /   xˆ(t)]dt.	(9)
Now substituting (7) and (8) in (9) yields



The optimal control model (1) becomes
dz(t)  [  1 expt    /   z(t)  z˜(t) (t)]dt.	(10)

By the virtue of (2) the instantaneous state of the inventory level differential equation

Multiplying both sides of (16) by exp expt    /   and then integrating over [0,T ], we have

Solution to the Optimal Control Problem

In order to solve the optimal control problem (1) subject to state equation (2) and (4), we derive the necessary optimality conditions using maximum principle of Pontryagin (1962), see also Sethi and Thompson (2000).

Solution of the Optimal Control Problem without Item Deterioration

The optimal control approach consists in determining the optimal control uˆ(t) that minimizes the optimal
control problem (1) subject to the state equation (2). By the maximum principle of Pontryagin (1962), there exists adjoint function  (t) such that the Hamiltonian functional form (3) satisfies the control equation
     H t, x(t), u(t), uˆ(t), (t)  0,	(19)
u(t) 

the adjoint equation
    H t, x(t), u(t), uˆ(t), (t)  d  (t),


 (T )  0	(20)


and the state equation
x(t)	dt

     H t, x(t), u(t), uˆ(t), (t)   d
x(t),
x(0)  0.	(21)


Then the control equation is equivalent to


The adjoint equation is equivalent to

and the state equation is similar to (2).

Solution of the Optimal Control Problem with Item Deterioration

The optimal control approach consists in determining the optimal control uˆ(t) that minimizes the optimal
control problem (1) subject to the state equation (4). By the maximum principle of Pontryagin (1962), there exists adjoint function  (t) such that the Hamiltonian functional form (5) satisfies the necessary conditions
(19), (20) and (21). Then here the control equation (19) is equivalent to (22) also. The adjoint equation (21) is equivalent to

Illustrative Examples

In this section, we present some numerical examples. Numerical examples are given for four different cases of

demand rates. (a) Demand rate is constant:
Demand rate is linear function of time:
Demand is sinusoidal function of time:
y(t)  y  20,
y(t)=y1 (t) t  y2 (t)  t 15,
y(t)  1  sin t .

Demand is exponential increasing function of time:
y(t)  expt .

We use the following parameters where the planning horizon has length T=12 months,
  0.001, the

inventory holding cost coefficient q  5 the production cost coefficient r  5. The goal inventory level is considered xˆ(t)  1  t  sin(t), and the location and scale parameters of the Gumbel distribution rate are
considered as   1 and   1 respectively. Then the deterioration rate of Gumbel distribution becomes

h(t)  expt 1,
t [0,T ]. The inventory level
x(t) in-terms of the first-order differential equation

from (4) and the second-order differential equation (34) considering the above demand functions are solved numerically using the version 6.5 of the mathematical package MATLAB.

Constant Demand Function

constant
y1 (t)  y1  20 instead of
y(t ) in the controlled system (4) we have

The constant demand rate is assumed to have fixed value 20 units per unit time. Note that here demand and
deterioration decrease the inventory level displayed in Figure 1. From the Figure 2, it is clear that the production rate is not following the constant demand rate but the production rate with constant demand increases over time.

Linear Demand Function

In this subsection, we present the model with linear demand function. Substituting linear  y2 (t)= t 15

instead of
y(t ) in the controlled system (4) we have

dx2 (t)  u

(t)  y (t)   1 expt    /   x (t),	0  t  T ,

uˆ2 (t)  y2
(t)   1 expt    /   xˆ
(t) 

In case of linear demand, it is the form
y2 (t)= t  15
and the inventory level in-terms of first-order

differential equation decreases over time shown in Figure 3. The result is shown in Figure 4 and it is found that the production rate is not following the linear demand rate. The production rate starts with zero amount and increases over time.

In Figures 5 to 8 do not show the variations of the inventory and optimal production level with time with changing the shape of the demand functions. In case of sinusoidal and exponential decreasing demand oriented optimal inventory levels over time almost have no variations that support the findings of Baten and Kamil (2009). It is observed that the optimal production rates are not very sensitive to changes in the demand functions in case of Gumbel distribution.



Exponential Increasing Demand Function

In this subsection, we present the model with sinusoidal demand function. Substituting

y6 (t)  expt 

instead of
y(t) in the controlled system (4) we have
dx6 (t)  u (t)  y (t)   1 expt    /   x (t),	0  t  T ,

The solution of the second-order differential equation is represented by Figure-9 and shows the state of optimal inventory level is increasing. However, in the subsections we present the model to measure the performance using different demand patterns. The production level with time t given uˆ(t) from the equation
(18) considering the mentioned above different demand rates and we take the inventory goal level is as
xˆ(t)  10 keeping all other parameters unchanged.

7 Conclusions

We developed an optimal control model in inventory-production system with generalized Gumbel distribution deteriorating items. This paper derived the explicit solution of the optimal control models of an inventory- production system under a continuous review-policy using Pontryagin maximum principle. However, we gave numerical illustrative examples for this optimal control of a production-inventory system with Gumbel distribution deteriorating items. However, particular emphasis can be made also with extreme value (e.g. Gumbel) distribution for assessing landslides hazards, earthquake hazards. Near-surface groundwater levels can be treated the same extreme-value distribution context as river floods, wind gusts, earthquakes, and other naturally occurring temporal phenomena.
