IntroductionThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has been imposing profound changesin our daily life. Most of the affected countries adopted different coun-termeasures in order to reduce the contagious rate. Among them, aneffective action is the so-called social distancing. The idea is simple asdisruptive at the same time: citizens are invited to maintain at a certainphysical distance from others. This recommendation applies when weinteract with people out of our personal spaces, namely a restrictedcommunity of contacts.Social distancing has become a new requirement in the way we accessand provide services. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, policy-makers have to re-think the way we visit a supermarket, we catch a bus,or we interact with colleagues at work. We consider two possible ways ofguaranteeing such a requirement: manually or automatically. Themanual approach is commonly adopted in our cities, such as in a shop-ping mall. In this case, an operator observes the scene acting to limit andprevent close contacts among people; for example by managing thewaiting queue, verbally distancing customers, or by optimizing the dis-placements of goods so that to reduce involuntary contacts. Althoughsuch approach is relatively easy to implement, we argue that a comple-mentary solution needs to be adopted on the long period; we refer to it asautomatic social distancing. In this work, we explore the possibility ofautomatically guarantying the social distance indoor with the adoption ofa privacy-preserving Indoor Localization System (ILS). We focus on thoseservices that are generally available indoor, such as a museum, airportfacilities, or a supermarket. In these representative use cases, users roamthrough a sequence of points of interest such as galleries of a museum,check-in desks, or aisles of a supermarket. Our approach consists ofestimating the current location of people with the ILS and to compute thepersonal distance among the subjects involved. Knowledge on the exis-tence of crowds can be exploited by suggesting to the customers analternative path able to minimize gatherings with others. In the lastdecade, ILSs have been widely adopted [ 1] in different scenarios; they are based on very different technologies, ranging from Wi-Fi ﬁnger- printing [2] to solutions based on ultra-wide band radio waves [ 3]. We argue that the accuracy obtained from the most advanced systems is nowsufﬁcient for the purpose of the social distancing [ 4]. As a meaningful example, we refer to class of ultra-wide band systems able to constrainthe localization error in the range of centimetres while tracking moving', '* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses:paolo.barsocchi@isti.cnr.it(P.

Weﬁrst propose a privacy-preserving ILS architecture able toguarantee real-time user’s location and privacy of the data collected. Thesolution we propose in this work considers the General Data ProtectionRegulation (GDPR) as the grounding framework for preserving privacythrough a compliant Access Control (AC) system [ 6–8]. The AC system ensures that only the intended users can access the protected (personal)data and get the permission levels required to accomplish their tasks.However, notwithstanding the important role of AC systems, their inte-gration inside the localization system architecture is still an emergingchallenge speciﬁcally considering the enforcement of the GDPR ’s re- quirements. Our solution relies on a privacy-by-design indoor positioningarchitecture, where purposes of data management are explicitly de ﬁned, consents collected and the rights related to privacy and data protectioncorrectly enforced. We then discuss three use cases in which the archi-tecture proposed can be adopted, namely visits to a museum, airportaccess, and shopping in a supermarket. For each of the use-cases, wepresent the requirements for guaranteeing social distancing indoor. Wealso introduce some barriers currently preventing a massive adoption ofILS-based tracing systems and we conclude our paper with an evaluationframework aimed at assessing the performance.The innovation we propose with our work mainly consists of fouraspects:/C15we frame a reference architecture for social distancing based on anIndoor Localization System generalizing three common use-cases;/C15we introduce a privacy-preserving access control system grounded onthe European GDPR framework;/C15we summarize three typical use cases in which the proposed archi-tecture can be adopted, by highlighting the intrinsic challenges of thesocial distancing;/C15ﬁnally, we discuss 4 main barriers to overcome for an effectiveadoption of such technologies in real-world settings.As recently reported by M. Zissman (MIT Lincoln Laboratory) in arecent article from J. Hsu [9],“[…] In a perfect world, something likethis would have taken a couple years to implement. There just isn ’t the time […]”. We agree with such vision, and we consider that a great efforthas to be spend for the integration of different technologies enabling theproximity detection of people both indoor and outdoor. Such effort willdetermine the success inﬁghting against the next pandemic.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2covers the background and related work in theﬁeld of Indoor Localization Technologies andGDPR-based Access Control. Section 3describes our reference architec- ture for an ILS. Section4reports three reference use cases, namelyvisiting a museum, airport terminal access and shopping assistance.Section5, we discuss some issues that we consider challenging for a real-world installation of an ILS and,ﬁnally, Section6describes our evalua- tion framework.2. Background and related workIn the following, we focus on three main aspects that equally con-tributes to the proposed architecture: the related indoor localizationtechnologies their speciﬁc characteristics 2.1; the Indoor Localization', 'Apps 2.2 and the Access Control Systems 2.3. We discuss in particular themobile application proposal able to deal with social distancing, exploringtheir main strengths and weaknesses in terms of authorization to accessto the mobile resources requested to the user and their impact on user ’s privacy.2.1. Indoor localization technologiesSeveral localization technologies have emerged in the last years toaddress the demanding of location-based services. We review two cate-gories: Radio Frequency-Based (RF) and non-RF based. Among the RFtechnologies there exist systems based on the analysis of Wi-Fi [ 10],Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) [11,12], LTE [13], and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) [14,15] signals. Wi-Fi-based solutions have the advantage ofexploiting the ubiquity of Wi-Fi Access Points. The most performingWi-Fi solutions obtain high performance in terms of localization accuracywith reduced cost of maintenance and installation [ 16]. In the last few years, the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard hasbeen adopted a cheap a viable technology for indoor navigation andlocalization. BLE tags are cheap and easy to deploy, moreover theirbattery life time spans from few months to years.1Indoor localization systems based on BLE often implements a range-based technique, ac-cording to which the moving target is localized in proximity of the BLEtags with the highest Received Signal Strength of the beacons emitted([17] explores this technique for the purpose of tracing social interac-tion). However, more advanced solutions based on the beacon ’s angle or arrival and time ofﬂight are also available with a very high accuracylevel, as done with Quuppa', '2and the recent Bluetooth 5.1 stack.Finally, the UWB network interface represents a recent and promisingsolution. Its accuracy can reach the centimeter-level with speci ﬁc de- ployments. Its adoption has been increasing as Apple decided to provi-sion the iPhone 11 with the U1 chip-set. As a result, we expect that in thenear future other vendors will include such technology with Android-based smartphones. Some remarkable examples of UWB-based indoorsolution are the Pozyx [18] and some recent works [19–21]. Non-RF based technologies for indoor localization rely on visual/camera [ 22], Visible Light Communication (VLC) [ 23], Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) [24], and Magnetic Field Sensor (MEMS) [ 25]. The visual based systems exploits images captured by surveillance camera alreadydeployed. The performance range in the centimetre scale but, in wide andpublic environments, the privacy regulations might limit their adoptionon the large scale. Differently, if the user/target is equipped with acamera sensor, a visual-based system can reach accuracy performancearound a meter of error. Furthermore, the end-user is required to keep thecamera in aﬁxed position with the side-effect of inﬂuencing the its natural way of moving.The Visible Light Communication is an emerging optical technologyfor high-speed data transfer which uses visible light modulated andemitted by Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Indoor positioning systemsbased on VLC use light sensors (e.g. camera sensor) to measure the po-sition and direction of the LED emitters but they generally require line ofsight between emitters and receivers [ 23]. Systems based on Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) exploitthe distortion of the Earth’s magneticﬁeld mainly due to structural steel elements (e.g. steelﬁre doors) and furniture. As an example, these dis-tortions can be a discriminating factor in environments comprised bycorridors, rooms and small areas. The performances of these systemsgenerally drops in wide and open space because the distortion areconsidered less meaningful [26].IMU based systems utilize tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes forsensing the motion. The combination of gyroscope and accelerometer isused to evaluate the heading direction [ 27]. Unfortunately, accelerom- eters are error prone due to random movements of human motion and,the gyroscope is susceptible of magnetic ﬁelds distortion. As a conse- quence, IMU-based systems generally reach low accuracy and requires acomplex calibration process to detect, for example, user ’step length and the motion speed [28]. Weﬁnally report onTable 1a comparison of RF and non-RF based techniques, with a summary of their weaknesses andstrengths.Weﬁnally survey some architectures for indoor positioning. Sucharchitectures provide features for a quick integration, such as an SDK orAPIs for third-party developers. Authors of [ 29] introduced a middleware architecture for fusing multiple sources of information, showing how a', '1BLE Tags can be conﬁgured in safe-mode with low power of emission andlow advertisement rate.', '2https://quuppa.com/.P. Barsocchi et al. Array 9 (2021) 100051', '2data fusion approach leads to improved performances in the same indoorenvironment. In [30], authors describe an extensible framework forexploring location data’s multifaceted representations and exposing aquery layer. Lastly, Anyplace [31] shows a similar idea to the other ar-chitectures above mentioned by releasing an open-source architecture inorder to easily deploy indoor localization functionalities in newenvironments.2.2. Indoor Localization AppsThe most diffused technical solutions for guaranteeing social distanceare based on mobile applications. Apps enable an easy-to-use userinterface and, at the same time, a massive diffusion through the well-known app stores. Currently, there exist several applications whosefeatures span from tracing contacts, e.g., Immuni [ 32] (the application build by Italian Health Minister), to the possibility of managing a waitingqueue, e.g., uﬁrst [33].Depending on their features, the apps require access to several entitiesand purposes. From a privacy-preserving point of view, unfortunately,not all the apps expose neither a clear claim about the usage of thecollected personal information nor a clear description concerning theusage of such data. Consequently, we argue that the end-user mightremain sceptic in daily using such apps. In order to provide a ﬁrst outlook about the existing apps for social distancing or for detecting in socialinteractions [17], we report inTable 2a selection of apps available on the Android Play Store and tested on a commercial smartphones. The tablereports the analysis of some features and the authorizations required. Inparticular, the group of columns labelled Location, Others, Disk, Camera,report the name of the permissions ’classiﬁcation provided by the Android Play Store for grouping the different features. Finally, for eachgroup, we report some details concerning the permissions of each appbased on the description provided by the developers. In particular, wereport the following information:1. Approx location: if the app can localize the device within a widearea;2. Precise location GPS&net: if the app can accurately localize thedevice;3. Receive data from Internet: if the app can receive data formInternet;4. View network conn.: if the app can check the networks to whichthe device has access;5. Full network access: if the app can access to any of the networksthe device is connected with;6. Run at startup: if the app can automatic restart;7. Prevent device sleeping: if the app can prevent the device fromswitching in sleeping mode;8. Pair BT devices: if the app can pair with a Bluetooth device;9. Access BT settings: if the app can initiate the device discovery ormodify the Bluetooth settings;10. Control vibration: if the app can control the device vibration;11. CRUD contents: if the app can perform CRUD operations;12. Take pictures or videos: if the app can take photos of recordvideos.Taking a glimpse as a generic user to the installation and usage of theapps analysed in theTable 2, the consent forms are very generic andsometimes do not intuitively declare the purposes of data collection, theduration of the data retention or the possibility of future exploitation ofthe data collected.For example, one application (the 2M Social distance checker) re-quests permission to access to the Call Log and Address Book withoutspecifying how the data will be used, i.e., to enable the sharing of userexperience with his/her contacts. From a technical point of view, in caseof open-source applications [34] speciﬁc information about the real usage of sensors data or the procedures for managing them can beretrieved by accurate analysis of the source code. However, this opera-tion is not feasible by common users without a computer science back-ground and it is not allowed for proprietary application [ 35,36]. Additionally, rarely there is a clear claim on where and how thecollected data will physically be stored or distributed. Indeed, dependingon the country where the DB is, the rules for accessing its information', 'could be compliant to a privacy standard different from that required bythe application country. The situation could be even worse in case whenthe application is used by users belonging to different countries havingnot the same privacy rules. Consequently, there could be the risk of apersonal data management not completely compliant with the consensussigned by the app users. For instance in Italian Immuni [ 32] (The application built by Italian Health Minister) developers clearly claimsthat the DB will be physically positioned in Italy and managed by theItalian Health Minister under the GDPR compliance.Social distance can also be implemented with ad-hoc hardwarecomponents like people counter and smart bracelets [ 37,38]. These so- lutions have the beneﬁt of guaranteeing reliability, since they do notdependent on the user’s device. The features offered are limited totracing the contacts with others or alerting when a user gets too close toanother. More advanced features can also be implemented with dataanalysis techniques but, at the current stage, we were not able to ﬁnd remarkable examples in the current literature.2.3. GDPR and Access Control SystemsWe now review some techniques adopted with Indoor LocalizationSystems that are commonly adopted to manage the privacy of the datacollected. Weﬁrst review the GDPR reference framework and then wesurvey some recent works. The GDPR [ 39]d eﬁnes Personal Data as any information relating to an identiﬁed or identiﬁable natural person called Data Subject. As a result, a data subject is a Natural Person (a livinghuman being), whose data are managed by a Controller. The GDPR isapplied to the processing of personal data, whether it is automated (evenpartially) or not. The GDPR deﬁnes, among others, the following prin-ciples and demands: Purposes, i.e., data should only be collected fordetermined, explicit and legitimate purposes, and should not be pro-cessed later for other purposes; Accuracy, i.e., the processed data must beaccurate and up-to-date regularly; Retention, i.e., data must be deletedafter a limited period; Subject explicit consent, i.e., data may be collectedTable 1A comparison between indoor localization technologies.', 'Technology Strengths Weaknesses Accuracy ScalabilityCamera High accuracy,low maintenanceRequires dedicatedhardware, difﬁcultuser identiﬁcation0.5–1 m MediumVLC Potentially highaccuracy, easy toinstallRequires line ofsight, requiresadditional hardware0.5–1 m HighIMU No infrastructurerequiredRequires highcustomization, errorprone to driftproblems1–5 m N.A.', 'MEMS Ubiquity of thesignal, noinfrastructurerequiredError prone tointerference, costlycalibration process2–5 m N.A.', 'Wi-Fi Easy toimplement, costefﬁcientMedium accuracy,generally requiremodiﬁcations to theAPs2–4 m High', 'BLE Low energyconsumption, lowcostError prone tonoise, mediumaccuracy in wideenviron- ment2–4 m High', 'UWB High accuracy insmallenvironmentRequires dedicatedhardware, highcosts0.5–1 m LowP.

As emerged by this survey, recent proposals show howlocation and topology-aware are becoming feature for the security [ 42]. However, most of the research has been focused either on:/C15using technology Wi-Fi and theﬁngerprinting methods combinedwith cryptography solutions [43–45]; /C15using access control mechanisms for (physical) protection withinvirtual perimeters [46];/C15using location information to automatically authenticate customer[47];/C15speciﬁc security attributes that do not fully cover the GDPR ’s re- quirements [48–50].3. Overview of the integrated architectureIn the following, we detail the reference architecture based on anIndoor Localization System (ILS) for guaranteeing social distancing. Thearchitecture relies on two layers: the smart device and the localizationinfrastructure. As detailed inFig. 1these layers include components suchas: a User Agent for managing the interactions on behalf of the end-user,the Indoor localization system including GDPR-based Access Controlsubsystem and the Map server. The reference architecture extends thesolution presented in [4], and it integrates the GDPR-based access controldescribed in [51,52].3.1. Aim and scopeThe approach we followed with this work is to ﬁrstly framing a reference architecture to be adopted in very different scenarios. To thispurpose, our effort has been mainly focused on generalizing a commonarchitectural design of a remote ILS, based on 3 main building blocks: amap server, the ILS engine, and a discovery agent to broadcast its exis-tence. We then focus on the client side in the form of a smart device, asthe primary interface to interact with the end-users. The architecture wepropose has been deliberately designed without constraining to any ofthe common scenarios we daily experience. Differently, we tried toprovide the community with a modular architecture to be customized.Furthermore, the current literature concerning the ILS does not identify astandard de-facto for indoor localization, rather multiple and heteroge-neous solutions are available. To the best of our knowledge, this workintroduces a privacy-by-design solution, mainly inspired by the EuropeanGDPR framework, as one of the most advanced regulations about privacyin force since the last decade.3.2. Architecture requirementsIndoor localization systems are based on very different technologies.A standardization process of these systems is therefore the ﬁrst objective that should be pursued in order to increase the spread and the usability oflocation-based services. We argue that standardized programming in-terfaces for the design of an ILS have a twofold bene ﬁt:/C15to provide inter-operable location-based services to the end-users:/C15to integrate in a seamless way outdoor and indoor localizationsystems.Concerning theﬁrst beneﬁt, its adoption can be used not only tolocate and track people, but also to measure their physical distance. Itsadoption can be considered an effective counter-measure to track, pre-vent and analyse how close people are in indoor environments. We referto Section4for a in-depth description of three use-cases in which we', 'describe the adoption of an ILS in real-world scenarios. Moreover, thestandardization will increase the possibility for a user-agent to discoverand to bind to any of the ILS available indoor. Such aspect is crucial for anopen market, since it breaks the silos of custom and vertical solutionsavailable so far.Concerning the second beneﬁt, we consider that the current userexperience for outdoor localization systems (e.g. GPS) must be preservedalso indoor. Under this context, the standardization could improve thedesign of systems enabling the hand-off between outdoor and indoorareas. We imagine a smooth transition from an outdoor map (e.g. pro-vided by OpenStreepMap or Google Maps) to detailed indoor mapsprovided by an ILS.Asﬁrst step towards such standardization process is the de ﬁnition of architectural requirements to be considered. In the following, we report alist of 4 requirements that we consider mandatory:1. To discover the available Indoor Localization System dynamically(R1)A discovery process should be deﬁned to enable a person to look up for services available in a speciﬁc environment [53]. The process can be triggered through the Web or based on short-range network in-frastructures. We refer to theﬁrst approach as global search, since theuser queries the Web looking for an ILS available e.g. in a supermarket. Inthis case, the user fetches the meta-information of an ILS via the HTTP orsimilar protocols. Differently, the second approach is referred to as localsearch since the user looks up for nearby ILSs, by exploiting networkinterfaces such as Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth or LTE- Direct and the up-coming 5G. Such interfaces allow to look up for surrounding services inthe range of few meters.2. Indoor localization systems must self-describe their features to ensureinteroperability with heterogeneous systems ( R2).We expect the deﬁnition of a common language for describing thefeatures provided by an ILS. More speciﬁcally, ILS has to advertise some core information, such as: the localization technology adopted, the pri-vacy requirements, the location of the indoor map and any other resourcerequired for a device to discover, connect and access to the ILS. Thebeneﬁt of such language is the possibility of replicating the user-experience for outdoor navigation (e.g. through Google Maps orsimilar) also indoor.3. Privacy must be guaranteed and the service policies must be welldeﬁned and veriﬁable(R3).One of the most critical aspects for the location-based services is thepossible loss of control of the personal data collected. As a meaningfulexample, we recall the contact tracing apps also exploiting the devicelocalization and designed for the purpose of mitigating the COVID-19pandemic. In these cases, end-users are worried about non-expectusage of the data collected for commercial purposes. Some example ofdata that we consider critical are: the timestamp of the contacts, the IDsof the contacts, any information about the device used and, in some cases,the GPS location of the users.Localization systems suffer intrinsically from this problem, thereforeindependently from the contingency period, explicit mechanisms foraccepting policies, together with the ability to verify and manage thedata collected, must be designed and implemented in accordance withthe various national laws.4. Indoor localization systems must be easy to use, intuitive and inter-active (R4).The interaction between the ILS and the end-user needs to speci ﬁcally tackled. We argue that their success also depends on the way a user in-teracts with it. Most of the people already interacts ﬂuently with GPS navigation systems (e.g. Google Maps, Garmin or TomTom charts). Inparticular, users search, discover and navigate toward a speci ﬁc locationP. Barsocchi et al. Array 9 (2021) 100051', '5that can always be represented as a pair of coordinates in the space (e.g.lat, long as WGS84 coordinates). The same user-experience should bereplicated also for indoor environment, even if a higher number ofchallenges are present. To this purpose, we consider mandatory to designintuitive work-ﬂows. As for example, the end-user should be able notonly to search for a location, but also to navigate toward person, to pickup a list of products in a speciﬁc order or to meet a moving target indoor.A further level of interaction is also represented by the possibility ofasking to an ILS context information describing the environment, such asthe existence of a crowd or the waiting time before accessing a service.Such level of interactivity can be obtained by designing multi-modalinterfaces, such as the Instant Messaging (IM) paradigm. Indeed, theIM paradigm implements the best metaphor for managing the exchangeof information between the end-users and a system in a intuitive way.The user can chat with the ILS in order to get the position of its target, toreceive suggestions, to be notiﬁed proactively and or to be guided step-by-step toward itsﬁnal destination.3.3. Architectural componentsThe requirements R1 to R4 are grounding for our architectural design.We describe in this section, several functional components to bedeployed in two distinct layers: those present on the user device andthose made available by the indoor infrastructure. This distinction easilyrecalls the two methods through which the position of a user is estimated:self-positioning processed by the smartphone and remote positioningprocessed at the local infrastructure. We also consider the possibility ofhaving hybrid solutions. We report in Fig. 1an overview of the compo- nents described. For the sake of brevity, we do not consider here thepossibility of other solutions that could make use of the Cloud. Forexample, internal maps could be downloaded from any server on theCloud (e.g. Google Maps), as well as a route to a target calculated by anavigation service available on the cloud. We mainly focus on abstractfunctionalities common to all the architectures and how they are to bedescribed. Therefore, many concrete architectures can be derived bycombining the abstract components we report in Section 4.4. We report inFig. 2an overview of the main components.In theﬁrst group of components, the most important is the User- Agent. It can be described as an intelligent software component thatoperates on behalf of the end-user. The main functions it provides are:global and local discovery (R1), to manage the privacy for the end-users(R3), to interact with the local infrastructure to estimate position of theend-user (R2), to interact with the end-user (R4). Other functional components that could be installed on the device are the Navigatorand a Translator, theﬁrst of course to manage navigation, determination ofthe shortest routes etc, the second is increasingly adopted to facilitatevocal interaction, as done with commercial vocal assistants (AmazonAlexa, Apple Siri, Google Home) (R4).The second group of components concern the infrastructure. Inparticular, theIndoor Location Systemand theMap Server(R2,R3). Theﬁrst consists of hardware and software artifacts deployed in theenvironment that are functional to the estimation of the user ’s position and the data protection, as detailed in Section 3.4. The second oneprovides the indoor maps and features of the indoor environment usefulfor navigating. Other components we foresee are the Discovery Server which provides the description of the resources available by the infra-', 'structure (R1,R2) and theSystem Agentwhich is the counter-part with which the User Agent can communicate. In particular, the System Agentcan be seen as a regular chat user to which send requests for assistance orinformation (R4), it can be implemented by an Instant Messaging bot.Components deployed in the infrastructure are interfaced by respectiveservices orchestrated by the User-Agent. A person trough the User-Agentinterface can interact with the System-Agent of the indoor infrastructure.3.4. Indoor localization system and data protectionWe now detail the internal structure of a generic ILS. We consider itprovides three main sub-components, as detailed in Fig. 2: theILS En- gine, theGDPR-Based Access Control System (G-ACS) and the Communication and Interaction Orchestrator . Such components implement the main features of an ILS. Moreover, we expect that theyrely two distinct database for collecting the information.The ILS Engine implements the core functionality of the localizationalgorithm: it returns back to the User Agent the timestamped coordinatesaccording to the map reference system (e.g. latitude and longitude asWGS84 reference system) [10,54].Data provided by an ILS can be simultaneously accessed by multipleactors. More speciﬁcally, the end-user, the system administrator or ageneric supervisor might require access to speci ﬁc data. In order to manage the different grants for the actor, we consider that the ILS and theGDRP Access Control System (G-ACS) components have to cooperate (seeFig. 2). In particular, the latter is in charge of evaluating each single dataaccess request and to allow or deny the access according to several fac-tors. They are: the consents collected, the data validity period, the spe-ciﬁc users/service rights and the access control policies established insidethe overall Localization Infrastructure.Finally the Communication and Interaction Orchestrator is thecomponent in charge of man-aging the communication to and from theILS. This component is exploiting publish-subscribe design patternthrough extensible events. It is in charge to instantiate communicationchannels and manageﬂows of notiﬁcations and events data. Those eventscan be structured adopting several asynchronous messaging technologieslike Java Messaging Service (JMS), Advanced Message Queueing Proto-col (AMQP), Message Queueing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) in order todecoupling not only the locations of the publishers and subscribers, butalso decouple them temporally.3.5. Components in actionThe interaction among the components described in reported inFig. 3. The indoor infrastructure periodically advertises its presencebroadcasting an URI. The URI points to the meta-information of the ILS.When the end-user enables the indoor positioning on its device, the UserAgent starts listening for such announces (Listen for URI activity). TheDiscovery phase ends when the User-agent accesses the URI in order toobtain the description of all the resources that are part of the infra-structure. The structure of the information obtained during the discoveryphase represents a key-point. We report a schematic example of suchinformation inFig. 4. The information reported can be representedfollowing different formats, such as JSON or XML text-based format.The Access stage can now start. During this stage, the end-user grantsor denies some consents required by the ILS to work properly (Consentevaluation). This process can also in-volve a more ﬁne-grained assess- ment of the consents (specialized consent acceptance activity), depend-ing on the kind of services to be used. If consents are accepted, thesubscription data as well as the collected consents are used by the G-ACSSystem for example:', 'Fig. 2.ILS and Data protection components.P. Barsocchi et al. Array 9 (2021) 100051', '6/C15setting up the user speciﬁc GDPR-access control polices in order toguarantee that all the information collected and exchanged betweenthe services are managed according the GDPR ’s demands (GDPR policies set-up activity);/C15preparing the required database infrastructure and security proced-ures so as to guarantee for instance: the isolation of the data from thepoint of view of storage; the data anonymization; the data deletionaccording in agreement with the consensus collected (Enabling pro-cedures and repositories activity).On the other side, even the User Agent needs to save the policyaccepted by the person and identiﬁcation code that will be used to communicate with the infrastructure resources. Once the access phasehas beenﬁnalized, the Service consumption cycle starts, that is theLocalization phase. At this point. the user interaction and (privacy) dataﬂow is realized taking in account the GDPR provisions such as: assuredata treatment in line with purposes and scopes speci ﬁed in the collected consents (as per Art. 5.1(a) of the GDPR), assure only authorized datatransfer to third parties in accordance with the general principledemanded in Art. 44, and the enforcement of the Right to erasure ( ‘right to be forgotten’)d eﬁned in Art. 17, (Gathered Data Management phase)Right-to-be-Forgotten, (Gathered Data Management phase), in line withArt. 17. The process ends in case of consent revocation (in this case weare considering the right to withdraw as stated in Art. 7.3) or when theuser requires to terminate a speciﬁc service.4. Designing indoor social distancingWe now discuss how to guarantee social distancing of users in threerepresentative use-cases, namely visiting a museum, accessing an airportand shopping assistant. We describe for each of them the overall user-experience, the requirements to be guaranteed and some enabling tech-nologies that can be used for adopting an indoor localization system.As a general observation, information about the physical distanceamong people can be exploited in three different stages: before, duringand after the end-user visits a location. More speci ﬁcally, knowing how people dispose indoor during the such stages, can increase the user-experience and improve the effectiveness of countermeasures to thediffusion of diseases (see Section2). We report inFig. 5an example of how the information concerning the social distance can be used duringwhile visiting a generic indoor environment. More speci ﬁcally:/C15beforevisiting an environment, the end-user can plan her/hist visit sothat to avoid crowded time slots. Planning the visit allows to mini-mize the probability of involuntary contacts and it can reduce queueto access to speciﬁc services;/C15duringa visit, the end-user can optimize the way she/he moves in-door, so that to reduce the contact probability with others. As arepresentative example, we refer to the possibility of planning theorder of products to pick while shopping. The path selection can beachieved by prioritizing those areas of a shopping mall scarcelyvisited by customers;/C15information about the social distance can also be used afterthe visit. More speciﬁcally, knowledge about how many people visited a spe-ciﬁc location, can be used to plan an efﬁcient cleaning schedule, to better dispose products and, more generally, to allow the serviceprovider to re-think the way services is accessed. Data collected afterthe visits can be used for statistical purpose as well, in order tomeasure if the actions taken prevent the existence of crowds.4.1. Use case 1: visiting a museumVisiting a museum is a challenging scenario in which to guarantee aproper social distance among the visitors. A museum is generally orga-nized with a visiting path designed to guide visitors through the art-works. Users can decide to follow the path and to move across the roomsin a speciﬁc order. Small museums do not recommend any speci ﬁc path', 'Fig. 3.Activity diagram for the system components.', 'Fig. 4.Information describing an ILS through a Discovery Process.P. Barsocchi et al. Array 9 (2021) 100051', '7to follow, while others have multiple paths. Users following a path do nothave any time restriction during their visits, they are free to move acrossthe rooms and to rest. Moreover, the number of visits in a museumchanges dramatically according to several factors, such as the day of theweek, the hour, the scheduled holidays as well as the whether conditions.The combination of such factors determines the existence of burst ofvisits, as discussed in Ref. [55] that are challenging to predict.The requirements that need to be preserved during a visit are:/C15users have to be able to respect easily the distance from other visitors;/C15the total number of visitors has to be managed;/C15design multiple visiting paths so that to reduce the encounter prob-ability among visitors;/C15the user-experience needs to be guaranteed during a visit;/C15users can wear a wristband or install a speci ﬁc app before their visit;We consider that the adoption of an indoor localization system in amuseum can support the adoption of effective countermeasures forlimiting crowded areas. More speciﬁcally, the knowledge of the positionof the visitors can be used for 1) observing the way visitors access themuseum and 2) to manage in real-time the ﬂow of visits. Concerning the ﬁrst goal, we argue that it is highly important to measure quantitativelythe way visitors access a museum. More speci ﬁcally, it is possible to measure the total amount of visits, the visits during a speci ﬁc time in- terval, the visiting time for each room and artwork, the existence ofpreferential paths during a visit and other metrics useful to describe thesocial attitude of the users. Such information, can be in turn used to meetthe second goal, namely to plan the visits according to the requirementspreviously reported.Users can be localized by adopting proximity-based technologies suchas Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or the UltraWide frequencies. Suchtechnologies are becoming more and more popular. In particular, BLE isalready available in most of the commercial smart devices, while theUltraWide technology is expect to diffuse in the near future. It is worth tonotice that the iPhone 11 already provides the U1 chip-set. Bluetooth andUltraWide band allow to detect proximity not only between users but alsobetween users and points of interests such as artworks or furniture.Moreover, such technologies can be easily integrated with personal de-vices such as smartphones or an audio guides without the need of acomplex network infrastructure. Some remarkable works alreadyaddressed the problem of localizing people in a museum, we refer to Refs.[56–58] for further details.4.2. Use case 2: airport accessThe layout of an airport is generally a combination of indoor/outdoormulti-ﬂoor environments with restricted areas. Except for shops, gener-ally the airports offer multi-storey buildings within wide and open spacesin which users freely roam. An airport terminal provides several servicesfor the end-users. Some of them are mandatory to all the passengers,others are optional and provided only for the entertainment purpose. Thenumber of users accessing to such services changes dramatically ac-cording to the seasons and according to external factors, such as weatherconditions, strikes and delays of theﬂights.The requirements that need to be preserved for travellers in order toguarantee appropriate social distance are:/C15the airport facilities have to be accessed with a pre-determined order.More speciﬁcally, users have to check-in, to pass through the securityclearances and,ﬁnally, to step toward the destination gate. The orderand the time to complete the previous steps should be orchestrated sothat to consider: the amount of users, the existence of crowds and anysituation leading to involuntary contacts;/C15users have to be able to respect easily the distance from other users;/C15the user-experience must be preserved as much as possible;Also for this use-case, we consider bene ﬁcial the adoption of a modular indoor localization system tracking the distance among users. Inparticular, the indoor localization system can be used for detecting theexistence of crowds in a speciﬁc location e.g. check-in desks and toprevent other passengers to stack in queue. Furthermore, such localiza-', 'tion system can be also exploited for security tasks, such as identi ﬁcation and tracking of target subjects. The majority of the terminals are alreadyequipped with Wi-Fi networks available also for traveller. Some worksalready address the problem of localizing users in an airport. Authors of[59] proposes a multi-modal solutions based on Wi-Fi and BLE tags.Through the availability of a precise map of the environment and anaccurate survey of the environment. The end-user can bene ﬁt of services based on positioning information on their own commercial smartphone.In [60] authors propose an interesting approach, based on BLE technol-ogy in an airport scenario, using a combination of Received SignalStrength Indication (RSSI) and Time-of-ﬂight.4.3. Use case 3: shopping assistantA shopping mall is generally organized with product-speci ﬁc aisles. Customers are free to decide the order of the products to pick. Malls alsohave some locations for speciﬁc fresh products, such as bakery or fresh-ﬁsh. In these locations, the self-service is generally not allowed, andcustomers interact with an operator. Some small/mid-size malls guidecustomers through a suggested walking path, while in large-scale malls,customers can freely move within the areas.Similarly, to the other use-cases, the number of users can changesalong the time. The burst of visits can be roughly predicted since theworking schedule forces many people to shop during the evening orweek-ends. In this context, the requirements for respecting the social', 'Fig. 5.How information about social distance can be used before, during and after visiting a generic indoor environment.P. Barsocchi et al. Array 9 (2021) 100051', '8distance between customers are:/C15speciﬁc products need to be booked in advance so that to reduce thenumber customers waiting in the same location;/C15users should be able to easily respect the distance from other users;/C15the user-experience must be preserved as much as possible.A shopping mall equipped with an indoor localization system canprovide several services for customers. We foresee the possibility ofoptimizing the path to follow in order to completing the shopping list.Moreover, the supermarket can provide a queue management servicethat notiﬁes the customers when to approach to a speci ﬁc desk. Finally, a supermarket can provide services for personalized advertising to the end-users. In fact, indoor positioning systems shall make available a set ofpersonal data which can be exploit to promote sales products or to pro-mote temporary offers.In the last decade, supermarkets have been equipped with internetaccess, throughout Wi-Fi Access Points deployed in the environment.These APs can be exploited also to provide an indoor localization ser-vices. The more promising technique in this environment is the ﬁnger- printing technique, where the RSSI previously collected together with theposition of the user is leveraged to infer the current user position [ 61]. In fact, the accuracy of this technique ranges in the order of few meters and,exploiting also inertial sensors of the smartphone, ILSs are generally ableto localize users accurately. A distributed ILS can provide meaningfulinformation before, during and after shopping. For example, beforeshopping, users can use the aggregated information about the number ofcurrent buyers to plan the purchases or not. During shopping, the user isreassured about the use of the ILS which can provide a “safe route”as described before. After shopping, information related to all the routesfollowed by customers can be used to thoroughly sanitize the most fre-quented spaces.4.4. A reference architecture for different use casesAlthough our goal is not to deﬁne a reference implementation of thearchitecture described in Section3, we consider that some of the com-ponents inFig. 2can be implemented with existing software artifactsavailable in the current literature. We report in this section somemeaningful examples both for the Indoor Infrastructure and for the SmartDevice.Concerning the Indoor Infrastructure, the Map Server is responsiblefor managing the indoor map. In particular, it provides the base maps or atile set covering a speciﬁc area. The Map Server couples with the clientside, in charge or downloading (possibly, with parallel connections) andrendering the map on a e.g. 5-inch screen. Both modules are available inliterature and can be re-used as third-party black boxes. As for example,the open source map-view solutions, open layers and lea ﬂet are available. According to the speciﬁc needs, it is also possible to adopt different MapServer such as mapbox, Google Maps and AcrGis.', '3', 'Concerning the ILS engine the literature also offers some interestingand open source solutions that can be deployed as off-the-shelf products,among them we refer to Anyplace as a complete framework for indoorlocalization comprising API, Viewer, Navigator and Logger components.', '4', 'Weﬁnally mention some existing discovery protocols that can beembedded with the Indoor Infrastructure to discover the server in aseamless way. In particular, the SLP, UPnP, ZeroConf and WS-Discoveryare old-but-robust valuables candidates for discovering networked re-sources [62]. Moreover, if the goal is to implement a local discovery thenthe Bluetooth beaconing and the Wi-Fi probing also represent twointeresting protocols that can be used to broadcast small chunk ofinformation.Finally, in relation to the Smart Device we found several client in-terfaces that can be customized. Among them, we consider that Telegramapp5is a valuable alternative since it offers the possibility of customizingthe popular chat-based application by reusing most of features available.Such choice allows to include speciﬁc features enabling the localization, the discovery and the map rendering in a chat box. We ﬁnally remark that guidelines for choosing the proper technical solution are out of the scopefor this paper but, it is worth to remark that these design decisionsstrongly depend on the considered use cases.5. Towards social distancing through ILSWe now discuss some issues related to the concrete possibility ofadopting an indoor localization system for the purpose of measuring thedistance among users. This section covers different aspects of its adop-tion. In particular, insubsection 5.1we discuss the impact on the privacyand trust reputation of the ILS.Subsection 5.2focuses on the discovery phase of ILS.Subsection 5.3presents two alternatives for the socialdistancing, namely a manual and automatic approach and, lastly, sub- section 5.4concludes with a description of some challenges of thedeployment phase of an ILS in real-world settings.5.1. Privacy and trust reputationOurﬁrst consideration faces with the problem of how to guaranteeprivacy of data collected by an ILS. We refer to [ 63] for complete survey also covering the following issues.Privacy by design encompasses seven principles that should be fol-lowed [64]: proactive privacy protection instead of remedial action afterprivacy violations have happened; privacy as the default setting; privacyembedded into the design; full functionality with full privacy protection;privacy protection through the entire life-cycle of the data; visibility andtransparency; and respect for user privacy. Solutions for incorporatingthese principles in the design of an ILS are necessary. In parallel, dataminimization approaches should be considered as a best practice forprivacy by design adoption.Furthermore, we argue that information sharing, active defence andautomation methods should be integrated with an ILS. Thus, we considermandatory to develop efﬁcient methods to create, disseminate, andconsume threat intelligence in a standardized and admissible way. It isalso necessary to adopt defence mechanisms able to increasing the cyberadversary’s cost by decreasing their overall efﬁciency of the active cyber operation. In parallel, in order to make the solutions effective, automa-tion should be considered and solutions integrated into business work-ﬂow, governance, and structure control.We also consider an orthogonal aspect of the privacy, namely the trustreputation of the ILS. Since the architecture described in Fig. 1involves a variety of components, it is required to implement different protectionspolicies and to ensure that there are no privacy leaks at any of the stageswe modelled inFig. 3. Additionally, the architecture should be deploy-able across different systems and environments maintaining the requiredlevel of trust. Another aspect linked with the management of the trust ofthe system, is how to guarantee trust for third-party components that anILS can integrate. As for example: multiples Map servers and differentimplementations of ILSs can coexist with the design presented in Section3. To this purpose, we foresee some possible solutions: to provideinteroperability recommendations and speci ﬁcations; to deﬁne speciﬁc governance; to provide on-line veriﬁcation and validation tools in order to identify the security risks. In parallel, data should be encrypted both atrest and in transit.', '3http://openlayers.org,https://leaﬂetjs.com/.', '4www.indoorlocation.io/.5http://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram .P. Barsocchi et al. Array 9 (2021) 100051', '95.2. Discovering an ILS with local and global interfacesThe capability of discovering an ILS automatically is a central aspect.We consider two possible approaches for the discovery phase: local andglobal. The local discovery is based on the analysis of local signals whenentering a new environment. In this case, the user exploits short-rangenetwork interfaces looking up for nearby signals. However, weconsider that a global search is required as well. In this last case, astandard search through a web-browser allows to query and to connectwith the ILS. We recall the well-known user experience though whichusers look for services on a search engine. The search engine summarizesto the user a box with key information about the service, such as thestreet address, the opening hours, the popularity of the service (e.g.Google Popular Times). We expect to extend such list, by also reportingthe information of the Indoor Localization System, e.g. showing an URLwith the meta-information reported in Fig. 4. Mobility in multiple indoor environments increases privacy issues.Continuing on the example of the outdoor navigation services offered byGoogle, we know that the people who activate the history of their posi-tions are tracked by Google, which, through the user account, allows youto view your movements and possibly eliminate them entirely. In the caseof indoor navigation, this information will be collected by multiplesubjects who must make it accessible to the owners of the data both forconsultation and for modiﬁcation. The task of the User Agent in this casebecomes essential, because it must be capable of maintaining a history ofthe indoor sites visited. In particular, it must keep track of the policiesand consents signed by the user, as well as links to the various interfacesto access the consultation and modiﬁcation services of personal data. Nevertheless, much of this information must be conveyed during theDiscovery process (Figure JSONﬁle) Privacy management in general ismore complex than the use case presented here, de-pending on whetherthe localization techniques used are Self-positioning or Remote posi-tioning based. Systems that intrinsically guarantee privacy should befavoured, in which the position is estimated by the user agent (self-positioning) and is not known by other subjects, such systems are alsomore scalable. However, with respect to social distancing, you must inany case give up your rights and reveal your position even if used onlyanonymously, therefore deﬁning an access control based on GDPR isalways an indispensable step.5.3. A dichotomy of manual and automatic social distancingAnother crucial aspect is the safety distance among people (usuallyﬁxed in the range of 1–2 m) which is normally perceivable on sight.People in favour of using automatic tools to support social distancing arealready well prepared to keep the right distance from others. We observetwo conﬂicting requirements:ﬁrstly, service providers e.g. a shoppingcentre, aim to increase the number of customers while, secondly, cus-tomers are interested to access a service scarcely populated. Therefore, aservice obeying to the current prescriptions will grant the access to themaximum number of admitted customers. Such situation is generallyperceived by theﬁnal users as potentially unhealthy, even if customersstay 1–2 m away from others. Such consideration is predominantly ofpsychological nature. However, we argue that also the adoption of appsfor preserving the social distance do not resolve the dichotomy betweennumber of customers and distance among them. In fact, the false posi-tive/negative alerts of such app, combined with the privacy issues pre-viously mentioned, discourage their use in the daily basis.Under this respect, the technology adopted by the apps is determinantfor their successful adoption on the large scale. More speci ﬁcally, range- based applications (i.e. based on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth signal strength) oftenfail in crowded scenarios or in those environments characterized bybarriers and obstacles. Differently, the adoption of indoor localizationsystem based on the data-fusion techniques are more reliable in suchcircumstances. Data-fusion allows to gather and to combine heteroge-neous sensing and context information. Although more complexity withrespect to a range-based approach, fusing data together allows to over-come issues such as body attenuation, indoor re ﬂections and multi-path fading. The side-effect of an Indoor Localization System is the mostlyrepresented by its installation costs.The current trend is to adopt solutions for preserving the social dis-tance that are based on apps for smartphones. We consider that suchapproach might fail on the large-scale and on the long-term. We considernecessary to understand those practicable alternatives and how togradually move from the use of apps to the use of infrastructures, such asan Indoor Localization System.If we consider that people are well predisposed for social distancingthrough the use of sight, aﬁrst discriminating factor is the type of', 'environment. In open spaces, such as a supermarket, people will havegreater ease of self-determination if a situation is risky or not. Differently,in indoor and constrained environments people need to be supportedwith automatic tools.The transition from manual to automatic systems for social distancingrequires bridging technologies able to reduce the deployment costs. As aremarkable example, we mention those systems designed to count thenumber of people in each room. Once a certain density has been reached,the system warns incoming people, in order to limit the access to suchplaces. In any case, even if a precise localization system is not used,common interfaces must be studied through which to communicate to allend-users. Other aspect to consider is that the turnout of people could beestimated from the reservations that are made to visit a certain envi-ronment. This practice is currently used by the most visited museums,where you can buy tickets online and avoid long queues to buy tickets. Inother environments such as airports, by integrating the various infor-mation systems of the airline companies, the number of people at acertain time can be determined on the basis of the scheduling of ﬂights departing and arriving. Obviously, this is an alternative to preparing newinfrastructures for localization, but it is an estimate that can be affectedby various random factors, lost reservations, ﬂight delays, random congestion. But even in this case, an interface to people who access theenvironment/system is necessary to allow it to check the crowding statusand possibly receive notiﬁcations.5.4. Deploying an ILS in real-world environmentsWe now discuss some deployment issues of an ILS that at realisticconditions.Deploying an ILS requires to accomplish at least the following twosteps: survey of the environment and hardware installation and systemcalibration. Such steps are required for all the use-cases we detailed inSection4. Theﬁrst step requires to visit the environment where the ILS issupposed to be deployed, with the goal of considering features of po-tential impact to the performance of the system. Some examples are: thebuilding-material of the environment, the dimension of the area to becovered and the existence of outdoor/indoor areas. The building materialof the environment has a great impact to the propagation of radio signals.As for example, concrete-based walls heavily attenuate 802.11 signalsmodulating at 2.4 GHz, with respect to wooden or drywall. Moreover, theshape of the environment is another feature that in ﬂuences the signal propagation. Wireless signals, generally, propagate more easily in openspaces due to the limited presence of obstacles. Finally, the existence ofoutdoor areas to be covered also inﬂuences the overall performance.The previous step leads to the installation of the hardware required byan ILS. This step, usually, requires toﬁnd places where to deploy anchor nodes enabling the localization of the users, such as Wi-Fi Access Points,Bluetooth tags or UltraWide band boards. The hardware to be deployedoften requires a power supply source in the nearby, the absence of sur-rounding obstacles and a safety distance from the end-users. The com-bination of such requirements makes the deployment a challenging taskin places not designed for such purpose.The last step copes with the conﬁguration of the ILS. With the term conﬁguration, we refer to all the settings depending on environmentalP. Barsocchi et al.

Barsocchi et al. Array 9 (2021) 100051', '11settings. As a meaningful example, we refer to the ﬁngerprint-based techniques (seesubsection 2.1). In this case, the localization system re-quires a database mapping the quality of the radio signals (e.g. ReceivedSignal Strength Indicator) with a number of locations. Such database isgenerally built only after the hardware installation and it can be obtainedwith a data collection campaign often achieved manually by an expert.Another representative example of conﬁguration is represented by all the algorithm settings of the ILS it-self. Such settings, very often, modelfeatures of the environment and they can be tuned only after theinstallation of the system in the target environment. Nevertheless, theconﬁguration of a ILS is not one-shot task. Rather, real-world localizationsystems conﬁgured and re-conﬁgured multiple times during their life-cycle. Some factors that require a new round of con ﬁguration are: envi- ronmental changes such as new obstacles or a new layout of the envi-ronment, new areas to be covered or modi ﬁcations due to hardware replacement.6. Measuring the performance of the integrated architectureWeﬁnally focus on the assessment of the performance of the inte-grated architecture as a crucial part of applicability of the solution wepropose in this work. Our goal is to frame a reference architecture basedon localization techniques for the purpose of measuring quantitativelythe distance among people roaming in an indoor environment. In thispicture, both the user experience and the hardware/software compo-nents can be measured to understand the effectiveness and its realapplicability in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, we consider a set ofmeasurable KPIs addressed to the 4 main players: the End-Users, theSmart Device, the Indoor Infrastructure and the Service Providers. Wedetail the motivation behind the such choices, how to measure the KPIs,the unit of measurement and any critical issue arising from the KPI.Table 3summarizes the KPIs we propose.7. ConclusionsComputing the inter-personal distance among people in real-timerepresents a challenging task. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemicimposes such requirement to the way people interacts and to the waypeople access services in indoor environments. Countries affected bysuch pandemic reacted to the emergency in different ways by adoptingcounter-measures that, in some circumstances, might be not effectiveafter the lock-down phase. In particular, we focus on exploitable tech-nologies for guaranteeing social distance among people that are generallyemployed in theﬁeld of indoor localization. In this work, we describe theadoption of an Indoor Localization System (ILS) with a twofold goal. Onone hand, the ILS can be adopted to localize people and, on the otherhand, for measuring the in-between physical distance. We ﬁrst present some functional requirements for an ILS and a reference architecture.Then, we present three signiﬁcant use-cases where an ILS can be adoptedfor measuring distance among users. We discuss how informationdescribing the distance among people can be used during three stages:before, during and after accessing a service. We also discuss some issuesand new possible new lines of investigation concerning the design of anILS for the purpose of the social distance. In particular, our attentionmoves towards the design of discovery protocol able to identify availableILSs indoor and to the adoption of privacy mechanisms for the treatmentof sensitive information collected about end-users. The letter point is, inour opinion, one of the most important barrier to the adoption anddiffusion location-based services. We argue that a more transparentapproach for the data treatment would bene ﬁt the adoption of such location-based services offered by ILSs.Credit author statementPaolo Barsocchi: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Su-pervision, Visualization, Writing–review&editing.

Financial risk early-warning mainly analyses and forecasts the possibility of the financial assets loss and the damage of the financial system in the financial operation process.  ', 'AASRI', 'Procedia', 'www.elsevier.com/locate/procediaAvailable online at www.sciencedirect.com', 'Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.', 'Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.429  KeNa Zhu et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  428 – 434 ', 'But what the financial risk really terrible is that it not only influences the current, it will also produce the subsequent effect in the after-operation. And the current domestic and foreign research seldom considers that these factors will have a lagging effect in financial risk. So, based on the research about the factors which have the hy steresis effect in financial risk both at home and abroad, this paper restudies the issue, ensure the hyst eresis factors which have significant influence in financial risk. This paper aims to put forward a kind of early-warning model considering the hysteresis factors, raise the connection between the financial risk and hysteresis factors, make the model researched from the analysis of hysteresis factors, and improve the accuracy of forecasting the financial risk. 2. Regional financial risk factors 2.1 Regional financial risk factors analysis. Regional financial risk that not only influenced by the external factors, but also be restricted by specific economic environments and market structure in this area. Imbal ance development in regional economy and finance will make the financial risk having a strong regional characteristic. Otherwise, the resistance ability to local risk of regional finance is weaker; the local financial tu rmoil could trigger regional financial crisis and even national financial crisis. However, financial risk factors operate with an obvious lag. Regional financial crisis would produce a lagging effect of impact and influence to the whol e financial system and the substantial economy.  So the article chooses the factors which produce a lagging effect to the regional financial to have index analysis, and based on this to construct a regional financial risk early-warning model integrating lagging factors’ return.  2.2 Regional financial risk factors’ index design. Regional financial crisis exists diffusivity, the regional financial crisis would cause wholesale financial crisis, even the global financial crisis. This financial crisis caused by America’s subprime crisis evolves from part to entire word, transmits from the developed c ountries to the emerging market countries and developing countries, and spreads from the financial territory to the substantial economy territory.  Economic growth has enormous influence to the fi nancial crisis, and we often use economic monetized degree to measure a country’s economic development level. According to our country’s commonly used method at present, namely using the method M2 (generalized currency)/GDP to show the economic monetized index. We c ould calculation the result as following:  ', 'Table 1.  Chinese economic monetized index ', '430   KeNa Zhu et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  428 – 434 ', 'Source: established according to phases of “China Statistical Yearbook” and “1999 China Statistics Bulletin”. From the calculated results, we see that along w ith the rapid development of the economy, Chinese economic monetized growth situation was very significant, in other words, currency relations as a form of economic relations has got a fair degree of deepening and generalization in our country. M2 not only reflect the reality purchasing power, but also reflect th e underlying purchasing power. We commonly use DM2 (generalized currency growth rate) to measure M2. Another important content of economic growth is foreign trade. Foreign trade is the core of various countries’ foreign economic relations, which plays an irreplaceable role in the economic development of all countries. Import and export trade’s balance of payments of a country is the important part of current account in its international payments; it is also the significant factor which could affect countries’ balance of payments. Foreign trade multiplier theory of Keynesian economics suggests that exports produce double aggrandized effect to national income and output, and the imports produce double shrank effect to its national income. The scale of the trade balance would eventually affect th e economic development in China, and then influence the financial risk indirectly. In addition to factors related to the economic growth , banking, estate and other factors might also have a lagging effect in financial risk. The expansion of th e commercial banks’ credit would accumulate bigger risk, the impact of small financial crisis would make the centralized outbreak of the borrowers’ credit risk, it also could make the problems about the increasing uncertai nty risk of estate market’s development completely exposed. Meanwhile, the international oil price, the economic growth and the deposit interest margin that trading close with China will also have a certain effect in financial risk condition. 3. Regional financial risk early-warning model 3.1 Financial risk early-warning model analysis.  Due to the factors that influence the financial risk have obvious lagging, we could first build up a general regression model with a lag dependent variable. Considering about diffusivity of regional financial risk, so this paper we choose our comprehensive index of financial systemic risk, namely Financial Stress Index of China(CFSI in short),to be the explained variable in the financial risk early-warning model. The first to propose the concept of financial stress and const ruct financial stress index is the economists Illing and Liu in Canadian Bank. According to the description of Illing and Liu (2003):”Financial stress is a continuous variable, its extremum is called financial crisis”. The financial stress will increase with the increase of expect financial loss, risk or uncertainty. According to the lagging-influence factors of  financial risk and referring to the literatures, the explanatory variables are eventually determined: CF SI lagging variables (AR (K)), GDP (GDP), GDP growth (DGDP), economic monetized degree (MRATE), broad money growth rate (DM2), balance of trade (TRADEBASA), the bank credit balance in our country(SODCSA), Chinese estate price index(HOUSEPINDEX), international crude oil pr ices rate(OIL), Japanese GDP growth rate(JPDGDP), the one-year deposit spreads between China and the United States(DR). 3.2 The established of the financial risk early-warning model.  According to the explanatory variables, the explained variables and the correlation between the indexes, 431  KeNa Zhu et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  428 – 434 ', 'we optimize the regression model:  ', 'In formula (1), CFSIt-k represent CFSI lagging K issue, Xt-ki represent other explanatory lagging K issue. Through the stepwise regression analysis, using T- test, R2-test, DW test, AIC information judgment and others, choosing the best combination of variables and the optimal forecasting equation. The statistics test indexes in the equation are the best. In 5 percent of the significant level, all explanatory variables have passed the T-test; the goodness-of-fit of the equation is higher, R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are 0.970219 and 0.949745, parameter sequence is smooth. According to th e results of the table below, we can get the following best prediction equation of the financial stress index: CFSI', 't=38.65159+0.421267AR˄4˅+0.43508DGDP t-4+0.39413HOUSEPINDEX t-4-4.745299OIL t-4 ', '-0.001607GDP t-4-198.7936MR t-4-0.717549DR t-4+0.357039DM2 t-4+0.004065SODCSA t-4 ', '+0.066912TRADEBASA t-6-0.332322JPDGDP t-8ggggggggggggg˄\\x16˅\\x03', 'Table 2 The regression results of best prediction model in Chinese financial stress ', '4. Experimental analysis.  ', 'Using the Eviews software, we can check out the actual  value, prediction and residual of our financial stress exponent, and compare the relation between actual value and prediction of our financial stress exponent from 2004 to 2010, the table is below: 432   KeNa Zhu et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  428 – 434 ', 'Figure 1 The actual value and predictive value of our financial pressure exponent ', 'Figure 1 shows the relation between the actual valu e and predicitive value in our financial stress exponent from 2004 to 2010, seeing from the figure, the two values are highly anastomotic. Visibly,the accuracy of the prediction equation is quite satisfactory. Through the search of literature, we can obtain the data of the explanatory variables in 2011, the following Table 3 ', 'Attention: the data of 2011 is the first half year, the growth is also the year-on-year increase ', 'Now we use the equation (3), taking the data above inside, and then forecast our financial stress in 2011. The result is available: ', 'Table 4: The Predicted value of CFSI in 2011 ', 'The result shows that in 2011, the financial stress exponents are all higher than the highest since 2002, namely the financial stress is greater than the four seasons in 2008. In the first three quarters in 2011, our financial stress exponents will keep growing, the third  quarter will achieve the maximum 20.96625, and the financial stress will have the trend of decline since the last quarter of 2011. Table 4 shows that we use the equation (2) and get the four quarters’ predictive value of our financial stress exponents in 2011. Figure 2 reveal the trend of annual financial stress exponents’ prediction in our country. 433  KeNa Zhu et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  428 – 434 ', 'Figure 2: The trend of our financial stress exponents’ prediction ', 'The regression result shows that the GDP growth, real estate price index, broad money growth, the credit balance, the balance of international trade will have positive influence in financial stress exponents, and the price of crude oil rate of change, SUMGDP, the ratio of broad money and GDP, the one-year deposit spreads between China and the United States and Japanese GDP growth will have negative influence. Due to the collinearity existed between the explanatory variables; the consistent of the explanatory variables may not correspond to the actual situation. But, the collinearity will not affect the explanatory variables as a general CFSI to the predictive result. 5. Conclusion On the basis of the research of Illing and Liu (2003), this paper ensure the measure index of financial risk by the financial stress exponents constructing by synchronization index of financial risk, confirm the explanatory variables the financial stress exponent itself and the ec onomic and financial index having prescience, and then with the aid of empirical methods to construct the financial stress index early-warning model. The model shows that the explanatory variables lagging four quarters (there are two variables were lagging six quarters and eight quarters) can better fitting our financial pressure exponent trend. That is, according to the known current financial stress exponent and other value of explanatory variables, we can use the model to predict the financial stress exponents of the future four quarters. Financial stress exponent CFSI can accurately measure our financial systemic risk; the corresponding explanatory variables can also be obtained timely and accurately. Indeed, the best prediction equations of the financial systemic risk or the financial systemic risk early- warning system is simp le and easy to the financial systemic risk prediction, and has great practical value.

The evolution (andrevolution) in information and communications technologies (ICT), that recentlyfueled remarkable economic and social changes, will only pick up the pace as weapply managerial interventions and controls for better ICT acceptance andassimilation.', 'The Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) inSaudi Arabia has launched a longitudinal study which asserts that Internet pene-tration is relatively high among educational institutions, as 75% of them are beingconnected to the internet[16]. However, a striking ﬁnding of the study, declaresthat only 39% of university/college students are able to access the Internet by2007 and that e-learning is also not very popular among the educationalinstitutions in Saudi Arabia.', 'Technology-assisted learning via ICT (or e-learning) has become progressivelymore vital for academia and corporate training. Furthermore, e-learning haspotentially become one of the most signiﬁcant developments in ICTs [46]. Motivated by such compelling advantages as: geographical reach, learner control(in terms of ﬂexibility and convenience), and cost effectiveness in course deliveryand management, educational institutions and professional organizations areembracing e-learning by implementing an expanding array of technology-enabled platforms[27].', 'Recently, Saudi Arabia has called for a national plan to adopt IT spanning thecountry. The plan strongly recommends the implementation of e-learning anddistance learning, and their prospective applications, in higher education. In amajor transformation of conventional education, the Saudi Ministry of HigherEducation has recently launched the National Centre of E-learning & DistanceLearning, set up a repository to organize the change, and prepare e-learning mate-rials to help universities adopt the system and transform to a scheme of e-learningquickly[39].', 'Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) by Venkatesh and Bala [44]provides valuable rational explanations into how and why individuals make a decisionabout the adoption and use of ITs, particularly the work on the determinants ofperceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

This study draws heavily onthe seminal work of Venkatesh and Bala[44]and Baker et al.[9]due to their interrelated nature dealing with IT acceptance and adoption testing as a commonthematic issue. More speciﬁcally, Venkatesh and Bala [44]provide TAM3 as a theoretical base model while Baker et al.[9]provide the quasi replication andtesting approach of a theoretical model in a different culture.', 'This study sets out an empirical research for investigating e-learning acceptanceand assimilation in Saudi Arabia as having a unique culture that is different fromthe Western culture where TAM originated. The fundamental contribution of thisstudy is to exploit TAM3 to predict technology acceptance of e-learning in SaudiArabia as a developing country, in addition to inquiring for some related post-implementation interventions that might contribute to the acceptance and assim-ilation of e-learning systems in developing countries. The speciﬁc objectives of thisstudy are: (i) to develop a customized Technology Acceptance Model using TAM3for the determinants of the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning; (ii) toemploy survey research to test the customized e-learning model per se; and (iii)to outline outcomes of the study, such as, the antecedents of e-learning technologyacceptance and managerial interventions and control for better organizationale-learning management.

Related work', 'Mirza and Al-Abdulkareem[30]reviewed the current situation of e-learning in theMiddle East (ME). They presented drivers and barriers to e-learning, the differenttypes of e-learning initiatives, steps being taken toward overcoming the challenges,and a possible future of e-learning through a case study of ongoing developmentsof e-learning in Saudi Arabia. Educational organizations in the ME are varying intheir engagement in e-learning as some are pioneering while the majority are pro-gressing visa-vis those that are still laggards.', 'To provide more insight into how to promote e-learning acceptance amongstudents in Saudi Arabia, Al-Harbi[7]investigated the factors that inﬂuencee-learning by analyzing the perceptions and attitudes of Saudi university studentsusing a survey conducted to investigate the acceptance of e-learning as perceivedby students. Al-Harbi used a combined factor model of the original TAM and theTheory of Planned Behavior (TPB)[3]to explain signiﬁcant perceptional andattitudinal factors related to the acceptance of e-learning. The ﬁndingsdemonstrated that attitudes toward e-learning, subjective norms, perceivedbehavioral control as well as e-learning system attributes were criticaldeterminants of students’ behavioral intention to use e-learning.Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 29Advanced technologies facilitating a new environment of higher educatione-learning have been investigated in Saudi Arabia such as the adoption of smartphones and tablets which is known as mobile learning or m-learning [13,32,37]. These studies report prevailing of these technologies to some extent indicating thatthe acceptance and adoption level of m-learning is on rise as the majority of stu-dents express positive attitudes toward m-learning due to the ﬂexibility of learningmethods and timings, and improved communication among learners. However,Chanchary and Islam[13]pointed out that there are many more challenges stillto overcome like giving proper training to students (a type of intervention asper TAM3) so they can have a sense of security in the new environment in anattempt to take full advantage of e-learning.', 'Jordan is a good example of developing countries in the ME, exemplifying anIT hub for the region, ﬁrst introduced e-learning in the Arab Open Universityin 2002[1]. Abbad et al.[1]and Al-Adwan et al.[4]explored students’ acceptanceof e-learning in Jordanian universities using the original TAM. Their ﬁndings,respectively, indicated that students’ beliefs about usefulness and ease of usepartially mediate the relationships between external factors (subjective norms,internet experience, system characteristics, self-efﬁcacy, and technical support)and intention to use and actual use of e-learning systems; and that intention touse e-learning systems is only predicted by perceived usefulness as students’attitude did not signiﬁcantly affect intention to use e-learning, while perceived easeof use was found to signiﬁcantly predict both usefulness and attitude towarde-learning.', 'Lately, Singh and Hardaker[38]conducted a broad search of the literature (formore than 300 articles) regarding barriers and enablers to the adoption and diffu-sion of e-learning that were analyzed as three main categories: (1) macro-levelstudies investigating the higher education context of e-learning, (2) micro-levelstudies probing on individual and social factors, and (3) studies probing onmanagement issues of the adoption and diffusion of technological innovations.Fortunately, our study seeks an empirical investigation of e-learning acceptanceand assimilation using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) as a frame-work covering the second and third categories suggested by Singh and Hardakerbeforehand.', '1.2. Theories of technology acceptance – Technology Acceptance Model 3', 'The original TAM[19,20]proposed that two belief constructs, perceived useful-ness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), are primary determinants of anindividual’s behavioral intention (BI) to use an IT. BI was theorized as the pri-mary predictor of actual usage behavior. There were successive developments ofTAM: TAM2, UTAUT, and ﬁnally TAM3. Fortunately, the original TAM,TAM2 and UTAUT were tested in the Arabian context and showed to hold verywell[5,9,6], respectively).30 S.S. Al-GahtaniIn this study, following Baker et al.[9], TAM3 is tested in the context of SaudiArabia, a technologically-developing Arab nation. Since the TechnologyAcceptance Model is built on the foundation of an individual’s beliefs, it isrational to expect that the application of any given Technology Acceptance Modelin the two different cultural contexts could produce different results [9]. It is hoped that the ﬁndings of this study shall help to improve our understanding about theantecedents of e-learning technology acceptance and assimilation in Saudi Arabia,thereby providing us an opportunity to reﬁne the model to suit this country’sunique cultural context and offering a path to investigate technology adoptioncharacteristics in other developing countries[5,9]. This paper was part of a scien-tiﬁc project which evolved over more than 3 years since 2010. The agenda for thisproject was summarized and published in the second international conference ofe-learning and distance education by the ministry of higher education in SaudiArabia[22].', '1.3. Technology Acceptance Model 3 – TAM3', 'The most recent and comprehensive developments of TAM are manifested inTAM3. Venkatesh and Bala[44]synthesized prior research on TAM and devel-oped a theoretical framework that represents the cumulative body of knowledgefrom TAM research that accumulated over the years, that results in four differenttypes of determinants of PU and PEOU – individual differences, system characteristics, social inﬂuence, and facilitating conditions . According to Venkatesh and Bala[44], ‘‘individual difference variables include personality and/or demo-graphics (e.g., traits or states of individuals, gender, and age) that can inﬂuenceindividuals’ perceptions of PU and PEOU’’, while, ‘‘system characteristics arethose salient features of a system that can help individuals develop favorable (orunfavorable) perceptions regarding the usefulness or ease of use of a system’’,whereas, ‘‘social inﬂuence captures various social processes and mechanisms thatguide individuals to formulate perceptions of various aspects of an IT’’, ﬁnally,‘‘facilitating conditions represent organizational support that facilitates the useof an IT’’ (p. 276). In summary, Venkatesh and Bala[44]combined TAM2[42] and the model of the determinants of PEOU[41], and developed an integratedmodel of technology acceptance which they called: TAM3. TAM3 presents a com-prehensive nomological network of the determinants of individuals’ IT adoptionand use, as shown inFig. 1.', 'In the context of IT adoption and use, social inﬂuence processes (i.e., compli-ance, identiﬁcation, and internalization) represent how important referents believeabout the instrumental beneﬁts of using a system[42]. Prior individual informa-tion and perceptions – about how easy a system is to use from important referents– are unlikely to be stable as individuals need to form these stable perceptionsbased on their own general computer beliefs and hands-on experience with the sys-tem[21]. In TAM3, three constructs – subjective norms (SN), image (IMG), andEmpirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 31voluntariness (VOL) – capture the social inﬂuence processes on perceived useful-ness[44].', 'However, according to Venkatesh and Bala[44], the inﬂuence of cognitiveinstrumental processes on perceived usefulness is captured by four constructs:Subjective NormExperience Voluntariness', 'Image', 'Job Relevance', 'Output Quality', 'Result', 'DemonstrabilityPerceivedUsefulness', 'R2=0.450IntentionTo Use Usage', 'Behavior', 'Technology Acceptance ModelAnchor', 'Computer Anxiety', 'Computer Playfulness', 'Objective UsabilityAdjustmentComputer Self-Efficacy', 'Perceptions of External Control', 'Perceived Enjoyment0.35***0.44***', '0.13**0.14** -.1**-.05* ', '0.08*', '0.1**', '-.03 -.11**', '0.0070.02', '0.08*', '0.2**0.45***PerceivedEase of Use0.18**0.15**0.38***0.15**', '0.020.37***', '0.25**0.21** R2=0.420R2=0.424R2=0.130', 'Figure 1Research model – A modiﬁed Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM3)a– and structural model.', 'aDotted variables (Usage behavior and objective usability) are omitted.

TAM3 theorizes that job relevance and result demonstra-bility directly affect perceived usefulness while output quality operates as amoderator of the relationship of job relevance with perceived usefulness. Table 1 presents the constructs deﬁnitions of social inﬂuence processes followed by thecognitive instrumental processes.', 'Four anchors were suggested by TAM3: ‘‘computer self-efﬁcacy, computeranxiety, computer playfulness,andperceptions of external control(orfacilitating conditions). The ﬁrst three of these anchors represent individual differences (are)general beliefs associated with computers and computer use. Computer self-efﬁcacy refers to individuals’controlbeliefs regarding his or her personal abilityto use a system. Perceptions of external control are related to individuals’ control beliefs regarding the availability of organizational resources and support structureto facilitate the use of a system. Computer playfulness represents the intrinsic motivationassociated with using any new system’’[44, p. 278]. Notably, Venkatesh and Bala[44]also suggested that ‘‘while anchors drive initial judgments of per-ceived ease of use, individuals will adjust these judgments after they gain directhands-on experience with the new system’’ (p. 278).', 'Perceived enjoyment and objective usabilitywere – two system characteristic-related adjustments – suggested by Venkatesh and Bala [44]to be included in TAM3 as determinants of perceived ease of use with enduring effects even afterindividuals gain experience with the new system.

Moreover, TAM3 theorized thatwith more hands-on experience with the system, the effects of adjustments –perceived enjoyment and objective usability– on perceived ease of use wereescalating. The constructs deﬁnitions of anchors and adjustments are shown inTable 2.', 'TAM received special attention from prominent scholars in the IS ﬁeld. TheJournal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS) devoted a special crit-ical issue (volume 8, issue 4, April 2007) about TAM ‘‘Quo Vadis TAM – Issuesand Reﬂections on Technology Acceptance Model’’[26]. The scholars’ reviews varied dramatically from ‘‘TAM is a blessing and indisputable’’ on one end to‘‘TAM is a curse’’ on the other end. TAM3 was ﬁrst developed and publishedin May 2008 which resolved a number of shortcomings with the TAM model.Viswanath Venkatesh, Fred Davis (as the innovator of TAM), and Mike Morriscommentary on the JAIS special issue was ‘‘We conclude that there has been excel-lent progress in technology adoption research. However, as a next step, we call forresearch focused on interventions, contingencies, and alternative theoretical per-spectives (to the largely social psychology-based technology adoption research’’[43, p. 267]. Hence, TAM3 came as a response to the JAIS special issue to focuson interventions, and therefore, we believe that TAM3 is a sound theoreticalframework to investigate the factors affecting individual acceptance and assimila-tion of e-learning in various settings which is much more developed than previouseditions of TAM. Several previous studies (e.g.,[4,7,1,36]used old versions of TAM as a framework to study e-learning from different perspectives. Moreover,this study – to the best of our knowledge – is the ﬁrst one to use the latest versionof TAM (i.e., TAM3) as a framework to study e-learning.', 'Table 2Determinants of perceived ease of use[44, p. 279].', 'Determinants DeﬁnitionsComputer self-eﬃcacy (CSE) The degree to which an individual believes that he or she has the ability to perform a speciﬁc task/job using the computer [17,18] Perception of external control (PEC) The degree to which an individual believes that organizational and technical resources exist to support the use of the system [45] Computer anxiety (CANX) The degree of ‘‘an individual’s apprehension, or even fear, when she/he is faced with the possibility of using computers’’ [41, p. 349] Computer playfulness (CPLY) ‘‘ ...the degree of cognitive spontaneity in microcomputerinteractions’’[47, p. 204] Perceived enjoyment (ENJ) The extent to which ‘‘the activity of using a speciﬁc system is perceived to be enjoyable in its own right, aside from anyperformance consequences resulting from system use’’ [41, p. 351] Objective usability (OU) A ‘‘comparison of systems based on the actual level (rather than perceptions) of eﬀort required to completing speciﬁc tasks’’ [41, pp. 350–351]34 S.S. Al-Gahtani2. Research model and hypotheses', 'TAM3 is the most recent reformulation of TAM as reﬂected in the seminal workpublished by Venkatesh and Bala[44]. The nomological network of TAM3 as perFig. 1reveals that both social inﬂuence processes (subjective norm (SN), volun-tariness (VOL) and image (IMG)) and cognitive instrumental processes (job rele-vance (REL), output quality (OQ), result demonstrability (RES), and perceivedease of use (PEOU)), establish the determinants of perceived usefulness (PU).The anchors (computer self-efﬁcacy (CSE), perceptions of external control(PEC), computer anxiety (CANX), and computer playfulness (CPLY)), and theadjustments (perceived enjoyment (ENJ) and objective usability (OU)) establishthe determinants of perceived ease of use (PEOU). PU, PEOU, and subjectivenorm (SN) determine behavioral intentions (BI) to use an IT. Ultimately, BI deter-mines IT usage behavior. Venkatesh and Bala[44]reported that TAM3 accountedfor 52–67% of the variance in usefulness perceptions, 43–52% of the variance inease of use perceptions and 40–53% of the variance in usage intentions.', 'However, this study research model differs from TAM3 in three basic aspects.Firstly, in this study, our survey data on the model constructs were collected at asingle point in time, as opposed to a longitudinal methodology (i.e., collectingseveral measurements over time). Our focus is on how well the social inﬂuenceprocesses, the cognitive instrumental processes, the anchors and the adjustmentspredict e-learning technology acceptance, in particular the implicit cultural effectson these processes and factors which affect technology acceptance and assimila-tion. Secondly, the usage construct of TAM3 model was excluded, because weintend to collect cross-sectional data at a single time point, instead of longitudi-nally, the choice to measure technology acceptance with intention is appropriate,since measuring usage would require assessments of people’s beliefs and attitudesin a preceding period. Thus, the use of intention is appropriate for our study andallows us to measure acceptance and beliefs contemporaneously [2].', 'Objective Usability (OU) used to be operationalized consistent with the key-stroke model from human–computer interaction (HCI) research and prior useracceptance research[41]. The suggested guideline for operationalizing this con-struct is to compute a novice-to-expert ratio of effort. Speciﬁcally, the time takenby an expert to perform a set of tasks using the system in an error-free situation iscompared with the time taken by a novice (subject)[41]. Accordingly, a set of e-learning tasks should be assigned and completed by the respondents (students).The time taken by each individual student to complete the tasks should berecorded by the Learning Management System (LMS), which will be comparedlater to the time taken by an expert to arrive at a ratio that would serve as the mea-sure of OU for the particular subject (student). The higher the OU estimate(student-to-expert ratio), the harder the system is to use from an objectivestandpoint[41]. Unfortunately, the LMS technology used in our university(Blackboard) does not support the keystroke model to measure OU. Therefore,Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 35this construct was dropped from the research model which reﬂects the third differ-ence of this study from TAM3.', 'In view of that, the current research main hypotheses are as follows:', 'H1: The original TAM will hold well in the Saudi Arabian environment.H', '2: The extended TAM (TAM3) will hold well but differently from Westerncultures (i.e., the culture where TAM3 originated).H', '3(a): The social inﬂuence process variable (SN) will signiﬁcantly inﬂuencebehavioral intention (BI) to use the e-learning system,H', '3(b): The social inﬂuence process variables (SN and IMG) will signiﬁcantlyinﬂuence perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learning system,H', '3(c): The social inﬂuence process variable (IMG) will mediate the inﬂuence ofsubjective norm (SN) on perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learning system,H', '3(d): The social inﬂuence process variable (VOL) will signiﬁcantly moderatethe inﬂuence of SN on behavioral intention (BI) to use the e-learning system,H', '4(a): The cognitive instrumental process variables (REL, RES, and PEOU)will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence perceived usefulness (PU) of e-learning system,H', '4(b): The cognitive instrumental process variable (OQ) will signiﬁcantly mod-erate the inﬂuence of JREL on perceived usefulness (PU) of the e-learningsystem,H', '5: The four anchor variables (CSE, PEC, CANX, and CPLY) will signiﬁcantlyinﬂuence perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the e-learning system,H', '6: The adjustment variable (ENJ) will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence perceived ease ofuse (PEOU) of the e-learning system,H', '7: Experience (EXP) as a moderator in TAM3 will signiﬁcantly moderate theseven intended paths as shown inFig. 1.', '3. Research methodology', '3.1. Sampling procedure', 'A ‘‘convenience sample’’ amalgamated with ‘‘quota sample’’ was thought to be themost appropriate sampling procedure for this study. Convenience sampling wasdeemed appropriate by the virtue of the researcher’s accessibility to the respon-dents while quota sampling was considered appropriate in terms of achieving rel-ative proportions of respondents in different categories such as gender, coursemajor, and study level[12]. Six sites, (three male colleges: Science, Business, andEngineering, and three female colleges: Science, Arts and Literature, and Girls’Study Center), as subsidiaries of a large Saudi Arabian university in the southernregion, were chosen according to this sampling procedure for data collection.These sites were mature in e-learning experience and provided with high speedinternet connectivity. To achieve this goal, the data collection method thoughtto be most appropriate was a survey questionnaire. Newsted et al. [33]argue that36 S.S. Al-Gahtanisurveys are among the more popular methods used by the information systems(IS) research community.', '3.2. Structural Equation Modeling approach', 'Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques are a second-generation multi-variate technique[24]that has been widely used for instrument validation andmodel testing in research in the ﬁeld of marketing and organizational behavior.The SEM technique has also been introduced to MIS and started gaining popular-ity among researchers in the ﬁeld who have adopted this approach in several stud-ies recently reported in the literature. Conceptually and practically, SEM is similarto using Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA). However, causal models developedfollowing the SEM approach are superior to MRA in many ways. As this studyseeks a causative explanation of the decision behavior of individuals toward theacceptance and assimilation of e-learning, SEM came in front of other potentialapproaches to achieve this purpose. Chau et al.[14]reported that Bagozzi[8]enu- merated the advantages that causal models developed using the SEM approachpossesses, such as: ‘‘(1) they make the assumptions, constructs, and hypothesizedrelationships in a researcher’s theory explicit; (2) they add a degree of precision toa researcher’s theory, since they require clear deﬁnitions of constructs, opera-tionalizations, and the functional relationships between constructs; (3) they permita more complete representation of complex theories; and (4) they provide a formalframework for constructing and testing both theories and measures’’ [14, p. 314].', 'The most widely used statistical software packages that adopt the SEMapproach include LISREL and PLS. Although they are both SEM based, theyare quite different in their estimation approaches and objectives. The primarymeasures used in LISREL are overall goodness-of-ﬁt measures that assess howwell the hypothesized model ﬁts the observed data. Hence, the analysis is‘‘theory-oriented, and emphasizes the transition from exploratory to conﬁrmatoryanalysis’’[29, p. 270]. PLS-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) isbased on least squares estimation with the primary objective being to maximizethe explanation of variance in the dependent constructs of a structural equationmodel. PLS is essentially targeted for causal-predictive analysis as PLS is moreappropriate to analyze highly complex causal models with low theoretical substan-tiation for the purpose to maximize the determinants’ predictive power toward thedependent construct.', 'In summary, the researcher decided to use PLS-SEM to analyze this study datafor several reasons:', '1) PLS-SEM is, as the name implies, a more ‘‘regression-based’’ approach thatminimizes the residual variances of the endogenous constructs [25].Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 372) Indeed, TAM3 is relatively a new theoretical model developed by Venkateshand Bala[44]that presently undergoes empirical test in the Arabian culture.Because of its prediction orientation, PLS-SEM is, thus, the preferredmethod when the research objective is theory development and prediction[25].3) PLS-SEM can be a powerful method of analysis because of the minimaldemands on measurement scales, sample size, and residual distributions[15]. In fact, our study sample size is comparatively small with skewed vari-ables indicating that it is not normally distributed.4) Hair et al.[25]conclude that PLS-SEM path modeling, if appropriatelyapplied, is indeed a ‘‘silver bullet’’ for estimating causal models in many the-oretical models and empirical data situations.', '3.3. Research instruments', 'All the survey items used to operationalize the constructs investigated in ourresearch model were adapted for this study from Venkatesh and Bala [44]. However, these scales were originally developed and tested in the English lan-guage, and therefore developed in a different environment and culture. To adaptthem for the current research in Arabic, the Brislin[11]back translation method was used. The items were translated back and forth between English and Arabicby two teams of bilingual professors. The process was repeated until both versionsconverged.

In addition, PEOU simultaneously showed a strong direct effect on behavioral intention(BI) (beta = 0.252,p< 0.001). PU achieved a strong positive directinﬂuence on BI (beta = 0.374,p< 0.001). These results strongly indicate thatthe original TAM holds very well in the Arabian culture.

Also, all anchor variables (except CPLY)and computer enjoyment as the single adjustment variable exhibited signiﬁcantrelationships as determinants of perceived ease of use. Besides that, experienceexhibited ﬁve out of seven signiﬁcant moderating relationships speciﬁed inTAM3. Furthermore, by comparing the variance explained ( R', '2) in this study vs. TAM3: BI (0.420/0.400), PU (0.424/0.520), and PEOU (0.450/0.440), respectively,one can conclude that they are similar with regard to BI and PEOU but differentin PU. As a result, TAM3 holds well in the Arabian context but somehow differ-ently from Western cultures (i.e., the culture where TAM3 originated).', 'The main dependent variable in this study is behavioral intentions (BI) of stu-dents to accept and use an e-learning system which solely predict and determineactual system usage and, consequently, the success of new ITs, as per TAM3.However, rather than PU which exhibits the strongest inﬂuence on BI in Westernculture, this study reports that subjective norm (SN) exhibits the strongest inﬂu-ence on BI (beta = 0.349,p< 0.001 compared to the insigniﬁcant SNﬁBI rela- tionship in (TAM3: Venkatesh and Bala[44]). Indeed our ﬁnding conﬁrms apronounced effect of SN on BI in Saudi Arabia, a ﬁnding which is not usuallyobserved in Western contexts. This adds further evidence and supports the impor-tant role of SN reported by Al-Harbi[7].

These three mechanisms can be brieﬂy interpreted in the context ofIT adoption and use such that:compliance: represents a situation in which an indi-vidual adopts and uses an IT in order to attain certain rewards or avoids punish-ment; whereasidentiﬁcationrefers to an individual’s belief that adopting and usingan IT will elevate his or her social status within a referent group because importantreferents believe s/he should do so; however,internalizationis deﬁned as the incor- poration of a referent’s belief into one’s own belief structure. This would ensurethe adherence to the compliance and identiﬁcation of the social inﬂuence42 S.S. Al-Gahtanimechanisms. However, the internalization mechanism will be manifested as aresult of continuous adherence of individuals to the compliance and identiﬁcationmechanisms as it is expected that with time the incorporation of important refer-ent’s belief into one’s own belief structure will take place.', 'We believe that underpinning the notion of IT acceptance and assimilation ontothese three social inﬂuence mechanisms in the bounds of Saudi Arabia’s culturalcontext with the pervasiveness of the Saudi hierarchical conforming society inthe workplace[10]would open a new outlook in this issue. Accordingly, we con-tend that Saudi individuals would show a high regard for authority and wouldconform to the expectations of those elites/managers who occupy senior roles inthe organizational hierarchy while embracing IT take-up tendency, would leadto IT acceptance and assimilation. This perspective is ‘‘especially true in light ofthe heavy promotion of technology adoption through governmental policy andwhere there are typically more rigid cultural and organizational structures ofauthority between managers and subordinates’’[9, p. 49].', 'In TAM3, four constructs – job relevance, output quality, result demonstrabil-ity, and perceived ease of use – capture the inﬂuence of cognitive instrumental pro-cesses on perceived usefulness. This study proved that two cognitive instrumentalprocesses (REL and PEOU) signiﬁcantly affect perceived usefulness as per TAM3(RELﬁPU = 0.380,p< 0.001; PEOUﬁPU = 0.206,p< 0.001) while OQ signiﬁcantly moderate RELﬁPU relationship (explained below). Result demon-strability (RES) was the only exception, as RES did not signiﬁcantly affect PUwhich might indicate that participants do not believe that the results of usingthe LMS are tangible, observable, and communicable[31]. Hence,H', '4(a)is par- tially supported.', 'The anchors suggested by TAM3 arecomputer self-efﬁcacy, computer anxiety,perceptions of external control(orfacilitating conditions),andcomputer playfulness.

Moderators effects', 'TAM3 posits that subjective norm (SN) has a positive signiﬁcant effect onbehavioral intention (BI) and to continue in voluntary usage contexts. Our ﬁnd-ings indicate that SN has positive direct effect on BI and that voluntariness(VOL) positively moderates the effect of SN on BI (VOL·SNﬁBI = 0.14) indi- cating that the positive direct effect of SN on BI will not attenuate in voluntaryusage contexts. The positive interaction of voluntariness on the effect of SN onBI could be interpreted such that, users in more voluntary usage contexts areinclined to be positively affected by signiﬁcant others’ opinions regarding theirintention to use LMS. In this milieu, it is likely that the effect of subjective normon intention to use LMS will not diminish with increasing voluntariness, asreported in Venkatesh and Davis[42]. Speciﬁcally, they found that SN inﬂuencedBI only in mandatory usage contexts, and that in voluntary usage contexts, SNhad no direct effect on BI. We contend that the signiﬁcant effect of SN on BI,in both mandatory and voluntary usage contexts, can be explained within SaudiArabia’s cultural context. In light of these Saudi cultural impacts, even if the con-text of usage was voluntary, SN would continue to be a signiﬁcant predictor of BI.Indeed, our ﬁndings do conﬁrm a pronounced effect of SN on BI in Saudi Arabia,a ﬁnding which is not usually observed in Western contexts. Hence, H', '3(d)is supported.', 'Venkatesh and Davis[42]deﬁned job relevance as the degree to which an indi-vidual believes that the target system is applicable to his or her job. This studyreports on a strong positive direct effect of job relevance (REL) on perceived use-fulness (PU) that will increase with higher output quality. OQ positively moder-ated the effect of REL on PU (OQ x RELﬁPU = 0.152). Job relevance andoutput quality will have a moderating effect on perceived usefulness such thatthe higher the output quality, the stronger the effect job relevance will have on per-ceived usefulness as reported in Venkatesh and Davis [42]. Thus,H', '4(b)is supported.', 'The positive direct effect of subjective norm on both behavioral intention andperceived usefulness will attenuate with increased experience. EXP negativelymoderated the effect of SN on BI (EXP·SNﬁBI =/C00.10) and PU (EXP·SNﬁPU = -0.05). These relationships are supported. These negativecoefﬁcients could be interpreted to indicate that more experienced individualsare possessing stable perceptions about LMS usefulness besides their afﬁrmedintention to use LMS regardless of referent opinion in this issue. In other words,more experienced users’ tendencies are less likely to be affected by signiﬁcantothers’ opinions regarding their perceptions of LMS usefulness and their intentionto use LMS. In this context, contrary to the ﬁndings of [42], our ﬁndings indicate that it is likely that the effect of subjective norm on perceived LMS usefulness andon intention to use LMS will diminish as users gain more experience with the sys-tem. Hence, management should concentrate on users to acquire more experience44 S.S. Al-Gahtaniwith the system, instead of relying on referent opinions, to ensure higher levels ofsystem acceptance and assimilation.', 'The positive direct effect of ease of use on both behavioral intention and per-ceived usefulness willnotattenuate with increased experience. EXP positivelymoderated the effect of EOU on BI (EXP·PEOUﬁBI = 0.101) and PU (EXP·PEOUﬁPU = 0.083). These relationships are supported. We interpretthese positive coefﬁcients as an indication that more experienced individuals arestill inclined to be affected by signiﬁcant system ease of use regarding the perceivedusefulness of, and intention to use, LMS. In this context, it is likely that the effectof ease of use on perceived usefulness and intention to use a system will notdimin- ish with increased experience. In fact our ﬁndings conﬁrm a pronounced effect ofPEOU on both PU and BI in Saudi Arabia, which should not be overlooked dur-ing system design.', 'EXP did not signiﬁcantly moderate the negative inﬂuence of computer anxiety(CANX) on PEOU (EXP·CANXﬁPEOU = -0.035). In this context, it is lesslikely that the effect of computer anxiety on system ease of use will diminish withincreasing experience, as reported in Venkatesh and Davis [42]. This is a sign of the impediment effect of anxiety with LMS users which persists even with increasingexperience. However, EXP didpositivelymoderate the positive inﬂuence of enjoy-ment (ENJ) on PEOU (EXP·ENJﬁPEOU = 0.076). Hence, it is likely that theeffect of system enjoyment on ease of use will increase with increased experience,as reported in Venkatesh and Davis[42].', 'Computer playfulness (CPLY) is theorized to signiﬁcantly affect perceived easeof use (PEOU) as per TAM3. However, our ﬁndings indicate that computer play-fulness fails to impact LMS ease of use which indicates that participants couldnotachieve an acceptable level of intrinsic motivation while using the LMS in order tofoster their perceptions regarding LMS ease of use. Thus, users feel that the systemhas no playfulness merit which otherwise would let users to perceive the system aseasy to use rather than being awkward and complex. This situation did not changewhen the CPLYﬁPEOU relationship was moderated by experience(EXP·CPLYﬁPEOU = 0.007). The insigniﬁcant interaction of experience onthe effect of CPLY on PEOU could be interpreted such that, gaining moreexperience has an unconstructive role with regard to how computer playfulnessimpetus LMS’ ease of use. In other words, even experienced users still perceiveLMS with no playfulness merit because they couldnot achieve an acceptable levelof intrinsic motivation which in turn fails to inﬂuence their perceptions regardingLMS ease of use.', 'Venkatesh[41]posited that the effects of adjustments on perceived ease of use(PEOU) were stronger with more hands-on experience with the system.

Interventions', 'It has been advised by academics and practitioners that managers need to developand implement effectiveinterventionsin order to maximize end-users’ IT adoptionand use[28]. Therefore, identifying interventions that could inﬂuence adoptionand use of new ITs can aid managerial decision making on successful IT imple-mentation strategies[28]. TAM3 paved the way to comprehend the role of inter-ventions in IT acceptance and assimilation contexts, based on delineating thepredictors of PU and PEOU. In TAM3, Venkatesh and Bala [44]classiﬁed inter- ventions into two categories:pre-implementationandpost-implementationinterven- tions motivated by the stage models of IT implementation and type of intervention(e.g., design characteristics, user participation, incentive alignment, training, orga-nizational and peer support). TAM3 also contributes to management with respectto interventions by supporting managerial decision making with two complement-ing alternatives[44]: Firstly, managers are provided with a framework to decidewhat interventions to apply during pre- and post-implementation stages and forwhat types of systems. Secondly, managers can decide on resource allocationfor each speciﬁc intervention anchored by the impact of such intervention on dif-ferent determinants of IT acceptance and assimilation, and system type.', 'As noted earlier, this study has the shortcoming of lacking a longitudinal meritand thus cannot justifypre-implementationinterventions from the ﬁeld. However,participants clearly acknowledged that they strongly desire to be given the choicebetween LMS alternatives based on ample presentations and demonstrations inorder to alleviate initial resistance and develop genuine perceptions of system fea-tures, capabilities, and relevance to enhance future system acceptance andassimilation.', '7.1.

Post-implementation interventions canbe vital so that users are able to go through the initial shock and react favorably tochanges associated with the new system. The core theme of post-implementationinterventions should be to make users feel that the new system is an opportunityto enhance their job performance, and give them the ability and necessaryresources to use the new system smoothly[44]. TAM3 suggests a group ofpost-implementation interventions: training, organizational support, and peer46 S.S. Al-Gahtanisupport that will be particularly relevant to each of the determinants of PU andPEOU.', 'In the following, we reﬂect on the concept of post-implementation interventionsto our study ﬁndings by giving an example of one determinant of perceived useful-ness and one determinant of perceived ease of use which were not signiﬁcant andapply the suitable intervention, as alleviation, to each case.', '(a) Our study reports that result demonstrability as a predictor of perceived use-fulness was not signiﬁcant which might indicate that participants do notbelieve that the results of using LMS are tangible, observable, and commu-nicable[31]. In order to alleviate this situation, TAM3 suggests a bunch ofpost-implementation interventions such as: training, organizational support,and peer support which will be particularly relevant in this situation.(b) Our study reports that computer playfulness as a predictor of perceived easeof use was not signiﬁcant which might indicate that participants could notachieve an acceptable level of intrinsic motivation while using the LMS soas to perceive LMS as easy to use. In order to soothe this situation,TAM3 suggests training as the sole post-implementation intervention whichwill be particularly relevant and adequate to let users feel spontaneous andplayful while using the system.', '8. Limitations', 'Our study has its own limitations. This study was set to utilize TAM3 to empiri-cally investigate the acceptance and assimilation of e-learning in a developingcountry. However, our study is not an exact replication of the study conductedby Venkatesh and Bala[44]to develop TAM3. Our study applied cross-sectional design and used a sample from a single organization compared to theVenkatesh and Bala study which used a longitudinal design with a sample of sub-jects included from four different organizations. Venkatesh and Bala [44]used conventional regression analysis (MRA), as the statistical technique to analyzetheir data. In contrast, our study employed PLS-based structural equation model-ing (PLS-SEM), a more powerful technique to conduct the data analysis. We hopethis analytical technique is a credit providing additional support for the validity ofthe results of our model.', 'With this study only having tested a single LMS technology (Bb) in one devel-oping country, the generalizability of our ﬁndings are quite limited as well. Thereis a need to conduct additional studies applying TAM3 to developing nations togain further support for the ﬁndings of this study as discussed below in the futurestudies of e-learning acceptance.Empirical Investigation of E-Learning Acceptance and Assimilation 478.1. Future studies of e-learning acceptance', 'Singh and Hardaker[38]suggest that future studies of e-learning acceptanceshould target both the micro-level reﬂecting on several aspects such as: individu-alist perspective considering the different backgrounds, experiences and motiva-tions of individual academics; and the macro-level considering variousorganizational and environmental settings. This study supports this recommenda-tion and suggests that future research needs to close the gap between these twoapproaches by developing a more integrated theoretical framework that providesa means to diminish the overshadow effects of organizational roles and organiza-tional and environmental settings over the personal characteristics inspiring fruit-ful future research ﬁndings.', 'Additionally, future studies could be conducted to examine TAM3 using sam-ples of students and instructors from different geo-locations and a wider range ofe-learning systems. This could involve testing TAM3 by including the technologyusage behavior construct omitted from our research model, which would increasethe predictable levels of e-learning acceptance. Furthermore, the full TAM3 modelcould be tested in future studies by including the objective usability constructwhich needs special research design to enable the key stroke model which wereferred to in the research method above.', '9. Conclusions', 'Contemporary organizations spend vast amounts of resources in ITs which arebecoming progressively complex, and implementation costs are tremendouslyescalating with time. Implementation failures of many of today’s ITs cost millionsof dollars to organizations. In addition, low acceptance and adoption manifestedin high underutilization of ITs have been a major problem for organizations.', 'This study develops our understanding of the determinants of e-learning accep-tance and assimilation in a developing country by testing a nomological networkbased on TAM3 using structural equation modeling. It also partially advocates theconcept of interventions – as per TAM3 – that can favorably inﬂuence these deter-minants so that management can proactively decide on implementing the rightinterventions to minimize resistance to this relatively new IT, and maximize itseffective utilization.', 'All hypotheses of direct effect relationships, as per TAM3 in Fig. 1, were sup- ported except two relationships: computer playfulness (CPLY)ﬁperceived ease of use (PEOU) and result demonstrability (RES)ﬁperceived usefulness (PU).Seven out of nine hypotheses of moderating effects relationships, as per TAM3inFig. 1, were supported. We hope that this adds further conﬁdence in ourresearch design and we also hope that future studies can refer to these ﬁndingsfor comparison and discussions.48 S.S.

Previous researchers have shown these formulationssuccumb to a different breakup mechanism than conventional formulations, beginning with inhomogeneitieswithin the liquid sheet that nucleate holes within the material being sprayed, beginning the mechanism respon-sible for breaking the sheet into droplets. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a Bayesian hierarchical model, isused to explore unsupervised learning relationships between image analysis metrics on spray video data and theresulting atomization droplet size. Latent factors discovered by LDA were used for classi ﬁcation of video seg- ments and achieved 99.9% accuracy (3-fold cross validation). Seventy- ﬁve videos were used for regression where each video had a unique measured droplet size distribution (D10, D50, and D90 values) for atomization.Experiments using the features learnt by Latent Dirichlet Allocation used with regression have extremely goodresults (R', '2~ 0.995 in 3-fold cross validation, R2~ 0.963 on never-seen videos), which serves as evidence for the potential use of this model in image analysis of agricultural spray patterns. LDA has huge potential in bothlearning and predicting atomization patterns [e.g., driftable ﬁnes (drops <150μm)] when used with images based on the breakup phenomena in agricultural spray. These small drop sizes that occur during atomizationhave the greatest propensity for off-target movement through wind induced drift. LDA proved useful in charac-terizing current and future formulation designs using only images as witnessed by observations and excellentpredictions summarized in this paper. In fact, these methods offer potential for use under ﬁeld conditions to ad- dress spray performance based upon images of spray patterns at the nozzle without the need for expensive lightscattering equipment often used to measure this phenomenon.© 2020 The Authors.

IntroductionFlat-fan and air-induction hydraulic nozzles, mounted on spraybooms, are the primary tools used to deliver agrochemicals to their tar-get location. Nozzles are mounted on delivery booms for both groundand aerial delivery systems. Pesticide mixtures being sprayed leavethe nozzle and begin as a liquid sheet which fans outward from the noz-zle and eventually breaks up into liquid drops. Instabilities decomposethe sheet into droplets by a variety of likely mechanisms, a phenome-non known as spray atomization (Dorman (1952)). Agrochemical spray drift is an increasingly important ﬁeld of study due to increased environment stewardship, legal liabilities, and the in-direct costs of off-target effects (Palardy and Centner, 2017;Moeller, 2018;Viera et al., 2019). The resulting drop size greatly inﬂuences how well the sprayed chemical is delivered to the target. The ultimatesize of the drops dictates both efﬁcacy and potential off targetmovement (e.g., drift). Attempts at the mechanistic understandingphenomena of spray drift can be found elsewhere ( Squire, 1953; Barlow et al., 2011;Altieri et al., 2014;Cryer and Altieri, 2017;Altieri and Cryer, 2018).Atomized drop size greatly inﬂuences the chemical effectivenesswhen delivered to its target. Large (coarse) drops may not effectivelycover the target or may bounce upon impact with foliage. This iscontrasted by smaller drops that risk becoming entrained in ambientair currents and carried off target, known as droplet drift. These smalldrops that are susceptible to off target movement are known as driftableﬁnes. Driftableﬁnes is not a standardized quantity but it is on the orderof drop diameters≤150μm(Cloeter et al., 2010). Experimental observations for spray patterns for multiphase emul-sions are also reported (Li et al., 2020;Altieri et al., 2014) and used for comparison and training in unsupervised learning techniques. LatentDirichlet Allocation (LDA) models are used in this analysis which differfrom deep learning approaches and constitute a generative statisticalmodel that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobservedgroups that elucidate why parts of the data are similar.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 253 –261', '⁎Corresponding author.E-mail address:steven.cryer@corteva.com(S.

Methods and materials2.1. DataThe droplet size distribution emanating from the nozzle was ob-tained using a Sympatec laser diffraction system shown in Fig. 1(Fritz and Hoffmann, 2016). This liquid sheet area, from the nozzle tip to thedistance where the sheet breaks up into drops, was imaged by video.Spray images videos were taken by a high-speed camera (Photron®Fastcam SA3 high-speed camera and a Nikon ED AF Nikkor®80–200 mm lens) with 1024 × 1024 pixels resolution at 2000 framesper second.The dataset consists of 83 videos belonging to 44 classes. Videos ofthe same class are recordings of repeated trials with exactly the sameformulations, pressure and nozzles. Each video contains around 3000frames and a total of 263,951 frames were obtained across all videos.Since videos were taken at different times with different nozzles,shape, size, and position of nozzles as well as brightness of imagescould change. To standardize those videos, every frame waspreprocessed. Nozzles and headers at the top of each frame werealigned and then cropped from each image frame. The background ofthe centered spray patterns was denoised. Finally, each frame wasturned into gray-scale fooled by conversion into black-and-white only(i.e. intensity of a pixel is either 0 or 255) since intensity variance isnot relevant in our case. Example of a standardized frame is providedinFig. 2(b) along with the raw frame inFig. 2(a).2.2. Latent Dirichlet allocationDeep learning models using the same dataset are reported in Li et al. (2020). Better overall performance is anticipated when using averagingmethods if models are uncorrelated. Latent Dirichlet Allocation Modelsdiffer from deep learning approaches, constituting a generative statisti-cal model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unob-served groups that elucidate why some part of the data are similar.LDA wasﬁrst introduced for natural language processing by Blei et al.(2003). It is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which eachitem of a collection is modeled as aﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topics, and each topic is modeled as an in ﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. A graphic model of LDA is showedinFig. 3. Here, plate notation is a method of representing variables thatrepeat in a graphical model in Bayesian inference. A plate (or rectangle)is used to group variables into a subgraph that repeat together, and anumber is drawn on the plate to represent the number of repetitionsof the subgraph in the plate.According toBlei et al. (2003), an easy way to understand LDA is tolook at the processes it assumes for each document within adocument-term matrix (e.g., corpus).1. ChooseN~ Poisson (ξ)2. Chooseθ~D i r(α)3. For each of the N wordsw', 'n:a. Choose a topicz', 'n~ Multinomial(θ)b. Choose a wordw', 'nfromp(w n|zn,β), a multinomial probability con-ditions on the topicz', 'n.To put it simply, topics are distributions over words, and documentsare distributions over topics. Suppose we have information from manydocuments that talk about news on different topics such as social,sport,ﬁnance, politics, etc. Some words (e.g. football, win, score) aremore likely to appear in sport news than ﬁnancial news. It is natural to assume that, each topic consists of different set of words, or more ac-curately, each topic corresponds to a different probability distribution ofwords. Moreover, a document might contain several topics such asnews that talks about an event that is related to both ﬁnance and law. LDA captures this by assuming each document corresponds to a combi-nation of topics (e.g., 20% political, 50%ﬁnancial, 30% social, and so on).An image can also be treated as a document when it comes to imageprocessing. For example, an image of a natural scene is a document. Thisscene may consist of 30% sky, 20% sea, and 50% sand, where sky, sea, andsand are topics. The topic sky might assign higher probability to visual', 'Fig. 1.The experimental spray chamber, nozzle system, Sympatec laser, and high-speed video camera used to measure the atomization drop size distribution a nd imaging the spray sheet.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 253 –261', '254words that are white or blue, while the topic sand might assign higherprobability of visual words that are yellow.As a result, although originally a language model, LDA has beenbrought into and widely used in computer vision. Applications of LDA in-clude object recognition (Sivic et al., 2005,Fei-Fei and Perona, 2005, Russell et al., 2006,Cao and Fei-Fei, 2010), natural scene classiﬁcation (Fei-Fei and Perona, 2005), human action classiﬁcation (Niebles et al., 2008), activity perception in complicated scene ( Wang et al., 2007), etc. Variants of LDA were developed for different tasks such as Spatial LDA(Wang and Grimson, 2008) for capturing spatial structures and Corre-spondence LDA (Blei and Jordan, 2003) for image annotation. In this work, we apply LDA to spray pattern images to obtain interpretable un-derlying features that can be subsequentially used in supervised learningtasks.2.3. Feature construction2.3.1. Bag of wordsWords, vocabulary, and documents are required to apply LDA. Thus,visual wordsare extracted (which are local areas of images) in handlingimage data. For example, in natural scenes, there is likely to be stones,mountains, sky, sun, trees, and so on. These objects are characterizedas visual words, and they form the vocabulary of natural scenes. Fei- Fei and Perona (2005)sample local regions from images by severalmethods (including evenly grid sampling) and use a k-means algorithmto cluster these local regions to get the vocabulary. In this way, a localregion of an image corresponds to a word, and an image, which is a col-lection of words, becomes a document. Other approaches employ theuse of super-pixels to over-segment images in regions of related pixels(Chen et al., 2017;Qiaojin et al., 2011).A video is a sequence of images, and in some cases human actionrecognition (e.g., spatial-temporal information) is critical. Niebles et al. (2008)represented each video sequence as a collection ofspatial-temporal words by extracting space-time interest points.However, human actions are highly structured and non-random,while the spray videos consist of ra ndom, unstable image textures, white dots and lines. Static instances of an image spray pattern tex-tures are insufﬁcient to properly categorize the information contentof such dynamic, highly random phenomena. It is the temporal dis-tribution of these image texture regions over the course of a videostream that provide discriminability. Thus, we treat videos as bagsof visual words. Each frame is an unordered collection of visualwords, and sequence of frames are still an unordered collection of vi-sual words. A sequence of frames are the collections of all visualwords that appear in any of these frames. We count how manytimes a word appears in a document, and a document is then repre-sented by the counts of words (known as a document-word matrix).A bag-of-words model is often used in document classi ﬁcation where the frequency of occurrence for each word is a feature fortraining a classiﬁer (McTear et al., 2016;Harris, 1954). For example, suppose we have two documents. The ﬁrst document is “James likes apples and Emma likes oranges. ”And the second one is “James hates oranges.”We can represent the two documents as twobags of words (BoW):', 'BoW1 = {“James”:1,“likes”:2,“apples”:1,“and”:1,“Emma”:1, “oranges”:1};BoW2 = {“James”:1,“hates”:1,“oranges”:1}; and the document-word matrix is constructed as follows:', 'Fig. 2.Single raw frame example extracted from a video showcasing the header and nozzle requiring removal (red boundary) and centering image (green boundar y) (a), followed by denoising and conversion to a black-and-white only image (b).', 'Fig. 3.Latent Dirichlet Allocation graphic model (taken from Blei et al.

CodebookSimilarly, we can construct a document-word matrix for images bythinking of an image as a document and local regions of an image aswords. We cut images into small local regions, use k-means to get a dic-tionary of visual words, and then form a bag of words representing a se-quence of images. All images are downsampled to 500 × 500 pixels forLDA. Each image is cut into 10 × 10 pixels small patches and we removeall patches that are completely empty (i.e., if every pixel in a patch is 0, itcontains the black background only).Fifteen hundred frames are randomly sampled (due to memory lim-itations and the relative simplicity of the elements in our images) to per-form k-means. A vocabulary size of 200 is selected (i.e., 200 clustercenters for the k-means) and we get a dictionary containing 200 visualwords of our“language”following the k-means step. We also obtain an-other 50 visual words using pyramid features extraction methoddescribed in section 2.3.3.Fig. 4illustrates the codebook that is learnedfrom the frames, and we use the 250 visual words in the codebook todescribe the images. We assign each local patch sampled from a frameto the visual word that is most similar. In this way, an image becomesa bag of visual words from the codebook.2.3.3. Pyramid featuresSince we resize each frame to 500 × 500 pixels and sample 10 × 10pixels local patches from these frames, each patch contains a verysmall portion of information in the original frame. One patch mightcontain a dot or part of a line (i.e., a very low-level feature about theimage). However, we would also like to have features that describeshigher level information about the image, (such as the spray angle ofsheets), and we adopt the feature extraction method used byLazebnik et al. (2006). After we extract local patches from 500 × 500pixels images, we shrink each image to 100 × 100 pixels and cutthem into 10 × 10 pixels local patches again. In this way, one patchcan contain more information in relation to the size of the image(i.e., higher-level features such as the angle of sheets in addition to adot or a short line).', 'Fig. 4.Codebooks sorted by frequencies.

Each word is counted to construct thedocument-word matrix.3. Results3.1. Clustering results and insightsData consists of 83 high speed videos belonging to 44 classes (wheremost classes contain two videos). Most videos contain around 3000frames. Each frame is transformed into black-and-white image. Wesplit each video into smaller video segments where each video segmentconsists of 25 consecutive frames. We treat a video segment as a docu-ment (instead of a frame as a document) where most videos containaround 100 video segments. Most frames sizes are approximately1000 × 1000 pixels, but we resize them into 500 × 500 pixels.The dataset is split randomly into a small training set (for learningthe codebook) and a test set.Approximately 200 low level visual words and 50 high level visualwords are learned in training. We set the number of topics of the LatentDirichlet Allocation model as 44. Although we use same number oftopics as classes, we do not expect one-to-one correspondence betweentopics and classes. Usually, a class is de ﬁned by multiple dominant topics.The unnormalized topic proportion for each document, or video seg-ment, is obtained afterﬁtting the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. Aclass is deﬁned by its unique topic proportions, and this topic proportionis used to analyze similarity and difference between classes. The topicproportion for two example videos is provided in Fig. 6.E a c hl i n ei n the plot is the topic proportion of a video segment. Each subplot con-tains video segments that come from the same video. We can see thatvideo segments that come from the same video have very similartopic proportions. A video class represents the formulation attributesthat lead to how the material breaks up into droplets and the resultingdrop size. And the topic proportion of video segments of this class arealmost the same. The top and bottom video each belongs to differentclasses,Fig. 6. Thus, the topic proportions are different.The top two principle components (PCA) of topic proportion of eachvideo segment are represented inFig. 7, with different colors indicating different classes. PCA produces a low-dimensional representation of adataset byﬁnding a sequence of linear combinations of the variable hav-ing maximum variance that are mutually uncorrelated and serves as atool for data visualization. A dot is a video segment. A cloud is a video.FromFig. 7, one sees that video segments of the same class are mostlygrouped together.', 'Fig. 7.Principle Components Analysis of topic proportion of each video segment using the ﬁrst two principle components.

A dendrogram isuseful to explore the numbers of various clusters that form between dif-ferent video classes with similar formulations clustering close to one an-other. However, often dramatically different formulations can clustertogether (similar results for PCA).Topics are distributions over words and one can further examinewhat these topics are. A crude idea of topic descriptions is determinedby looking at the high frequency words of a certain topic. In Fig. 9,t h e majority ofﬁrst topic is dots, while polygons, or holes, appear in the sec-ond topic more frequently. The third topic is about vertical lines, and thelast example shows lines of different orientations. If a class has a highproportion of theﬁrst topic and low proportion of the last topic, theremight be more dots than lines in the videos of this class.3.2. Video segment classiﬁcationLatent Dirichlet Allocation discovers the topic distribution which de-ﬁne classes in an unsupervised fashion. Each class has a unique topicproportion. Supervised models can be built if topic proportions aretaken as a feature vector that describes each class. Linear DiscriminantAnalysis is chosen to perform classiﬁcation using topic distributions. There is a total of 10,461 video segments, 83 videos, 44 classes for thespray atomization videos. Video segments originating from the samevideo share the same class label. Unique classes represent video obser-vations that yield similar behavior.The topic proportion of each video segment is used as its features.Even when running videos at steady state, the dynamic nature for theﬂuid sheets suggest that it is possible for video segments to bemisclassiﬁed into different classes depending upon where in the processthe video segments is taken. Thus, the dataset is ﬁrst split into training and testing sets by video segments (i.e., 2/3 of all video segments aretrain data, 1/3 of all video segments are test data). A Linear DiscriminantAnalysis model is trained via the training set, and predictions for theclass of video segments (25 frames) are analyzed in the test set. Accu-racy of 3-fold cross validation is 99.9%. Table 1shows the high cross- validation accuracy of the classiﬁcation for this approach. A possibleexplanation to the high accuracy may be due to having multiple videosegments for a single video.For further insights into generalizability of these features, the datasetis then split into train and test set by videos. There are 31 classes con-taining two or more different videos. For those classes, video segmentscoming from one video are in train set, and video segments coming fromanother video are in test set. This approach results in 5742 video seg-ments in train set and 4719 video segments in test set. Again, a LinearDiscriminant Analysis model is used to classify these video segments,and it achieved 85.9% accuracy.Table 1summarizes the classiﬁcation results. The high classiﬁcation accuracy shows that the topic distributions extracted by Latent Dirichlet', 'Fig. 8.Dendrogram of classes by Euclidian distance of their topic proportions.H. Li, S. Cryer, J.

Drop size predictionFeature vectors are also used to do regression in addition to classi ﬁ- cation. Only 75 of the 83 videos utilized for Latent Dirichlet Allocationhad atomization drop size distributions summarized for three measure-ments (i.e., D10, D50, and D90 values representing drop size particle di-ameter corresponding to 10, 50 and 90% cumulative), leaving 9621video segments (75 videos) for the regression task. The independentvariables are the topic proportion of each video segments (smaller sub-set of main video) and are different for each video segments (althoughthe difference is extremely small if two video segments are derived fromthe same video). The dependent variables are the three measurements,D10, D50, and D90.Data is split into a train and test set by video segments (e.g., 2/3 of allthe video segments are train data, and 1/3 of all video segments are testdata).

ConclusionsThe mechanism for delivering many pesticides to the target site isby atomization of spray using hydraulic nozzles. Atomization showsrich diversity and is a function of formulation type, composition, thenumber of phases within the formulation, spray pressure, nozzle ge-ometry, and so on. Breakup patterns from spray nozzles are exploredusing unsupervised learning techniques to elucidate the mechanics ofatomization for oil-in-water formulations. The Latent Dirichlet Alloca-tion (LDA), a Bayesian hierarchical model, is used to perform unsuper-vised learning on video spray data for agricultural formulations. TheLDA model discovers and learns about the latent factors for the datato provide insight on information that is much more interpretablethan that obtained via black box methods. Latent factors discoveredby LDA were used for supervised learning tasks including classi ﬁcation and regression.A Linear Discriminant Analysis model was able to classify video seg-ments with 99.9% accuracy (3-fold cross-validation) based on those la-tent factors. Seventy-ﬁve videos were used for regression where eachvideo had a unique measured droplet size distribution (D10, D50, andD90 values) for atomization. The primary experiments using the fea-tures learnt by Latent Dirichlet Allocation used with regression (3-foldcross-validation) have extremely good results ( R', '2~ 0.995). Further ex- periments where never-before-seen videos were held out as test setstill give good results (R', \"2~0 . 9 6 3 ) ,w h i c hs e r v e sa se v i d e n c ef o rt h ep o -tential use of this model in image analysis of agricultural spray patterns.The Latent Dirichlet Allocation model offers huge potential to learn andpredict atomization patterns (e.g., especially dri ﬁtableﬁnes) when used with images based on the multiphase breakup phenomena witnessed inagricultural spray drift. Small drops of sizes <150 μm offer the greatest propensity for off-target movement via wind induced drift, and LDAmethods can be used to offer insight into the drop sizes manifest withspraying oil-in-water formulations. Images can be obtained from videosobtained in spray chambers (this work) or from real time videos ofspray phenomena at the source along a boom in ﬁeld applications. Thus, process control can come into play to keep drop sizes within atargeted range (e.g., spray performance).Author StatementHongfei Li was a principle author involved in all aspects of thiswork.

IntroductionPermanent Magnet Synchronous Machine ‘‘PMSM ”become a good choice in servo drives, and is on the way to step besideinduction machines in traction applications. TraditionalPMSM drives employ position sensors to measure the speed,and rotor angular position. These sensors present severaldisadvantages, such as reduced reliability, susceptibility tonoise, additional cost and weight and increased complexityof the drive system. Recently, there has been much interestin developing a sensorless algorithms in which the motor wascontrolled using the estimated values of the angular speed ofthe rotor[1,2].Several methods have been developed to estimate the rotorspeed or position, and among them are Flux Linkage Observer‘‘FLO”, Extended Kalman Filter ‘‘EKF”based observer, andSliding Mode Observer ‘‘SMO”. The latter has a fast response,good robustness for external disturbances, and machineparameter variations[3,4]. The SMO uses a sliding mode vari-able structure in the control loop to compensate the parametricuncertainties keeping the observer independent of theunknown signals during the sliding motion with a stabledynamic error[5,6]. The estimated values in an ordinarySMO contain high frequency oscillation components becauseof the discrete switch control. The switch function is criticalto the observer performance and it allows appearing the chat-tering phenomenon that can excite high frequencies which isn’tdesirable in high performance speed drives [7,8]. Several solutions are proposed to make a trade-off between chatteringphenomenon reduction, and observer robustness. In [9–11]a ﬁrst order and second order SMO proposed, the chatteringphenomenon reduced but low pass ﬁlter causes unavoidable', '*Corresponding author at: Sigma Electronic Industries, Cairo, Egypt.E-mail addresses:Mahmoud.Gaballah1@gmail.com(M.M.

In[12], the ordinary switchfunction replaced with the sigmoid function, low-pass ﬁlteravoided but there is a tracking error. In[13]a higher-order sliding mode ‘‘HOSM”observer presented, the estimationaccuracy improved, but selecting sliding mode gains andboundary layer are difﬁcult as they are dependent on the rotorspeed. Other algorithms such as artiﬁcial neural network [14] and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods[15], can achieve highperformance, but they are relatively complicated and requirelarge computational time.This paper introduces a new Fuzzy Sliding Mode Observer(FSMO) in which the switch function in traditional SlidingMode Observer ‘‘SMO”was replaced by a rule based FuzzyLogic System ‘‘FLS”. The proposed observer not only ensuresthe robustness for various disturbances, but also improves thedynamic performance. The observer was experimentally testedout on a TMS320F28069M DSP Controller, and experimentalresults were introduced to validate the proposed observercovering digital implementation cost, position estimation accu-racy, and speed response.2. Motor model and sliding mode observerBased on these assumptions the motor appears to be orbecomes unsaturated; all the stator resistance, self- and mutualinductances for each phase are the same, neglecting the ironlosses. The PMSM model in the stationary reference frame isdescribed by the following equations[16]:L', 'sðpiaÞ¼/C0R sia/C0eaþV a', 'LsðpibÞ¼/C0R sib/C0ebþV b( ð1Þwheree', 'a¼/C0wfxrsinhe', 'b¼/C0wfxrcosh( ð2ÞTo observe the EMF components, the sliding mode observer isdesigned as follows[17,18]:L', 'sðp^iaÞ¼/C0R s^iaþV a/C0ksgnð^i a/C0iaÞL', 'sðp^ibÞ¼/C0R s^ibþV b/C0ksgnð^i b/C0ibÞ/C26 ð3ÞwheresgnðxÞ¼1i fx>0/C01i fx<0/C26 ð4Þ Subtracting Eq.(1)from Eq.(3),V', 'acancel V b, and the error equations will be the following:L', 'sðp~iaÞ¼/C0R s~iaþea/C0ksgnð/C22i aÞL', 'sðp~ibÞ¼/C0R s~ibþeb/C0ksgnð/C22i bÞ/C26 ð5ÞTo guarantee the observer convergence based on lyapunov’direct theory, the observer gain ‘‘k”should be[11]: k>maxðjeajjebjÞ ð 6Þ Once the system reaches the sliding surface, then:/C22i¼~i', 'a~ib ½/C138T¼0p/C22i¼p~i', 'ap~ib ½/C138T¼0( ð7ÞSubstituting Eq.(7)in Eq.(5), the back EMF can be obtainedas follows:0¼0þe', 'a/C0ksgnð/C22i aÞ0¼0þe', 'b/C0ksgnð/C22i bÞ/C26;ea¼ksgnð/C22i aÞe', 'b¼ksgnð/C22i bÞ/C26ð8Þ The back EMF in Eq.(8)usually contain high frequency com-ponents[19].

Design of fuzzy sliding mode observer (FSMO)The idea behind SMO is to select the switching gain so the slid-ing function ’’ksgnð/C22iÞ’’ compensate the parametric uncertain-ties keeping the observer independent of the unknownsignals during the sliding motion insuring a stable dynamicerror[5,6]. The discontinuous sign function in Eq.(4)is critical to the observer performance and needs fast switching ofmotion states, which will cause chattering[20,21]. To eliminate the chattering phenomenon in classical SMO, the ﬁxed numer-ical values of the switching function are replaced by linguisticvariables, and the switching function is calculated throughfuzzy logic system. The new Fuzzy SMO ‘‘FSMO ”will have the robustness property of SMO with sufﬁcient chatteringreduction via Fuzzy Logic System ‘‘FLS ”. The FSMO blockdiagram is depicted inFig. 1, and built as follows:L', 'sðp^iaÞ¼/C0R s^iaþV a/C0kF s', 'Lsðp^ibÞ¼/C0R s^ibþV b/C0kF s/C26 ð11Þwhere F', 's¼FSMOð/C22i;p/C22iÞð12Þ The proposed FSMO will have 49 if-then rule base, two inputvariables½/C22i;andp/C22i/C138which deﬁne the current error and its rateNomenclaturep;PIderivative operator, proportional integralV', 'a;Vbvoltages in stationary reference framei', 'a;ib measured currents in stationary reference frame^i', 'a;^ib estimated currents in stationary reference frame/C22iestimation error in current signale', 'a;eb EMFs in stationary reference frameRs;Lsphase resistance and Phase inductancew', 'f ﬂux linkagex', 'r angle speed of the rotorhposition of the rotorkobserver gain170 M.M.

The blockdiagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3. It consists of power inverter, PMSM with parameters shown in Table 1 and loading arrangement, voltage and current sensing circuits,and ﬂoating point TMS320F28069M digital controller.The controller running clock and Pulse Width Modulation‘‘PWM”switching frequency are 50 MHz and 10 kHz, respec-tively. To avoid the switching harmonics in the samples phasecurrents, the sampling frequency is selected as 10 kHz for thecurrent control loops and 1 kHz for the speed control loop.Two PI controllers are used for current, and speed control', 'Fig. 2Input MFs, and Rule base of FSMO Algorithm.', 'Fig. 1Block diagram of FSMO.Speed sensorless control of PMSM 171loop, and the tuning process of controller constants is designedto get a bandwidth of 400 HZ, and 40 HZ respectively.

Experimental resultsSeveral tests have been carried out to verify the correctness androbustness of the proposed observer.Test 1: Speed step increase', 'sreference from 10% to 100% of', 'rated speed with constant load; this test examine the steady-state performance of the proposed observer at low and high-speed, comparing its performance with the traditional SMO.Figs. 4, and5shows the experimental results for traditionalSMO, and the proposed observer respectively.The actual and estimated rotor speed for traditional SMOis shown inFig. 4a, whileFig. 4b, and c shows the waveformsof the actual and estimated rotor positions obtained for tradi-tional SMO respectively. The rotor position error is shown inFig. 4d. The average steady-state speed error is (300/4000 =7.5%) at 4000 rpm, and (55/400 = 13.7%) at 400 rpm.The actual and estimated rotor speed for FSMO is shown inFig. 5a, whileFig. 5b and c shows the waveforms of the actualand estimated rotor positions obtained for FSMO respectively.The rotor position error is shown inFig. 5d. The average steady-state speed error is (50/4000 = /C01.25%) at 4000 rpm,and (10/400 = 2.5%) at 400 rpm. It can be observed that theFSMO is accurate with sufﬁcient chattering reduction com-pared with traditional SMO.Test 2: The speed response to bipolar command from 400 rpm', 'to/C0400 rpm with constant load ; this test examines theperformance of the proposed observer at low speed bipolarcommand.

The dynamic response seems satisfactory.Test 3: Observer robustness to motor parameter', 'variation; the body temperature of a running motor increases because ofthe core loss, copper loss and mechanical frictions. As a result,the stator winding resistances increase. The main purpose ofthis test was to examine the robustness of the proposed obser-ver in case of doubling the motor resistance. This test was doneby connecting 1Xresistor in series with the stator winding,and a speed step reference from 400 rpm to 4000 rpm.Fig. 6shows the waveforms of the actual and estimatedrotor speed, actual and estimated rotor positions, and therotor position error respectively. Although position estimationerror exists, it is very small because of high rotating speed. Inthis case, about 55 rpm speed estimation errors appear at tran-sient time. But they converge to zero very quickly. Test resultsprove the good performance of the proposed observer, despiteof the variations of stator resistance, in the speed range from10% of rated speed to full one (seeFig. 7).6. ConclusionA new efﬁcient fuzzy based SMO algorithm for sensorless vec-tor control of PMSM was introduced. The chattering reduc-tion is achieved by using linguistic variables, and theswitching function is calculated through fuzzy logic system.The proposed algorithm is successfully implemented on aDSP controller, and the performance is compared to the tradi-tional SMO. Experimental results prove that the proposedFSMO has sufﬁcient chattering reduction along with a goodestimation accuracy, and high immunity to the motorparameter’s variations.

Proposed Method Recently, the university research in the area of processing web pages for creation short web documents focuses on the analysis of text segments around images. Research in image processing is currently at a high level, would have been wrong not to use this fact to creation short web document. Our proposed method is based on existing systems, which are described in previous section. In this system we put the emphasis on the minimization or elimination of potential deficienci es (see Tab. 1). The proposed method allows an automatic processing of various components of web pages. The system architecture called Semantic Inclusion of Image using Textual segments is shown in Fig. 1.

Experimental Results In this section, the proposed method for creating a short web document is presented. The experiment has been done on Caltech 101 image database and 100 offlin e web documents. The proposed approach using programming languages JAVA and MATLAB was implemented. The process of creation short web document: xAutomatic extraction of web objects xAnalysis of images xSemantic inclusion of web objects 3.1.', 'Automatic extraction of the main web objects Identify the main block to the desired web document content using the Document Object Model [5] is now possible in several ways. As principal, we can mention: xKnown name identifier element: (for exampl', 'e <div id=\"main_block\">) xCounter signs xCounter sentences In ', 'practice we identifier element and simple character counter not work. The amount of Web documents in question contained multiple blocks with more than 500 characters. Dynamic sites is a long text strings used to create the drop-down menu or similar interactive blocks, from  one point in the chain is presented as part of using JavaScript as moving text or list. In this case is preferable to use a natural language description to distinguish the relevant text from the auxiliary strings. Instead of a single counter of characters or a word that has the same drawbacks, we chose counter full sentences. In natural language, we assume the characteristics of structure of sentences - each sentence is followed by a terminating punctuation character of the preceding sentence (period, question mark, exclamation mark) and a space. Observation, we found that the vast majority of normal cells do not use the terminating question mark or exclamation sentences to the extent that it affected the identification of the main article. Therefore we use as a rule separating the new sentence string \"dot + loophole.\" After reading a text document, test the contents of each element of the number of sentences that rule. The relevant content will be such a text block that contains at least 5 sentences. Elements that hide the appropriate text with relevant content are also tested for the presence of images. We assume that the images associated with text can be found in these blocks. If confirmed their presence, their extraction algorithm ensures together with the text. To identify the main text in the form of a flowchart is shown in Fig. 2.  34   Martina Zachariasova et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  31 – 36 ', 'Fig.2. Workflow for web article extraction pipeline ', 'For comparison, the counter of characters was used. This part of the algorithm was implemented in the JAVA programming language. First, all spaces from the input document using counter were removed. Subsequently, all the characters of text in application were counted.  The proposed algorithm on selected sample of documents has been tested. The overall efficiency for text extraction was 88.99%. Extraction of the images depends on the identification of the main block of the document therefore follows the success of the state of text extraction. 3.2. Analysis of images In this section the extracted images were processed. The main goal of this step was obtained automatic semantic description of static images. This description is important for matching objects of web document. The overall procedure of automatic semantic description of image is shown in Fig. 1. The basic steps of automatic semantic description can be divided into the following steps: xLoading extracted images xLoading SVM model xDivision of the i', 'mage into segments xFeature extraction using SIFT', ' method xFind the closest conformity between extracted descriptors and SVM model xThe output of the analysis of images is a semantic description of objects ', '0510152025303540', '12345', 'Fig.3. General schematic diagram for analysis of image ', 'Firstly, we loaded of extracted images and SVM m odel. In the next phase, we defined number of segments for segmentation images using K-means [6]. The extrac ted images from web pages contains only three segments (e.i. water, tree, sky, ...). For each input imag e we set three segments using K-Means. Next, we used 35  Martina Zachariasova et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  31 – 36 ', 'filter for holes filling in the binary segment into image. A hole is a set of background  pixels that cannot be reached by filling in the background from the edge of the image.   In the third phase, features from segments using SIFT descriptors was extracted. These descriptors by threshold 5 or 8 pixels have been modified. This threshold was selected on the basis of previous publications [7]. In the test image, the vector length than eight pi xels is not obtained. For this reason, the threshold greater than eight will not be used.  In the following phase, we classify extraction of features using SVM models. Models contain 9 classes. Every extraction feature of segment was evaluated and description was allocated by using SVM model. In the last phase of our experimental part, description of image was assigned (shown in Fig. 3). 3.3. Semantic inclusion of web objects Finally, an algorithm for semantic inclusion of web object s was proposed. Semantic inclusion is based on description of extracted images. The textual segments of the web page are searched and extracted. The sentences, which contents identical words description are extracted into short web document. Then, the image with the sentences which have same index as the descriptio n were associated. The general block diagram for semantic inclusion is shown in Fig. 4. ', '+', '+', '+', 'Fig.4. Block diagram for semantic inclusion of textual and non-textual objects ', 'Design of algorithm for semantic inclusion of we b objects is based on three steps. Firstly, descriptions of image and textual segments were loaded. Secondly, linguistics analysis of textual segments was made. Finally, all experimental results are displayed. The main part  of semantic inclusion is linguistics analysis of textual segments. It is consists of three parts (lexical analysis, morphological analysis, syntactic analysis). The all words whose l', 'ength is less than three phonemes using lexical analysis are removed. The complexity of the Slovak language is main reason for setting this value. This is mainly due to fact that in the Slovak language different prepositions are used. Furthermore, in lexical analysis the frequency of sentences with the identical words are counted. These words are identical to the description. Finally, the total number of words in sentences that were extracted as relevant text was counte d. Morphological analysis of text segments is based on the creation of word-formation base of words an d phrases analysis. The average number of words and length of sentences was counted. In the last step, duplicate sentences in syntactic analysis were reduced. The experiments have been done on 100 Web documents. The best results for threshold 8 pixels were achieved (79.59%).  36   Martina Zachariasova et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  31 – 36 ', '4. Conclusion Growing amount of web documents leads to necessity of effective system management for automatic annotation the web pages based on semantic inclusion image and text. The best results for 8 pixels are achieved. The accuracy for creating short web documents was 79.59 %. The proposed method is based on SII', 'T (see Fig. 1). The input is original web page and the output is modified web page. As can be seen, only one abstract was created. Namely image, which was into the main of block text. Other images for extracting information from a Web document were unwanted (contain links to other websites). The text from the main body of the web page was extracted and the banners or navigation menu were removed. Only relevant text for an abstract was used. Since the original image - text abstract contained text segment less than 60 words, morphological analysis was performed. For the better visualization of text segments a different color marking was used (see Fig. 1). In future work, a semantic map will be implemented. This map should help with more accurately description of non-textual information and improve accura cy of the animal’s description in the image. Based on the recognition efficiency of image objects, it could be assumed, th at the presented classification is sufficient for e', ' vidence of animal presence in the vicinity of a road, and for the  corridors build-up.

Amongst renewable energy sources, sea wave energy is definitely the one that has been less utilised.  This is probably caused by two reasons: i) the strong technica l novelties that are required to extract the energy that is contained in a highly and stochastically variable motion; ii) th e difficulty o find a suitable electrical system able to convert  the energy contained in the motion of the sea into electrical energy. In this paper we propose an approach to set up a general methodology toward the design of a seawave farm.

Franzitta et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   2  ( 2012 )  223 – 228 ', ' To generate a substantial amount of power, Wave  Energy Converters have been proposed. Several solutions have been discussed, some consider a single en ergy absorber others consider several abosrbing unit. In this case, the absorbing units are arranged in several rowsor in a farm.Such units may generate 10–100 [kW] depending on their size and wave spectrum. A larg er buoy may absorb more energy but a too large buoy will not rise, only sways.[7] This stage converts the mechanical energy contained in  the waves into a more usable mechanical energy; it can be a hydraulic coupling device or a mechanical gear  and, in any case, introduces additional losses and additional maintenance requirements. In order to reduce  these losses a generator directly coupled to the sea waves should be used. Linear electrical generator has been recently studied for the exploitation of sea wave energy. Most of these projects considers mechanical conv erters in MWs scale and therefore not very suitable for a sea like Mediterranean sea where the energy density is lower than in the ocean. Moreover a general methodology to design a seawave power farm has not been fully established. In this paper we discuss an approach to design a seawav e farm through a case study. This case is located in north west part of sicily. 2. Description of the proposed design approach The first step to approach  the general design of a seawave farm is the choice of the converter. In order to perform  this task one must consider the characteristics (i n terms of waves, sea depth, currents etc) of the area where the generator will be located. In the case under study the waves are not very high (as it is shown in a following section we are in the mediterranean sea) as a result one must use a converter that is able to exploit  such a limited source. It can be seen that in this case the best solution is represented by a  conversion system has the structure of fig.1. Other conversion topologies  can be realized but the one of fig.1 captures the essential features of the most of conversion systems.            ', 'Fig. 1. Schematic description of conversion system based on PM linear generator ', 'In this device the slider of the PM linear generator is driven from a buoyant (that is rigidly connected to the slider) and counteracted by a spring. The generated emf is produced from the motion of the vertical level of the sea. The typical frequency of sea waves is in the range of the tenth of Hz and as a result a machine with a high number of poles is needed in order to obtain an output whose average frequency is in a range that is easily convertible. The choice of the technology is the input for the design of the farm, which is split in 8 steps. The first step deals with the site evaluation and prep aration: the characteristics of waves are measured and are used to chose the detailed design of the converter to be used and th e preparation which are needed in the installation area.  ', '225  V . Franzitta et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   2  ( 2012 )  223 – 228 ', ' In the second step, the mechanical installation requirem ents are specified and the mechanical drawing of the installation  are specified.  In the third step the level of low voltage is chosen. In the fourth section the distribution equipment to be used is identified. In this section a discussion on the maintenance strategy to be used in the farm is given. In section fifth and sixth losses and voltage drop and power quality are calculated.  In this section the energy requirements needed are calculated. The evaluation of section 4, 5 and 6 are used in section 7 to design the protective relays to be used in  the farm. Finally, in section 8 a business plan of the plant is presented. Following the above outlined steps, a power farm has been designed and its size has been chosen in order to maximize the energy extraction in the waters of west  Sicily. The data used to optimize the converter and the farm are some experimental data on the energy density of seawes on a point located on the north west part of Sicily in the middle of Mediterranean sea. The nu merical results and optimization of this procedure is illustrated in this paper[1]. 3. Generator structure and interconnection scheme The design approach above outlined has led to design a power farm based on several low power units electrically interconnected.  The parameters of the first prototype are shown in the following table: ', 'Table 1.Characteristics of the PM generator obtained ', 'Geometric Parameter Value ', 'Pole pitch [mm] 150 ', 'Slot height 70 ', 'Number of phases 1/3 ', 'Number of slots per pole per phase 3/1 ', 'Stator slot width [mm] 12.5 ', 'Tooth height [mm] 12.5 ', 'Stator yoke height [mm] 60 ', 'Length of the magnet [mm] 50 ', 'The prototype has been manufactured and is shown in fig.2.

Franzitta et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   2  ( 2012 )  223 – 228 ', '   ', ' Fig.3 Interconnection schemes The converter were simulated by assuming a standard nu merical model of the inverter. The parameters that we have considered is the ripple in dc link, the time of  use of each inverter the continuity of the generation. The simulation was run many times and in each run each generator was exposed to a set of waveform generated as illustrated. Each generator had the characteristics of the one reported above. In fig. 4 the ripples of the dc link for the two approach es are compared. In fig. 4 the voltage ripple of the dc link of the centralized approach is compared to the ty pical voltage ripple of a single generic converter in the case of the decentralized approach.  It can be clearly se en that in all respects the partially centralized approach guarantees a more reliable and efficient operating cond ition. Moreover, the requirement on the buffer capacitance are less tight because the dc link continuous ly receives power from some generators of the farm and, therefore, its voltage is more easily kept at the value required to generate power in optimum condition. As far as the use of each inverter is concerned, in the partially centralized approach the inverter is used constantly even if the energy carried by the seawaves is small, for the decentralized approach the inverter are used discontinuously and for a percentage of time lowe r than 50 %. The continuity and the smoothness of the generation is enormously higher in  the partially cent ralized approach. This is due to the fact that a common dc link can have a higher buffer capacitance and therefor e it is much more stable than a dc link connected to a single generator.

That will be used to produce electricity through a fuel cell. 5. Conclusions In this paper we present an approach to the design of  seawave power farm. The generators used in the farm are Permanent Magnet (PM) linear generators driven by  the seawavesand, therefore, they generate highly distorted emfs. We propose and compare two possible ways  to connect the generator to the grid. One is a decentralized approach where for each generator there is a conversion subsystem that permits the direct connection of the generator to the a.c. grid, the other one is based on partially centralized approach where an a.c.-d.c. rectifier is connected  to the generator and the rectifier outputs is pumped into a dc link that can receive the power from other units and that can supply a dc-ac converter directly connected to the power grid. We compare the performances of the two approaches in terms of ripple of the dc link voltage, the time of use of each inverter and the continuity of the generation and we show that the partially centralized approach is definitely more efficient and reliable of the centralized approach.

IntroductionProviding higher-speed data transmission has always been themost concerned objective of the 4th generation of mobile commu-nication standards. That is why these standards have constantlybeen suffering from prohibitive cost, splintering of technologystandards and lack of user interest. Evolved UMTS Terrestrial RadioAccess Network (E-UTRAN) is one of the 4th generation mobilecommunication standards for mobile communications introducedby 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [1]. Unlike 3rd gen- eration standards which use CDMA technique, LTE makes use ofOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for downlinkand Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA)for uplink transmission. It has a very ﬂexible radio interface, andits core network is called System Architecture Evolution (SAE) orEvolved Packed Core (EPC). The most serious rival for LTE standardis the IEEE 802.16e standard, which is well-known as WiMAX andwas developed by IEEE[2,3].2. Overview of 3GPP LTE2.1. System architectureLTE came up with a new network architecture called SAE. SAEarchitecture consists of two main parts: EPC and E-UTRAN(Fig. 1). These two parts together form a system called EvolvedPacket System (EPS). EPS routes the IP packets with a given QoS,from Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW) to User Equipment(UE). E-UTRAN manages the radio resources and makes sure ofthe security of transmitted data[4]. E-UTRAN entirely consists of base stations only, which are connected to the UEs providing net-work air interface roles. E-UTRAN architecture is ﬂat, thus there isno centralized controlling in E-UTRAN [5]. E-UTRAN and EPC net- work components are connected together via standard interfaces[6].The EPC enables commuting data packets with the internet aswell as UE while a given QoS is maintained. EPC includes HomeSubscriber Service (HSS), Policy Control and Charging Rules Func-tion (PCRF), Mobility Management Entity (MME), P-GW and Serv-ing Gateway (S-GW).2.2. Protocol architecture of LTE physical layerFig. 2illustrates the physical layer protocol architecturebetween LTE network and UE.

Multiple access techniquesThe downlink transmission utilizes a multiple access schemebased on OFDM with a Cyclic Preﬁx (CP) while the uplink transmis-sion uses a scheme based on SC-FDMA with a CP [9]. Since OFDM allows us to avoid Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), transmission ofhigh-speed serial streams is highly possible. The LTE supportstransmission on a dedicated carrier for Multicast/Broadcast overa Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) [10,11]by utilizing a longer CP with a subcarrier spacing of 7.5 kHz. MIMO techniques areemployed in LTE[12]. LTE also maintains aggregation of multiplecells in both uplink and downlink directions with up to ﬁve servingcells, where each serving cell can have a transmission bandwidthof up to 20 MHz.2.4. Physical resource allocationsThe LTE physical layer supports two types of frame structures astypes 1 and 2. The type 1 structure ( Fig. 3) is used for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode; however, the type 2 structure(Fig. 4) is applied to Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode maintainingonly full duplex operation. Type 1 lasts 10 ms equivalent to 10 sub-frames (each 1 ms long) or 20 slots (each 0.5 ms long). As in FDD,each frame consists of 10 subframes of 1 ms long and each sub-frame consists of two concatenated slots of 0.5 ms long. The radioframe used in TDD mode (type 2) also has a length of 10 ms, but itis divided to two half-frames of length 5 ms.

Performance evaluation Of LTE physical layer3.1. Link level simulatorWe have utilized only the Link Level simulation ( Fig. 7) for downlink transmissions[13–15]. In LTE, the transmission processstarts when user data is generated and tailed with Cyclic Redun-dancy Check (CRC)[16]. In next step, each user’s data is encodedindependently using a turbo encoder. Then each coded block isinterleaved and rate-matched to achieve the target rate, and thenmodulated based on the received Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)feedback value[17]. The possible modulation schemes are 4-QAM, 16-QAM, and 64QAM.The User Equipment absorbs the signal transmitted by theevolved Node Base (eNodeB) and performs the reverse processingmade by the transmitter. The receiver in UE then provides the nec-essary information (Fig. 7).3.2. LTE physical layer modulationAdaptive modulation and coding, support of MIMO systems andHARQ are the key features of the LTE downlink. The modulationschemes speciﬁed in[13]for downlink transmission are 16-QAM,64-QAM, BPSK, and QPSK.3.3. LTE downlink physical channel processingIn LTE, data and control information are encoded down from theMAC to the physical layer and decoded back from physical to MAClayer to serve transport and control Channels. Once the channelcoding is performed, its output will be kept in a circular bufferwhere Redundancy Versions (RVs) are constituted. An RV is consid-ered as the retransmission unit in the Hybrid Automatic Repeatrequest (HARQ) technique, and maximum 4 of them are permittedto be used in LTE.The signal processing is shown inFig. 8. First, the coded bits in every codeword are scrambled and conveyed to physical channels.The next step is to map these complex-valued modulated symbolsinto one or few transferring layers. Once the layer mapping is done,the process of precoding of modulated symbols on each layer willbe started and the output will be conveyed to the antenna ports.The precoded symbols for each antenna port are then mapped intoresource elements, and eventually, generation of time-domainOFDM signal for every single antenna port takes place. At the UE,to detect the transmitted signal and discover the original data, aTable 2Resource Block Parameters.', 'Normal Extended Cyclic PreﬁxSubcarrier Subcarrier SubcarrierSpacing: Spacing: Spacing:15 kHz 15 kHz 7.5 kHzUplink N', 'ULsymb 76–N', 'RBSC 12 12 – Downlink N', 'DLsymb 763N', 'RBSC 12 12 24Table 1Resource Block Conﬁgurations [13].', 'CHANNEL 1.4 3 5 10 15 20Number of RBs 6 15 25 50 75 100', 'Table 3Physical Channels.', 'Physical Layer TransmissionPBCH Physical Broadcast Channel DownlinkPMCH Physical Multicast Channel DownlinkPDCCH Physical Downlink Control Channel DownlinkPUCCH Physical Uplink Control Channel UplinkPDSCH Physical Downlink Share Control Channel DownlinkPUSCH Physical Uplink Share Control Channel UplinkPCFICH Physical Control Format Indicator Channel DownlinkPHAICH Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel DownlinkPRACH Physical Random Access Channel Uplink', 'Fig. 7.LTE link level simulator structure [15].36 H.

The receiver mustsend requests for up to 3 retransmissions of redundancy versionto the transmitter.3.4. Channel Coding, Interleaving and rate matchingThe turbo encoder used in LTE consists of two convolutionalconcatenated encoders that are connected by an interleaver. Thecode rate of turbo coder used in the LTE is 1/3 and its two gener-ated polynomials are G0 = [1011] and G1 = [1101]. From two can-didates as Quadratic Permutation Polynomial (QPP) and AlmostRegular Permutation (ARP), QPP was selected to improve the max-imum throughput of the system. This interleaver is a conﬂict-freeparallel turbo coder and provides maximum ﬂexibility in support-ing the parallelism. In LTE, the value for QPP inverse polynomialinterleaver is 4. From the 1/3 rate output of the turbo coder, RateMatching (RM) algorithm selects bits for transmission via punctur-ing or repeating. In rate matching, the bits in the code block arepunctured and repeated to achieve a desired Effective Code Rate(ECR).4. Performance evaluation metricsThe LTE Link Level Simulator has key features such as the Adap-tive Modulation and Coding (AMC). It consists of few functionalsections, which are one eNodeB (transmitter), N number of UEs(receivers), a downlink channel model, signaling information, andan error-free uplink feedback channel with adjustable delay. Acomplete set of physical layer variables can be modiﬁed in the sim-ulator. The eNodeB can estimate the code rate and modulationscheme by using the Sounding Reference Signal (SRS). Refs. [18– 22]have presented the physical layer throughput as 100 Mbps,150 Mbps and 300 Mbps for 1, 2 and 4 antenna ports respectively.Based on bandwidth of 1.4–20 MHz, the number of antenna ports(1, 2, or 4), the number of OFDM symbols assigned for PDCCH (1,2, or 3 symbols per subframe), different channel code rates(0.0762–0.9258) and modulation schemes (4-QAM, 16-QAM, or64-QAM), different system throughput performance as well asBER and BLER performances were obtained. The MIMO systemmodels are described in detail in[23–26]. The input of this simula- tor is 500 subframes with random transmitting data selected bythe simulator itself. For the results of this downlink simulation,average values of throughput, BER, and BLER vs. average valuesof SNR are calculated and plotted in form of MATLAB ﬁgures.5. Results and discussion5.1. Simulation parametersBesides PDSCH, there are other physical channels (e.g. PBCH,PDCCH, and PMCH); however, this information is mainly controland broadcast information.Table 4summarizes the simulation parameters and depicts those conﬁgured for the simulation work.We have considered stable user equipment’s, channel band-width of 1.4 MHz, channel type of AWGN with the ideal channelestimator (Perfect), CQI = 9, 8 turbo code iterations, and 3 HARQretransmissions for simulation.5.2. SISO techniquesSISO or Single-Input and Single-Output technique is a wirelesscommunications system in which the only one transmit antennais used at the transmitter and only one receive antenna is usedat the receiver to carry out the transmission.5.2.1. Performance analysis of different CQI numbersInFig. 9the BER curves for different CQI feedback values andmodulation schemes are presented under different channel condi-tions (Channel SNR). It can be seen from the ﬁgure that for channelSNR values lower than/C05 dB, the CQI = 1, which used 4-QAM mod-ulation scheme and ECR of 0.0762, has the lowest error rate, thusthe best transmission quality. Lower order modulation schemeshave lower data rates as the number of bits per symbol is less. Itresults in increasing the symbol pulse-width thus decreasing signalbandwidth and a better BER performance.However, in the case of increasing channel SNR, CQI = 9, whichutilizes 16-QAM modulation scheme and ECR = 0.6016 appears toTable 4Simulation parameters.', 'Parameter Value (s)Channel Bandwidth 1, 4, 3, 5, 10 MHzChannel Type AWGN, PedB, VehB, Flat RayleighFEC Coding Scheme Turbo Coding, Rate = 1/3Modulation Scheme 4-QAM, 16-QAM, 64-QAMFrame Period 10 msSubcarrier Spacing 15 kHzCyclic Preﬁx NormalCode Rate 0.0762 to 0.9258Antenna Diversity SISO, MIMO 2 /C21, MIMO 2/C22, MIMO 4/C22, OLSM 4/C22 Number of Turbo CodeIterations1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 20Number of CQI feedbacks 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15Number of HARQretransmissionsNo HARQ, 3 HARQChannel Estimators Perfect, LS, MMSEMaximum User Speed 100 km/hNumber of Subframes 500', 'Fig. 9.BER vs. SNR for different CQI Values, SISO.', 'Fig. 8.Physical channel processing [13].H.

This is because of using very effective errorprotection level (ECR = 0.6016) associated with the modulationscheme for this CQI feedback. Decreasing of the error rate is per-formed by applying a better ECR and a better Cyclic RedundancyCheck (CRC) scheme.Table 5shows the CQI user feedback conﬁg-uration of the LTE downlink simulator.5.2.2. Performance analysis of different channel typesInFig. 11, the BER performance of AWGN, Pedestrian B (PedB)and Flat Rayleigh, is investigated. In terms of error rate, the AWGNchannel provides the lowest error at low channel SNR values, as theBER¼10', '/C06is achieved at the channel SNR = 8 dB. However, PedBand Flat Rayleigh channel models result in poorer BER perfor-mances in comparison with AWGN. The PedB channel results in abetter BER performance than the Flat Rayleigh channel. But, inthe Flat Rayleigh channel, the signal is corrupted more severe thanin the PedB channel.FromFig. 12, the throughput performance of AWGN channel isbetter than the performance of both PedB and Flat Rayleigh chan-nels. This channel results in throughput improvement to higherthan 2 Mbit/s at the channel SNR = 8 dB; however, the throughputof the system experiencing PedB or Flat Rayleigh channels can beimproved to higher than 2 Mbit/s at the SNR = 20 dB, which is12 dB higher than that of AWGN channel.5.2.3. Performance analysis for different turbo code iterationsThe BER and BLER performances are shown in Figs. 13 and 14 respectively. At turbo decoder, data decoding function is iterateduntil the decoder maximum iteration number is reached. Aftereach iteration, the output of turbo decoder is stored and later usedas an input parameter for the next decoding iteration helping thedecoder to make a better decision. Thus, by increasing the numberof turbo decoder iterations the BER performance of the system canbe improved, as inFig. 13at the 8th iteration, a BER of 10', '/C06can be achieved at the channel SNR = 8 dB.Fig. 14illustrates that the SNR improvement gap between 1stand 3rd iterations is much larger than the SNR improvementbetween 3rd and 5th iterations.', 'Fig. 10.Throughput vs. SNR for different CQI values, SISO.', 'Table 5At low channel SNRs, higher CQI feedback values will have poor BER performancethan the lower CQI feedback values. However, by increasing the signal power, lowererror ratio for higher CQI feedback values can be achieved.

Mousavi et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 34–44InFig. 15the throughput performance improvement betweenlow iteration numbers is much larger than the throughput perfor-mance improvement between high iteration numbers.5.2.4. Performance analysis of different HARQ retransmissionsFrom theFigs. 16 and 17, by increasing the number of HARQretransmissions the system BER and BLER are decreased. This isbecause when a packet is found to be in error for the ﬁrst time,up to 3 retransmission requests are sent toward the transmitterwhile the corrupted packet at the receiver is ignored. For SNR val-ues 0–8 dB the 3 HARQ retransmissions technique improves thesystem BER performance moderately better than no HARQ retrans-missions technique. But, at the expenses of increasing SNR to 9 dB,both methods perform alike. Therefore, there is no point of usingHARQ retransmissions technique for high channel SNR values.InFig. 18, at low channel SNR values, a signiﬁcant differencebetween no HARQ and 3 HARQ retransmission schemes can beseen. This is since the 3 HARQ retransmissions technique canrequest data retransmissions for up to 3 times.5.2.5. Performance analysis of different channel estimationsInFig. 19the system’s BER improvement uses the Perfect orMinimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), with a comparison to theLeast Squares (LS). However, in the MMSE channel estimator, itrequires the second-order statistics of the channel and the noise,and it makes the MMSE channel estimator much more accuratethan the LS. As at the channel SNR of 8 dB, by utilizing the MMSEchannel estimator or the Perfect channel estimator a BER close to10', '/C06can be achieved. However, choosing the LS algorithm as thechannel estimator can only give a BER close to 10', '/C06at the expense of a higher channel SNR value which is 10 dB.Fig. 20shows the throughput performance of Perfect, MMSEand LS channel estimators, where the SNR improvement of theMMSE channel estimator in comparison to the LS channel estima-tor is approximately 2 dB. While a system using the MMSE channelestimator performs only about 0.5 dB worse than a system withperfect channel knowledge.5.2.6. Performance analysis of different user speedsFigs. 21 and 22present the BER and throughput performancesof the LTE physical layer respectively, while AWGN channel wassimulated to associate a ﬁxed user, and PedB and Flat Rayleighchannels associate users with 10 km/h and 100 km/h of velocity', 'Fig. 13.BER vs. SNR for different turbo code iterations, SISO.', 'Fig. 14.BLER vs. SNR for different turbo code iterations, SISO.', 'Fig. 15.Throughput vs. SNR for different turbo code iterations, SISO.', ' Fig. 16.BER vs. SNR for different number of HARQ retransmissions, SISO.H. Mousavi et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 34–44 39respectively. If the SNR is low, the AWGN channel results in thebest BER performance. As the UE experiencing this channel condi-tion, we can achieve data with the BER ¼10', '/C06at the SNR = 8 dB. While, in case of PedB channel associating a user with 10 km/hvelocity, as well as the Flat Rayleigh channel associating a userwith 100 km/h velocity, since the UEs experience the small-scalefading channel type (PedB and Flat Rayleigh). Comparing theFigs. 21 and 22withFigs. 11 and 12, the LTE standard is not sensi- tive to user mobility and user velocity, as the performances of thechannels tested in both with user mobility and without user mobil-ity scenarios are very similar.5.3. MIMO techniquesIn LTE, the MIMO technique with the possibility of up to eighttransmit antennas and eight receive antennas in downlink, andup to four transmit antennas and four receive antennas in uplinkdirection are supported. This feature allows transmitting up toeight streams of multi-layer in downlink and up to four multi-layer streams in uplink.', 'Fig. 17.BLER vs. SNR for different number of HARQ retransmissions, SISO.', 'Fig. 18.Throughputs vs. SNR for different HARQ retransmissions, SISO.', 'Fig. 19.BER vs. SNR for diverse types of channel estimators, SISO.', 'Fig. 20.Throughput vs. SNR for diverse types of channel estimators, SISO.', 'Fig. 21.BER vs. SNR for different user speeds, SISO.40 H. Mousavi et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 34–445.3.1. Performance analysis of different CQI numbersWe analyze the impact of a different number of CQI feedbackson a MIMO TxD 4/C22 system in the LTE standard. InFig. 23, the CQI number results in an increase of required SNR value to helpkeep the BER value at a desired value. Thus, to achieve a low BERvalue while increasing the quantity of CQI feedbacks, a penalty ofenhancing SNR must be paid. Since higher CQI values indicatehigher modulation orders and higher ECRs, thus higher bit rate istransferred, which causes increasing the signal bandwidth andoverlapping. So, we see that at low channel SNRs, higher CQI feed-back values will have worse BER performances than the lower CQIfeedback values.InFig. 24, the increasing CQI numbers result in better through-put performance. Since higher CQI feedback numbers indicatehigher modulation orders and higher ECRs; hence, higher data rateand thus higher throughput can be achieved, but it requires anincrease of signal power. Therefore, a trade-off between higherCQI numbers and lower SNR values should be made to design adesirable system.5.3.2. Performance analysis of different channel typesInFigs. 25 and 26, BER and BLER performances of four channeltypes, namely; AWGN, PedB, VehicularB (VehB) and Flat Rayleighare shown using a MIMO TxD 4x2 technique. If low SNR value isdesired, the AWGN channel performs the best among all four chan-nels in terms of error performance. As the system using AWGNchannel can approach the BER¼10', '/C02at SNR lower than 6 dB. However, PedB, VehB, and Flat Rayleigh channel models whichare small-scale fading channel types, perform much worse thanthe AWGN in terms of the error performance. In Flat Rayleighchannel, the signal is corrupted more severe than in the PedBand VehB channels.InFig. 27, AWGN channel type results in better performance incomparison with VehB and Flat Rayleigh channels. The PedB chan-nel has better throughput performance than both the VehB channeland the Flat Rayleigh channel. In the Flat Rayleigh channel, the sig-nal is corrupted more severe than in the PedB and VehB channels,since the Rayleigh fades is added to the Flat fades, and the signalalso suffers from Non-Line-of-Sight propagation in multipathfading.', 'Fig. 22.Throughputs vs. SNR for different user speeds, SISO.', 'Fig. 23.BER vs. SNR for different CQIs, MIMO.', 'Fig. 24.Throughput vs. SNR for different CQIs, MIMO 4 /C22.', 'Fig. 25.BER vs. SNR for different channel types, MIMO 4 /C22.H.

As, in the case of the BER ¼10', '/C02', 'desired, utilizing SU-MIMO TxD 4/C22 and SU-MIMO TxD 2/C22 techniques result in 3 dB SNR gain in comparison with other tech-niques. This improvement is due to the increase of the number ofthe receive antenna, as when using two receive antenna insteadof one the variance of the noise term is scaled by a factor of 2. Fig- ure 28.

Mousavi et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 34–44throughput to approximately twice the maximum throughput ofother systems. The maximum throughput achieved by SU-MIMOTxD 4/C22 technique is lower than the maximum throughputachieved by two SU-MIMO TxD 2x1 and SU-MIMO TxD 2 /C22 techniques.5.3.4. Performance analysis of different channel bandwidthsInFig. 31, BER performance of few channel bandwidths(1.4 MHz, 3 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz) on an SU-MIMO TxD 2 /C21 LTE system is presented, where the BER difference between differ-ent channel bandwidths is insigniﬁcant. This is due to taking theadvantage of OFDM technique in downlink transmission, whichresults in decreasing ISI in high data rates. In addition to OFDMtechnique, using turbo coding, interleaver, and HARQ retransmis-sions help to keep the system BER at low levels.By analyzingFig. 32, increasing the transmission bandwidthresults in increasing the system throughput dramatically. Highersystem throughput can be obtained by utilizing larger channelbandwidths in the scenario.6. ConclusionThis study focused on the main parameters of LTE physical layeras well as the most frequent scenarios for mobile communications.Several techniques and technologies such as OFDM, OFDMA, SC-FDMA, and MIMO for the cellular systems were studied using aLink Level Simulator based on MATLAB program.A reduction of system BER and BLER can be achieved in LTEdownlink transmission. The effects of different numbers of HARQretransmissions and turbo code iterations were investigated forSISO mode. Different user speeds were simulated and analyzed interms of BER, BLER, and throughput in SISO systems, where MMSEchannel estimator has a much better consequence on transmissionthan the LS channel estimator. A system experiencing AWGN chan-nel condition results in a signiﬁcant BER and throughput improve-ment compared to systems involving with PedB, VehB or FlatRayleigh channel types. The system involving with PedB channelresults in a better performance. In MIMO systems, increasing thesystem bandwidth is a very effective way, but this solution obvi-ously is signiﬁcantly costly for service providers. Moreover, evalu-ation of physical layer throughput can be performed for nextRelease(s) of 3GPP, since some effective modern technologies suchas bandwidth extension up to 100 MHz and supporting moreantenna ports can highly impact the performance.References[1]X.

IntroductionComputer vision has attracted attention because of its applications inautomated driving, video surveillance, anomaly detection, etc. In addi-tion, the advent of deep learning has led to signi ﬁcant developments in computer vision. One of the typical tasks in this ﬁeld is object detection. In object detection, objects in an input image are classi ﬁed, and then, localized using bounding boxes. Recent studies in this area have achievedremarkable results based on advancements in deep neural networks.Object detectors can be categorized as two-stage [ 1–3] or one-stage [4–7]. One-stage detectors are superior in terms of their inference speed.Deep-learning-based object detectors are typically trained from adataset that has many real-world images with instance-label annotations,such as Pascal visual object classes (VOC) [ 8]. However, the performance often decreases signiﬁcantly when the training and test data havedifferent distributions. One possible solution is to collect labeled data fora new domain, although this is a time-consuming approach. Anothersolution is domain adaptation. The goal of domain adaptation is to adapta model from a label-rich domain (source domain) to a label-scarcedomain (target domain). In particular, unsupervised domain adaptationassumes that there are no labels available in the target domain.Unsupervised domain adaptation methods focused on visual tasks canbe divided into four categories: discrepancy-based, adversarial discrim-inative, adversarial generative, and self-supervision-based methods [ 9]. Discrepancy-based methods are designed to reduce the difference be-tween the source and target domain distributions [ 10,11]. Adversarial discriminative methods are designed to align features using the adver-sarial learning of feature extractors and domain classi ﬁers [12,13]. Adversarial generative methods use target-like images with originalsource annotations obtained from image-to-image translations [ 14–16]. Self-supervision-based methods incorporate a self-supervised learningtask in the target domain [17–19].For two-stage detectors, domain adaptation approaches are mainlybased on adversarial discriminative methods. They are often designed toalign features at several levels, and have been improved in variousmanners. For example, image- and instance-level alignments have beenused in Ref. [20]. However, it is difﬁcult to assume such an approach in one-stage detectors, predicting bounding boxes and object classesconcurrently.For one-stage detectors, the authors of [ 16] proposed a domain', '* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses:fujisan8@chiba-u.jp(K.

With DT, images with instance-level an-notations are transferred from the source domain to the target domain.Under an unsupervised setting, the authors of [ 19] proposed weak self-training (WST) based on self-supervision-based methods. WST en-ables the training of unlabeled images, by reducing the negative effects ofinaccurate pseudo-labels. However, the performances of these domainadaptation methods for one-stage detectors are insuf ﬁcient compared with those for two-stage detectors.Among the four categories of domain adaptation, adversarial gener-ative and self-supervision-based methods can be easily applied to one-stage detectors. Moreover, these two methods have different advan-tages. An adversarial generative method can access accurate source la-bels; meanwhile, a self-supervision-based method can use the originaltarget images. To take advantage of both methods, we propose an un-supervised domain adaptation method that combines an adversarialgenerative method with a self-supervision-based method. For eachmethod, we use DT and WST, which have been shown to be effective forone-stage detectors [16,19]. We show that the two components com-plement each other, thereby improving the detection performance.In summary, our main contributions are as follows.●We propose an unsupervised domain adaptation approach for one-stage detectors. Our method consists of an adversarial generativemethod and a self-supervision-based method.●We show that an adversarial generative method and a self-supervision-based method complement each other.●The proposed method achieves an improvement in the mean averageprecision on three benchmark datasets.2. Related workIn this section, we review the literature on object detection anddomain adaptation.2.1. Object detectionThe development of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) hasimproved the performance of object detection. Two-stage detectors (suchas R-CNN [1], Fast R-CNN [2], and Faster R-CNN [3]) extract region proposals, and then, classify them. One of the advantages of the two-stagedetectors is that the classiﬁer can be customized to suit a speciﬁc task [21]. In contrast, one-stage detectors, such as You Only Look Once(YOLO) [4] and Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) [ 5], achieve sig- niﬁcant improvements in the inference speed using a single-stagenetwork. Furthermore, recent studies [ 6,7] have improved both the ac- curacy and inference speed.In this study, we tested our method on an SSD, which is a represen-tative one-stage detector. SSD has a simple architecture, and is wellbalanced in terms of inference speed and performance. Furthermore,because SSD has been used in related studies [ 16,19], we can make a fair comparison.2.2. Domain adaptationThe goal of domain adaptation is to adapt the information learnedfrom the source domain for use in the target domain. The authors of [ 9] divided unsupervised domain adaptation methods for visual tasks intofour categories: discrepancy-based methods, adversarial discriminativemethods, adversarial generative methods, and self-supervision-basedmethods.Discrepancy-based methods [10,11] manage to reduce the discrep- ancy between the feature distributions of the source and target domains.Adversarial discriminative methods [ 12', ',13] employ adversarial learning to align features. Discrepancy-based methods and adversarial discrimi-native methods are also called feature-level adaptations, because theyaim to obtain domain-invariant features. Although these two categoriesoften perform well, they require architecture-speci ﬁc design. Adversarial generative methods [14–16] are known as pixel-level adaptations. They are based on generative adversarial nets [ 22], and produce target-like training data from the source images. This categorycan be applied regardless of the architecture type, as it only changes thetraining data. However, the performance is highly dependent on thequality of image generation.Self-supervision-based methods [17–19] employ self-supervised tasks, such as reconstruction, image rotation prediction, andself-training. This category brings the source and target domains closerby adding auxiliary tasks to the target images. However, the performanceis limited compared to the other categories.2.3. Domain adaptive object detectionRecently, numerous studies have been proposed to address theproblem of domain shifts in object detection. For two-stage detectors,adversarial discriminative methods are often used [ 20,23,24], and have shown very good performance in recent studies [ 25–27]. In many cases, they are designed to align features at several levels, including theinstance-level. One-stage detectors do not have access to instance-levelfeatures, as they predict bounding boxes and object classes simulta-neously. Therefore, adversarial discriminative methods are not suf ﬁcient for one-stage detectors.However, adversarial generative methods and self-supervision-basedmethods are suitable for both two-stage and one-stage detectors. Theauthors of [16] proposed the DT method, which is based on adversarialgenerative methods. DT transfers images with instance-level annotationsfrom the source domain to the target domain using CycleGAN [ 28], and trains a detector on domain-adapted images. The authors of [ 19] pro- posed the use of WST and adversarial background score regularization(BSR), which are based on self-supervision-based methods. With WST,reliable detections on unlabeled images were chosen, andpseudo-instance-level annotations were generated. BSR reduces thedomain shift by extracting discriminative features for target back-grounds. In this study, we combine an adversarial generative method anda self-supervision-based method for a one-stage detector.3. MethodIn this study, we propose a generative and self-supervised domainadaptation method for a one-stage detector. Fig. 1shows an overview of our method. Our method is based on SSD [ 5], and combines two methods: DT [16], which is an adversarial generative method, and WST[19], which is a self-supervision-based method.In this section, weﬁrst formulate the problem, and then, explain theeffect of combining the two methods and the details of the proposedmethod.3.1.

Generative and self-supervised domain adaptationIn an ideal scenario where the target labels are available, supervisedlearning of the target data is possible, as shown in Fig. 2(b). We approach the unsupervised domain adaptation for one-stage detectors by bringingthe learning setting closer to the ideal case.We propose generative and self-supervised domain adaptationcomposed of an adversarial generative method and a self-supervision-based method. In the adversarial generative method ( Fig. 2(c)), the source images were converted to target-like images. Although the dis-tribution of the transferred images does not perfectly match that of thetarget images, the transferred images with source labels enable super-vised learning. In the self-supervision-based method ( Fig. 2(d)), self- supervised tasks were employed on the target images. Although super-vised learning cannot be applied, this method enables the training of theoriginal target images. These two contrasting methods are expected tocomplement each other. The proposed method ( Fig. 2(e)) is close to the ideal case (Fig. 2(b)) in terms of supervised learning near the targetdomain and using the original target images for training.In this study, we applied DT [16] to the adversarial generative method and WST [19] for the self-supervision-based method. DT usesCycleGAN [28] to transform the source images into target-like images.WST enables self-supervised learning by generating pseudo-labels on thetarget images. The pseudo-labels are assigned to reliable detections,considering the detection results of neighboring regions. Then, WSTtrains detectors using pseudo-labels, while reducing the effect of falsenegatives using weak negative mining.3.3.

Watercolor2kand Comic2k are unrealistic datasets, and have six classes in Pascal VOC.Each dataset provided 1000 images for the training set and 1000 imagesfor the test set.

We found that the pro- posed method detected more objects correctly compared to the baseline.Furthermore, objects detected by DT but not by WST were detected bythe proposed method, and vice versa.4.5. DiscussionComplementary effect:The experiments show that our method iseffective for unsupervised domain adaptation. Based on the improvedaccuracy compared to using DT or WST alone, the adversarial generativemethod and self-supervision-based method are considered to comple-ment each other.Measuring domain distances:To quantitatively evaluate the per-formance of each target dataset, we computed the FID [ 29] between the source and target images and between the domain-adapted and targetimages, as shown inTable 4. The FID measures the difference betweentwo distributions in the high-dimensional feature space of theInception-v3 model [30], and indicates the similarity between the twogroups. The smaller the FID between the source and target images, thebetter the performance of the baseline, as shown in Tables 1–3. DT performance:We found that DT is ineffective for Watercolor2k ascompared to Clipart1k and Comic2k. Although the FID between thedomain-adapted and target images did not differ signi ﬁcantly among the datasets, the distance difference on Watercolor2k was the smallest,which led to DT's poor performance. In contrast, DT performs better forClipart1k and Comic2k, where the distance differences are larger. Thus,the effectiveness of the adversarial generative method depends on thetarget dataset.WST performance:WST showed improvements for all three datasets.The results suggest that the self-supervision-based method is robust tovariations in the target domain.Table 1Results on adaptation from Pascal VOC to Clipart1k.

Introduction One of the key appearances in concurrent software de sign is able to deal with a reckless adaptability and reusability. Software continuously changes when either a new hardware or requirement is needed. Adaptability of concurrent software is definitely demand ed. Without reengineering of the whole concurrent software, reusability in the design of concurrent s oftware is a critical aspect of concurrent software development. The more components in the existing software can reuse, the faster and better software design are. Most changes in software make it defects and prod ucing errors [1]. When we need new features or adding new hardware to the system, modification of the software is inevitable. Modifications of the concurrent software are not a relaxed process. Variation of the concur rent software is invasive evolutions and changes to meet needs. Certain alterations can be applied to traditional functional decomposition and object-oriented analysis and design. However, modifications must not be too complicate. Concurrent software developers essentially keep simplicity of concurrent software deve lopment. Ease in the concurrent software development is a noteworthy specific of a good software development. Classical benchmarks in concurrent software design have used to implement and demonstrate how practical of adaptability and reusability of the concurrent software development, like readers-writers and producers-consumers problems.  The commercialization of concurrent software, e.g. operating systems, has ensued in their design gaining more importance. System software such as operating sys tems is constantly extended for improvements as well as to support new features and hardware. During the desi gn of concurrent system software, certain decisions such as reusability and adaptability are essential [2].  The necessity in the principle of separation of concerns deals with one issue at a time, originally addressed by [3, 4]. The principle of separation of concerns is th e major of concurrent software development. Separation of concerns leads many benefits. Although reusability and adaptability recognized, nowadays there is none commonly acknowledged approach tips programmers and developers how preeminent achieve reusability and adaptability. Developers and programmers have to deliberate how separation of concerns can address and how a quantity of aspects in the system can take [5] not only in the design, but also in an implementation of the system software. The better separation of concerns is , the better reusability and adaptability of both functional components and aspects in the system is.  Concurrent system software consists of multiple  concerns spreading across many components of the system. Systems are disreputable of one concern spread ing across many components. We mean this situation is not only depriving reusability, but also gradual adaptability. System asset is defined as one concern spreading across multiple components in the system. Example system assets include system monitoring, error handling, synchronization, and scheduling. At present, traditional functional decomposition techniqu es have been used in most current concurrent software design. Separation of concerns can achiev e by using functional decomposition technique with excessive limitation of reusability and adaptability. The concurrent object-oriented design and programming provide higher abstraction. However, reusability and adaptability have to manually achieve. It depends on the ability of developers and programmers.  Concurrent object-oriented design and programming provide only one facet which developers can separate concerns. However, tangling concerns still exist in the system if developers are unaware of it. Concurrent object-oriente d design and programming solutions help to localize the effect of adding or changing to data, but it can also result in tangling and scattering of system assets across multiple objects [6]. Tangling system assets lead to a lack of  higher level of abstraction in concurrent software increasing dependencies between the functional component s, known as tightly couple. Tightly couple makes it difficult to reuse and adapt. As a result, adapting or reusing of existing components has to produce massive changes in the concurrent system. This affects soft ware quality of adaptability and reusability for concurrent system. Thus, reengineering the whole system to  meet the new requirements cannot avoid. 135  Paniti Netinant  /  AASRI Procedia   5  ( 2013 )  133 – 139 ', ' Recently, an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) proposes a better separation of concern technique. It keeps advantages of object-oriented programming. Its goal is to achieve central decomposition [7]. Nowadays, there are many software development methodologies. Th ere is one used by developers in order to produce high-quality software such as aspect-oriented software development [10, 11, and 12]. The aspect-oriented approach aims to provide explicit defining for modul arizing design decomposing concerns of functional components in the system. Spreading concerns divide, contain, and collaborate in separated components called aspects. Aspect components and functional componen ts are woven into the whole system at predefined joinpoint. Aspect-oriented approach is a general software model which is noticed to extract concerns spreading in components.  Aspect-oriented approach can apply to all phases in the software development life cycle. In reality, aspect-oriented approach encourages decomposition of spreading concerns in separated components at the early beginning of software developm ent. Current aspect-oriented approaches interpret entities into components and aspects. Finally, the system will automatically combine aspects, where the joinpoints have been defined, and functional component s to create the system. A system asset is a concern which spread multiple functional components. Every sy stem asset can be splatted into independently from functional components.  2. Architecture of Framework Using a fork for plotting plants is a misplaced as using a spoon to dig out an excavation for a dinosaur bone. Concurrent software development turns out to be more and more complex. High quality concurrent software development is become more expensive. Concurrent so ftware is never completed finish. In the future, new requirements and changing hardware require to be modified and improved the software. For these reasons, it is practical to look for adequate methods that allo w complexity to be mastered, or make invasive modifications by better supporting reusability and adaptability. We believe that aspect-oriented approach to software design can assist developers and programmer in the concurrent system. It could cleanly support separating concerns from multiple components, and captured into only one component, called an aspect component. Aspect -oriented approach could deliver a technique making it possible to a higher abstraction. Then the weaver component composes functional components and system assets together [8]. The framework view differs fr om the languages view, in the sense the framework architecture are usually more flexible than the language part. The framework is a design of a cluster of cooperative objects which handles aspects. The framework consists of three parts. First, the moderator takes the place of the weaver. The collaboration of functional components and the aspect components has been defined by jopinpoint in moderator components. Se cond, the proxy intercepts accesses to functional components. The proxy can have more than one in order to increasing the speed of intercepting accesses. A proxy object uses a design pattern such as factory or proxy pattern. Third, an aspect-factory component creates asset components. The framework is illustrated in Fig.1.          136   Paniti Netinant  /  AASRI Procedia   5  ( 2013 )  133 – 139 ', '           ', 'Fig 1. Concurrent Aspect Framework. ', 'Composing of aspects using the moderator presents  components of aspect factory.  Functional components need to gather required aspectual components. Then functional components decide about the weaving policies. The framework offers an open architecture that is very suitable for adaptability and reusability of both functional components and aspect components knowing of system assets. The architecture is conceptually very simple as it divides aspect and functional compone nts, and the control over the weaving aspects. The aspects are centralised in the aspect factory component. System assets in concurrent software should not be se en and be treated as a single monolithic component.  The framework consists of components, assets, and layers. Functional components are the basic functionality of the concurrent system software. System assets ar e concerns extracted from functional components. Each asset component is a concern like fault tolerance, sy nchronization, scheduling, naming, and logging. Layers are a number of more manageable sub problems deco mposed into functional components and system assets. Each functionality component will be isolated from system assets. System assets of each functional component will be captured into asset components. A sset components are defined asset abstraction and asset objects. This design outcomes a better clarification of in teractions, reduces a concern tangling by increasing understanding of system assets in each component. It makes the concurrent advanced level of abstraction, and better to easily understand. Design patterns played roles in the concurrent aspect framework. We use abstract a factory pattern and a bridge pattern to create aspect components. A factory patte rn uses to isolate between an asset abstraction and the asset objects. The obligation and the process of cr eating asset objects have been responded by a factory pattern. The asset object appears only once in a functio nal component instantiated. When an asset object has been modified, the framework promotes consistency. A bridge pattern helps to prevent a permanent binding between an asset abstraction and an asset implementa tion. Using a bridge pattern, asset abstractions and asset implementations can freely association and extend. Changing in the implementation of an asset object or an asset abstraction does not result any effects on functional components. A proxy pattern uses to control access asset components and allow organization responsibilities when an asset component is retrieved. 3. Adaptability of the Framework Most developers think an object-oriented model nat urally endorses reusability and adaptability. We argue that those concerns are not naturally enforced. Concurrent system software must be carefully specified and ', 'Proxy Objects ', 'Functional Components ', 'Shared Data', 'Behavior a', 'Behavior b', 'Moderator', 'joinpoint', 'AspectFactory', 'Synchronization', 'Scheduling ', 'Asset Components ', 'Behavior a Shared Data 137  Paniti Netinant  /  AASRI Procedia   5  ( 2013 )  133 – 139 ', ' designed in order to make the concurrent software re usable and adaptable. One of many important software qualities is an adaptability factor in software design .  A minimal degree of adaptability can lead to reengineering a whole system. Adaptability of softwa re quality has explicitly plotted into a concurrent software design stressed in concurrent software resear ch [2]. Changing requirement or adding new hardware without invasive modifications is an increasing de gree of adaptation. Traditional object-oriented software design supports minimal degree of adaptation. Adaptability can achieve in two ways: - a vertical adaptability or a horizontal adaptability. An inheritance component supports a vertical adaptability. A composition, encapsulation, and message passing support a horizont al adaptability. Concurrent object-oriented software design does insufficiently support adaptability of concurrent software.  System assets are not only tangled in functional components, but also prevented concurrent software to adapt or change later. The concurrent aspect framework does not require any structure to represent and support system assets. A few classes for system assets must be added into the concurrent software wh ile concurrent software is designing and implementing. Using the concurrent aspect framework, previous system assets can be easily removed from the system. The moderator objects response to dynamically activate or  deactivate system assets during runtime (dynamic adaptability can achieve).  The semantic of collaboration between system assets a nd functional components can cleanly define in the moderator through joinpoints. Joinpoints in the moderator represent a semantic of interaction between system assets and functional components as well as the orde ring of execution system assets. Joinpoints can dynamically alter during the runtime. An automatic weaver technologies does not support a dynamically adaptability. The concurrent aspect framework designs functional components and aspect components independently. When developing a system asset, develo pers and designers do not have to concern functional components. On the other hands, development of asse t components does not know functional components in advance (before runtime). The asset components only know functional components.  An asset component has been created and registered by the moderator.  Joinpo ints of the moderator take care of weaving functional and asset components. Adding or changing new asset or functional components needs not to reengineer the system. A new collaboration between asset and function com ponents has to define joinpoints in the moderator. Only the moderator has to be recompiled. There is no n eed to make any modification either functional or asset components. This is an invasive change. The concurre nt aspect framework seems to promise a better degree of adaptation in the design of concurrent software with naturally adaptable.  4. Reusability of the Framework The concurrent aspect framework does not only supp ort adaptability, but also reusability. The functional components and asset components are independently th ought and designed. The framework can achieve both a vertical and horizontal reusability of both functional components and asset components. The moderator uses design patterns that weave functional components and system assets together.  Adaptability can achieve by using design pattern [2].', '  The pros of using the moderator are when a new system asset added to the system. There is no need to make any modification of the moderator.', ' Reusability can achieve in two ways: - a vertical adaptability or a horizontal reusability.', '  First, a vertical reusability can achieved. Asset compone nts on the higher layer can use abstractions of asset components on the lower layers to implement.  To  develop rapid concurrent software, this promotes not only reusability, but also cost and time reduction. Asset ob ject in the upper layer can specify and reuse asset object in the lower layer that provide a generally specified asset. Channing of specification of asset object in the lower layer will have affected asset objects in th e upper layer. This would make asset objects in the concurrent system consistent by separately relatively designed.  Second, a horizontal reusability can achieved. To develop various asset objects in different domain in the same layer, asset interface of that layer can 138   Paniti Netinant  /  AASRI Procedia   5  ( 2013 )  133 – 139 ', ' implement as many as asset objects to meet specified requirements. For example, a system asset of logging in the concurrent software is defined in the lower layer  to record activity of the system every 2 seconds. This logging asset in the concurrent system can reuse an d modify at the upper layer. The asset interface in the lower layer provides the abstraction of the lower loggi ng asset. The concurrent aspect framework seems to promise a better degree of reusability in the design of concurrent software with naturally reusable. 5. Conclusion This paper presents our approach for improving the c oncurrent software system using the aspect-oriented framework while maintaining the advantages of better reusability and adaptability. We propose an alternative technique for designing concurrent software system that present a higher level abstraction to the designer and the programmer. Instead of requiring the designer and the programmer to deal with the complex components of concurrent software system, we allow designers an d programmers to modify and understand components simply. Concurrent software system, developed usi ng this framework, is referred to as reusability and adaptability models. We believe that aspect-oriented software development can assist developers and programmers to design the adaptable and reusable concurrent software. Aspect-orient ed approach does not limit to any language either. A general feeling, that concurrent object-oriented design  and development naturally helps reusability and adaptability, is a misconception. Concurrent object-oriented design does not naturally enforce reusability and adaptability. Relatively, developers of concurrent software have to carefully specify and design for reusability and adaptability supporting. The high level abstraction of relatively separated concerns better allows for reusability and adaptability. The framework promises on decomposition of concurrent object-oriented system. The framework can achieve and improved a better separation of concerns in the development of concurrent software system.   We achieve extraction both functional components and spreading concerns through a single component, called an asset component. A moderator component can coordinate the interaction of functional components and aspect components via joinpoints. System assets can reuse and adapt without interfering any functional components. Functional components can reuse and adapt without interfering any system assets as well. The concurrent aspect framework not only promises reusability and adaptability, but also lets developers find any proper language for the system. The framework can address various asset and functional components. This technique can reduce time and cost to develop concurre nt software. A weakness of this approach is an increasing number of classes. References [1] M. E. Fayad and A. Altman. An introduction to  software stability, Communications of ACM, Vol.44, 2001; 9: 95-98.

IntroductionWeeds are undesirable plants that can be eliminated using herbi-cides. Traditionally, these herbicides are used uniformly over thewholeﬁeld. This uniform spraying eliminates the weeds but affectsthe crop as well. It also consumes an unnecessary amount of herbicide,adversely affecting the environment and human health. The amount ofherbicide usage can be decreased by selective spraying. The agriculturalrobots can perform weed and crop detection to perform precisespraying, which will help reduce herbicides' usage. However, theserobots lack a universal weed detection mechanism making them un ﬁt for commercial use. In addition, typical methods for detecting weedsdo not translate to out-of-distribution data; therefore, each new weedtype orﬁeld needs to be updated, which is time-consuming.Solving the weed detection problem using the colour, skeleton, andarea-based hand-crafted features is prone to error, as the plant's shapeundergoes variations due to growth, time of the day, weather condi-tions, and temperature. Therefore, these hand-crafted features-basedclassiﬁcations are only practical in situations with limited variations inthe data. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based encoder-decoder architectures are reliable for weed detection using semanticsegmentation (Milioto et al., 2017), but a system that can work formultiple stages with different data distribution is still required.This paper proposes a solution for better model generalization. Inthis work, we perform experiments to achieve a more reliable modeltuning that can be implemented on a robot to select weeds. Further-more, the resultant model performs better on the data on which it istrained and other growth stages without any additional training re-quirement. The dataset used for this research consists of images col-lected from multiple stages of sugar beet crop ( Chebrolu et al., 2017). It has nineteen stages which are divided into four sections. The ﬁrst three sections haveﬁve stages each, and the last section consists ofthe remaining four stages.In semantic segmentation, given the limited access to labelleddata and difﬁculty annotating at the pixel level, the generalizationof the model parameters for the unknown stage of the plant becomesdifﬁcult. To articulate that, we explore the capability of differentmodels to segment the crop and weeds from different stages whentrained in an adversarial (using CGAN) and classical fashion. Themain focus is to train different models to adapt to the unseen infor-mation given minimal access to data, i.e., training only for the lastfour stages. The target dataset has varying illumination, multipleweeds, and different soil texture. Using a fully grown stage for under-standing, we are searching for a mechanism to improve the modelperformance for different stages of the crop.

The classical training isperformed using weighted cross-entropy loss, whereas the adversar-ial training is conducted using L1 loss and patch-wise discriminatorloss.The CGAN (Isola et al., 2017) is used for adversarial training. TheCGAN in (Isola et al., 2017) consists of two individual models, D and G.The D tries to classify the input as fake or real, and the G's objective isto generate realistic fake images to fool D.

The experiments are basedon both classically and adversarially trained encoder-decoder models.Firstly, we experimented with different encoder-decoder modelstrained in classical fashion. The input to the model is four channelled(RGB-NIR) images. Secondly, the same models are trained in adversarialsettings. We replace G with the earlier used encoder-decoder models.These encoder-decoder models include U-Net ( Ronneberger et al., 2015), SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017), U-Net and SegNet with ResNet-50 as a backbone, and DeepLabv3+ ( Chen et al., 2018).

Thedata analysis, experiments, and description of the model architecturesare described inSection 3.Section 4presents the results with a compar-ison of model performance. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.2. Related workExisting weed detection methods could be broadly categorized intotwo categories; feature-based and CNN based. Furthermore, CNN-based methods are divided into two, one based on classical trainingand the other with adversarial training.Haug et al. propose a feature-based detection method usingRandom Forests Classiﬁer (RFC) (Breiman, 2001). First, they extract Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) mask for each over-lapping 80 × 80 pixels window, followed by the computation of 15key points based on the shape of the plant and pixel intensities.Next, users draw class-based polygons which assign the class labelto nearby pixels. The features and labels are fed to the classi ﬁer fortraining (Haug et al., 2014). A similar approach is followed by Lotteset al., where Local Binary Patterns (LBP) are used to ﬁnd statistical features over R, G, and NDVI channels. The LBP operator generates abinary pattern based on the centre pixel value within eight neigh-bours. Shape-based features are calculated for vegetation masks.These features are then used to train RFC to detect weeds and plants(Lottes et al., 2016). These methods depend on shape-based features,which vary for the same or growing stage of the plant.Milioto et al. propose CNN based classiﬁer for weed detection. The vegetation mask is used for detecting connected vegetation blobs ofsize 64 × 64 pixels, and bounding boxes are computed around eachblob. The RGB + NIR blobs are used as input to CNN, which classi ﬁes them in a vector with the probability distribution of the input image\", 'patch as a plant or a weed (Milioto et al., 2017). Mortensen et al. pro- pose a modiﬁed version of the VGG-16 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) model to perform the semantic segmentation task achievingpixel accuracy of 79% (Mortensen et al., 2016). Milioto et al. work on weed detection in data having different distributions. Ini-tially, the encoder-decoder-based model, modi ﬁcation of SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017), is trained for uniformly distributeddata, and performance is measured for the same and cross datasets(Milioto et al., 2018).Cicco et al. propose plant modelling for enhancing the dataset anduse the SegNet model (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017) for semantic seg- mentation of weeds and crops. They design different leaf models andthen model other plants based on the type and number of leaves.These plants with varying sizes of leaves representing various growthstages are randomly distributed over the soil. The respective class isspread with the class semantic mask on a transparent background forground truth. The generated dataset is fed to the SegNet model for seg-mentation (Di Cicco et al., 2017). This solution helps enhance data to im-prove accuracy. McCool et al. use encoder-decoder architecture toperform weed, and crop segmentation tasks ( McCool et al., 2017). Lottes et al. use a decoder with dilated 3D convolution to visualize the weedand crop. This technique uses a sequence of non-overlapping imageschosen using the odometry information. This method proposes thesequential module for extracting the pattern of the plantation. Theyachieve the mDICE score of 0.86 for the cross-validation dataset(Lottes et al., 2018). The common challenges with the above schemesare variant features utilization and lack of generalization for growingplants.Gated-shaped CNN (Takikawa et al., 2019)i m p r o v e st h es e m a n t i c segmentation task by processing information in two streams. Insteadof processing colour, shape, and texture information in a single tradi-tional network, a shape-based stream is proposed. The shaped-basedstream focuses on gradient computation for the given mask. The in-termediate layers in the shape stream are connected using GatedConvolutional Layers (GCL). Finally, features from the regular andshape streams are fused using Atrous Spatial Pooling Pyramid(ASPP). They report an overall mean Intersection Over Union(mIOU) of 80.8% for the cityscape dataset.', 'Fig. 1.The CGAN for image translation: G represents generator whereas D represents Discriminator, x represents input (RGB and NIR) image, G outputs RGB sema ntic map that is fed to D with the fake label. In the next iteration real semantic map is used along with x input to only train D with a real label.H.S. Ullah and A. Bais Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 189 –198', '190Asad and Bais propose a novel approach for agricultural image label-ling with promising results for weed detection ( Asad and Bais, 2020). Images from the canolaﬁeld areﬁrst segmented into background andforeground, then the weeds are manually labelled. This labelling mech-anism is not fully automatic, but still, it reduces the complexity of man-ual labelling. The segmentation masks with ﬁeld images are fed to two different models, SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017), and U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015). With mIOU of 82.9%, SegNet based onResNet-50 outperforms U-Net architecture. Model-assisted labellingunder different challenges is adopted in ( Ullah et al., 2021) for crop and weed segmentation in canola. Chen et al. propose an ef ﬁcient way of semantic segmentation. They use the ASPP module to extract multi-scale information. ResNet and Xception-based backbone is used to ex-tract high-level features. These features are placed at multiple scales inthe encoder. The decoder takes low-level information from the featureextractor and combines it with high-level features to target the seman-tic map. They name their model DeepLabv3+, reporting 89% mIOU forCityscapes dataset (Chen et al., 2018).Wang et al. use different image enhancement techniques for im-proving weed, and crop segmentation under varying lighting ( Wang et al., 2020). They use histogram equalization and deep photo enhancer(GAN is used to perform enhancement) for image enhancement. Thendeeplabv3+ (Chen et al., 2018) model is trained reporting 88.91%mIOU.Semantic segmentation can also be done using CGAN. Most of the re-cent research on CGAN focuses on image translation either from text oran image (Karras et al., 2019;Reed et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2017). Reed et al. use GANs to convert textual features to generatean image. The randomly distributed noise with text description is fed tothe generator. The discriminator is conditioned to the image with thetext attributes. This idea is useful for generating arti ﬁcial data (Reed et al., 2016). Zhang et al. improve image generation from text usingtwo-stage stack GAN. The stage I generator extracts sketches and thestage II generator reﬁnes the results (Zhang et al., 2017). The text description to image translation can be used as a data enhancementtechnique. In the image-to-image translation, Isola et al. suggest seman-tic segmentation on the cityscape dataset using CGAN. The scene imageis fed to an encoder-decoder-based G, and the output of G is forwardedto D. D is trained for ground truth and generated a segmentation maskimage for a given scene image. With pixel accuracy of 86%, generatedimages look close to the ground truth, but there is noise. The reasonfor this noise is instability in G (Isola et al., 2017). Karacan et al. utilize semantic layout to synthesize realistic outdoorimages. They use CGAN that learns target content to be drawn insidelayout (Karacan et al., 2016). Rezaei et al. propose CGAN for segmentingbrain tumours. Utilizing U-Net (Haug et al., 2014)e20 as generator and Markovian GAN (Radford et al., 2015) based discriminator, they report 0.68 mDICE score (Rezaei et al., 2017). Wang et al. use CGAN for high- resolution image translation. They use 70 × 70 Patch-GAN ( Isola et al., 2017) for discriminator networks. Their focus is to transform thesemantic map into a realistic image. They also report the inverse trans-formation achieving 63.9% mIOU for Cityscapes dataset (', 'Wang et al., 2018). Regmi et al. work on natural image synthesis and pixel-level seg-mentation using CGAN. The generator is con ﬁgured to take an aerial image and convert it to a street map view and the corresponding se-mantic map. The model consists of one encoder and two decoderstreams. They achieve mIOU of 41.3% ( Regmi and Borji, 2018). Rammy et al. propose retinal vessel segmentation using conditional patch-based GAN. The conditional sample with noise vector z of latent spaceis fed to the generator leading to a synthetic map. This synthetic mapis used in the discriminator as a fake sample update. They report98.84% speciﬁcity for the proposed method (Rammy et al., 2019). To the best of our knowledge, CGANs were not previously used for weedsegmentation. We aim to improve weed detection for the cross stagesdataset without relying on hand-designed features and to reduce Ginstability in CGAN.3. Data analysis and experimentsIn this work, we performed a comparison-based study to understandthe effectiveness of model generalization under adversarial and classicaltraining settings. Our focus is toﬁnd an architecture as well as a trainingscheme that could effectively detect weeds and crops at multiplegrowth stages. In the following subsection, we perform ExploratoryData Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying pattern and chal-lenges in the data.3.1. Data analysisIn the dataset, images are collected over the growing season of thesugar beet crop.Fig. 2analyzes the percentage of Weed and Crop LeafArea (WLA and CLA) over different growth stages. Eqs. (1) and (2) explains the calculation of percentage CLA and WLA respectively.Percentage Crop Leaf Area¼∑Y crop', 'Total Number of pixels/C2100ð1ÞY', 'croprepresents pixels associated with the crop, and the pixel valuecan either be 1 or 0 for the channel associated with the crop.Percentage Weed Leaf Area¼', '∑Y weed', 'Total Number of pixels/C2100ð2ÞY', \"weedrepresents pixels associated with the weed, pixel value 1 or0 represent weed or no weed, respectively. The pixel value isfundamentally a one-hot encoded vector representing the pixel be-longing to a particular class based on its hot value. For example, thevector with values [1,0,0] means the pixel belongs to the ﬁrst class. InFig. 2, the plots in theﬁrst column indicate the percentage CLA,whereas the second column reports the percentage WLA. In Fig. 2 (i and ii), CLA and WLA of images from Set I, that consist of ﬁve initial timestamps, are reported. The percentage leaf area gives us an indica-tion of changing shape and size. InFig. 2(a), for stage one, the crop leaf area is a small fraction (approx. 0.05%), whereas in (b), the weedpercentage is near zero, i.e., there is no weed at the early stage. This isrepresented with blue inFig. 2(a and b). The weedy plants start poppingout at Stage 3 in Set I (Fig. 2(b)), which is more than the crop as the av-erage leaf area is approximately 0.2% compared to the crop that is 0.11%.As we move forward in Set II,Fig. 2(c and d) show prominent growthfor the crop, but for weeds, there is no consistent growth. The approxi-mate mean CLA is near 0.11% for the crop, whereas for weeds, it is closeto 0.03%. InFig. 2(e and f), the growing trend of percentage CLA con-tinues with an approximate mean of 0.65%, whereas the percentageWLA has an approximate mean of 0.10%. In Set IV, the average WLA isabout 0.82%, whereas for the crop, the average increases to 4.52% asshown inFig. 2(g and h). This analysis aims to understand the underly-ing challenges associated with plant growth, especially when the task isto segment it. Going from a minimal growth stage (where the plant isbarely visible) to a stage where the average CLA in the images fromSet IV containing a crop plant is almost 10% (CLA of Set IV with cropplants), a lot is happening with the plant's shape. This diversity is com-plex to generalize if we do not access any prior information. Anothercritical information that can be extracted from Fig. 2is the percentage distribution of classes of interest. Looking at WLA and CLA, one can tellthat the dataset is highly imbalanced. For example, there are morepixels in the background data than weed and crop. For a model to un-derstand various distributions like the ones explained through Fig. 2, we, unfortunately, sometimes do not have access to enough data.The percentage of pixels for each class and the sets of images isreported inTable 1. For example, Set IV has the highest crop and weedpixels percentage compared to the other three sets. On the otherhand, pixels in Set I mainly belong to the background, and only three-H.S.

A total of 19 timestamps (stages) are grouped to make 4 sets. The ﬁrst three sets contain 5 timestamps each, whereas the last group (Set IV) has the ﬁnal three stages.H.S. Ullah and A. Bais Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 189 –198', \"192quarters of a percent have weeds and crop. This analysis is essential tostudy as it helps deﬁne the solution to the problem of data imbalance.In this work, we address the discussed problem by exploring thegeneralization capacity of different models under two training settingswith minimal exposure to the shape-based diversity of data.3.2. ExperimentsThe diversity of a plant's shape is a signiﬁcant challenge and hard to address if data is unavailable. In our case, although we have access to thedata from different plant growth stages, the aim here is to limit access tothe data and perform training only over the last few stages. We thenevaluate the technique over the remaining data to understand thecapacity of different models when trained using two methods. First,different state-of-the-art encoder-decoder models with multiple back-bone structures are trained classically. In classical training, the modeldirectly learns the mapping from a given ﬁeld image to a semantic map, i.e. model has exposure to output segmentation mask. The samenetworks are trained in the second mechanism using adversarial train-ing settings. While utilizing the CGAN model, we use the D as describedin pix2pix (Isola et al., 2017) and change G with encoder-decoder archi-tectures described earlier to see the variation in results. In CGAN, G gen-erates images, and D classiﬁes them as real or fake. D splits the imageinto patches and decides the patch of the image to be real or fake. Thisprocess continues until we get the balance between D and G. The back-ground varies between stages, impacting the model performance. Toreduce model dependency on background, we randomly blur theimages using a Gaussianﬁlter of size 5 and standard deviation of 1.The random blurring changes the entire image, not only the soil. Theplants also get an effect of blurriness which helps in mimicking thevibrations in the ground imagery system.In both settings, we train the models for 100 epochs with batch size4 and save the model's best weights. We use Adam optimizer with alearning rate 0.0002 andβ\", '10.5. In addition, we use one-hot encodedsegmentation masks with weighted cross-entropy for classical training.The weighted cross entropy helps in mitigating the class imbalanceproblem. In adversarial settings, we use binary cross-entropy loss andmean absolute error (L1 loss) for D and G. It is called PatchGAN lossbecause the D generates a patch indicating the image as real or fake.3.3. Objective function for classical trainingSemantic segmentation using classical training is common. The sizeand shape of plants change with growth. If enough data is unavailable,these changes and the soil texture variations are hard to learn. Addition-ally, the dataset is imbalanced as there are more background pixels thanweed and crop.Fig. 3explains the distribution of the entire dataset. Only1.46% of a total number of pixels consists of vegetation with 0.23% forweed and 1.28% for the crop. Almost 98.5% of the pixels are from thebackground class. The weighted cross-entropy loss helps in solving thedata imbalance problem. For an unbalanced dataset, weighted crossentropy assigns loss weightage to each class. The weightage is set suchthat the class with the high number of samples gets a lower weight,and the class with the low number of samples contributes a higher por-tion towards overall loss. The focus of model tuning is directly related tothe penalty for each class. The objective function for classical learningcan be written as:Loss Ytrue,Ypred/C0/C1¼/C0 1P∑Pp¼1∑Cc¼1wcYtrue p,clog Y predp,c/C16/C17ð3ÞwhereY', 'true∈[0,1] is the ground truth andY pred∈[0,1] is the softmax output. P represents the number of pixels and C denotes the total num-ber of classes.w', 'cis weight assigned to classc. For this work, thew', \"cis chosen by taking the inverse of thepercentage of the data distribution.3.4. Objective function for CGANThe main objective while training CGAN is playing the min-maxgame. The training is assisted by generating real and fake labels for D.These labels are produced at each step. The real label corresponds togrid of ones and is only given when the ground truth is used. Zeros rep-resent the fake label. They are given when the prediction from the gen-erator is used. The output of D has a shape of 24 × 32. The labels aregenerated of the same size as the output of D. Initially, D takes ﬁeld image and condition as input. The condition is the ground truth that Gaims to learn. It can be called a real sample update. Then, D takes ﬁeld image and prediction from G as input. This is a fake sample update. Atthe end of each real and fake sample update in D, the weights of G areupdated. While updating the parameters for the G, we perform back-propagation through D without updating D's parameters. In otherwords, we update G with all the layers of D set to non-trainable. Thelearning rate of D is adjusted to half of the G using loss weight con ﬁgu- ration so that G learns faster than D. Collectively the objective of CGANcan be expressed as below (Isola et al., 2017): Loss\", 'CGAN G,DðÞ ¼E X,YtruelogDX,Y true ðÞ½/C138 þE X,Zlog 1/C0D X, G X, ZðÞ /C138ðð½ð4ÞX and Z represent the input image and the operation performed onthe image, respectively.Y', 'trueis the ground truth and only given to D.For G, we use mean absolute error (L1 loss) for parameter updates. L1loss works well for low-frequency components by improving sparse-ness in the image. The sparsity is linked with having few pixels with ahigher difference to the original. As the D and G work opposite, G re-stricts the high component and resists D to only model high frequency.For G, our objective equation is:Loss', 'L1GðÞ¼E X,Ytrue,Z‖Ytrue/C0GXð,ZÞ‖ 1 ½/C138 ð5ÞOverall, the end objective is to play the min-max game as givenbelow:G', '∗¼arg min', 'Gmax', \"DLoss CGAN G,DðÞ þλLoss L1GðÞ ð6Þλis the tuning parameter to assign more weightage to G's loss. Thevalue ofλis set to 100.The best model is chosen based on the equilibrium of minimumlosses of G and D. If D is trained at the same speed as the G, then Dwill outperform G and getting a balance will be dif ﬁcult.Fig. 1shows how the inputsﬂow through the network. G takes the RGB-NIR ﬁeld image and generates the target segmentation mask. The output of Drepresents if eachM×Ngrid in an image is real or fake. In otherwords, it gives a penalty that penalizes the D model at M×Npatch of the image. The model architecture and the improvements made aredescribed in the following subsections.3.5. Model architecturesWe use U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017), U-Net with ResNet-50 backbone, SegNet with ResNet-50Table 1Percentage-wise pixel distribution of Weed, Crop, Background the data.Set Images Percentage Distribution of PixelsWeed Crop BackgroundI 2679 0.02% 0.05% 99.93%II 3423 0.03% 0.11% 99.86%III 2673 0.10% 0.65% 99.25%IV 2800 0.82% 4.52% 94.66%H.S. Ullah and A. Bais Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 189 –198\", '193backbone, and DeepLabv3+ (Chen et al., 2018) with ResNet-50 back- bone to perform our experiments. The mentioned models are ﬁrst trained using classical training mechanism and then using adversarialsettings.All the models take an input consisting of RGB and NIR channels. Thedimension of the input image is set to 384 × 512. All the models learn tomap the input image to a translation representing the class semanticmask. Each model has two main blocks in the architecture, the encoderand decoder block. The encoderﬁnds the deep features while reducingthe spatial size. The decoder performs inverse operation of mappingthe features to image translation. The difference between SegNet andU-Net is the type of skip connections ( Badrinarayanan et al., 2017; Ronneberger et al., 2015). The U-Net shares more information thanSegNet, where only the max-pooling indices are shared in the futurelayers. The skip connections help to achieve additional stability in spa-tial conﬁguration. In U-Net, the learnable up-sampling is implementedusing transposed convolutional layer. DeepLabv3+ employs the AtrousSpatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module of four different depth-wiseseparable dilated convolutional layers. Using different dilatation ratesin each convolutional layer, this module probes features at multiplescales of the input feature map that helps in maintaining a more diversespatial conﬁguration.Table 2compare the models based on trainableparameters. InTable 2theﬁrst column represents the model name,whereas the second column denotes the number of trainable parame-ters. U-Net requires the highest number of trainable parameters whencompared to other reported models. DeepLabv3+ requires only23.96Mparameters whereMrepresents a million.3.5.1. Generator architecture in CGANIn CGAN settings, we use U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017), U-Net-ResNet-50, SegNet-ResNet-50,and DeepLabv3+ as G. The U-Net, SegNet, U-Net-ResNet-50, SegNet-ResNet-50, and DeepLabv3 + -ResNet-50 are named as C-U-Net, C-Segnet, C-U-Net-ResNet-50, C-SegNet-ResNet-50, and C-DeepLabv3+when trained in adversarial settings. Using different models as G alsohelps study the variations in the performance for the same D model.The end layer of each decoder is a convolutional layer, after whichtanh activation is applied. The output result is in the range of [ −1,1], which is then shifted and scaled to [0,1].3.5.2. Discriminator (patch wise penalizer)There are altogether six convolutional layers in D with 4 × 4 ﬁlter size and 2 × 2 stride. First, it takes the source and the target image asinput. Then, it uses sigmoid activation toﬁnd a 24 × 32 patch of binary output. The size of the patch can be altered based on the query as givenin (Li and Wand, 2016)a n d(Isola et al., 2017).4. Results and evaluationFor the evaluation of semantic segmentation tasks, the IOU and DICEscore are reliable evaluation metrics to target. We use mean IOU score tocompare our performance. The mIOU score can be calculated usingEq.(5).', 'Fig. 3.Percentage of number of pixels for each class in the overall data.', 'Table 2Trainable parameters for different models.Network ParametersU-Net 36.96 MSegNet 29.46 MU-Net-ResNet-50 38.05 MSegNet-ResNet-50 34.88 MDeepLabv3+ 23.96 MH.S.

The weeds are mainly dicot and grass. The dataset consists of RGB and NIR images witha three-channel corresponding segmentation mask. The samples aretaken over two months, starting from the zero growth stage. Eachnetwork is trained on last stage, it is then tested on unseen data fromthe same and the remaining three stages. We use 2000 images for train-ing, and the rest of the data is used for testing. The data distribution isshown inTable 3.F r o mTable 3it is clear that only 17% data is used fortraining, which is a tiny fraction compared to the 80% testing data.The results inTable 4andTable 5refer to classically and adversarially trained models, respectively. Both tables compare modelperformance based on mIOU score. Together with comparing trainingschemes, the results also give a bigger picture of the models' overallperformance for different plant stages. The C-U-Net results in higher ac-curacy and IOU score for unknown stages. It reports about 10% overallimprovements in mIOU score compared to other models.Deep networks like U-Net and SegNet with ResNet-50 backboneperform better with classical training. This shows that deeper networksare not suitable for G in CGAN. As SegNet has similar architecture as U-Net, the adversarial training in C-SegNet should work similarly to C-U-Net, but U-Net comes with an advantage of enriched skip connectionsthat makes U-Net preserve more information compared to SegNet.The DeepLabv3+, when trained in a classical training fashion, showssigniﬁcantly good results for the trained stage, reporting an 84.5%mIOU score. U-Net-ResNet-50 is the second better performance modelin the classical setting.SegNet trained classically works well for the crop at the thirdstage, reporting a 77% mIOU score. As the plants grow, the mIOUscore tends to increase. The score improves from 32 to 84% fromtheﬁrst stage to the last stage. This increasing trend shows that asthe crop and weeds grow, they exhibit more resemblance with thetraining data.Fig. 4andFig. 5show results from four different stages, with groundtruth and predicted segmentation mask. The weeds are red, green rep-resents the crop, and everything else is classi ﬁed as background. C-U- Net has better overall performance. However, its result is not suitablefor the earliest growth stage. The model has dif ﬁculty in detecting weeds/crop at an early stage and produces noise instead. This is becauseof high variations in soil texture as depicted in the 1st row of Fig. 4and Fig. 5.Additionally, the difﬁculty of differentiating weeds and crops at anearly stage may be the leading cause of poor performance. The soil var-iation can be addressed using artiﬁcial augmentation. Changing bright-ness and adding noise in theﬁeld images can tackle the soil variationseffectively. However, due to the very close resemblance of weed andcrop at this stage, it is hard to differentiate between crop and weed atthe early stage.The white rectangular boxes inFig. 5show some of the false detection (noise). These false detections are the cost of usingCGAN as G does not see the true data distribution, making it un-stable. To help G to get stable, we use noise removing techniqueon random images. Furthermore, we examine that randomly blur-ring images help us achieve better- generalized parameters for the model, making G stable. We refer to blurring as Z input in Eq. (2) and Eq.(3). The drop-out layers also help in approaching a morestable G.There is an interesting fact about the dataset. Some of the pixels in-ground truths are either unlabelled or mislabelled. The connectingweeds are labelled such that the area in between the weeds is marked\", 'as weed class. These pixels belong to the background class. Moreover,some of the stem pixels are labelled as background. The stem pixels ei-ther belong to weed or crop but not the background. Likewise, somepixels are labelled as background, but their actual class is either cropor weed. Nearly all our models detect most of the unlabelled ormislabelled pixel classes in the ground truth. Comparing false labelleddata with good predictions raise a concern about results being betterthan reported. The yellow rectangular boxes in Fig. 4andFig. 5repre- sent the visuals of our claim.The changing moisture levels of soil may lead to late germinationof crops. InFig. 5(t) and (x) the green rectangular boxes highlightsome of the late germinated plants. Our model detects them as aweed because of mislabelled data. The labels in the dataset do notaccount for the late germinated plants. It makes the weed and cropsegmentation confusing and complex for the model to learn. Usingalready labelled data with improvements can lead to more notice-able results.Also, one can see the performance drop of the model in different sets,multiple factors might be hurting the performance, soil moisture,weather, camera settings, Ground Sample Distance (GSD), and time ofthe day images were collected being some of them. GSD normalization,classical domain adaptation (Histogram matching), and droppingsamples to balance the data can be some valuable techniques thatmight elevate the model performance.Table 3Number of images from each stage used in the test, train, and validation sets.Stage Data splitTrain Test ValidationI 0 2679 0II 0 3423 0III 0 2673 0IV 2000 500 300', 'Table 4Comparison of classically trained models for different growth stages (mIOU).U-Net SegNet U-Net-ResNet-50 SegNet-ResNet-50 DeepLabv3+mean Intersection Over Union (mIOU)Stage I0.32960.3267 0.3128 0.3113 0.3240Stage II0.54380.4792 0.3895 0.4029 0.4063Stage III 0.71990.77190.7412 0.7022 0.7496 Stage IV 0.8088 0.8319 0.8403 0.7924 0.8455', 'Table 5Comparison of adversarially trained models for different growth stages (mIOU).C-U-Net C-SegNet C-U-Net-ResNet-50 C-SegNet-ResNet-50 C-DeepLabv3+mean Intersection Over Union (mIOU)Stage I0.34340.3357 0.3356 0.3336 0.3344 Stage II0.54880.3886 0.4757 0.4501 0.4967 Stage III0.75000.6756 0.6594 0.5837 0.6183 Stage IV0.84720.7355 0.6905 0.6335 0.7023H.S.

We performed a semantic segmentation task for weed de-tection using classical and adversarial learning. We examined dif-ferent stages of the sugar beet crop by training our models ononly one stage. We discuss possible improvements in a datasetthat can lead to better results. Using U-Net in CGAN settings leadsto more generalized weights than simple classical training, whichis evident from the quantitative and qualitative analysis of resultscollected over different stages. The C-U-Net outperforms in detect-ing the growth variations in the dataset. Compared with other net-works, C-U-Net shows improvements of 10% in mIOU score. Theresults can be improved if the dataset has equal distribution of allclasses and the mislabelled data is corrected. The other way is touse artiﬁcial augmentation to enhance the dataset, which willboost accuracy. There is a need to improve the penalizer. PatchGANloss is not very helpful for training deep models. In particular, ournext research will focus on enhancing D and weed detection foran imbalance class data with a focus on late germination of theplant.CRediT authorship contribution statementHaﬁzS a m iU l l a h :Conceptualization, Methodology, Software,Writing–original draft.Abdul Bais:Supervision, Validation, Conceptu-alization.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂu- ence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences and EngineeringResearch Council of Canada Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2021-04171) enti-tled \"Crop Stress Management using Multi-source Data Fusion.References', 'Asad, M.H., Bais, A., 2020.

Another commonly used regularization method called Dropoutrandomly removes some hidden units during the training phase. In this work, we describe some architectures ofDeep Learning algorithms, we explain optimization process for training them and attempt to establish a theo-retical relationship betweenL', '2-regularization and Dropout. We experimentally compare the effect of these techniques on the learning model using genomics datasets.', '1. IntroductionIn the last decade, Deep Learning (', 'DL) algorithms have achieved tremendous success in many domains where large scale datasets are usedsuch as Bioinformatics [2,13,50,62,88,94], Natural Language Processing [5,15,28,47,71], Computer Vision and Speech Recognition [ 1,4,29,34, 37,56,65].In this work, we review a class of', 'DLalgorithms called Feedforward Neural Network (', 'FNN)[54,68,91], in which information moves in onedirection, from input to output through sequential operations called“layers”. These models are the generalization of logistic regressionmodels, both (', 'FNNand logistic regression) are widely used in Bioinfor-matics and Biomedical science to perform classi ﬁcation and diagnosis tasks [8,20,21,24,27,44,48,70,73]. In most cases, we look for a nonlinear mappingy¼fðxÞbetween a variableyand a vector of variablesx. The form offdepends on the complexity of the studied problem.Logistic regression deﬁnes a low complexity model using a simple nonlinear mapping from inputs to outputs. Whereas', 'FNNdeﬁnes a more complex mapping between inputs and their corresponding outputs, thusresulting models have high complexity and ﬂexibility and better pre- diction capacity. However, increasing the complexity of predictivemodels increases also the risk of overﬁtting problem, which repercussionis that the training modelﬁts well the training dataset but looses itsprediction capacity on unseen datasets.Preventing overﬁtting problem is one major challenge in trainingthese algorithms. However, there are many techniques that deal with theproblem of overﬁtting called“regularization techniques”. The most used regularization techniques in Machine Learning (ML) community areL1', \"andL2regularization's [53]. The idea is to prevent the weights of themodel from being large by adding a supplementary term to the lossfunction. The effect of this penalization is to make it so the learning al-gorithm prefers to learn small weights. This method makes models lesscomplex and avoid the risk of overﬁtting. Another commonly used reg- ularization technique so-called“Dropout”, developed by Hinton et al. [33] consists to randomly remove some neurons (in hidden layers) dur-ing the training phase. This forces the hidden units to extract useful in-formation's from the input data and reduce co-adaptation betweenhidden units, thus making the model less sensitive to the speci ﬁc weights of neurons. The Dropout technique allows to train an exponential numberof (thinned) Networks in a reasonable time [ 33]. During the test phase, taking the mean prediction of the different (thinned) Networks isequivalent to test on a single Network with all the hidden neurons [ 6] (without dropping out any unit).

An Autoencoder is a', 'NNdesigned to learn an identity function in a way that the original input can be reconstruct froma compressed version. Such a network will allow the discovery of a moreefﬁcient and compressed representation of the input data. It consists oftwo parts, an encoder and a decoder.

In an AutoencoderNetwork, the targetyðxÞof each input samplexis the input it self, i.e. yðxÞ¼x,8x2Rd. At the end the output has the size of the input.The main objective of an Autoencoder is to automatically capture themost relevant features from input data.

Gradient descentOnce the loss function is deﬁned, gradient descent strategy is typicallyused to minimize it. Gradient descent is a ﬁrst-order optimization strat- egy for nonlinear minimization problems [ 17]. The loss functionCis minimized iteratively by using Gradient descent method [ 3] given byw', 'lij→wlij/C0α', 'nX', 'x2X∂Cx', '∂wlij: (8)Where', 'αis the learning rate.

At each iteration, we have to compute partial de-rivatives ofC', 'xfor each training inputx, and then average them to update weightsw', 'lij. Unfortunately, this method can be very expensive andlearning occurs slowly when the number of training inputs is large. Thisproblem of learning slowness can be avoided by the Stochastic Gradient', 'Fig. 2.Classiﬁcation network.', 'Fig. 3.Autencoder', 'Fig. 4.Classiﬁcation network&autoencoder.H. Soumare et al. Array 11 (2021) 100068', '3Descent (SGD) method.3.1.

However, these wereomitted for simplicity.4. Regularization techniquesOne of the most serious problems in training', 'MLmodels, particularly for', 'NN, is overﬁtting. This problem occurs when a training model is toocomplex.4.1. L', '1and L2regularization techniquesA widely used technique to reduce a model complexity is to add aregularization term [26] to the loss function C. The new model lossfunctionC', 'λis deﬁned as follows:C', 'λ¼CþλΩðWÞThese, update the general cost function by adding another term known asthe regularization term, whereΩisL', '1orL2norm andwis the NNweight parameters.4.1.1. L', '2regularizationTheL', '2regularization term, commonly known as weight decay. The idea of this technique also known as ridge regressionorTikhonov regularization [78], is to add aL', '2term to the function to be minimized, inthis caseΩðWÞ¼', '12kWk22. This added term inL2norm imposes the weights to live in a sphere of radius inversely proportional to the regu-larization parameter [ [26], p. 249]λ. In this context, the updating rule, using gradient descent strategy becomesw', 'lij→/C161/C0αλn/C17w lij/C0α', 'nXni¼1∂Cxi', '∂wlij: (13)this means that, after each iteration, the weights are multiplied by afactor slightly smaller 1. It tends to force the model to prefer smallweights.H. Soumare et al. Array 11 (2021) 100068', '44.1.2. L1regularizationL', '1regularization modiﬁes the loss function by adding aL1term, i.e. ΩðWÞ¼P', 'w2Wjwj. The idea behind this technique is to regularize theloss function by removing the irrelevant features from the trainingmodel. In this situation, the updating rule is writtenw', 'lij→wlij/C0αλnsgn/C16w lij/C17/C0α', 'nXni¼1∂Cxi', '∂wlij:(14)Wheresgnðw', \"lijÞis the sign ofwlij. Both types of regularization try topenalize the big weights when it's necessary by shrinking them after eachupdating step, but the way of shrinkage is different [ 26]. WhenL\", '2reg- ularization is used, the weights are shrunk by an amount proportional tow', 'lij, whereas inL1regularization, the weights are shrunk by constantquantity toward to zero. As shown in Fig. 5(graph on the left), in a two dimensional space, theL', '1norm deﬁnes a parameter space bounded by aparallelogram at the origin. In this case, the loss function is likely to hitthe vertices of the parallelogram rather than its edges. L', '1regularization removes some of the parameters, thus L', '1technique can be used as a feature selection technique. On the other hand, the L', '2regularization deﬁnes a circle whose radius size is inversely proportional to the regu-larization parameter (seeFig. 6).4.2. Dropout techniqueIn training a', 'NN, Dropout technique regularizes learning by droppingout some hidden units with certain probability. This is equivalent tomodifying [72] the', 'NNby setting some hidden activation functions tozero. Using Dropout, we can formally deﬁne the', 'NNas follows:~a', 'lj¼δljalj; (15)At each neuronj, in a hidden layerl, the output activationa', 'ljis multiplied by a sampled variableδ', 'lj, to produce thinned output activations ~alj. These thinned functions are then used as inputs to the next layer and the sameprocess is applied at each layer. This application is equivalent to samplinga sub Neural Networks from a larger network. Where δ', 'ljis a Bernoulli random variable (δ', 'lj↪Bernoulli(pl)) of parameterpl, i.e. a neuron in the lth layer is kept with a probability of p', 'land removed with a probability', '1/C0p', 'l.Srivastava et al. [72] suggested that, applying Dropout to a', 'NNwithn units can be seen as sampling 2', 'nsub Networks with weight sharing. In thetest phase, as it is not always practical to take the mean of 2', 'nmodels, an approximate averaging method is used. The idea is to approximate theexponentially many Networks by a single', 'NNwithout Dropout. To correct the fact that training outgoing weights of a layer are obtained undercondition that neurons were retained with a probability p, the weights are simply multiplied byp. This approximation has been proved for lo-gistic and linear regression models [ 72,79]. But, for Deep Neural Net- works', 'DNNs, there is an unknown gap between the expected output ofexponential sub Networks and the output of a single deterministic model.Ma et al. [46] showed that under some assumptions on input data, thegap is controlled and it can be used to regularize the single', 'NN.In this work, without any assumption of input data, we quantifyexplicitly the gap and then show how it related to L2regularization.4.2.1. Dropout application to linear networksTo see more clearly the relationship between L', '2-regularization, we start by studying the problem in a very simple case, where all activationfunctions in the model are linear.

Dropout with others regularization techniquesDropout is known to improve training model performance when it iscombined with other regularization techniques. Batch normalization,introduced by Ref. [35], is a regularization technique used to speed upthe training and improve performance of Deep', 'NNs. In the training of a', \"DNN, the distribution of each layer's inputs change, as the parameters of alllayers that come before it, variate. This can slow down by requiring smalllearning rates and careful parameter initialization. Given a batch ofsample used to update parameters, batch normalization normalizes theinputs of each layer by recentering and rescaling (subtracting the meanand dividing by the batch standard deviation). Thus, batch normalizationprevents layers inputs to have large standard deviations [ 35]. show experimentally that batch normalization with large learning rate, speedup signiﬁcantly training as it can eliminate the need for Dropout. In fact,as discussed in Section ??, Dropout look for layer's inputs with morevaritions and shrink their weights, this function of shrinking is thenlargely reduced by batch normalization application. Combining dropout\", 'with batch normalization [25,35,43] can improve', 'DNNs prediction accu- racy. Dropout regularization is known to give a signi ﬁcant improvement when it is combined with others regularization methods such asmax-norm [72] and weight normalization [67]. Rather than constraining whole weight matrix of each layer as in L', '2regularization, these constrain each column of the weight matrix to prevent separately any hiddenneuron from having very large weights. Max-norm regularization con-sists to constrain the incoming weight vector of each hidden neuron tolive in a ball of radiusc, wherecis a hyper-parameter. Weight normal-', 'ization constrains incoming weight vectors to have unit norm.5. Materials and methodsAll models in this work are constructed using Keras and Tensor ﬂow open source libraries [38].

Two types of datasets areincluded in our experiments, Expression Project for Oncology (expO)cancer datasets and 1000 Genomes Project ethnicity datasets respectivelyused for training logistic regression and FFN models.Individuals in selected datasets are humans that are represented bythe list of their SNP', 'S. Each SNPis represented by its genotype (i.e. geneticinformation) at a speciﬁc locus. In a diploid organism at each locus, thereare two copies of alleles, one comes from the father and other from themother. Consequently, a genotype takes one of three values for a diploidorganism: 0 (homozygous reference), 1 (heterozygous) and 2 (homozy-gous alternate). The homozygous reference refers to the base that isfound in the reference genome, an homozygous alternate refers to anybase, other than the reference, that is found at that locus and genotype issaid heterozygous at a given position, when the two alleles are different.The input of a model is a matrix X of size n/C2d, wherenis the number of individuals included in the study and dcorrespond to the number of features (SNP', \"S).

A reluaction function is used in the two hidden layers followed by asotmax layer to perform ancestry prediction.6. ExperimentsIn this section, we present the effects of regularization techniques ontraining models for different datasets (see Table 1).6.1. Cancer dataset classiﬁcation using logistic regressionUn-regularized logistic regression results are reported in Table 2, despite its simplicity, logistic regression model gives good classi ﬁcation accuracy on these cancer datasets. To improve prediction capacities ofthe present model, a penalty term is added and obtained results arepresented inTable 3andTable 4forL', '1andL2regularization added term, respectively. We can observe from theses table that penalization with theappropriate regularization parameter improves the classi ﬁcation accu- racy. For example, whenL', '1regularization is used with regularizer λ¼ 10', '/C03, the classiﬁcation accuracy on Breast-Kidney dataset goes from96:53 to99:01. Similarly, whenL', '2penalization is applied(λ¼10/C03), the prediction accuracy on Breast-Colon dataset increases from 94.44 inunregularized case to99:44.6.2. Ancestry prediction using a multilayer perceptron (MLP)In this subsection,', 'FNNis used on 1000 Genome Project ethnicitydataset to predict individuals ancestries. As in the preceding subsection,we start with a simple logistic regression model, which gives a low pre-diction accuracy of54.64%. To achieve better prediction results, a', 'MLP', 'with equal hidden units is constructed and the obtained results byvarying the model complexity are reported in Table 5. As expected, the model prediction accuracy starts by increasing with its complexity untilsome level (two hidden layers with 100 units for each one), then it startsto drop. Because beyond this stage, the training model is considered toocomplex and it overﬁts.6.2.1. Classiﬁcation with autoencoderWe start by using a classiﬁcation Network with one hidden layer of 50units with reconstruction path. This gives an accuracy of 84 :85%.

Classiﬁcation with regularizationWhen Dropout is used alone, the choice of its rate pis very important as inTable 6, we have to be more careful about it. Combining Dropoutwith batch normalization improves the performance training model andmakes the choice ofpless important.L', '1andL2regularization, give good prediction accuracy and outperform Dropout as observed in Table 7. However, when Dropout is combined with batch normalization, max-norm and unit-norm outperforms the traditional regularization tech-niques. We have obtained our best prediction accuracy 94.43%, when Dropout is combined with unit norm constraint.7. DiscussionRegularized Logistic Regression has achieved good results comparedto previous machine learning approaches tested on the same cancersamples [70,73]. For instance, Stiglic et al. [73] combined different feature selection methods such as Vector Machines Recursive FeatureElimination (SVM-RFE) and ReliefF followed by SVMork-nearest neighbors. To the best of our knowledge, the best results on these data-sets were reported in Ref. [70], where the authors used Stacked SparseAutoencoders (SSAE) to select most relevant features followed by aclassiﬁcation Neural Network to categorize the samples. Despite itssimplicity, the proposed approach outperforms SSAE on datasets such asBreast-Kidney and Breast-Colon (see Table 8). In Stacked Sparse Autoencoders [36,45] many Autoencoder layers are stacked together toform an unsupervised learning algorithm, where the encoder layercomputed by an Autoencoder will be used as the input to anotherAutoencoder layer. In practice, a logistic regression model may be betterthan a', 'NNfor relatively small data sets and simple classi ﬁcation tasks, where the classes are more or less linearly separable. Indeed, the latterare more difﬁcult to train, require more training samples and are moreprone to overﬁtting than logistic regression.Logistic regression application to anscentry prediction dataset lead topoor prediction accuracy, which is due to the large dimension of inputfeatures and high nonlinear correlation between them, and to the geneticsimilarity between some ethnic of groups of populations.Training a', \"NNwith an Autoencoder reconstruction path improved theresults. However, training an Autoencoder in conjunction with the clas-siﬁcation Network makes the high dimensional optimization problemmore difﬁcult to solve than simply training the classi ﬁcation Network, yielding in a higher classiﬁcation error. To improve the results, regula-rization techniques are used. One can notice that traditional regulariza-tion technique's application has more improved the prediction accuracyof the model compared to Dropout. This could be attributed to the factthat Dropout is less effective thanL1andL2regularization techniques [58] when the training model is not complex (as for our model).Combining Dropout with techniques such as Batch normation, Unit normconstraint or Max norm enabled the training model to achieve its bestaccuracy. The obtained results are compared to the results in Table 9 obtained by Ref. [64] on the same dataset. In Ref. [64], the authors proposed auxiliary\", 'NNs to predict the parameters of theﬁrst hidden layer of the classiﬁcation', 'NNs and different features embedding techniquessuch as Random projection(RP), Per class histogram, and SNPtoVec havealso been proposed. Achieving such prediction accuracy obtained withSNP data, these regularization techniques will allow us to face morecomplicated problems in many domains such as preventive medicine.8. ConclusionIn this work, we have explained stochastic gradient descent optimi-zation technique with back-propagation in training', 'DLalgorithms. To prevent overﬁtting problem, regularization techniques are studied and,theoretical relationship between Dropout and L', '2regularization is established. Experimental results have shown that Dropout, when it iscombined with techniques such as batch normalization, max-norm orunit-norm gives better performance than L', '1andL2regularization techniques.For future work, we expect to further study these regularizationtechniques in', 'DNNand use them to analyze gene expression pro ﬁle data with the aim of predicting rare diseases.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂuence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentsThis project was partly funded by H3ABioNet, which is supported bythe National Institutes of Health Common Fund under grant numberU41HG006941.AppendixIn this section, we report results obtained by Singh et al.

Among the AI tech-', 'niques, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have shown tremendous promise in drug discovery.

However, despite these advancements, certain areas in drug discovery face data scarcity, particularly ', 'in neglected, rare, and emerging viral diseases. Few-shot learning (FSL) is an emerging approach that addresses ', 'the challenge of limited data in drug discovery. FSL enables ML models to learn from a small number of examples ', 'of a new task, achieving commendable performance by leveraging knowledge learned from related datasets or ', 'prior information. It often involves meta-learning, which trains a model to learn how to learn from few data. This ', 'ability to quickly adapt to new tasks with low data circumvents the need for extensive training on large datasets. ', 'By enabling efficient learning from a small amount of data, few-shot learning has the potential to accelerate the ', 'drug discovery process and enhance the success rate of drug development. In this review, we introduce the ', 'concept of few-shot learning and its application in drug discovery. Furthermore, we demonstrate the valuable ', 'application of few-shot learning in the identification of new drug targets, accurate prediction of drug efficacy, ', 'and the design of novel compounds possessing desired biological properties. This comprehensive review draws ', 'upon numerous papers from the literature to provide extensive insights into the effectiveness and potential of ', 'few-shot learning in these critical areas of drug discovery and development.   ', 'Introduction ', 'The field of Computer-Assisted Drug Design (CADD) has seen ', 'remarkable progress and is constantly evolving [1]. CADD techniques ', 'can be broadly classified as Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) [2] and ', 'Ligand-Based Drug Design (LBDD) [3], based on the information and ', 'availability of protein/target and ligand structures, respectively. The ', 'term artificial intelligence was introduced by John McCarthy in 1956, ', 'who defined it as the field dedicated to the creation of intelligent ma-', 'chines [4]. Essentially, AI encompasses the capacity of machines to carry out tasks in response to different conditions. In recent years, AI has ', 'garnered considerable attention for its aptitude to learn from data and ', 'accomplish specific tasks, and the pharmaceutical industry has equally ', 'recognized and embraced its immense potential [5–8]. AI algorithms are ', 'now widely applied in various computational approaches for CADD, ', 'including the prediction of 3D protein structures [9,10], the develop -', 'ment of docking scoring functions [11], the execution of molecular ', 'docking [12,13], de novo design [14], the establishment of QSAR ', '(Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models [15], and the ', 'prediction of synthetic routes and synthetic accessibility [16], among ', '*Corresponding author.

', 'However, within the field of drug discovery, certain areas like ', 'neglected, tropical [17–20] and rare diseases [21–23] frequently face a ', 'scarcity of comprehensive datasets. This constraint gives rise to concern ', 'since models encounter difficulties in achieving high performance and ', 'effectively generalizing to compounds beyond the known chemical ', 'space [24]. This difficulty poses a significant obstacle for drug discovery, ', 'particularly when endeavoring to identify novel scaffolds from predicted ', 'compounds within academic and open science research. ', 'Few-shot learning (FSL) is a specific subfield within ML that is uti-', 'lized in scenarios where data resources are limited. It aims to achieve ', 'satisfactory learning performance despite the constraints of limited su-', 'pervised information available in the training set. This training set ', 'consists of input examples along with their corresponding output labels ', '[25]. Consequently, various techniques have been developed in order to ', 'enhance FSL, including transfer learning [26,27], neural network, and ', 'meta-learning [28,29]. These methods aim to address the limitations ', 'associated with learning from limited examples and improve the per-', 'formance of models in FSL scenarios. ', 'The Transfer Learning (TL) involves leveraging pre-existing knowl -', 'edge from \"upstream\" tasks and applying it to a smaller, distinct but ', 'correlated, task, thereby enhancing the modeling performance even ', 'with limited samples [30]. In contrast, meta-learning in neural net-', 'works, often referred to as “learning to learn”, refers to the ability of an ', 'algorithm to improve its performance for each task through experience, ', 'considering the number of tasks as well [31]. This approach is applied to ', 'learning episodes obtained from a specific task family, resulting in a base ', 'learning algorithm that exhibits strong performance when faced with ', 'new tasks drawn from the same family [32]. ', 'These algorithms can be employed using various approaches to ', 'address the challenges posed by limited data. In this review, we show the ', 'application of FSL in the field of drug discovery, providing examples ', 'using QSAR and other methodologies. By highlighting these examples, ', 'we hope that researchers will be encouraged to explore and utilize FSL ', 'for modeling datasets with scarce resources. ', 'Few-Shot learning ', 'Few-Shot Learning (FSL) can be employed in various types of data for ', 'supervised learning problems. These include: (i) classification: this type ', 'of FSL approach, known as N-way-K-shot, involves considering N from ', 'the number of classes, and K is the number of examples. Alternatively, ', 'one-shot learning (OSL) is employed when only one example is avail-', 'able, while zero-shot learning (ZSL) is applied when zero examples are ', 'provided [33,34]; (ii) regression: FSL can also be applied to regression ', 'tasks, where the goal is to estimate a function based on only a few ', 'input-output example pairs sampled from that function. In this scenario, ', 'the output represents the observed value of the dependent variable, ', 'while the input records the observed value of the independent variable ', '[25,35]. Furthermore, FSL can be used in semi- or unsupervised ', 'learning, using the reinforcement learning to weight orient the prior ', 'knowledge and prediction between the tasks [36,37]. ', 'The taxonomy of FSL revolves around the concept of an unreliable ', 'empirical risk minimizer [25]. In this framework, the hypothesis h is ', 'minimized based on the empirical risk, which is derived from the error ', 'decomposition of the model’s poor decision-making. When a sufficient ', 'number of supervised samples are available, the empirical risk can ', 'approximate to the expected risk, leading to favorable performance and ', 'accurate predictions [38,39]. ', 'Various methodologies have been developed to address this problem, ', 'and they can be categorized into different approaches to use prior ', 'knowledge. According with Wang and co-workers [25], based on which ', 'aspect is enhanced using prior knowledge, existing FSL works can be ', 'categorized into the following perspectives: (i) Data, where prior ', 'knowledge is used to augment and increase the number of samples, ', 'leveraging related, labeled, and unlabeled data can be employed to augment the low data available; (ii) Model, where prior knowledge is ', 'used to constrain the model and result in a smaller hypothesis space ', 'between empirical and expected risk, training the model on tasks similar ', 'to the target problem, it can acquire transferable knowledge and ', 'improve its generalization capabilities; and (iii) Algorithm, where prior ', 'knowledge alters the search strategy to better approximate empirical ', 'and expected risk, employing algorithms specifically designed for FSL ', 'can further refine predictions or develop new algorithms capable of ', 'generalizing predictions with minimal data (Fig. 1). ', 'Apart from these, other authors presented alternative taxonomies for ', 'FSL, including metric-based, data-based, and optimizer-based ap-', 'proaches [40–42]. While some authors limit the scope of FSL to transfer ', 'learning and meta-learning, it is important to note that FSL is a broader ', 'problem and can be addressed using various approaches. It is worth ', 'mentioning that even automated machine learning (AutoML) [29] ', 'techniques can be adapted to tackle FSL problems. ', 'In addition to the mentioned architectures, there are various other ', 'approaches that can be utilized for FSL, including Siamese networks ', '[43], prototypical networks [44], kernel networks [45], bi-directional ', 'LSTM [46], convolutional neural networks [24], generative neural ', 'networks [47], matching networks [41], and others. The method of ', 'choice depends on the specific requirements and objectives of the ', 'problem, aiming to achieve accurate predictions even when only a few ', 'or zero examples are available. ', 'We performed a search on Google Scholar and PubMed, using the ', 'keywords \"Few-shot learning for CADD\", \"Few-shot learning for Drug ', 'Discovery\", \"Few-shot learning for Drug Design,\" \"Meta-learning for ', 'CADD,\" \"Meta-learning for Drug Discovery,\" \"Low-resource for Drug ', 'Discovery,\" and \"Meta-learning for Drug Design\". These papers were ', 'classified based on their architectures and objectives, following the ', 'taxonomy proposed by Wang et al. [25], which includes data, model, ', 'and algorithm taxonomies. Some selected papers will be thoroughly ', 'discussed within its respective taxonomy category. Table 1 includes ', 'details of each paper found, including the dataset, features, architec -', 'tures, type of prediction, taxonomy, metrics, and year of publication. ', 'Recent advances in FSL for drug discovery ', 'In the following sections, we will present and discuss the recent ', 'advances in FSF for drug discovery, exploring its three major branches: ', 'data, model, and algorithms. ', 'Data ', 'Within each category, there are various methodologies employed to ', 'tackle the FSL problem. Data augmentation can be achieved by utilizing ', 'the training set samples, weakly or unlabeled data sets, or similar data ', 'sets. ', 'The three methodologies differ in terms of the type of data utilized in ', 'the training set. In the case of augmenting data using the sample of the ', 'training set, additional samples are generated by applying variations to ', 'the existing data. When augmenting data using weakly or unlabeled data ', 'sets, the augmentation process involves incorporating weakly or unla-', 'beled samples from large data sets. Lastly, for augmenting samples using ', 'similar data sets, aggregation techniques are employed to combine ', 'similar samples from large data sets, which are commonly utilized in ', 'generative neural networks, in this approach, the large data should be ', 'labeled, different from weakly or unlabeled data [25]. ', 'The work described by Meng, Zhao, and King (2023) adapt to the ', 'taxonomy of transforming data from the training set, when the model ', 'performs the augmentation during modeling [81]. The authors used a ', 'motif-based task augmentation, a meta-learning framework that learns ', 'to adapt to new tasks with few examples by augmenting the training set ', 'with molecular motifs. This approach begins with recursive decompo -', 'sition of molecules in the dataset into substructures until each sub-', 'structure appears more frequently than a specified threshold. An S.

Artificial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 4 (2023) 100086', '3extracted motif vocabulary serves as external memory. In meta-training ', 'tasks, support/query samples retrieve relevant motifs from the vocab -', 'ulary. Using convex combinations, the approach creates prototype ', 'clusters to represent each class. Then, the authors evaluated the effec-', 'tiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets for molecular ', 'property prediction. The results demonstrated that incorporating ', 'motif-based task augmentation significantly improves the performance ', 'of FSL models compared to conventional approaches [81]. Furthermore, ', 'the technique exhibits robustness across different molecular property ', 'prediction tasks, highlighting its potential for practical applications in ', 'drug discovery and other molecular-related domains. ', 'The paper described by Gao and co-workers [63] can be classified as ', 'a framework to transform samples from similar datasets, when is ', 'aggregated or adapting data from similar and large data set. The authors ', 'compose a two-step approach where the low dimensional deep learning ', 'model captures the overall atomic properties, while the fragment-based ', 'GCN focuses on the local environment of atoms. In the first step, the low ', 'dimensional deep learning model is trained to predict atomic properties ', 'based on simplified atomic descriptors. This model provides an initial ', 'estimation of the atomic properties in a fast and efficient manner. In the ', 'second step, a fragment-based GCN is applied to refine the predictions ', 'by considering the interactions between atoms and their local environ -', 'ments [63]. Finally, the authors evaluated the performance of their ', 'method based on various datasets for atomic and inter-atomic property ', 'prediction. The results demonstrated that this combined approach ach-', 'ieved high accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs ', 'compared to traditional methods [63]. ', 'Model ', 'The model concept is divided in four categories: multi-task learning, ', 'representation modeling, learning with external memory, and genera -', 'tive models. The initial classification is multi-task learning, which in-', 'volves parameter sharing or use the same parameters the across tasks to ', 'facilitate learning. Although this taxonomy is widely applied and well ', 'established in drug discovery [70,86–96], it has been already revised ', 'and discussed previously by other authors [97,98] and therefore will not ', 'be the focus of this review. In the following sections, we will discuss ', 'representation learning, learning with external memory, and generative ', 'modeling. Representation learning ', 'Representation learning in FSL refers to the process of learning a low- ', 'dimensional representation or embedding space for the input data, ', 'where similar samples are closer to each other and dissimilar samples ', 'are farther apart (Fig. 2). This embedding space enables effective ', 'generalization and inference even with limited labeled data [99]. ', 'One popular approach in representation learning is to use deep ', 'neural networks (DNNs), such as graph convolutional neural networks ', '(GCNs), to learn the representations. These networks are trained on ', 'large-scale datasets to capture the inherent structure and patterns in the ', 'data. The learned representation can then be used for FSL tasks by ', 'leveraging the similarity or distance between samples in the embedding ', 'space [41,44]. ', 'Language Model and GCNs (LM-GVP) is a deep learning framework ', 'designed for protein property prediction created by Wang and collabo -', 'rators [68], incorporating both sequence and structural information. ', 'The technique aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods by ', 'leveraging the power of language models and GCNs. The language ', 'model processes protein sequences to capture sequential patterns, while ', 'the GCNs utilizes structural information encoded as graphs to capture ', 'spatial relationships among each amino acid, specifying the task. The ', 'framework is trained on a large dataset and demonstrates impressive ', 'performance in various protein property prediction tasks. Its extensi -', 'bility allows for the incorporation of additional features and information ', 'sources, making it versatile and adaptable to diverse prediction prob-', 'lems. LM-GVP represents a promising approach for accurate and ', 'comprehensive protein property prediction by leveraging both sequence ', 'and structural characteristics of proteins [68]. ', 'Zhang and colleagues [84] introduced a novel technique for few-shot ', 'drug synergy prediction using a prior-guided hypernetwork architec -', 'ture. This approach addresses the challenges in discovering effective ', 'drug combinations and advancing precision medicine. The hypernet -', 'work learns prior knowledge about drug synergy from the training data ', 'and generates task-specific weights for the main network, allowing the ', 'model to adapt to different combinations. The FSL approach trains the ', 'model on limited drug combination examples to handle scenarios with ', 'scarce data. By incorporating additional prior information, such as ', 'drug-target interactions and molecular properties, the model gains ', 'valuable guidance and improves prediction accuracy. The model ’s per-', 'formance is evaluated on a validation set to optimize hyperparameters, ', 'Fig. 1.Three key approaches to improve predictions for few-shot problems. Firstly, low data can be supplemented by incorporating related, labeled, and unlabeled ', 'data. Secondly, to enable generalization with only a few examples, the model can leverage insights from related tasks. Lastly, an algorithm can be refined or ', 'developed to enhance prediction generalization for scenarios with limited or no samples. S.

By leveraging the relationships between chemical proper -', 'ties, the technique enhances the model ’s ability to generalize and make ', 'reliable predictions with limited data. ', 'In their research, He and co-workers [67] developed a novel tech-', 'nique that utilizes mutual information, a statistical dependence mea-', 'sure, to establish connections between peptide sequences and their ', 'bioactivity.

', 'In another notable contribution, Lv and collaborators [79] intro-', 'duced a technique for low-data drug discovery by employing meta ', 'learning in conjunction with graph attention networks.

These findings underscore the ', 'tremendous potential of meta learning with graph attention networks in ', 'accelerating the drug discovery process and facilitating the identifica -', 'tion of potential candidates even with limited labeled data. ', 'FSL models and their performance in property and biological ', 'activity prediction ', 'Focusing on papers that applies FSL for molecular property predic -', 'tion, we found around eight manuscripts which use toxicity data sets ', 'such as Tox21, MUV, SIDER, QM9 and ToxCast [48,54,61,65,76,78,79, ', '81]. The papers listed above focus on few-shot molecular property ', 'prediction and adopt various techniques to address this challenging task. ', 'Notably, the best metrics were achieved by Meng and collaborators for ', 'Tox21, MUV, SIDER, and ToxCast [81], followed by Ju et al. [78] and ', 'Wang and colleagues [61].

Despite the superior metrics achieved by ', 'Meng et al., the models ’ interpretability was not explicitly explained, ', 'unlike Wang et al., which demonstrated interpretability by capturing ', 'relationships between molecular properties and predictions. ', 'In terms of architecture, Altae-Tran et al. [48] appears to employ a ', 'relatively simpler and more straightforward design compared to the ', 'other analyzed papers. Since the focus is on one-shot learning, their ', 'model is tailored to learn from a single instance and make predictions ', 'accordingly, potentially involving less complex computations and a ', 'reduced number of layers in comparison to other methods that incor -', 'porate advanced techniques such as graph attention networks or trans -', 'formers. Conversely, papers by Meng et al. [81], Lv et al. [73], and ', 'Torres et al. [76] may feature more intricate architectures. These papers ', 'introduce meta-learning approaches or utilize advanced graph-based ', 'models and transformers, which typically require more sophisticated ', 'computations and a deeper network structure to effectively capture and ', 'process the complex relationships in molecular data. Despite that, ', 'Altae-Tran et al.

This diversity underscores the need for a standardized approach ', 'that can be employed in research endeavors seeking to leverage FSL ', 'methodologies. The work described by Stanley et al. [28] contributes ', 'significantly to this field by providing an accessible dataset, the FS-Mol, ', 'that facilitates the refinement and application of FSL techniques to ', 'biological activity prediction. However, only a limited number of ', 'studies, like Schimunek et al. [72], have utilized the FS-Mol dataset to ', 'enhance existing methodologies, demonstrating improved efficacy and ', 'accuracy in their predictions. ', 'Challenges in FSL for CADD ', 'Despite its promise, few-shot learning for CADD faces many chal-', 'lenges, such as the need for high-quality and diverse training data, ', 'model interpretability, and addressing issues of bias and fairness, ', 'especially when applying personalized medicine approaches. ', 'High-quality and diverse training data ', 'The quality of available data can vary widely, and bias can be ', 'introduced during data collection or curation. Biased or noisy data can ', 'lead to suboptimal model performance and potentially biased drug ', 'discovery outcomes. As well as data that span a wide range of molecular ', 'structures, targets, and properties. Ensuring that the -FSL model is ', 'exposed to diverse chemical and biological spaces is challenging. ', 'Limited diversity in the training data can lead to poor generalization. To ', 'exemplify this, Stanley and collaborators [28] used the ChEMBL data ', 'only with IC50 and/or EC50 and compounds with high molecular weight, ', 'is worth mention even with their encouraging results, ChEMBL data has ', 'different levels of confidence, which is crucial for any methodology of ', 'QSAR. ', 'Interpretability ', 'Understanding why a FSL model makes a particular prediction is ', 'crucial in drug design. Black-box models may not provide interpretable ', 'explanations, which can be problematic when trying to identify poten -', 'tial drug candidates or understand molecular interactions. Therefore, ', 'interpretability of FSL models is a significant challenge in the field. ', 'Among the FSL papers analyzed, the level of interpretability varies. ', 'Wang et al. [61] demonstrated the interpretability of their models by ', 'capturing the relationships between molecular properties and pre-', 'dictions. Lv et al. [73], Yao et al. [65], and Ju et al. [78] offered insights ', 'into crucial molecular interactions, chemical property relations, and ', 'improving interpretability. Lu et al. [80], Liu et al. [58], interpreted ', 'their generated FSL models with experimental results and experimental ', 'data already published in literature, and He et al. [67] presented the ', 'relationship between the peptides residues and the models learning, ', 'which are very important to understand the model and how they learn ', 'with the data. In contrast, Altae-Tran et al. [48], Guo et al. [54], and ', 'Torres et al. [76] lack interpretability of models due to the limitation or ', 'complexity of the FSL models. ', 'Ethical issues and regulatory acceptance ', 'As FSL become more influential in drug discovery, ethical concerns ', 'related to their use may arise. There could be questions about the fair-', 'ness and transparency of these models, especially when they impact ', 'patient treatments and outcomes. Moreover, convincing regulatory ', 'agencies (such as FDA, EPA and others) to accept and validate the use of ', 'FSL models in drug discovery and toxicity research is a significant ', 'challenge. There may be a need to develop new regulatory frameworks ', 'and guidelines. Model complexity ', 'FSL models can use different levels of complexity such as augmenting ', 'data and learn an algorithm or augmenting data with representation ', 'learning. Due to the new subject of FSL for biological activity prediction, ', 'the use of different levels and types of data become difficult to compare ', 'the complexity between the models, with exception of manuscripts using ', 'the FS-Mol dataset [28,72]. On the other side, for molecular property ', 'prediction is possible to compare the approaches published by Meng ', 'et al. [81], Ju et al. [78], and Wang et al. [61] that used the same data ', '(MUV, SIDER, Tox21, and ToxCast). This comparison revealed that the ', 'complexity of models can to be used to achieve a better performance for ', 'complex data. ', 'Addressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary collabo -', 'ration between machine learning experts, medicinal chemists, bi-', 'ologists, and regulatory agencies. Moreover, advances in data collection ', 'and curation, and model interpretability techniques specific to drug ', 'discovery will be crucial for the successful application of few-shot ', 'learning in this field. ', 'Perspectives and guidelines for using FSL for CADD ', 'As shown in this review, there are many successes cases emphasizing ', 'the significance of FSL in CADD, particularly when supported by ', 'compelling experimental results. Molecular property-related studies ', 'often rely on established datasets for model generation, facilitating ', 'effective comparisons with existing literature. In contrast, biological ', 'activity-focused manuscripts employ diverse datasets, such as ChEMBL, ', 'BindingDB, ZINC, FDA-approved drugs, Ellinger, and others, which ', 'hinders the establishment of a universal benchmark for model evalua -', 'tion. One promising approach to kickstart this process involves utilizing ', 'the FS-Mol dataset, made available by Stanley et al. [28], enabling the ', 'exploration of novel models and advancing interpretability in AI-driven ', 'drug discovery—an area of ongoing importance. ', 'The undeniable efficacy of FSL is evident through its impressive re-', 'sults and predictions. However, the prevalence of complex models raises ', 'the question of whether such intricacy is truly essential. Interestingly, ', 'Occam’s Razor theory is often adhered to in model selection, favoring ', 'simplicity as the optimal approach [104,105].

While some molecular property datasets indicate improved ', 'metrics with more model complexity [61], the question remains less ', 'resolved for biological activity datasets, warranting more research to ', 'identify simple and explainable FSL models capable of surpassing the ', 'predictive performance of traditional machine and deep learning ', 'models. ', 'As discussed, FSL can indeed be applied to various aspects of CADD. ', 'If one wants to start exploring FSL approaches, first need to select a ', 'specific CADD task you want to address with FSL, which can be pre-', 'dicting the activity of molecules against a specific target, identifying ', 'potential drug candidates, or optimizing molecular structures for spe-', 'cific properties.

', 'Conclusions ', 'FSL has several potential applications in the field of drug design and ', 'discovery. As perspectives on how this approach could be used: 1. ', 'Identifying new drug targets: one potential application of FSL in drug ', 'discovery is to identify new drug targets based on few data.

Predicting drug activity/efficacy: ', 'FSL could also be used to predict the activity of new drug candidates ', 'based on low data. To recognize common features and properties of ', 'effective drugs to predict which new compounds are likely to be effec-', 'tive based on their chemical properties and other characteristics. 3. ', 'Designing new drugs: Another potential application of FSL in drug dis-', 'covery is to design new drugs based on limited data. By training models ', 'to recognize common features and properties of existing drugs to ', 'generate new drug candidates with similar properties, but optimized for ', 'specific targets or indications. 4. Personalized medicine: FSL could also ', 'be used to develop personalized medicine approaches based on ', 'restricted data from individual patients, to predict which treatments are ', 'likely to be most effective for individual patients based on their unique ', 'characteristics and medical histories. Therefore, we can conclude that ', 'FSL has the potential to accelerate drug discovery and improve ', 'personalized medicine by enabling models to learn and generalize to ', 'new tasks and domains. However, there are still several challenges that ', 'need to be addressed, such as data quality, model interpretability, and ', 'ethical considerations. ', 'In this comprehensive review, we provide an in-depth analysis of the ', 'latest research papers in the field, focusing on the growing significance ', 'of representation learning approaches in accomplishing remarkable re-', 'sults for FSL tasks. The appeal of this approach lies in its straightforward ', 'calculation of similarities between embeddings, as opposed to the uti-', 'lization of intricate meta-learning architectures, making it particularly ', 'intriguing. Nevertheless, delving deeper into the field of FSL with meta- ', 'learning models in the context of drug discovery, even with the demand ', 'for substantial computational resources, offers promising opportunities ', 'to tackle diverse challenging endpoints like ADME/Tox, as well as ', 'neglected, tropical, and rare diseases that may suffer from limited re-', 'sources. While the introduction of new methodologies is undoubtedly ', 'valuable, there still exists untapped potential for exploring these ', 'methodologies in crucial areas such as scaffold generalization, ', 'explainable machine learning, and the chemical space encompassed by ', 'these models. Finally, bridging the gap between computational science ', 'and medicinal chemistry is crucial to develop models that not only ', 'perform well but also possess the capability to accurately and cost- ', 'effectively predict new drugs, solve protein structure-related prob-', 'lems, assess drug synergy probabilities, and evaluate drug toxicity and ', 'ADME properties.

So the article researches the methods of 3ds file read, render and control in Open GL, and applies the method into the system of the borehole operation operate simulation and drilling, and achieve better results', '[2]. 2. 3DS file format 3DS file is saved as chunk structure.  Beginning of a chunk is 2 bytes ID, 4 bytes chunk length information, and then is the main date of the chunk. 3DS file is ope ned in hex format, the data is saved according to the lower is in the front, and the higher is in the back. For example, 2 bytes FF AF is integer in hex, AF is higher byte and FF is lower byte; 93 8E 06 00 is long intege r, 8E 93 is lower byte and 00 06 is higher byte. There is a basic chunk in every 3DS file, The ID of the chunk is 4D4D, the subchunks are the main edit chunk with ID 3D3D, the key chunk with ID B000. The structure of the chunk and nested relationship of every chunk is complex. Now let’s briefly describe several main chunks. 2.1.  The main edit chunk', '˄0X3D3D˅ The states of current edited scene and the configuratio n information of current window are saved in the main edit chunk (0X3D3D), which is used to describe scene information, these information is not only important geometry information used to display three dimensional graph but also the key point research part of loading 3DS file based on OpenGL. 2.2. The material chunk(0XAFFF', '˅ Material chunk(0XAFFF) defines the material attribute of  objects, which includes the name,color and texture of material. If the material includes texture,the name, the alpha information, the position and the UV map of textures are also saved in the subchunk of material chunk. 2.3. The Object Chunk', '˄0X4000˅ Object chunk includes object mesh chunk (0X4100) and object material chunk (0X4130). The vertex of model, the UVW of vertex, face information and edge  information are saved in object chunk. The endowed material information in current object is saved in objec t material information. The difference between material chunk and object material chunk is that 3DS file ’s material library information is saved in material chunk, compare with it, material information in current object is saved in object material chunk. 2.4. The Other Chunks If the information of chunk is unknown or invalid for displaying model, we should skip current chunk and directly read next chunk. 3. Read 3DS File   According to the characteristics of the 3DS file structure, we will illustrate the basic data structure and loading flow in reading file', '>\\x16@. 3.1. The basic data structure 3DS file is saved as nested chunk structure, so it shou ld be divided into chunk.Defining the data structure of basic chunk as follows: 179  LiuFang and LiuXianmei  /  AASRI Procedia   1  ( 2012 )  177 – 182 ', ' struct tChunk {   unsigned short int ID;  // ID the ID of chunk unsigned int length;   //  the length of chunk unsigned int bytesRead;//the number of bytes readed}; After abstracting the face chunk ,material chunk and object chunk structure, the structure definition of basic model in scene is arrived, as flows: struct tModel  {   int numOfObj;       //The number of objects int numOfMat;       //the number of material vector<tMat> pMat;   //', 'Material linked list ', 'vector<tObj> pObj;  //object linked list CVector3 Pos;      //position CVector3 Rot;      //rotation CVector3 Sca;      //Scale   }; 3.2. Reading and loading file flow The chunk structure of 3DS is fixed and nested, we shou ld read file in recursive rule, and the condition of return back is whether the bytes read is equal to the chunk length.Jump from father ch unk to subchunk could be realized by switch statement, which subchunk branch could be enter is through the subchunk ID .If we want to skip an unused chunk, the pointer point to f ile could be moved forward chunk length-6 bytes, and then skip this chunk by break statement, and process next chunk.If we want to read a chunk, for example material chunk, when the ID is 0XAFFF, first self add variab le numOfMat used to record material number, then distribute an empty structure to current ma terial chunk, and then Recurs call function ProcessNextMaterialChunk() to read relative information', '[4]. Whole program will end after main chunk is all read. The main flow of read program is as figure 1.

Draw and Control Model 4.1. Data Processing The information directly getted from the 3DS file can not reach requirement of rendering model in OpenGL, so the data is must to be processed, including the Coordinate conversion and the vertex normal vector calculation. \\x14\\x11 The Coordinate conversion\\x03The coordinate system of OpenGL is different to 3DS MAX. In this article, the reading program is designed like that, swapping the coordinate of y and z, and then saving the swapped data when reading vertex list data. Compare with processing after reading data, this method could save time and space in processing.\\x03 2. The vertex normal vector calculation The render effect of the vertex- triangle 3D model depends on vertex normal vector’s setting, so we must allocate a normal vector for every vertex in model, which could be used to compute lighting effects and judge the orientation of the triangle face relative to the obser ver. From solid geometry knowledge, we could know that all vertex normal vector in the same face is not necessarily same, the normal vector of a point is equal to the average of all face to this point for vertex. Reading program first initializesed all model vertex normal vector as(0.0,0.0,0.0),then computed normal vector of every face separately ,and then add it to vertex normal vector of this face, finally normalized all vertex normal vector, the final compute result of the vertex normal vector will arrived. 4.2. Render Model's geometry, material information are saved in relevan t data structure, rendering is according to these information, draw scene to the screen with graphic command provided by OpenGL\", '[5]. Primitive’s render way is setted up as triangle strip, when rending, program judges whether there is texture mapping, If there is open texture mapping. Mod el renders according to the following 4 steps: (1) configure head fileǄ#include<gl/gl.h>,#include<gl/glu.h>,#include<glaux.h>.

Introduction Ultrasonic flowmeters (USFM) have been rapidly developed in recent years. Due to the non-destructive testing and facilitation of installation and removal, USFMs  became more and more important in fluid flow ', ' *Jia Liu. Tel.: +86-13601238491; fax: +86-010-68940761-210.

These meters can be used as a spool-piece meter  or as a clamp-on meter. But the transit-time clamp-on USFMs are not very robust. Many papers aim to improve the accuracy of the flowmeter. The fluid velocity distribution in the pipe can be obtained using the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach', ' [2]. The relationships between correction factor K and Reynolds number for different ultrasound paths can be obtained through numerical calculation ', '[3]. The accuracy of measuring flow rates changes with the incidence angles', ' [4] and upstream installations [5]. Especially, absolute propagation time (the upstream and downstream transit times) always contains the delays ca used by emitting and receiving circuits and the transit time when the signal spreads in the wall and acoustic wedg e. Thus this paper attempts to address this problem.   One of the most important parameters is the differentia l of transit time. We can get it by several ways. The first one is the cross-correlation algorithm. The peak-searc hing algorithm identifies the peak of the discrete function of the cross-correlation using Cosine interpolation algorithm ', '[6], Gaussian interpolation algorithm [7] or Parabolic interpolation algorithm. The second one is the sample tracking algorithm. In this algorithm, the time shift of each sample in a delayed echo signal is  measured with respect to a continuous, interpolated representation of the reference echo signal', ' [8]. The third one is Spline-Based algorithm. The algorithm uses cubic splines to produce a continuous time represen tation of a reference signal, and then computes an analytical matching function between this reference and a delayed signal. This method is about 500 times better than normalized cross-correlation and entails a substantial computational cost', ' [9]. The proposed method improves the Spline-Based al gorithm by combining with the cross-correlation algorithm. The improved algorithm reduces the comput ational cost without reducing the accuracy. This proposed method is evaluated in experiments. In addition, an important part of the installation process is the transducer separation distance previously described. If the signal received by a transducer when set up at the wrong position, the calculation result would be definitel y wrong. This paper analyzes the affection of the differential separation distance between transducers to show the importance to determine the correct position. Experiments have shown that the separation distance affects the result seriously. 2. Proposed Method The flow velocity is calculated by Eq.(1)   ', '2sin 2 ( ) ( )', 'up delay dn delayDtvtt tt        (1) t', 'dn and t up in (1) represent the downstream and upstream transit times. t denotes the differential time of  ', ' ', 'Fig.1.Ultrasonic transducers are mounted in accordance with V-shape. 16   Liling Ma et al.  /  AASRI Procedia   3  ( 2012 )  14 – 20 ', 'flight. t delay is the transit time that  signal takes when it is not in the liquid.

Ultrasonic transducers are mounted in accordance with the V-shape shown in Fig.1. Transducer X emits ultrasonic waves, and transducer Y receive them. On th e contrary, Transducer Y emits ultrasonic waves, and transducer X receive them. 2.1. Improved Spline-Based Algorithm The differential time of flight, ', 't, is a key parameter, and its order of magnitude is nanoseconds. Since sound velocity in the water is quite fast, so high time resolution is necessary, especially in a small inner diameter, short sound path measurement environment. Typically, the cross-correlation algorithm is the most widely used algorithm. And this method is good at rest raining white noise. But simulation results show that the calculation accuracy of the Spline-Based algorithm is higher than the cross-correlation algorithm.  Assume S', '1 and S 2 are discrete signals of reference signal and delayed signal (continuous time signal), and each group signal has 2048 points.  Extract the kernel signal from S', '1 and S 2 starts from the same point. The kernel signal is the effective part of the ultrasonic. Assume S', '1 [n] and S 2 [n] represent the kernel signal. The length of  S', '1 [n] is N and The length of S 2 [n] is M, where M<N. As is shown in Fig.2, extracting kernel signal is depending on experience. If M and N are too big, the kernel signal will include useless points. In contrast, if M and N are too small, the useful points will be missed. ', ' ', 'Fig.2.

If m i-1<m i+1, then k=i; Else if m i-1>m i+1, k=i-1. k is the parameter we need in Eq.(5). Since k is a known parameter, we can get t by computing only once. Points of signal S', '2 [n] compute with the k+1 to the k+M th segment of S 1 [t] by Eq.(4). It is clear that N-M-1 times calculate quantities are removed. And the speed of algorithm will be increased. 2.2.

When the wall thickness, the wall material, and the fluid medium are all known quantities and the acoustic path is determined in accordan ce with the V-shape, the separate distance between each transducer should be definite. Assume transducer acoustic wedge is organic glass, and the material of the wall is steel. The fluid medium is water and incid ence angle of ultrasonic wave is 37 degree.

', '=37o, and longitudinal wave velocity in organic glass is 2730m/s. If shear wave velocity in steel wall is 3230m/s, we can get ', '=45o. Longitudinal wave velocity in water is 1480m/s at 20oC, then =19o.The differential distance between transduser X and transducer Y is calculated based these angles. ', '2 tan 2 tanAB tLd d          (7) In Eq.(7), d', 't is wall thickness, d is inner diameter. At the same time, the value of L AB in turn affect the value of ', ' in Eq(1). Assume the position of transducer Y shifts to the right axially 2mm from the correct position. This will cause to refraction angle, ', ', 3 degrees bigger than the true value. As a result, the calculation error of water velocity will be up to 11% based on Eq.(1) . Moreover, this impact is more pronounced to small diameter measurement environment. So it is necessary to fine tune the transducer location. 3.

IntroductionThe grape industry is one of the signiﬁcant organic product indus- tries in India. Nearly 2,46,133 tons of fresh grapes worth $334.79 millionwere exported by India in 2018–19 (Indian Grape Forum, 2019). Maha- rashtra (third largest state in India) comprising over 81% of the yield forgrape production in India. However, grape plants are vulnerable to dif-ferent types of diseases due to the ongoing climate conditions such asrain and humidity. Ranchers struggle with various issues in keepinggrape quality and trade responsibilities in diverse business sectors. Sub-sequently, detection and prevention of grape leaf diseases at an earlystage are required by vineyard peasants and research experts.Downey Mildew (induced by Plasmoparaviticola), and Grape Pow-dery Mildew (induced by Uncinulanecator (Schw.) Burr.), are two sig-niﬁcant diseases of grape in numerous parts of the world ( GuanlinLi and Wang, 2011). These diseases affect both leaves and grapefruits.Downey is particularly severe under severe precipitation, high relativemoistness, and signiﬁcant stretches of dampness on leaves and fruits(Indu et al., 2010); whereas high humidity and moist weather favoursthe development of Powdery disease ( Mundankar et al., 2008). Crop protection products (fungicides) are applied to minimize these diseases.Fungicides are expensive for farmers and can cause ecological contami-nation (Weissteiner et al., 2014), (Zhang et al., 2011)(Zhao and Pei, 2012). Thus, only applied when there are vibrant signals about the exis-tence of the disease.Many recent approaches for disease identi ﬁcation depends primarily on visual or image recognition. Nonetheless, this is a tedious and oneroustask. Precision horticulture (McBratney et al., 2005)a i m st oi m p r o v et h e yield per unit of cropland using Information and Communication Tech-nologies (ICT) equipment and advancements. Utilization of ICT devicesand identiﬁcation frameworks have been created to notify the farmersabout the unexpected advent of diseases. Grape diseases can disseminateswiftly in various climates due to temperature and humidity ( Eitzinger et al., 2013) under India climatic conditions. Other countries such as theU.S. and Australia have various systems in place that use both hourlyand daily meteorological conditions to anticipate the onset of a varietyof different crop diseases but not for grapes.

In recentyears, modern mechanisms from the Internet of Things (IoT) have beenutilized to acquire real-time onsite observations ( Pesonen et al., 2014) and it is crucial to build disease models referenced to these IoT devices.The principal objective of this work is to acclimate a disease warningmodel in theﬁeld of viticulture via an innovative framework using sen-sors to measure real-time meteorological conditions within the vine-yard.

Section 4 shows experi-mental results of this system followed by insights on performance.Section 5 concludes the work and proposes commendation of futurework.2. BackgroundDowney Mildew (PlasmoparaViticola) is a major grape disease inIndia (Emmett et al., 1992). Farmers need to use judgment on whetherto use fungicides for Downey Mildew ( Magarey et al., 1991)n o t i n gt h a t both cost and residue levels on crops increase with fungicide use.Clearly, farmers need to restrict the occasions to shower, so that thecost diminishes along with ecological contamination; however theylikewise need to limit the danger of crop failure because of the disease.Decades ago only a few methodologies were utilized to anticipate GrapeDowny Mildew disease. Various statistical models were evolved ( Hill, 2000)(Maurin, 1983)(Tran Manh Sung et al., 1990)(Blaise and Gessler, 1992)(Orlandini et al., 1993) that performed without explaining all functioning details. Robotic models often depends onthe assessment of numerous parameters and require a good knowledgeof mechanisms and impact of various ecological factors on thesemechanisms. In 1992, an Austrian analyst built up the Metos pro-grammed climate station and related software, to foresee the occur-rence of Downy Mildew. The abroad could not precisely determinediseases in India. The Metos software model (G. Pessl, 2000) was per- sonalized for South African environment in 1995. Consequences haverevealed that supplementary splashes were required in the protectionshowering program, rather than proposals of the Metos-2 model, forthe equivalent or even further developed control of Downey mildew.Metos-2 model didn't caution of any Downey mildew contaminations.In 2006 to make it more exact and easy to use DonsigeSkimmelVroeg-Waarskuwings model (DSVW) (Afrikaans for “Downey Mildew Early Warning Model”) was developed (Haasbroek and Vermeulen, 2005). Two signiﬁcant changes were made in comparison to Metos-2, the leafwetness was supplanted with a numerical, non-linear regression andthe Metos-2 model's“Yes/No”admonitions for Downey Mildew dis-eases were supplanted with four classes of potential dangers. The deter-mined leaf wetness of the DSVW model, which used estimated relativedampness and air temperature as info esteems, had a critical coef ﬁcient of assurance of 0.70, compared to estimated leaf wetness.The DSVWmodel yield at present gives a graphical depiction of the past climatefactors (as long as 3 weeks), and an alert of (3 unique tones - high, me-dium and low possibility) of probable favorable condition for both es-sential and optional disease occurrence.Powdery Mildew is another monetarily signi ﬁcant disease. In India, this disease reoccurs in grape plantations with humid climate (e.g.high relative dampness) favoring growth of the disease (\", 'Oberti et al., 2014). Presently, in the hotter and drier grapevine-developing terri-tories, powdery mildew is meticulously constrained by agrochemicals,applied consistently in grape plantations ( Stummer et al., 2003) (Calonnec et al., 2004)(Crisp et al. (2006a))(Crisp et al. (2006b)) (Iriti et al., 2011).Sensor mechanization for grape yield malady has been comprehen-sively analyzed by (Sankaran et al., 2010), who describe current tech- nologies for developing a ground-based sensor framework which aidin supervising disease in plants underﬁeld conditions. The authors also reviewed that the spectroscopic and imaging innovation could beincorporated with a self-governing agricultural automobile for reliableand real time disease detection recognition to accomplish predominantplant disease monitoring and control. Various researchers haveprojected solutions for identifying the condition of a vineyard by utiliz-ing sensors.

The sensor is intended for grapes and can be placed among leavesto convey this important information to viticulturists.On studying all the frameworks referenced and summarized (SeeTable 1.), Our proposed system intendsﬁve primary focal points that have not been discussed simultaneously in the literature. To beginwith, it gives a total hardware and software framework, so similarity is-sues are limited. Secondly, this system tries not to gather informationfrom or through third-party cloud-based platforms Third, because ofthe utilization of standard android Nodes, the arrangement cost of theframework is genuinely reasonable, while giving a decent coverage.Fourth, it focuses on early stage detection in grape production. Lastly,this approach has been devised in a secluded manner for ease in addingnew alerts, sensors, and actuators to the framework.Hence, the objective for this work lies in developing an adaptablesystem for the management of grape diseases that occurs at muchearly stages for crop disease using wireless sensors nodes.3.

Thus, the accuracy achieved has helped thefarmers to reduce the use of fungicides on grape plants. This increasesthe quality of grapes.4.5. Comparison with other systemsDepending upon the proposed system, the grape diseases can be ef-fectively identiﬁed at a much early stage. The novelty of the proposedsystem lies in using the Rain sensor along with temperature and humid-ity sensor. The accuracy of disease notiﬁcation is therefore considerably increased then if a rain gauge was omitted. Thus, the projected devicedemonstrates higher performance in recognizing grape diseases.In this proposed system, temperature and rainfall level have beenused as features to identify the favorable conditions for grape diseasegrowth. The performance of the projected framework has beencontrasted with existing detailed strategies and is conferred in Table 6, proposed (Patil and Thorat, 2016), (Das et al., 2009)(Kharde and Kulkarni, 2016). The systems used for comparison have used IoT, WSNand Image Processing approach. All the systems have been analyzedon our augmented data set and achieved accuracy of approximately90%. However, the accuracy proposed in our system is increased dueto the use of rain sensor along with humidity and temperature sensor.From the comparison, it is clear that the proposed algorithm is capableof identifying Downey and Powdery Mildew grape disease with high ac-curacy better than other systems investigated.5. ConclusionThis paper presents a framework dependent on wireless sensor hubsthat considers remote monitoring of grape plantations. Particularly, theproposed system suggests an executive approach to control Downeyand Powdery Mildew (devastating grape diseases for vine producers).Based on literature surveys, we develop an adaptable system for themanagement of grape diseases at much early stage using wireless sen-sor nodes. When a particular threshold level is achieved, the proposedframework generates an alert to the farmer so they may take preventivemeasures by scouting and potentially using a fungicide. Consequently,the framework avoids the use of pesticides and herbicides when not re-quired, thereby reducing the impact on the surroundings and minimiz-ing the cost to farmers.The system was deployed initially in Prashant Agro Farm(Materwadi, PimalgaonBaswant) and also Boraste farm(Sakura,PimapalgaonBaswant) in September 2019. The arrangement includedtwo types of sensor hubs dependent on ESP8266 microcontrollers.Type-1 nodes monitor environmental information and Type-2, precipi-tation level. A battery was used to satisfy the power supply of the grape-vine in an economical manner. The data gathered by the developedsystem is introduced through an easy to understand LCD interface forrepresentation. The information can also be accessed online throughthe cloud and can be operated from any PC, tablet or smartphone withthe sole prerequisite of having a browser and an Internet link. Addition-ally, the framework offers state-of-art information to deal with thegrape plantation in the form of cautions by means of messages to thefarmers. As regards to the tests performed, it was con ﬁrmed that the framework executed well in a real-world situation and also gave accu-rate information gathered on the climate, the nodes, and the alarms re-lated with the advancement of Downey and Powdery Mildew grapedisease.To summarize, all outcomes from the proposed system af ﬁrm that it offers excellent information to the grapevine producers to automate thedetection of Downey and Powdery Mildew through monitoringweather related variables while providing a cost-effective system forthe ranchers to address real-time climate issues surrounding diseasemanifestation in grape plantations.CRediT authorship contribution statementKainjan Sanghavi:Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing –orig- inal draft, Visualization, Investigation.Mahesh Sanghavi:Data curation,', 'Fig. 6.Occurrence Notiﬁcation for Powdery Mildew showing temperature value 29.60 andCloudy atmosphere on the experimental device.', 'Table 4.1Confusion Matrix of the proposed system for Downey Mildew.n= 430 Predicted (No) Predicted Yes TotalActual (No) TN = 106 FP = 14 120 Actual (Yes) FN = 10 TP = 300 310 116 314 430', 'Table 4.2Confusion matrix of the proposed system for Powdery Mildew.n = 430 Predicted (No) Predicted Yes TotalActual (No) TN = 115 FP = 11 126Actual (Yes) FN = 6 TP = 298 304121 309 430', 'Table 5.1Performance measures Downey Mildew.Measure Estimation %Accuracy 0.944186047 94.4 Recall 0.967741935 96.8 Precision 0.955414013 95.5', 'Table 5.2Performance measures Powdery Mildew.Measure Estimation %Accuracy 0.960465116 96 Recall 0.980263 98 Precision 0.9126984 91.3K.

Training of SFFANN has been shown to be sensitive t o initial weight choice [1]. The random initializ ation of weights was proposed by Rumelhart et al. 1987 [2]. They observed that if weights are initialized to equal values they move in tandem/groups during training, and to break this “weight-symmetry”, the random weight initialization method was proposed. Moreover, it has been suggested in literature that hidden nodes act as feature detectors [3]. Thus, it is desirable that each hidden layer node act as a detector of a separate/distinct feature.  Thus, it becomes meaningful to initialize the weights leading into the hidden node (including the threshold of the node), in a manner that for distinct hidden nodes, th e weights and thresholds belong to distinct region of the initialization interval. This would lead to the net input to distinct nodes being different by design, and during training allow the nodes to adapt to become detectors of distinct features. This, hypothesis is enshrined  in the proposed weight initialization method. The proposed method is compared against four random weight initialization methods (specifically, į = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00), on a set of 6 function approximation tasks.  The ', 'paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presen ts the design of experiments including the architecture of the networks used, the function approximation tasks, the random weight initialization method description and the proposed weight initialization method.

Design of Experiment The universal approximation results for SFFANNs assert that there exist network with sufficient number of sigmoidal output function hidden nodes can approximate any continuous function arbitrarily well [4-6]. Thus, the networks used in this study have use one hidden layer of sigmoidal nodes. A sigmoidal function, in the context of this paper,  is a function that has the following property: Definition 1: A continuous, monotonically increasing and differentiable function ı(x), where x is a real qua', ' ntity, is sigmodial if and only if it satisfies the following: ', '1 ) (lim; 1 ) (lim\\x10   ', 'f \\x10 of oxx', 'xxV V                                                                                                           (1) A function (out of the many functions that satisfy (1) and (2) is the hyperbolic tangent  function (another function is a scaled version of the arc tangent function).

The method IWI distributes the weights leading in to the ith hidden node in the interv', 'al [(2i-1)/(H-1), (2i+1)/(H-1)] (as uniform random numbers in the given interval).

A similar mechanism, but in a random m', ' anner, for the weight initialization of weights based on the fan-in to a node is suggested in[7]. 23  Sartaj Singh Sodhi and Pravin Chandra  /  AASRI Procedia   6  ( 2014 )  19 – 25 ', '2.4. Experiment Procedure The Resilient Backpropagation algorithm is used for training the network. For the purpose of training 200 input data sets are generated by uniform random sampling of the input domain of the function, and the corresponding output calculated from the function to create the training data set. For testing the generalization capability of the trained network(s), a similar set with 1000 data values is generated and called the test set.  For each task and each weight initialization method, 30 networks are trained for 1000 epochs. The average over the 30 networks of the mean squared error (MMSE) for the training set and the test set is reported together with the standard deviation of the mean squared error as a measure of the goodness of training (lower value of MMSE is better) and generalization capability, respectively. Another set of experiments is performed to measure the convergence speed during training, wherein a goal equal to twice the worst MMSE achieved in the previous experiment is kept as a goal of training, and the number of epochs required is measured. Since the maximum epoch of training is kept at 1000, if a network does not converge during training, its epoch value is kept at 1001 (arbitrarily). This creates a small bias in the mean epoch value, but the number of non-convergent networks is also counted and reported for each instance of function approximation task and weight initialization method.  3. Result and Discussion The result of the training experiment and the generaliza tion experiment is summarized in Table 2. From the Table 2, it can be seen that among the random weight initialization methods (WTRs), there is no single method that gives the best result across the function approximation tasks. It can also be seen that the proposed weight initialization method (IWI) always leads to training  and generalization errors that are smaller than any of the random weight initialization methods. We may infer that the proposed method of weight initialization leads to lower value of error after training on an average and up to a factor of 2 deeper minima of the error functional can be achieved on training by the proposed me thod (IWI), as the variation in the ratio of the best result for the WTR for a specific function approximation task to that of the proposed method lies in the interval [1.12, 2.86].  Moreover, from the generalization experiments we may in fer that the networks trained after initialization by the proposed method, have better generalization behavior. That is, the error on data not used for training is lower for networks initialized by IWI. For the generalization experiment, the ratio of the best result for the random weight initialization method (WTR) to the result for the proposed method (IWI) lies between [1.08,2.71] across the function approximation task. Thus, for the generalization experiment also, the proposed method has error on an average across problems that is lower by a factor of about 2 for networks trained using the IWI method. ', 'Table 2.

Conclusions In the current work, a proposal for distribution of SFFANN  input to hidden weight and thresholds of the hidden weight is made in a manner such that these weight s associated with distinct hidden nodes lie in disjoint intervals. On a set of 6 function approximation task, the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated. That is, networks that are initialized by the proposed method, can be trained to achieve deeper minima as compared to random weight initialization method; they generalize better and are faster in training.

Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).In cloud computing, clouds can be described at differentlayers, i.e., SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as aService) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). Although appli-cations for clouds are in development phase, however securityrequirements for the data and services on the clouds are gettingattention of researchers and it has become necessary to con-sider each layer of a cloud for possible attacks. It is worth not-ing that cloud computing systems have many advantages;however, large organizations are still hesitant to shift their set-ups on the cloud mainly due to security issues and risks. Thus,it is important to address the security issues and problems incloud systems, and to ﬁnd a solution for the widespread accep-tance of these solutions. However, being a new domain, theresearch on the requirements and issues regarding security ofclouds is still in its early stages.In the literature, there are different classiﬁcations of cloudsecurity attacks[2–7]targeting a speciﬁc cloud service or a par-ticular kind of the cloud system. Thus there is a need for amore comprehensive classiﬁcation of security attacks acrossversatile cloud services at each layer. This paper proposes amultilevel classiﬁcation of security attacks for different cloudservices and their associated risks at cloud layers. It also dis-cusses provision of dynamic security contract for each cloudlayer that dynamically decides about security requirementsfor cloud consumer and provider.The rest of paper is structured as follows: Section 2consists of related work. Section3presents the proposed multilevelclassiﬁcation of security concerns in cloud computing. Sec-tion4is based on the dynamic security contract concept. Sec-tion5concludes the paper.2. Related workThe application softwares at SaaS are provided with a speciﬁclicense based subscription, pay-as-go[8]. Platform as a Service(PaaS) caters services for operating system, network capacity,storage and multi-tenancy via the Internet. Infrastructure as aservice (IaaS) provides utility computing, automation ofadministrative tasks, dynamic scaling, desktop virtualization,policy-based services, and Internet connectivity. IaaS providesvirtual servers with unique IP address and storage pool asrequired by customers. The concept of infrastructure and hard-ware layer is mentioned by different researchers. Some authorshave suggested that the infrastructure layer offers system soft-ware services and hardware layer provides hardware-based ser-vices. Infrastructure and hardware layers may be combineddue to intrinsic relationship between hardware and software.In[9], security aspects of one of the popular cloud AmazonElastic Compute Cloud (EC2) have been discussed. It consistsof systematic analysis of various crucial vulnerabilities in pub-licly available Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and mecha-nisms to eliminate them. The proposed tool referred to asAmazon Image Attacks (AmazonIA) uses only publicly avail-able interfaces regardless of the underlying cloud infrastruc-ture. As a result of exploiting vulnerabilities and successfulattacks, authors are able to extract sensitive informationincluding passwords, and credentials from AMIs. Theextracted information can be used to initiate botnets, or createback doors to launch impersonate attacks or access sourcecode of a web service available on AMI. The authors have dis-cussed effects of successful attacks and also the methods tomitigate those attacks. Some research groups have workedon the interfaces of both public and private clouds [10]. The public cloud under their consideration is Amazon, while theprivate cloud is Eucalyptus.Authors in[11]consider security as a service for cloud-based applications. The architecture considers the existing ser-vices at different levels. It considers user-centric security i.e.,users have control over their security permitting them to usesecurity solutions across different clouds. They can subscribeto any security solution provided by any cloud provider anduse that particular security solution for their cloud and mayalso have multiple security solutions for a particular servicedepending upon its criticality. The multiple security solutionscan also be used at different levels.Authors in[9]address the security and privacy aspects ofreal-life cloud deployments, while ignoring the malicious cloudproviders or customers. Here authors’ focus is Amazon ElasticCompute Cloud (EC2). They have analyzed the crucial vulner-abilities of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) through an auto-mated tool and as a result of attack information regarding APIKeys, private keys and credentials of publishers were extracted[9]. Vulnerabilities were discovered in Secure Shell. Theextracted information can be further used to create multiplesecurity threats resulting in botnet instances, access of backendservices or code of the Web sites through back-doors content.In[12]authors suggest that security should be provided as aservice and propose a model for security as service. Security asa service implies that the security applications and services canbe provided by a cloud vendor, or cloud consumer or even by athird trust-worthy party. The security service can be in theform of a cloud-based infrastructure or software. The authorshave proposed a component based software model in whichauthorization components can be developed by any partyregardless of being a service provider. An eXtensible accesscontrol markup language (XACML) decision engine that iscomposed of a context handler, a policy decision point and apolicy administration point, can be furnished by reusable com-ponents to augment the security service. By XACML standardattributes of subjects, resources and environments and autho-rization rules can be deﬁned as Boolean expressions. Thus,these types of security services, which can be managed andaltered by cloud customers, are helpful to build trust of cloudcustomers on cloud systems.In[3]Cloud Computing Open Architecture (CCOA) conceptis discussed for clouds in virtual environments. The role andfunctions of the architecture are discussed according to different', 'infrastructures for IT and business systems. Different types ofarchitectures complicate security management for cloud sys-tems. This architecture provides a solution for different securityaspects regarding virtual environments. The authors suggestphysical and logical isolation of data instances for each customerto enhance the data privacy and expeditious replication andrecovery system. Authorized users based on the role-basedaccess control can access the sensitive data on platforms. To pre-vent intrusion attacks, cloud service provider blocks the mali-cious and un-trusted codes enabling digital forensic applications.Research in[14]suggests a trusted computing and attesta-tion system for virtual environments. In virtual environmentssystems are more prone to threats due to the poor computercommunication architectures and hidden network channels.These hidden channels can be a risk since many virtualized net-work channels can be easily observed and hacked.58 S.A. Hussain et al.3. A multilevel classiﬁcation of security concerns in cloudcomputingCloud systems have a layered architecture of different servicesand control levels for users.Fig. 1illustrates the classiﬁcationmodel of security problems at each layer of the cloud system.SaaS, PaaS and IaaS layers are considered for associated secu-rity risks and problems.3.1. Security concerns for Software as a Service (SaaS)SaaS is exposed by attacks on API’s, publishers, web portalsand interfaces. The attacks on the SaaS are categorized intotwo broad groups: attacks on development tools and attackson management tools. Most popular services on SaaS areweb services, web portals and APIs. Intruders’ attempt un-authorized access and gain of services by attacking web portalsand APIs. These attacks affect data privacy. Intruders try toextract the sensitive information of API Keys, private keys,and credentials of publishers via different kinds of attacksand automated tools. Another possibility of attack on thislayer is exposure of secure shell for extracting key credentials.3.1.1. Data protectionIn cloud computing applications are deployed in sharedresource environments; therefore, data privacy is an importantaspect. Data privacy has three major challenges: integrity,authorized access and availability (backup/ replication). Dataintegrity ensures that the data are not corrupted or tamperedduring communication. Authorized access prevents data fromintrusion attacks while backups and replicas allow data accessefﬁciently even in case of a technical fault or disaster at somecloud location. Data are shared and communicated at thecommon network backbone. Hence malicious attackers orintruders can deploy hidden proxy applications between thecloud provider and consumer to scavenge information of logincredentials and session details[4]. An intruder can also per-form packet snifﬁng or IP-spooﬁng as a middle-party andcan access and/or alter the restricted or sensitive information.One possible solution for the data privacy in cloud computingis Cisco Secure Data Center Framework that provides multi-layer security mechanism[4].3.1.2. Attacks on interfacesA successful attack on the cloud interfaces can result in a rootlevel access of a machine without initiating a direct attack onthe cloud infrastructure. Two different kinds of attacks arelaunched on authentication mechanism of clouds. The controlinterfaces are vulnerable to signature wrapping and advancedcross site scripting (XSS) techniques. First kind of attack isreferred to as signature wrapping attack or XML SignatureWrapping attacks. Single signed SOAP message or X.509 cer-tiﬁcate can be used to compromise security of customers?accounts through operations on virtual machines or resettingof passwords. Second type of attacks exploits the vulnerabilityin XSS. The particular vulnerability attack steals usernameand password pair information.3.1.3. Attacks on SSH (Secure Shell)Attacks on Secure Shell (SSH), the basic mechanism used toestablish trust and connection with cloud services, are the mostalarming threat that compromises control trust. According toPonemon 2014 SSH security Vulnerability Report [15], 74 per- cent organizations have no control to provision, rotate, trackand remove SSH keys. Cybercriminals take full advantage ofthese vulnerabilities and use cloud computing to launch differ-ent attacks. An organizations´cloud workload can be used hostbotnets if SSH access has been compromised. Attackers havehosted the Zeus botnet and control infrastructure on AmazonEC2 instances[16]. The different types of attack on SSH', 'Figure 1Classiﬁcation model of attacks at each layer of the cloud system.Security concerns in cloud computing 59include attacks on API keys, attacks on user credentials, andattacks on publisher credentials.3.2. Security concerns for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) andPlatform as a Service (PaaS)IaaS and PaaS layers are overlapped in the model due to theirinterdependency on each other. The attacks on these layers aregrouped into three types: attacks on cloud services, attacks onvirtualization, and attacks on utility computing. The securityconcerns for IaaS and PaaS are discussed below.3.2.1. Hardware virtualizationThe VMs interconnectivity is the biggest security concern inthe designing of cloud computing platform. VMs are linkedusing bridge and route virtual network conﬁguration modes.The bridge mode works as a virtual hub shared among allthe VMs, which may result in snifﬁng the virtual network bya compromised VM. In the route mode, where route worksas a virtual switch, each VM is connected using a dedicated vir-tual interface. Any network intruder in a LAN segment of anetwork can access virtual environments by address resolutionprotocol (ARP) spooﬁng and MAC spooﬁng. ARP spooﬁngalters the ARP tables and management interfaces and systems.On the other hand, an intruder can mimic another hostthrough MAC spooﬁng and also change address of host orguest Virtual Machine (VM) to gain access of restrictedresources[13]. The attacks and exploitation of virtual environ-ments are very diversiﬁed and they will increase in future sinceplatforms are growing in number and complexity. Therefore, amechanism for detecting attacks along with preventions isnecessary.3.2.2. Software virtualizationA software virtualization attack may examine the VM imagesto launch an attack or steal of information, especially targetingdevelopment images, which are accidentally released [21].I ti s also possible to provide a VM image having malware to cloudcomputing system resulting in theft and corruption of data.For example, cloud consumers are enticed to run taintedVM images contributed to image repository manipulatingthe registration process for ﬁrst page listing.3.2.3. Cloud softwaresMulti-tenancy in clouding computing requires multiplexing theexecution of VMs from different consumer on the same phys-ical server[17]. Softwares deployed on guest VM remain sus-ceptible to attack and compromise. A malicious code in VMmay interfere with the hypervisor or other VMs. Shortcomingsin programming interfaces and processing of instructions arethe main targets to uncover vulnerabilities [18]. This security concern also includes indirect attacks such as man-in-the-middle during a live VM migration; insertion VM based root-kit during memory modiﬁcation; a zero-day exploit inHyperVM; side-channel attack to gain information.3.2.4. Utility computingUtility computing is the concept that emerged from grid com-puting, and it combines computation, storage and bandwidthto provide services on the demand through payment by thecustomer. It also provides two basic advantages of cost reduc-tion and scalability. Security risk associated with utility com-puting is access by attackers who want to utilize resourceswithout paying[8]. Majority of hackers and crackers use thecomputing power or storage for the illegal use. The commonuse of public cloud includes e-commerce, web-applicationand Web site hosting making these services vulnerable to vari-ety of attacks on possession, authenticity, integrity and utility.A compromised client may perform a Fraudulent ResourceConsumption (FRC) attack by using the metered bandwidthof web-based service that results in a ﬁnancial burden on thecloud consumer[19].3.2.5. Service Level Agreement (SLA)SLA is an optimal way for ensuring security and trust. Theimplementation of SLA results in a well-designed contract ofresponsibilities between parties that can enhance security level.In cloud environment, SLA can be combined with the web ser-vice level agreement (WSLA) for mitigating security risks [8]. SLA deﬁnes the different levels of security and their complex-ity based on the services for the better understanding of thesecurity policies to a cloud consumer. The existing cloud stor-age systems do not provide security guarantees in their SLAseffecting the adaptation of cloud services. A cloud storage ser-vice may leak private data, return inconsistent data or modifythe data due to bugs, hacking, crashes, or misconﬁgurations.This security concerns require proper SLA guarantee modelssuch as CloudProof[20].Table 1shows multilevel classiﬁcation for the three cloudlayers in terms of cloud service, types of attack, cloud typeand risk levels. Cloud layers are considered as ﬁrst level fol-lowed by cloud services as second level and types of attacksfor these services as third. A risk is associated with each levelof this classiﬁcation. SaaS has low to medium risk level if itis under attack. However attacks on publisher service at thislayer may adversely affect the services. Services at PaaS andIaaS layers are associated with medium to high risks.The classiﬁcation identiﬁes the risk levels as low (less vulner-able), medium, and high (more vulnerable) depending on theexposure of cloud security requirements. Data encryption,multi-tenancy, data privacy, authentication, and authorizationare the security requirements for cloud services. The exposureof these security requirements constitutes different risk levels.For example exposure of multi-tenancy and data privacy forhardware virtualization represents high risk. These levels indi-cate control of a customer given by a service over the cloud sys-tem. The attacks on software layer are generally considered lesssevere and if the attack effects infrastructure or platform layersit has medium to high severity. However it is observed that cer-tain attacks such as attacks on SSH for publisher credentials onsoftware layer are highly adverse. A cloud service offered atPaaS or IaaS provides multiple ways for the exposure of cloudsystem. From this, it may be inferred that major attacks andthreats exist on the underlying layers of a cloud system.At second level available services on PaaS and IaaS consti-tute hardware virtualization, software virtualization, utilitycomputing and development services. Some attacks on theseservices may be severe up to the extent that even the real', 'machines can be affected. Most of intruders try to hack theselayers with the help of ARP spooﬁng, MAC spooﬁng or exe-cuting malicious codes on cloud platforms.60 S.A. Hussain et al.Web services and web portals are attacked to break encryp-tion or to get signatures and user credentials. Attacks on SSH(Secure SHell) extract API keys, user credentials and publishercredentials. Attacks for breaking encryption, extracting signa-tures, keys, and credentials are associated with low to mediumlevel risks. However attack on publisher credentials has high-level risk. Hardware virtualization is attacked through ARPspooﬁng and MAC spooﬁng. Risk level associated with hard-ware virtualization is medium to high. Software virtualizationis threatened by hacking with automated tools and has a highlevel of risk. Malicious codes and scripts can be executed withdevelopment services and these may adversely affect the wholecloud system, and hence risk associated with development ser-vices is high. Utility computing is associated with high risklevel and can be attacked by hacking or for SLA.Table 2presents a mapping of cloud services and cloudsecurity requirements. The mentioned security requirementsare mandatory to achieve the integrity and coherence in thecloud system. These security requirements are data encryption,multi-tenancy, data privacy, authentication, and authoriza-tion. Data encryption and hashing techniques are used to pro-tect the data over the distributed system. Thus, the dataprotection service depends on encryption techniques and pri-vacy policies. If data protection services or web services areattacked, the data encryption and data privacy will be compro-mised because intruder will try to break encryption and hash-ing policies. However physical data storage is not threatenedso risk factor associated is medium. On the other hand, ifAPI’s and web portals are intruded, authentication and autho-rization requirements will be violated. API’s and web portalsprovide a gateway to access cloud systems, thus by attackingthese gateways, attackers can easily expose cloud systems.However these credentials and signatures are expired afterthe session so risk factor associated with these services is lowto medium. Development services provide a way to createother cloud services by customers. By accessing this service,malicious scripts and codes can be executed. Attacks on devel-opment services can expose the data encryption, multi-tenancyand authentication. So this service has a high risk factor. Vir-tualization offers many advantages but these advantages areassociated with the possibility of some threats e.g., multiplenumbers of customers on a single resource can access data inan un-authorized manner. Intrusion on hardware virtualiza-tion may violate multi-tenancy requirement and data privacyand has a high risk factor. If software virtualization and utilitycomputing are attacked, multi-tenancy and authorization arethreatened. Attacks on multi-tenancy jeopardize the logicalseparation of multiple customers on a single resource, andhence risk factor is high.4. Dynamic security provisioningDynamic Security Contract (DSC) between a cloud consumerand a provider is implemented across the layers according toconsumer and provider requirements for services and security.Security gets more stringent for the services offered at cloudprovider layers (PaaS and IaaS). The risk levels associated withthese two layers are in the medium to high range since theattacks on the services of these layers may affect the wholecloud system. Hence level of security is determined dynami-Table 1A multi-level classiﬁcation of security and privacy risk in cloud computing.', 'Cloud layer Cloud service Security concerns Attack type Cloud type RiskSAAS Web service Data protection Privacy All clouds MediumWeb portal Attack on interfaces Attack on signature AMI/EC2 Low Attacks on credentials AMI/EC3 Medium API Attack on SSH Attack on API Keys AMI/EC4 Medium Attack on user credentials AMI/EC5 MediumAttack on publisher credentials AMI/EC6 High PAAS and IAAS Platform virtualization Hardware virtualization ARP Spooﬁng on virtual switching All High MAC spoogin on virtual switching All MediumSoftware virtualization Hacking on computations All Low Development services Cloud softwares Malicious code script All HighComputation services Utility computing Unpaid client attacks All LowSLA Hacking All High', 'Table 2A mapping of cloud service and security requirements.', 'Data encryption Multi-tenancy Data privacy Authentication AuthorizationSecurity requirementsData protection Yes No Yes No NoAPI’s No No No Yes YesWeb portals No No No Yes YesCloud software Yes No Yes No YesHardWare virtualization No Yes Yes No NoSoftware virtualization No Yes No No YesVirtualization No Yes No No YesUtility computing No Yes No No YesSecurity concerns in cloud computing 61cally for cloud consumer and cloud provider through DSC asshown inFig. 2.Fig. 2shows that the serviceX', '1andX 2at SaaS layer has aspeciﬁc risksR, such as attacks on APIs, attacks on interfaces,attacks on publisher, and data protection, having severitylevels such as low, medium and high.

Dynamic Security Contract (DSC) provisioning modelDSC is an approach for agreement between a consumer and aprovider regarding cross layer security provisioning methodscorresponding to the available services. Before establishingthe security model, it is necessary to understand the differentobjectives and outcomes of DSC from consumer as well asprovider perspective.Fig. 3shows the ﬂow of our proposed Dynamic SecurityContract (DSC) in which the consumer is offered a DSC afterinitial contact to the provider. The consumer can have threeavailable options, accept the DSC as it is, negotiate the param-eters as per his requirements or decline the DSC without givingany reason. The provider responds to either of the choices withits own viable set of corresponding options, i.e. Provision ofsecurity if accepted by consumer, alter the DSC keeping inview of its own parameters of cost and Return on investment(ROI) or decline any further contact. The consumer can noweither accept or decline the new offer as there is only one avail-able option for negotiation to simplify the model, and providerresponds with provisioning security or declining the consumerchoices. Consumer and provider have their own set of param-eters to decide the viability of the contract and are discussed infurther sections with the foremost discussion on measurementof security in a quantiﬁable manner.4.1.1.

ConclusionA novel multilevel classiﬁcation of security concerns in cloudcomputing highlighting the effect of different security attackson each cloud layer is presented in this paper. This multilevelclassiﬁcation provides a new dimension to address securityconcerns on multiple levels and minimization of their effects.The level of severity of the attack is also assessed as low, med-ium and high across different security concerns. The securityrequirements for different cloud services are also outlined forthe secure cloud computing. These security requirementsinclude data encryption, multi-tenancy, data privacy, authenti-cation and authorization. These security requirements aremapped to different cloud services to achieve integrity andcoherence in the cloud system. The paper presents a novel con-cept of dynamic security contract to determine the risk leveland type of security required for each service at different cloudlayers for a cloud consumer and cloud provider.Appendix A.

Introduction Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is an important parameter in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) for the structural integrity assessment of structures containi ng cracks and singular stress fields [1]. SIF gives a measure of the intensity of the stress field in the crack tip region. It gives also the possibility to analyze a crack growth or a catastrophic failure if a load is applied to the structure [2]. The stress intensity factors can be calculated using stress and strain analysis or parameters that measure the energy released by crack growth. SIF can be estimated analytically or using numerical techniques [3, 4].Analytical methods are more complex to calculate SIF, however, they have some advantage; an analytical solution can be applied for a range of crack lengths and on the other hand, numerical techniques require the calculation of stress or strain field for each crack length corresponding to each value of SIF.  Stress and strain fields for a given structure can be  calculated using several techniques [5]. The most common and available ones can be found in several commercial packages employing the Finite Element Method (FEM) [6] or the Boundary Element Method (B EM) [7]. Nowadays, new techniques based on mesh less methods such as the Extended Finite Element Mode l (XFEM), are emerging and have several advantages compared to the traditional methods, particularly in problems of fracture mechanics [8]. 2. J-Integral  To determine the energy quantity that descri bes the elastic-plastic behavior of materials, Rice [9] introduced a contour integral or a line integral that encloses the crack front as shown in Figure 1.

Displacement extrapolation  The displacement extrapolation method was developed to obtain crack tip singular stresses and stress intensity factors using only nodal displacements of elements around the crack tip [10]. The near crack tip displacement field may be expressed as a series function of the stress intensity factor, the position to the crack tip as well as the orientation to the crack propagation direction.

Conclusion In this paper, we studied the usefulness of Eddy current sensors as a tool to control cracks and micro cracks in materials. The simulations performed in this study led to the following conclusions: ', '-Determination of the impedance in only one point is not enough to confirm the presence or the absence of a defect for two types of materials (non -magnetic or magnetic). This behavior leads us to the evaluation of the impedance along the tube.  ', '-Detection of an external defect requires the energy of the sensor using high frequencies. ', '-The position of defect (internal, middle or external) has a large effect on the impedance. Obtained results show the great sensitivity of the differential sensor with respect to the detection of the surface defects. However, the major disadvantage of this type of sensor lies in the fact that it is unable to detect a defect located between two reels. ', '-Determination of SIF is an important parameter  in detecting singularities in a given model. 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.09', '0.040.0410.0420.0430.0440.0450.046050001000015000   Color: von Mises  Height: von Mises', '20004000600080001000012000', '00.020.040.060.080.1', '0.040.0410.0420.0430.0440.0450.046-0.1-0.0500.050.1   Color: exy  Height: exy', '-0.08-0.06-0.04-0.0200.0263  Salaheddine Harzallah and Mohamed Chabaat  /  AASRI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  57 – 63 ', ' References [1] A.Zaoui, H.Menana, M.Feliachi,G.Berthiau; Inverse  Problem in Nondestructive Testing Using Arrayed Eddy Current Sensors, Sensors 2010, 10, 8696-8704  [2] S.

Initially,  the procedure  estimates  the ', 'proximity  between  the disease-related  proteins  and the drug targets on ', 'the protein-protein  interactome,  performing  a ﬁrst selection  of candi- ', 'dates.

', 'HD is the most common  monogenic  neurological  disorder.  The on- ', 'set is typically  in the early stage of adult life, and it is characterized  ', 'by motor dysfunction,  cognitive  impairment,  and neuropsychiatric  fea- ', 'tures [ 12 , 15 ]. The autosomal  dominant  mutation  that causes HD is lo- ', 'cated in the HTT gene, and it consists  in a cytosine-adenosine-guanine  ', 'trinucleotide  repetition  (CAG, encoding  glutamine)  leading  to an over- ', 'expansion  of the polyglutamine  (polyQ)  tail in the huntingtin  protein.  ', 'The mutated  protein  tends to aggregate  and accumulate,  forming  inclu- ', 'sion bodies that have deleterious  consequences  for the neural cell. Both ', 'the inclusion  bodies and the length of the CAG expansion  are proven ', 'to play an important  role in the development  of the disease.  The clear- ', 'ance of the ﬁrst ones slows the HD progression,  while the longer the ', 'CAG expansion,  the earlier the disease  may manifest  [15] . The remain-  ', 'ing uncertainty  on the course of HD can be ascribed  to other genetic  ', 'diﬀerences  in the genome  of the patients  [ 12 , 14 ]. ', 'MS is both the most frequent  non-traumatic  disabling  disease  in ', 'young adults [16] and the commonest  demyelinating  disease  [17] . The ', 'etiology  and the mechanism  causing  its worsening  progression  are still ', 'unclear,  nevertheless  it has been proven that a complex  interplay  of ge- ', 'netic and environmental  factors is important  [ 18 , 19 ]. The main known ', 'risk factors are smoking,  childhood  obesity,  infection  with the Epstein-  ', 'Barr virus, and low vitamin  D levels [19] . MS is generally  viewed  as a ', 'two-phases  autoimmune  disease,  in which initially  focal inﬂammatory  ', 'processes  cause a relapsing-remitting  form of the disease,  and subse- ', 'quently  demyelinating  plaques  (lesions  resulted  by the previous  immune  ', 'response)  and oligodendrocyte  damage  lead to neurodegeneration  and ', 'non-relapsing  progressive  course [ 17 , 19 ]. MS is commonly  character-  ', 'ized by progressive  spastic paraparesis,  cognitive  impairment,  and sen- ', 'sory and cerebellar  dysfunctions[19].  ', 'Both HD and MS are still lacking  resolutive  treatments  [ 20 , 21 ], ', 'whose development  needs a deeper knowledge  of the underlying  mech- ', 'anisms [22] . To this aim, network-based  models,  as the ones we utilized  ', 'in this study, could be adequate  theoretical  tools for investigating  such ', 'multifactorial  disorders.  They would allow us to take into account  the ', 'latent complex  structure  of these diseases  without  losing a comprehen-  ', 'sive view [23] . Through  the methodology  presented  here, we were able ', 'to collect a number  of approved  drugs and their plausible  combinations  ', 'that could be proposed  for the treatment  of HD and MS.

The ﬁrst rerun was carried out on the widely ', 'recognized  interactome  from Cheng et al. [5] (16 677 unique proteins  ', 'and 243 603 experimentally  conﬁrmed  protein–protein  interactions).  ', 'The second one was performed  on a drastically  restricted  version  of our ', 'own interactome  (16 954 proteins  and 246 080 interactions),  in which ', 'only interactions  from low throughput  studies (listing less than 20 in- ', 'teractions)  were included.  ', 'Network  proximity  ', 'Proteins  related to a speciﬁc  disease  are unlikely  to be scattered  ', 'throughout  the interactome,  rather, they tend to group together  forming  ', 'the so-called  disease  module  [45] . The relationship  between  a drug and ', 'a disease  could be estimated  by means of an unsupervised  and unbiased  ', 'network-based  approach  [4] , which quantiﬁes  the interplay  of drug tar- ', 'gets and disease-related  genes measuring  a network  proximity.  Here we ', 'used a recently  modiﬁed  version  of such method  [10] that includes  a ', 'term ( 𝑤 ) for taking into account  the degree of the drug targets directly  ', 'into the distance  calculation.  Given 𝐺, the set of disease-related  genes; ', '𝑇 , the set of drug targets;  and 𝑑( 𝑔, 𝑡 ) , the shortest  path length between  ', 'nodes 𝑔( 𝑔 ∈𝐺) and 𝑡 ( 𝑡 ∈𝑇 ) in the human protein-protein  interactome;  the distance  𝑑( 𝐺, 𝑇 ) between  each drug and the disease  was calculated  ', 'as: ', '𝑑 ( 𝐺, 𝑇 ) = 1 ', '|𝑇 |∑', 't∈𝑇 min ', '𝑔∈𝐺 ( 𝑑 ( 𝑔, 𝑡 ) + 𝑤 ) (1) ', 'where 𝑤 weights  the targets based on their node degree in the interac-  ', 'tome ( 𝑤 = − ln ( 𝐷 + 1 ) if the target is related to the disease,  𝑤 = 0 oth- ', 'erwise).  𝐷is the degree of the target in the PPI network.  ', 'Then, for each drug, the signiﬁcance  of its association  to the inves- ', 'tigated disease  was assessed  comparing  the measured  distance  to that ', 'of a dummy  reference  distribution.  This reference  was obtained  com- ', 'puting 10 000 times the distance  ( 𝑑( 𝐺, 𝑅 ) , deﬁned  by Eq. (1) ) between  ', 'the disease-related  genes and randomly  selected  (from the human inter- ', 'actome)  sets of proteins  ( 𝑅 ) matching  the number  of the drug targets.  ', 'Since the degree of the drug targets is already  taken into consideration  ', 'in the distance  calculation,  the sampling  of the randomly  selected  pro- ', 'teins is facilitated  having to match only the number  and not also the ', 'degree distribution  of the drug targets.  The mean 𝜇𝑑( 𝐺,𝑅 ) and standard  ', 'deviation  𝜎𝑑( 𝐺,𝑅 ) of the reference  distribution  were used to normalize  ', 'the observed  distance  into a proximity  value (z-score):  ', '𝑧 ( 𝐺, 𝑇 ) = 𝑑 ( 𝐺, 𝑇 ) − 𝜇𝑑 ( 𝐺,𝑅 ) ', '𝜎𝑑 ( 𝐺,𝑅 ) (2) ', 'Inverted  gene set enrichment  analysis  ', 'Starting  from the hypothesis  that eﬀective  drugs should be able to ', 'restore the healthy  expression  of genes deregulated  by a disease,  the ', 'drugs with signatures  most enriched  in disease-related  genes should also ', 'be the most promising  ones in treating  such disease.  In order to gain this ', 'knowledge,  an Inverted  Gene Set Enrichment  Analysis  [10] (IGSEA)  on ', 'the datasets  (drug signatures)  of LINCS was performed,  looking  for the ', 'disease-related  genes under study. For each analyzed  dataset,  the nor- ', 'malized  enrichment  score and the p-value  (estimated  comparing  the en- ', 'richment  score with those of a null distribution  generated  from 100 000 ', 'permutations)  were computed  for measuring  the enrichment  magnitude  ', 'and its statistical  signiﬁcance,  respectively.  The resulted  p-values  were ', 'then corrected  for multiple  comparison  using the Benjamini-Hochberg  ', 'procedure  [32] , obtaining  the FDR. If the dataset was signiﬁcantly  en- ', 'riched (FDR < 0.25), the corresponding  drug was considered  a potential  ', 'drug candidate.  ', 'Network  separation  ', 'An important  aspect in investigating  drug combinations  is to eval- ', 'uate whether  the two drug-target  modules  are overlapped  (overlap-  ', 'ping exposure)  or separated  (complementary  exposure)  on the human ', 'protein-protein  interactome  [6] . In the case of overlapping  exposure,  ', 'there is a higher similarity  in chemical,  biological,  functional,  and clin- ', 'ical proﬁles.

The idea behind this method  ', 'is that drugs proximal  to the disease  module  should be more eﬀec- ', 'tive than distant ones, as shown by Guney et al. in an extensive  anal- ', 'ysis that considered  known diseases  and disease-associated  genes, as ', 'well as drugs and their targets [4] . Following  Peng’s protocol  [10] , ', 'the procedure  compares  the distribution  of the distances  between  drug ', 'targets and disease-related  proteins  to that of a reference  collection  ', '(see Methods  and Fig. 3 ). For both diseases,  it was possible  to iden- ', 'tify a distance  value below which the two density  curves (drugs and ', 'reference)  drop dramatically.  In particular,  the reference  density  as- ', 'sumes negligible  values for distances  below this point ( Fig. 3 , green ', 'part of the plot).

From this analysis,  685 ', '(11.8%)  out of the 5798 drugs collected  from DrugBank  were consid-  ', 'ered signiﬁcantly  proximal  medicaments  for HD, and 475 (8.2%) for ', 'MS. ', 'In order to evaluate  the impact of a drug on the disease,  we examined  ', 'the eﬀect of its administration  on the expression  of the disease-related  ', 'genes in relevant  cell lines (see Methods).

', 'The drugs that were both signiﬁcantly  enriched  and proximal  to ', 'the disease  were deemed  to be repurposable  drug candidates:  138 for ', 'HD and 38 for MS (Supplementary  Tables 2, 3). The interactions  be- ', 'tween the MS-related-genes,  the drug targets,  and the repurposable  drug ', 'candidates  are visualized  in Fig. 4 (and Supplementary  Figure 4 for ', 'HD), showing  how drugs can be related to the disease  through  their ', 'targets.  ', 'Unfortunately,  only a small portion  of the proximal  drugs has data ', 'in the LINCS database  (21.9%  for HD and 13.7% for MS). Even though ', 'the IGSEA analysis  increases  the reliability  of the results,  it dramatically  ', 'reduces  the number  of molecules  that can be investigated  and possibly  ', 'proposed.

To be more conﬁdent  on the pool of predicted  repurposable  drugs, ', 'we replicated  the entire procedure  using three diﬀerent  interactomes.  ', 'Our original  one and the two networks  used to validate  it diﬀer both in ', 'size and in listed interactions  (see Methods).

It is noteworthy  that all the molecules  retrieved  ', 'from the two smaller  interactomes  are included  among those of the ﬁrst ', 'one. A very similar conclusion  could be drawn for MS, for which the pro- ', 'cedure predicted  39 drugs with the large interactome,  26 with Cheng’s  ', 'one, and 29 with the severely  constrained  version  of our interactome.  ', 'Drug combinations  ', 'Combined  therapies  and multi-targeted  agents have proven to oﬀer ', 'signiﬁcant  advantages  over monotherapy,  presenting  higher eﬃcacies  ', 'and less adverse  reactions  [ 6 , 46 ].

Eventually,  we ended up with 138 po- ', 'tential drugs for HD and 38 for MS. Their plausible  combinations  are ', 'numerous,  but this work can help to prioritize  them. While these re- ', 'sults are exploratory  and should be experimentally  veriﬁed  before fur- ', 'ther consideration,  they could provide  valuable  clues for improving  the ', 'management  of HD and MS. ', 'Finally,  this pipeline  demonstrated  to be eﬀective  on both investi-  ', 'gated diseases,  even though they have a diﬀerent  nature.

Introduction', 'In our earlier research we developed a signal analysis method for nystagmic eyemovements investigated in otoneurological tests (Juhola et al., 2009, 2011). For the automatic analysis of such signals poor or invalid nystagmic eye movementsshould correctly be separated from valid nystagmic eye movements, because valideye movements can only be used for the data analysis needed for the diagnostics ofotoneurological patients. Typically, invalid nystagmic eye movements are cor-rupted by noise or artefacts. Thus, we have also studied the classiﬁcation of nys-tagmic eye movement candidates into invalid and valid, hereafter called therejected and accepted, on the basis of machine learning methods ( Juhola et al., 2013). We then observed how their complicated distribution made the classiﬁca-tion task difﬁcult and attempted to reduce the greater subset (class) of the rejectedeye movement candidates in a learning set, which was performed by cleaning awaya part from them. Surprisingly, a simple cleaning process impaired classiﬁcationresults of some of the machine learning methods applied. We realized that the rea-son for such a seemingly conﬂicting situation originated from the complicated var-iable distribution of the data (Juhola et al., 2013).', 'In order to deﬁne which distribution of two classes is seen as simple or compli-cated we refer toFig. 1. A simple distribution is where the centre (computed asmeans for all variables) of each class is located inside its own area including mostelements of that class. This is described inFig. 1(a). A complicated distribution isdepicted inFig. 1(b), where the centre of one class is outside its own area. Suchcomplicatedness could be deﬁned in various ways, but it is essential that we cannotthen base data cleaning on distances from the class centres.', 'Nystagmus is formed from repeated, reﬂexive eye movements occurring asto-and-for beats that can be measured in the horizontal, vertical and torsionaldirections with two eye movement video cameras, one for each eye. A hypotheticnystagmic eye movement beat is seen inFig. 2and an actual signal of severalnystagmic beats inFig. 3. A nystagmic beat includes the slow phase immediatelyfollowed by the fast phase in order to return the eye in the opposite direction.Nystagmic beats are repetitive and their conﬁgurations vary even in the courseof short measurement times. A healthy subject performs nystagmic eye move-ments, for example, when he or she is sitting in a moving train and looks at chang-ing (relatively close) views through a window. This is called optokinetic nystagmusbecause of the stimulation. Caloric nystagmus is induced by injecting a smallquantity of cool or warm (37 ± 7/C176C) air or water into the ear canal of a subject.In regard to some otoneurological disorders or diseases, head shaking or headmovement can provoke nystagmus and even spontaneous nystagmus may appearin vestibular patients. Congenital nystagmus also exists ( Hertle and Dell’Osso, 1999). The slow phase features (variables) of nystagmus are important for thediagnostics of vestibular neuritis, positional vertigo, vestibular schwannoma andMenie`re’s disease. The fast phase features of nystagmus are important forClassiﬁcation of medical data set 53investigations of the central origin, i.e., the brain. Our current data included mea-surements from 107 patients mainly with spontaneous nystagmus. Here the slowphase variables were medically essential.', 'Since the 1970s, dozens of different nystagmus detection algorithms have beenpresented (Abel et al., 2008; Augustyniak, 1996; Hertle and Dell’Osso, 1999;Hosokawa et al., 2004; Juhola, 1988; Tominaga and Tanaka, 2010; Wall andBlack, 1982). Most of them have been on the basis of applying digital ﬁlters,(a) ', '(b) ', 'A', 'Fig. 1Let us assume that there are two hypothetical classes A and B in a variable space. Elements of themajority class A close to B and possibly from their overlapping area would be useful to be cleaned out. (a) Asimple distribution in which the majority class A (more elements) and minority class B partially overlap and inwhich elementxfrom A is closer to the centre of B (square) than to the centre (circle) of its own class A. Thus, x can clearly be cleaned on the basis of the distance criterion. (b) A complicated distribution in which xfrom A is closer to its own centre than to that of B. Further, the centre of A is outside its actual area. Element xcannot be cleaned on the basis of the distance criterion.54 M.

Nevertheless, it is notonly to detect nystagmic beat candidates, but the separation of acceptable beatsfrom those corrupted or noisy is a necessary stage in processing before computingnystagmus variable values from all accepted beats. Typically, this stage has beengrounded on conventional signal analysis methods and separately on every singlenystagmic eye movement. However, this is difﬁcult, because poor nystagmic beatsmay vary remarkably between patients and also depend on measurement devices.', 'Recently, we developed an approach based on machine learning and collected adata set of nystagmic eye movement beats, both accepted and rejected, in order toform a training set for machine learning and classiﬁcation of nystagmus signals(Juhola et al., 2013). To our knowledge, no such attempt has previously beenmade for nystagmus data. Nonetheless, the classiﬁcation task was difﬁcult becausethe data distribution appeared to be of a rare form in which the two classes of thedata were very close to each other or partially overlapped so that accepted nystag-mic beats were, in a way, surrounded by those rejected beat candidates ( Juhola et al., 2013). This resulted in an extraordinary outcome that our then straightfor-ward data cleaning technique impaired the classiﬁcation results computed withsome machine learning methods. In the present study we applied a more efﬁcientmethod (Laurikkala, 2001) to overcome this problem.', 'In the present description we do not express in detail how nystagmic beat can-didates were detected and how they were determined to be acceptable, because allthese are preprocessing phases for the study to be described and because they arepresented precisely in our earlier articles (Juhola et al., 2009, 2011, 2013).', '2. The data set', 'Our data set included 19 variables that were computed for nystagmic beat candi-dates in order to advance their identiﬁcation into accepted and rejected beats. Notall of these variables are medically useful, i.e., it is probable that otoneurologicaldisorders do not affect all of them. In our previous research we, however, observedthat all 19 variables are useful for the present classiﬁcation task ( Juhola et al., 2013). The variables are given inTable 1. See alsoFig. 2for symbols. The variable distributions are given in detail in (Juhola et al., 2013).', 'The data set included one signal from each of 107 patients suffering chieﬂy fromacute, unilateral, peripheral loss of vestibular function, in other words, vestibularneuritis or having had a surgery for acoustic neuroma. Nystagmus of a patient sit-ting in a chair in the darkened room was measured with two small eye movementvideo cameras that detected eye movements with an image processing system.Each signal was 30 s long and included 20–80 acceptable nystagmic beats.', 'Every signal was analysed with a nystagmus detection algorithm ( Juhola et al., 2011) and nystagmic beat candidates were, at the same time, separated either intoaccepted or rejected beats according to our algorithm ( Juhola et al., 2013). Inde- pendent of this automatic separation, an expert manually explored all nystagmic56 M.

The purpose of applying both manual and automatic ways was tocompare their results and also to use both of them jointly to see whether classiﬁ-cation results could further be improved this way.', '3. Data cleaning procedures', '3.1. Straightforward cleaning procedure', 'In our original cleaning procedure (Juhola et al., 2013) we assumed that there would be two classes in the data having their class centres in different areas. Thisassumption was reasonable in the sense that the poor nystagmic beat candidateswere marked to be rejected (manually or automatically) typically since some oftheir variable values were above some upper bounds. For instance, segments(2)–(5) inFig. 3would create too high torsional mean velocities for slow or fastphases of nystagmus because of the very steep spikes in the torsional signal. Clean-ing was made ﬁrst by computing the class centres and second by deleting those re-jected nystagmic beats that were the closest to the class centre of the opposite classuntil the class size of the rejected nystagmic beat candidates became as small as theopposite class.', 'A more precise data analysis showed, however, that the class distribution wascomplicated so that no two clearly separate class centres appeared.

Thus, the neighbourhood cleaning meth-od of (Laurikkala, 2001) is not hampered by a complicated distribution of more orless overlapping, mixing classes or one class surrounding the other. Since thecleaning procedure processes data cases on the basis of their nearest neighbour-hood approach, it functions locally, independent of the ‘‘global’’ properties ofdata. It also cleans not only according to the majority class of the rejected beats,but also by means of the minority class. Nevertheless, in our nystagmus datacleaning is only directed to the majority class. This is very natural particularlyClassiﬁcation of medical data set 59for the current data set, because the majority class represents rejected nystagmiceye movement beats and the aim was also to enhance dissimilarity between theclasses of the accepted and rejected beats in order to improve classiﬁcation results.', 'Note that the present cleaning procedure when directed to the majority classdoes not necessarily balance much the class sizes, but the number of removeditems depends on the data. On the other hand, since small k= 3 was used, the two cleaning rules of the method explore tiny areas from the distribution spaceat a time and may, therefore, mark relatively many items to be removed, becausethe majority condition may be frequently satisﬁed.', '3.3. Artiﬁcial extension of training data', 'Not pure cleaning is the only useful data reﬁnement technique. Sometimes the useof artiﬁcial extension of data cases may also be useful, especially for balancing aclass distribution (Swingler, 1996; Autio et al., 2007). In our data, class balancingwas not necessary, because there were only two classes with frequent nystagmicbeat candidates. Nevertheless, we experimented with the artiﬁcial extension byextending the same number of artiﬁcial nystagmic beats in the class of the rejectedas was cleaned out. Such artiﬁcial cases should naturally resemble very much thoseof the same class. A simple way is just to copy existing cases. However, this is notperhaps fully suitable for all classiﬁcation methods that may take advantage of theproperty that all cases are more or less different, i.e., multiple cases do not bringnew information for training a model. Therefore, we created artiﬁcial rejected nys-tagmic beat candidates by calculating means of pairs of two successive rejectedbeats in the data set. (After cleaning, more nystagmic beat candidates still remainedthan were discarded from the class of the rejected beats.) We may assume that sincetwo successive rejected beats are temporarily quite close to each other in a time-dependent signal, their nystagmus variable values may resemble each other. Con-sequently, computing the means of all their variable value pairs we may assume thatsuch an average, artiﬁcial case would also be in the class of the rejected beats if itwere real. Of course, several, more complicated, but perhaps more productiveextension ways could be designed. We used this simple way because we assumedwhatsoever that artiﬁcial extension could not improve results essentially since clas-siﬁcation results obtained after neighbourhood cleaning were already very high.', 'It is important to know that the artiﬁcial cases were only used to extend trainingsets. It would not be sensible to include them in test sets.', '4. Results', '4.1. Classiﬁcation procedure', 'As mentioned, the data set was computed according to three selections ( Juhola et al., 2013): manual selection to accepted or rejected nystagmic beats, automatic60 M.

Results are presented in percents as classiﬁcation accuracies,i.e., ratios of true positive added with true negative rates to the number of all testcases. Since the leave-one-out method was applied to tests, the number of testedcases was equal to all nystagmic beat candidates, 5989, or less when the data werecleaned.', 'Nearest neighbour searching and logistic discriminant analysis gave better clas-siﬁcation results when the data were ﬁrst standardized by subtracting the mean ofeach variable and then by dividing with its standard deviation. For those otherclassiﬁcation methods, standardization (being not useful) was not used. Withoutstandardization, the cleaning procedure removed 1313, 1680 and 1364 nystagmicbeat candidates from the class of the rejected, respectively, after the three selec-tions. With standardization, these were only 998, 717 and 732.

(Random cleaning was made only to showthat more efﬁcient cleaning is necessary.) When strong cleaning that left the halfout of the rejected was run, we even obtained partially poorer results. Of course,we also have to notice the different class sizes here that affect a priori probabilitiesin classiﬁcation. Doubtless did neighbourhood cleaning affect positively byincreasing classiﬁcation accuracies by 5–6% for all three selection ways of nystag-mic beat candidates. Instead, the extension of artiﬁcial, rejected beats after neigh-bourhood cleaning had only a minor effect, less than 0.5%.

Discussion and conclusions', 'In all of our results, neighbourhood cleaning was an efﬁcient way to reﬁne dataand reduced the size of the majority class, rejected nystagmic beats. Simpler clean-ing ways could hardly function as effectively, at least neither that was used earlier(Juhola et al., 2013) nor inTable 2.', 'Logistic discriminant analysis after cleaning was 2–12% better than the othersinTable 3and 2–6% worse than the accuracies of the nearest neighbour searchingafter neighbourhood cleaning as inTable 2. However, the best support vector ma-chines (with the quadratic kernels) were 2–5% poorer than the nearest neighbouraccuracies after neighbourhood cleaning as inTable 2. This is a slightly surprisingconclusion since our experience among some other data sets has been the opposite,frequently support vector machines have been subtly better than others. We as-sume that the possible reason was now that neighbourhood cleaning favouredthe nearest neighbour searching classiﬁcation. Since the nearest neighbour search-ing was applied in both, cleaning could ‘‘favour’’ its ‘‘relative classiﬁcation meth-od’’ more than the others.', 'The automatic selection was better in some cases than the manual and auto-matic ones together. Apparently, this stemmed from the fact that manual selectioncriteria may vary a little from time to time. Instead, the automatic selection alwaysfunctions stably.', 'The use of greater nearest neighbour numbers (5, 7, 9 or 11) than 3 originallyused improved the classiﬁcation results slightly further since more elements werecleaned out from the majority class compared to the situation of 3 nearest neigh-bours. However, no such conclusion could be drawn that this phenomenon wouldtypically be present. After all, the properties of data and their distribution areessential.', 'A future research detail in using the neighbourhood cleaning method could beto attempt to also clean the minority class. In general this is not perhaps sensible,but for such data sets as ours here where both classes were fairly large, it might beuseful since the classes were ‘‘mutually overlapping’’, some rejected nystagmicbeats among the accepted and vice versa, as seen in Fig. 4. On the other hand, cleaning accepted beats should be made very carefully and ‘‘conservatively’’, notto deteriorate the validity of the data set as a training set for nystagmus analysisviz., the accepted nystagmic beats represent physiologically plausible and possiblenystagmus variable values, whereas the rejected beats are more or less values out-side physiologically possible boundaries. However, these boundaries are not exact,because they may vary between subjects.', 'We can conclude that neighbourhood cleaning reﬁned data efﬁciently and im-proved accuracies throughout the tests accomplished. Its character is rather localthan global and it can purify noise-like occurrences from data. It had also goodinﬂuence on the current data set with the complicated distribution.

IntroductionArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming an importantscientiﬁc and technological tool in solving geosciences issues such asearthquakes detection, spatial prediction, stratigraphic correlation,seismic processing and interpretation, etc. ( Magrini et al., 2020;Foued- jio, 2020;Xu et al., 2022;Zhou et al., 2020;Birnie et al., 2021). It has reported that the rapidly evolvingﬁeld of machine learning (ML), a popular way to realize AI, will play a key role in geosciences ( Bergen et al., 2019). However, due to the black-box issue existing in many MLmodels, we cannot know the way how an ML model works, so cannotassess its reliability and have enough conﬁdence to apply it in produc- tion. We believe that the interpretability of ML will play an extremelyimportant role in geosciences in which there are too many risk-awareapplications, e.g., exploration.The geophysical logs interpretation means the prediction of boreholegeology information (e.g., lithofacies, porosity) according the logs, whichis a fundamental and worthy work to understand the undersurface earth.The recent years have witnessed the development of the applications ofmachine learning in logs interpretation. For example, a semi-supervisedmodel named Laplacian support vector machine is proposed to solve theproblems of scarce labels (Li et al., 2020). The smoothnesses implying in the feature space and depth are utilized to propagate the labels formlabelled samples to unlabelled ones, therefore increasing the classi ﬁca- tion accuracy. Although the Laplacian works in semi-supervised learning,the setting of Laplacian is still empirical so that the introduction ofunlabelled data might result in a worse performance compared with justusing labelled data. Hence, an ensemble mechanism is used to combinesome candidate Laplacians and calculate an optimal one to guarantee thesafety of using semi-supervision (Li et al., 2021). More similar work could be found in the literatures (Dunham et al., 2020;Imamverdiyev and Sukhostat, 2019;Zhu et al., 2018).Although there has been a great deal of researches in this area, mostof them work under the assumption of independent and identically dis-tribution (iid), i.e., the data from training wells should have similardistribution with those data from testing wells. However, such anassumption barely hold due to the differences in logging equipments,borehole conditions, etc. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, there are a signiﬁcant distribution discrepancy between the training dataset and testing dataset,so iid does not hold anymore. As shown in Fig. 1a andb, the non-iid problem causes an accuracy decrease in interpreting the logs fromanother wells by the trained classiﬁer. Both supervised and semi-', '* Corresponding author.

Inaddition, data mining and processing techniques can be coupled withmachine learning algorithms to solve the problem of data imbalance(Long et al., 2016;Zhong et al., 2020) Filtering techniques help us to remove some of the random non-stratigraphic responses ( Lv et al., 2018; Ruckebusch, 1983), but do not have a signiﬁcant effect on the distribu- tion alignment. For such a geophysical logs calibration issue, we canresort to the Domain Adaptation (DA) methods which are very popular inmachine learning.As a transfer learning method, DA tries toﬁnd the relevance between two datasets and then adopts the knowledge from one domain to another.DA could works in an unsupervised manner which means that we onlyneed the samples from two datasets. DA generally falls into three cate-gories: model-, sample-, and feature-based methods ( Yang et al., 2020). The sample-based DA re-weights the samples overlapped in the featurespace during the training phase to yield a more robust model in bothdomain, but it could only handle the small distribution discrepancy issue(Chang et al., 2021b;Chang et al., 2022). The model-based DA re-adjust the source-domain classiﬁer toﬁt the target domain (Liu et al., 2020). For a neural network model, usually the last few layer are allowed to adjust,so the transferability is not strong enough. The feature-based DA (fDA)tries to map the samples to a feature space with higher dimension suchthat two domains align (Li et al., 2018). As we know that a deep neural network possesses multiple layers for feature extraction, so the fDAusually has more feasibility. Most fDA methods map both domains, so thephysical meanings of the original features would loss ( Chang et al., 2021a). Instead, we could just align one domain to another in the originalfeature space, therefore maintaining the physical meanings ( Chen et al., 2018;Wu et al., 2022). Such a fDA method could be named UnilateralAlignment (UA) which might be an excellent tool for geophysical logscalibration to our opinions.', 'Fig. 1.Illustration of data distribution discrepancy.

The label spaceYofD sis also identical with D', \"t's, i.e.,ys;yt2Y.Since the datasets of two domains are sampled from respective jointdistributions, the discrepancies of probability distributions between twodomains can be seen as the discrepancies of two joint distributions i.e.,P\", 's(xs,ys)6¼P t(xt,yt)(Vapnik, 1999). The joint distributions ofD sandD t', 'are rewritten asP s(xs,ys)¼P s(xs)Ps(ys|xs),P t(xt,yt)¼P t(xt)Pt(yt|xt),respectively, wherePs(⋅),P t(⋅) are marginal probability distributions, andP', 's(⋅|⋅),P t(⋅|⋅) are conditional ones. In general, the conditional probabilitydistributions are shared across domains ( Stojanov et al., 2021). Under the assumption ofP', 's(ys|xs)¼P t(yt|xt), the problem turns to tackle theunequality of marginal probability distributions, i.e., P', 's(xs)6¼P t(xt). In order to improve the performance in the case of probabilitydiscrepancy, we propose a calibration method to learn a unilateral cali-brating functionfcompellingP', 's(f(xs))/C25P t(f(xt)) and consequently P', 's(f(xs),ys)/C25P t(f(xt),yt). In this way, the classiﬁer trained onD swould have a good performance in the interpretation task on a target-domainwell.3.

The UA framework is illustrated in Fig. 2.4. Experimental analysisIn this section, we conduct a large number of experiments using well-logging data collected from multiple wells in Jiyang depression, BohaiBay Basin to verify the validity and interpretability of our method. First,we describe the dataset and the experimental settings. Second, wecompare the performances of UA, S.O., and T.O., and present the accu-racy of each lithology via the bar graphs. Finally, we show the visualizedresults and discuss the interpretability of our method. Here, S.O., meansthe model trained on source-domain dataset only, which could be seen asthe lower bound of UA. If UA has a lower accuracy than S.O., thennegative transfer happens. T.O. means the model trained on target-domain dataset only, which could be seen as the upper bound of UA.4.1. Experimental settingsThe dataset consists of three wells, which is shown in Table 1. Wells A, B, and C are from the same area and have the same types of logs andlithologies, that is, they have the same input and output space. To verifythe calibration effect, a three-class ELM is trained to classify three typesof lithologies and evaluated by average F1-Score which considers both', 'Fig. 11.Frequency distribution histogram of R25 log in the task A →B.W. Zhang et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Geosciences 2 (2021) 192 –201', '199the accuracy and recall ratios of the classiﬁcation model.

The number of hiddenneurons are set 800, the weights and bias are generated randomly by theGaussian distribution with variance equalling 3. The trade-off parameterγis searched from 10', '/C03to 104, andλfrom 102to 106. S.O. and T.O. are realized by weighted ELM which could eliminate the in ﬂuence of un- balanced classes. All experiments are implemented by Python 3.8 on adesktop computer with 2.90-GHz CPU and 16.00-GB RAM.4.2. Comparative studyThe performances of these methods are evaluated by different com-binations of wells on the experimental dataset. For example, we set WellA as the source domain for training and Well B as the target domain fortesting (i.e., task A→B). Therefore, there are a total of six combinationsto be compared, i.e., A→B, A→C, B→A, B→C, C→A, and C→B. Table 2lists the macro-average F1-scores of these methods on 6 tasks. Wehave the following observations. (i) In all six tasks, the high F1-score wasachieved by using T.O. method, while the F1-score was signi ﬁcantly decreased by using S.O. method. This indicates that the data distributionvaries from well to well. (ii) The F1-scores of UA performing on all tasksare higher than S.O., which shows the effectiveness of UA in the case ofdata discrepancy. (iii) The F1-scores of UA is very close to those of theT.O. baselines. Especially, it can reach 97.2% on the task A→B. (iv) In the six tasks, the F1-scores of UA are improved by about 10% comparedwith S.O. baseline method, and even improved by 20% on the task B →C. (v) Although the F1-score of S.O. baseline is relatively high, UA still havean improvement on task A→C. The F1-scores for each lithology areshown inFig. 3. It is easy toﬁnd that S.O. usually overﬁts to the mudstone so that its F1-score might be high on some tasks. UA eliminates the dis-tribution discrepancies in the six tasks, so the classi ﬁcation after logs calibration could perform well on each lithology.4.3. Deeper discussionsTaking experiment A→B as an example,Fig. 4andFig. 5show the changes of logs of Well A and Well B. It is obvious that each log in sourcedomain has a slight change as shown in Fig. 4. Most of the macroscopic characteristics are preserved. Some microscopic characteristics areweakened due to low-passﬁltering function of the regularization term ofsource domain maintenance. As shown in Fig. 5, some logs has a great change and the predictions are signiﬁcantly improved by UA Observing areas a and b inFig. 5, we think that UA smoothen R25 by integratingCAL, so the calibrated R25 can be seen as that under the situation withoutborehole expansion. Such a smoothness in R25 avoids many mis-classiﬁcations. In areas of c and d, although the calibrated logs changegreatly, it keeps the basic variation trend of the original logs.The following analysis are based on the statistic information of logs,i.e., the differences of means and distribution histograms between twodomains. Taking A→B and A→C as an examples, it can be seen fromTable 3andTable 4that the mean of each log in the aligned (calibrated)target domain and source domain are almost the same as those in theoriginal source domain. This indicates that the means are alignedunilaterally. Subsequently,Fig. 6presents the distribution histograms ofWell A SP and Well B SP in two domains. It can be seen that the SP logdistribution of target domain is obviously aligned to the one of sourcedomain, while the original SP log distribution of Well A and Well B isquite different. This could be the reason why the F1-score in the task A → B could be increased greatly as shown in Table 2. According toFig. 7,i t can be seen that there is a small difference in SP log distribution betweenWell A and Well C, so S.O. method used to predict Well C can achieve ahigh F1-score of 92.3%. In this case, UA should align to Well A in thehigh-dimensional space while preserving the original information of WellC as much as possible. The frequency distribution histograms of otherlogs are shown inFigs. 8–11which all support the superiority of UA5. Conclusions and further workIn this paper, we formulated the geophysical logs calibration problemand give its statistical explanation, and exhibited an interpretable ma-chine learning method, i.e., UA, which could align the logs from one wellto another without losing the physical meanings. Massive experiments in3 wells and 6 tasks showed the effectiveness and interpretability frommultiple views. The involved UA method is an unsupervised featuredomain adaptation method, so it does not rely on any labels from cores.Actually, the source-domain labels could be used to pre-train a model andoutputs some pseudo-labels for the target domain, such that we canobtain a conditional MMD instead of the marginal MMD used in thepaper. With the conditional MMD, the conditional probability distribu-tion of both domain could be aligned, which might have a better cali-bration effect than the current work.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂuence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported in part by the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China under Grant 61903353, and in part by the SINOPECProgrammes for Science and Technology Development under GrantPE19008-8.References', 'Bergen, K.J., Johnson, P.A., de Hoop, M.V., et al., 2019.

', '1.Introduction ', 'The extraction of thematic information from remote sensing imagery ', 'in an automated way is frequently addressed by resorting to supervised ', 'learning techniques due to their adaptive nature and accuracy proper -', 'ties. Such techniques determine assigning a discrete thematic label (in ', 'classification problems) or continuous value (in regression problems) ', 'based on a sufficient amount of properly encoded prior knowledge, i.e., ', 'training data. The training data is deployed to infer a rule (e.g., a de-', 'cision function) that enables favorable generalizations capabilities for ', 'unseen instances [1,2]. ', 'Unfortunately, the compilation of prior knowledge is frequently very ', 'costly [3,4]. Consequently, it can be desirable to utilize existing prior ', 'knowledge from a source domain to estimate the target variable in a ', 'target domain by exploiting the concept of domain adaptation. Domain ', 'adaptation methods are frequently categorized according to the amount ', 'of available prior knowledge in the source and target domain. Supervised domain adaptation methods can exploit labeled samples ', 'from both source and target domain. Thereby, labeled samples in the ', 'target domain are substantially less numerous than labeled samples ', 'available in the source domain (otherwise there would be no need to ', 'render the estimation problem as a domain adaption problem, i.e., solely ', 'using a supervised learning algorithm in the target domain would be ', 'appropriate). In contrast, unsupervised domain adaptation methods ', 'assume that two unlabeled domains need to be matched. If there is prior ', 'knowledge available in the source domain but not in the target domain, ', 'and if the joint distributions of source and target domain are different, ', 'but related enough to ensure that the source domain information can be ', 'of help for solving the prediction problem in the target domain, we can ', 'regard the situation as a semi-supervised domain adaptation problem ', '[5]. ', 'Domain adaptation frequently includes two further subproblems, i. ', 'e., covariate shift and sample selection bias.

Covariate shift is a ', 'particular case of a sample selection bias. This kind of bias is induced by ', 'the independent variables, i.e., covariates. In the field of remote sensing, ', 'such a situation is frequently related to changes in the source and target ', 'domain imagery. Those changes are induced by varying data acquisition ', 'properties related to illumination and acquisition angle, among others ', '[5]. Hence, by definition, it is crucial to avoid a negative model transfer ', 'from a source to a target domain, i.e., to ensure that the general ', 'assumption of transfer learning, namely that the domains have to be ', 'related, is not violated [6]. ', 'We address this aspect by a proper selection of the source domain the ', 'model should be learned from before transferring it, i.e., we aim to ', 'establish an efficient way for domain adaptation when multiple potentially ', 'helpful but unlabeled source domains exist. Hence, the goal is to select a ', 'source-target domain combination that allows for beneficial model es-', 'timates in the target domain, i.e., to enable a positive model transfer. ', 'Subsequent to selection, the training data is obtained for the selected ', 'source domain and a prediction model is learned thereof (Fig. 1). Pre-', 'vious works in the context of domain adaptation either dealt with a ', 'given labeled source domain or had access to multiple labeled source ', 'domains. Regarding the first family of methods, feature-based methods ', 'jointly map the distributions of source and target domain in a latent ', 'subspace for direct inference, e.g. Refs. [7,8], whereas instance-based ', 'methods estimate the instances in the original space by deploying ', 'semi-labeled samples of the target domain, e.g., Refs. [9,10]. Only ', 'recently, techniques in the context of remote sensing evolved, that are ', 'concerned with domain adaptation including multiple labeled source ', 'domains. Those works followed the idea of synthetization of sources, i. ', 'e., creating an optimal source domain from multiple suboptimal source ', 'domains: Lu et al. [11] consider the case where a single source domain ', 'does not contain all the categories of a target variable regarding the ', 'target domain. They use multiple complementary source domains to ', 'form the categories of the target domain and learn a multisource ', 'compensation network thereof. Likewise, Gong et al. [12] integrate ', 'multiple incomplete source domains and propose a separation mecha -', 'nism so that only source domains with relevant manifestations of the ', 'target variable are considered for cross-domain alignment. Elshamli ', 'et al. [13] propose a CNN architecture that is learned and adaptively ', 'optimized across multiple source domains. ', 'However, the uniqueness of this study is related to the selection of a single source domain from multiple potentially helpful but unlabeled ', 'source domains and subsequent labeling only after selection. Our ', 'motivation is related to the circumstance that domains are particularly ', 'associated with distinct geographic locations in remote sensing. This ', 'frequently implies that the compilation of labels remains very costly ', 'since it requires, e.g., field campaigns in dedicated areas or the acqui -', 'sition of additional geospatial data for an area to enable the compilation ', 'of labeled samples. Ideally, such labor-intensive efforts must solely be ', 'carried out for a source domain that was identified beforehand to likely ', 'enable a positive model transfer later on. From an application-oriented ', 'point of view, such a setting frequently occurs if the direct compilation ', 'of training data for a target domain is not possible or inefficient. The ', 'latter refers to situations where a target variable needs to be estimated ', 'over various domains, i.e., large geographical areas, whereby solely a ', 'small subset of them can be labeled due to limited resources. ', 'Generally, we aim for a method that is independent of the learning ', 'algorithm. This is intended to account for the No-free-Lunch-Theorem. It ', 'states that there is no algorithm that can provide the highest accuracies ', 'in any domain at all times [14]. Algorithm-independent methods can be ', 'easily adapted to the problem at hand by employing suitable base ', 'learners and ensemble models. The latter were found to be particularly ', 'beneficial in terms of accuracy and reliability properties in the context of ', 'remote sensing [15,16]. Consequently, we designed an unsupervised ', 'source selection approach, which builds upon the robust quantification ', 'of the similarity between the source and target domains. We consider the ', 'main contributions of this work as follows:  ', '≡From a methodological point of view, we propose unsupervised ', 'source selection mechanisms by voting from similarity metrics that ', 'follow aligned marginal distributions regarding image features of ', 'source and target domains for remote sensing imagery. Thereby, we ', 'also establish an unsupervised pruning heuristic to solely consider ', 'robust similarity metrics in an ensemble voting scheme. Finally, ', 'labeled samples are solely obtained for a selected source domain and ', 'used to learn a prediction model which is subsequently applied to the ', 'target domain.  ', '≡We provide an evaluation of the method within an innovative ', 'application field. Recently, efforts were carried out to derive prop-', 'erties of the urban morphology for large areas based on regression ', 'techniques using Sentinel-2 imagery [15]. In this application ', 'context, we learn models from training data sets created with ', 'Fig. 1.Illustration of the considered unique problem setting of this work: a) multiple potentially helpful but unlabeled source domains exist; b) the source and target ', 'domains are compared individually regarding their similarity; c) the most similar source domain regarding the target domain is selected and solely for this source ', 'domain the (frequently very costly) training data is obtained. Subsequently, the selected source domain is deployed for learning the prediction model and transferring ', 'it to the target domain. C.

', '2.1. Histogram matching and feature computation ', 'To enable domain adaptation under covariate shift, we implement a ', 'histogram matching procedure of the imagery covering the source and ', 'target domains first. At this point, we consider image data from K ', 'potentially helpful but unlabeled source domains ⊔Sk⊓K', 'k\\x881, where Sk\\x88', 'Xk', 'S\\x88⊔xk', 'Si⊓nk', 'S', 'i\\x881 represents the set of nk', 'S unlabeled source samples of the k th ', 'domain and image data from the target domain where XT\\x88⊔xTj⊓nT', 'j\\x881 ', 'represents the set of nT unlabeled target samples, with samples xk', 'Si, xTj∃', 'Zd⊥iCj. Histogram matching is a method for adapting data distributions. ', 'To that purpose, the representations of the original data are matched ', 'independently of the subsequent processing model. The latter aspect is ', 'relevant since our goal is to establish a method, that can handle multiple ', 'independently learned models. Histogram matching implements a ', 'relative normalization. Thus, the method provides similarly distributed ', 'digital numbers rather than physical units as an output [5]. A nonlinear ', 'transformation φ is deployed to align the shapes of the cumulative his-', 'tograms of the spectral bands of the image of the target domain to the ', 'spectral bands of the image of the source domain [17]. This procedure is ', 'carried out for the considered possible source-target domain combina -', 'tions individually to obtain a set of matched target domain distributions ', 'concerning K source domains, i.e., XT→φ', 'XT\\x86\\x88Xk', 'T (Fig. 2a). Generally, ', 'we deploy histogram matching as a method for domain alignment here, ', 'since it showed viable properties for domain adaptation problems in the ', 'past [5]. However, given the modular nature of the proposed method, ', 'also other unsupervised domain alignment methods could be ', 'considered. ', 'Subsequently, features are computed from the matched imagery ', '(Fig. 2b). To estimate the target variables, we integrate into this work ', 'multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. In particular, we deploy the R-G-B- ', 'NIR bands of Sentinel-2, which feature a pixel spacing of 10 m [18]. ', 'Previous works demonstrated already the capacity of multispectral ', 'Sentinel-2 imagery to describe the built environment in a discriminative ', 'way [15]. We computed an exhaustive set of spectral-spatial features, i. ', 'e., spectral features derived from the R-G-B-NIR bands, features that are ', 'based on the concept of mathematical morphology [19], and texture ', 'measures using the gray –level co–occurrence matrix [20]. We deploy ', 'features as described in detail in Geiβ et al. [15]. Given the different ', 'feature categories and various window sizes used for the aforemen -', 'tioned spatial features, each characterized source and target domain ¯Xk', 'S ', 'and ¯Xk', 'T carries a 413-dimensional feature vector. Thus, it can be noted ', 'that we consider a homogeneous domain adaptation setting here since ', 'all domains share the same features [13]. ', '2.2. Computation of similarity metrics and unsupervised ensemble ', 'pruning ', 'To address problems related to sample selection bias, we compute ', 'similarity metrics regarding a characterized source domain – aligned ', 'target domain combination, i.e., ¯Xk', 'S and ¯Xk', 'T, and select a proper combi -', 'nation thereof. The empirical estimate of the similarity of a source and a ', 'target domain δ is computed with eight different metrics in this study ', '(Table 1; Fig. 2c). ', 'We aimed to consider metrics that feature a low level of sensitivity ', 'regarding, e.g., outliers, the scale of measurement, or data dimension -', 'ality [21]. Besides evaluating the suitability of a single metric to select a ', 'proper source-target domain combination, we also follow the idea to establish an ensemble of metrics as a selection mechanism. In our work, ', 'an ensemble strategy foresees the combination of votes for certain ', 'source-target domain combinations from multiple metrics via a decision ', 'fusion strategy to obtain the final selection. This strategy is implemented ', 'to alleviate the risk of eventually picking an inadequate single metric. ', 'From a conceptual point of view, in contrast to, e.g., supervised classi -', 'fication problems, we do not have access here to knowledge on actual ', 'prediction accuracy which could facilitate the selection of a suitable ', 'metric. Instead, we need to select a proper source-target domain com-', 'bination in an unsupervised way. ', 'To compile a robust ensemble, we establish a heuristically-guided ', 'ensemble pruning strategy. The goal is to select a subset of metrics M\\x88', '⊔δ1C…Cδm⊓from the full set of metrics N\\x88⊔δ1C…Cδn⊓, which enables a ', 'robust source-target domain selection later on (Fig. 2d). We exploit the ', 'notion of a small margin distance of empirical estimates obtained with a ', 'certain similarity metric δi regarding all possible source-target domain ', 'combinations k\\x881C…CK. To this purpose, we compute the percentage ', 'deviation }p of the numerical value which indicates the highest agree -', 'ment between a source and target domain aδi and the mean value of all ', 'estimates μδi, i.e., }p\\x88†aδi\\x00μδi†', 'μδi⋅100. This is motivated by the circumstance ', 'that metrics that can properly describe the similarity of source-target ', 'domain combinations feature a rather small range of numerical ', 'values. Subsequently, we compile M based on the smallest numerical ', 'values of }p, while simultaneously selecting interchangeably metrics that ', 'quantify the distance (eq. 1-4) and similarity (eq. 5-8) (Table 1) of ', 'source-target domain combinations to account for a multi-view ', 'perspective, i.e., to impose the consideration of complementary sub-', 'spaces with a particular physical meaning and statistical properties [22].

', '4.Experimental results and discussion ', 'To investigate whether the proposed domain adaptation techniques ', 'are generally beneficial in this empirical setting, Fig. 4 provides mean ', 'absolute errors (MAEs) for estimated built-up density and height regarding ', 'four different situations: i) non-domain adaptation setting, i.e., super -', 'vised learning and applying a model within a domain (i.e., upper ', 'benchmark); ii) proposed domain adaptation strategy that foresees both ', 'a domain alignment and selection of a proper source domain (mean ', 'values across all 11 selection mechanisms are plotted); iii) domain ', 'adaptation strategy that foresees solely a domain alignment without ', 'selection, i.e., all source domains are deployed interchangeably and ', 'accuracy estimates are averaged; iv) no domain adaptation strategy was ', 'implemented, i.e., a model from a source domain is learned and applied ', 'to the target domain without adaptation (i.e., lower benchmark). ', 'Thereby, results from 24 realizations per target variable are plotted ', '(composed of four cities, three sizes of the spatial processing units, and ', 'two regressors). ', 'First, it can be noted that the unadapted models, despite featuring ', 'the largest deviations in this setup, yield accuracy levels that indicate ', 'that the models did not fail when applied to a new domain. This can be ', 'attributed to the exhaustive set of spectral-spatial features which im-', 'poses invariance in the models. However, when actually aligning source ', 'and target domains, a substantial decrease of MAE can be achieved. ', 'Compared to the domain adaptation strategy which solely foresees to ', 'align domains, our proposed additional mechanisms to select a proper ', 'source domain for an aligned target domain enable on average a further increase of 4.7 and 4.9 percentage points (p.p.) regarding built-up density ', 'and height , respectively. Expectably, MAEs are by far the lowest when ', 'learning and applying a model within a domain. Thus, the difference in ', 'accuracy compared to the domain adaptation settings can be regarded as ', 'an error cost, that is related to the acquisition of training data for a target ', 'domain. ', 'However, to enable a more detailed perspective which source se-', 'lection mechanisms are most beneficial, more differentiated results are ', 'revealed in Fig. 5. It shows the median percentage differences in terms of ', 'MAE as obtained with source-target domain selections with the ', '(ensemble) similarity metrics compared to random source-target ', 'domain selections computed from the aligned data across all configu -', 'rations. Thereby, we also depict empirical MAEs when always the worst ', 'source domain for a certain target domain would be selected (lower ', 'bound) and when always the best source domain for a certain target ', 'domain would be selected (upper bound), respectively. ', 'First, it can be noted that all values of all considered (ensemble) ', 'similarity metric-based selections are positive, i.e., the majority of ', 'models could benefit from the guided source-target domain selection ', 'based on (ensemble) similarity metrics (Fig. 5a). Regarding the indi-', 'vidual similarity metrics, the Pearson correlation coefficient proved to ', 'be the most useful similarity metric here, since an improvement of 9.9 p. ', 'p. Could be achieved. This measure turned out to be useful in the context ', 'of, e.g., unsupervised classification of high-dimensional data sets also ', '[21]. ', 'However, our proposed pruned ensemble enabled the 2nd highest ', 'overall improvement (9.4 p.p.).

In this manner, our pruned ensemble of four also enabled more ', 'favorable improvements compared to an ensemble that includes all ', 'metrics (7.1 p.p.) and random selections of four metrics (6.0 p.p.).

', '≡The use of similarity metrics as applied to aligned marginal distri -', 'butions of various image features proved useful to select proper ', 'source-target domain combinations, which allowed obtaining ', 'frequently higher accuracy levels compared to random source-target ', 'domain selections.  ', '≡We evaluated different similarity metrics, whereby Hellinger and ', 'Pearson turned out to be the most favorable individual metrics in the ', 'considered empirical setting.  ', '≡Our proposed heuristically-guided ensemble pruning strategy, which ', 'was particularly motivated to alleviate the risk of eventually picking ', 'an inadequate single metric in this unsupervised selection problem, ', 'allowed the 2nd best overall estimations.

IntroductionThe Brazilian law (Lei 11.326, 2006) deﬁnes the family farmer asthe family which practices agricultural activities in a rural area thatis not larger than four ﬁscal modules and uses predominantly thefamily’s own labor in their business activities. Moreover, accordingto the law, the income of a family farmer must be originated fromactivities related to their own business, which must be ran by thefarmer and his family. According to Guanziroli [15], in 2001, family-based agriculture in Brazil was so far responsible for almost40% of the total agricultural production, and accounts for 76.8% ofagricultural employment.Most of the family-based agriculture in Brazil is consolidated inthe Northeast region. However, the family farmers which reside inthis region face various challenges related to the soil and climate.Approximately 70% of the semiarid region is above the crystallinebasement where soils are generally shallow and with low waterinﬁltration capacity, which limit the development of agriculture[16]. Furthermore, the Northeast region frequently suffers fromdrought, resulting in insufﬁcient or irregular distribution of rain-fall, which cannot keep the soil moist enough during periods longerthan the harvest cycle[8]. In addition, the income distributionamong the farmer families in the region appears to be deﬁcient.In 2006, family-based agriculture in the Northeast region was com-posed of more than 4,500,000 farmers; only around 450,000 ofthem comprised the most capitalized group, with a annual incomeof more than 53,000 reais, while more than 2,500,000 farmers sur-vived only on subsistence activities, with an annual monetaryincome of approximately 255 reais [16]. One possible way to identify categories among these familiesand to gain insight on the most important factors for this divisionis the analysis of social data regarding these families by clusteranalysis and data mining techniques. Data mining is a process ofdiscovery of useful information and hidden patterns in databases,widely used in recent research in various ﬁelds such as food science[3,4,26,27], agriculture[28,29], social media[2,17], business and customer management[30], sports[6]and others. However, the analysis of social data sets present some challenges derived fromthe manner in which they are gathered and stored.

MethodologyThe analyzed data was obtained from research conducted on476 households distributed around six country cities from theCeará state: Barbalha, Guaraciaba do Norte, Boa Viagem, Limoeirodo Norte, Itarema and Parambu (Fig. 1). Each family was evaluated by a questionnaire composed of 79 questions regarding demo-graphic, economic, agricultural production and food security infor-mation. The answers for the questions were deﬁned as the featuresfor the data set. Some important questions (features) are listed inTable 1. The number of evaluated families from each city is similar:80 from Barbalha, 80 from Boa Viagem, 80 from Guaraciaba doNorte, 79 from Itarema, 79 from Limoeiro do Norte and 78 fromParambu. Data were collected in 2012 over a 1-month period, aspart of a research project focused on understanding householddrought vulnerability. The six municipalities selected each repre-sent one of the agro-ecological zones in the state. Questions weredeveloped based on a sustainable livelihoods approach [34], which categorizes ﬁve types of capital – social, natural, ﬁnancial, humanand physical – and provides a framework for understanding theirrelationships. The respondents were randomly selected from a listof farmers that were provided by the local Farm Workers Syndi-cate, which contains an almost exhaustive list of farmers Table 2.2.1. Knowledge discovery using data mining and cluster analysisThe ﬁrst step of the analytical procedure was to identify rele-vant groups of the interviewed families based on a similarity factorrelated to the nature and domain of the social questions involved.For this matter, we employed cluster analysis concepts andtechniques.Data mining refers to the process of automatic discovery of use-ful information in large databases [35]. Data mining techniques merge machine learning, statistical calculation, linear algebra andmathematic optimization concepts in order to uncover hidden pat-terns in data. Machine learning is a fundamental procedure for datamining processes as it generates smart algorithms capable of dis-covering patterns and information in data bases automatically,which aid decision making[5].Cluster analysis is a data mining process which consists individing the samples into groups (clusters) based on informationfound within the data which describes these samples and its rela-tionships[35]. Samples belonging to the same cluster must show asimilarity pattern among them while being as dissimilar as possi-ble from samples associated to other clusters.Due to the nature of social data and the way they are usuallyobtained and stored, the application of clustering techniques on thiskind of data proves challenging. Research on social data is usuallyconducted through the use of structured forms which bring a num-ber of questions to be answered by the members of the observedpopulation. Once collected, these data are stored in spreadsheetsor plain text. The conversion of these ﬁles to data matrixes usually', 'generates columns of mixed types, including numeric, categoricand ordinal variables. Moreover, ﬁelds that are not ﬁlled are mappedinto null values, which represent obstacles for data analysis.Some recent research brings methodologies and techniques forhandling the problem of data sets with variables of mixed typesduring cluster analysis[1,21,32]. Another point to be observed isthat, in this study, we conduct an exploratory analysis where wehave no pre-established models or hypotheses regarding the data[22]. Most clustering techniques require the number of clustersas an input parameter, and in our case this number is not knowna priori. We employed the Silhouette method which aids in theestimation of the best number of clusters within the data set.2.1.1. Estimating the best number of clustersIn this study, we used the Silhouette method [33]to estimate the best number of natural clusters within the data set. Silhouetteis a graphical display method for clustering algorithms. Each clus-ter is represented by a silhouette which is designed based on sim-ilarity and dissimilarity between the samples. The silhouetteshows which samples are well placed in the clusters and whichsamples are ﬂoating between two or more clusters. The entire par-tition is shown in a single plot as a combination of silhouetteswhich allows visualization of the quality of the clusters. The bestnumber of clusters can be estimated by computing the averageweigth of the silhouettes designed for a range of partitions withdifferent numbers of clusters.Consider aðiÞas the average distance between the sample iand the other samples in the same cluster as i. For all other clusters C', 'k, kbeing the number of clusters, dði;CÞis the average distance betweeniand the other samples in C', 'k. The minimum value of dði;CÞ, given by bðiÞ:¼min', 'cdði;CÞ, is the distance betweeniand the nearest cluster. Hence, sðiÞis computed as:', 'sðiÞ:¼bðiÞ/C0aðiÞmaxðaðiÞ;bðiÞÞ', 'Samples with show high values for sðiÞare well clustered, otherwise they are probably placed between two or more clusters, and sam-ples with negative values for sðiÞare placed in wrong clusters. Thequality of a cluster can be estimated by computing the averagevalue of sðiÞfor all samples associated to it.154 C.

To conclude, the ﬁnal averageP', 'nk¼2mediaðsðiÞÞkis computed and selected as the bestnumber of clusters for the data set.2.1.2. Partitioning around medoids (PAM)The clustering algorithm selected was the PAM [24], an exten- sion of the K-means algorithm. K-means is an antique clusteringalgorithm which is still very popular due to its speed, efﬁciencyand simplicity[22]. This method searches forkcenters within the data set which minimizes the total sum of the squared dis-tances between each sample and its nearest center. The K-meansis executed in the following steps:1. Randomly chooseksamples from the data set as the initialcentersC={c', '1,c2,...c k}.2. For eachi2{1,...,k}, set the clusterCias the subset of samples which are nearest toc', 'ithan to any other centerc jfor allj–i. 3. For eachi2{1,...,k}, updatec', 'ito be the center of mass of allsamples inC', 'i.4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until no changes are observed in Cor a maximum number of iterations is reached.Although K-means is currently the best-known and most usedclustering algorithm, it has the key limitation of working withnumerical values only, which makes its application on our mixeddata set unfeasible. We opted for the use of the PAM algorithm,which implements the K-medoids[23]clustering algorithm. K-medoids is similar to K-means, but more robust and lesssensitive to outliers. The k-medoids algorithm is based on ﬁndingkrepresentative samples within the data set, called medoids, andthekclusters will be constructed through the association of eachsample to its nearest representative object. K-medoids can alsoreceive a dissimilarity matrix instead of the data, a matrix which', 'Fig. 1.Map of Ceará state.

The medoid of acluster will be the sample from this cluster such that the averagedissimilarity between this sample and the other samples in thissame cluster is as small as possible, instead of the squared sumof Euclidian distances computed by the K-means. The algorithmis executed in two steps, BUILD and SWAP. In BUILD phase, aninitial clustering is performed by the successive selection of krep- resentative samples. The ﬁrst sample selected must present theleast average dissimilarity possible from the other samples and,therefore, should be located at the center of mass of the dataset. The nextk/C01 samples are selected in order to decreasethe objective function value, following the steps:1. Considerias an unselected sample.2. Considerjan unselected sample.

Dissimilarity matrix calculationThe dissimilarity matrix which PAM algorithm receives as inputparameter can be computed using the Daisy function detailed by[24]. This function accepts mixed data types, including numeric,categoric, ordinal, symmetric and asymmetric binary values, whichis useful for the data set we analyze in this study. In order to handlemixed variables, Daisy uses the Gower dissimilarity coefﬁcient[14]. Each variable is normalized by dividing each value by therange of values of the corresponding variable, after the subtractionof the minimum value. Thereafter, the variable will be scaled to[0,1]. Null values are discarded from the calculation.The Gower coefﬁcient computes the distance between two sam-plesiandjas the weighted average of the contributions of eachvariable, given by the equation:', 'dij¼dði;jÞ¼Ppk¼1wkdkijdkij', 'Ppk¼1wkdkij', 'whered ijis the weighted average ofdkij,w kdkijare the corresponding weights,d', 'kijis 0 or 1, anddkijis thekth contribution of the variable forthe total distance.

The contribution d', 'kijof a categoric variable for the total distance is 0 if both values are equal 1, or 0otherwise. For the other types of variable, the contribution is thedifference between the two values divided by the range of valuesof the variable.', '2.2. Data classiﬁcationIn addition to cluster analysis, data mining also offerstechniques to perform predictive analyses called classiﬁcation.Classiﬁcation models implement supervised learning, in which acertain information represented by a class label of an unknownsample can be predicted based on previous observation of labeledsamples. These labeled samples are also called training set. Theﬁnal product of supervised learning is a classiﬁer that ismathematically described by a function ^f:X!ftrue;falsegwhich uses a subset ofDand^fðxÞﬃfðxÞ, being D a set of labeled samples andD¼f ðx;yÞjx2Sey¼fðxÞgfor a labeling function f:X!ftrue;falseg[20].After clustering the data, we developed classiﬁcation modelscapable of predicting in which cluster an arbitrary family wouldbe associated to. We selected three of the most popular classiﬁca-tion models in the data classiﬁcation literature: artiﬁcial neuralnetworks, support vector machines and decision trees.2.2.1. Decision treesDecision trees[31]refers to one of the oldest classiﬁcation mod-els. Each variable of the data set is individually questioned, and allthe questions and answers can be arranged in a hierarchical struc-ture called a tree. Each node of the tree refers to a variable, andeach edge originated in a node represents a value, or a range ofTable 2Best features determined by the CFS method.', 'Feature Type DescriptionF_2 Categorical Household received credit in the pastF_3 Numeric Per capita annual incomeF_6 Categorical Household never received Bolsa FamíliaH_1 Categorical Household has health accessS_2a Numeric Frequency of support givenS_2c Categorical Household gave support to other familiesLS_2C Numeric Percentage of total income from Bolsa Família cashtransfer programLS_2D Numeric Percentage of total income from social securityP_5 Categorical Household participated in crop insuranceFS_1 Numeric Food security indexFS_2 Numeric Access indexFS_4 Categorical Household has food of insufﬁcient qualityR_2 Numeric Annual household income from social securityR_2A Numeric Annual household income from social security, 2012inﬂation adjustedR_3A Numeric Annual household income from Bolsa Família, 2012inﬂation adjustedAG_1 Categorical Household planted corn or beans for subsistenceC. Maione et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 153–162 157values, for the variable represented by the node. Leaf nodes storethe class labels, the ﬁnal point of the classiﬁcation. Whenever anew test sample is analyzed, each one of the variables are ques-tioned, following a preexisting path along the tree until a leaf nodeis reached and its corresponding class label is set as the class labelpredicted for the analyzed sample. The recursive Hunt algorithm isone of the most commonly used algorithms for building decisiontrees. The idea behing it is that the nodes of the tree should bearranged in order to maximize the information gain, i.e., the ques-tioned variables should be capable of dividing the data set in purepartitions, with larger frequencies of a determined class.Another advantage of decision trees is the ease of visualizationand interpretation. The decision rules exposed on the paths allowus to generate hypotheses regarding the individual inﬂuence ofeach variable in the classiﬁcation process. Therefore, although theyare used primarily as classiﬁcation models, in this study weemploy decision trees in order to interpret the clustering resultsand visualize which variables are the most relevant to the separa-tion of the clusters[25,35].2.2.2. Support vector machinesSupport vector machine (SVM) is a popular classiﬁcation modelin the recent data mining literature due to its efﬁciency and empir-ical success. Data sets usually have more than one decision bound-ary capable of dividing the data in the n-dimensional space, andthe goal of SVM is to compute the hyperplane with the largest mar-gin possible to act as a decision boundary [35]. When applied to data that is linearly separable, the decision boundary has a linearrepresentation given by the equation:', 'w/C1xþb¼0', 'wherexrefers to the variable set of an arbitrary sample e,andwis a set of weights whose linear combination gives the class label yfore. The width of the decision boundary margin is given by the distancebetween the two parallel hyperplanes (support vectors) whichtouch the samples from each class that is nearest to the decisionboundary, and is deﬁned as[7,10]:', 'd¼2jjwjj', 'Finally, the goal of SVM is to ﬁnd the decision boundary with thelargest margin possible, which means minimizing the followingobjective function:', 'min wjjwjj2', '2', 'When handling data that is not linearly separable, SVM projects thedata from its original n-dimensional space into a new space wherethe samples can be separated by a linear decision boundary. Thisprocess is achieved with the aid of kernel functions K(x,y). Kernel functions express the similarity between two samples in the newtransformed dimensional space according to their dot product. Inthis study, we use the radial basis kernel function (RBF) to trans-form the data, given by the equation:', 'Kðx;yÞ¼expð/C0 cjjx/C0yjj2Þ', '2.2.3. Artiﬁcial neural networksArtiﬁcial neural networks are inspired in the cognitive systemand neurological functions of the human brain, simulating its neu-ron and links. A neuron has a ﬁlament called axon which connectsto another neuron through dendrites, and the connection point iscalled synapse. Similarly, a classiﬁcation model based on artiﬁcialneural networks is composed of interconnected nodes [35]. In thisstudy, we use a classiﬁcation model of this family called MultilayerPerceptron (MLP).A perceptron is a structure composed of ninput nodes that receive the values from the feature variables which describe thesamples. Each node from this initial layer is linked to the outputnode through an edge that is associated to a weight value w. The output value is determined by the equation:f¼Xnk¼1wkxk !/C0t', 'The class label is 1 iff>0 and 0 otherwise. The model’s perfor-mance can be improved by systematic adjustments in the weigthvaluesw', '1;w2;...;w n. The MLP has hidden layers between the initiallayer and output layer which works with backpropagation: the pre-diction errors obtained during the training phase are backpropa-gated to the previous layers, and this error value is used to adjustthe weights in each edge. The training phase with the implementa-tion of the backpropagation is summarized in the following steps[13]:', '1. Initialize the neural network with the weight values in eachedge2. Read the ﬁrst input sample3. Propagate the feature values of the given samples through theneural network until an output value is obtained4. Compute the error value by comparing the output valueobtained with the expected output value5. Propagate the error back through the network6. Adjust the weigth values in order to minimize the overall clas-siﬁcation error7. Repeat steps 2–7 for new training samples, until the overallerror is minimized2.2.4. Evaluating the performance of classiﬁcation modelsThe evaluation of classiﬁcation models is performed by using aset of training samples to train the model and a set of test samplesformed by unknown samples to test it. In the k-fold cross valida-tion method, the data set D is randomly divided into kmutually exclusive subsetsD', '1;D2;...;D k(folds) of equal or similar size.The classiﬁcation model is trained and tested ktimes, and in each iterationt2f1;2;...;kg, the foldsD/C0D', 'tare used to train the model and the remaining foldD', 'tis used to test it[12].

The ﬁnal accuracy ofthe model estimated by the k-fold cross validation is the average ofall accuracies obtained in each iteration.', '2.3. Feature selectionFeature selection is a data mining process which aims for theremoval of feature variables which are considered unimportantof the classiﬁcation. In general, we say that a feature is consideredimportant for the analysis if it is relevant and irredundant [9].A variable is considered redundant when it presents high depen-dence to the other variables and the information contained in itcan be expressed by a fewer number of these variables. A variableis considered irrelevant when the information it contains does notcontribute to generate hypotheses regarding the samples withrelation to their class labels. The removal of such variables can158 C. Maione et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 153–162improve the accuracy of classiﬁcation models, reduce outliers andsimplify the analysis[11,18].2.3.1. Correlation Based Feature SelectionCFS (Correlation Based Feature Selection) is a feature selectionmethod proposed by Hall[19]which employs a heuristic basedon correlations to estimate the importance of a subset of features.This method generates subsets with different combinations of fea-tures, and each subset is evaluated by the following Pearson corre-lation equation:', 'Ms¼krcfﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃkþkðk/C01Þrffp', 'beingkthe total number of features,M sis the merit of a feature subsetS,', 'rcfis the average correlation between the features andthe class label, and', 'rffis the average intercorrelation between thefeatures.

Finally, the feature subset which achievedthe highest merit is selected as the best feature subset.', '3. Results3.1. Groups identiﬁedThe ﬁrst step of the analysis was estimating the empirically bestnumber of clusters within the data set. We determined the averagewidth of the silhouette for 2–50 clusters, and we found that theanalyzed families could be divided into a best number of 2 clusters.The PAM clustering algorithm was applied, and the data wasdivided into 2 clusters of 224 and 252 samples, respectively. A t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) graph for thepartition is presented inFig. 2, allowing the visualization of theformed clusters in a bidimensional plot. The frequency of familiesfrom each city in the clusters is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. InFig. 3, we can see that families from Barbalha and Parambucities are more frequent in Cluster 1, corresponding to 21% and20% respectively of the total families associated to this cluster. Thispercentage varies between 10% and 17% for the other cities. Fami-lies from Guaraciaba do Norte are less frequent in this cluster,accounting for 10% of the families. This scenario is reversed forCluster 2, presented inFig. 4. This cluster has more families fromGuaraciaba do Norte (23%) and fewer families from Barbalha andParambu (13% both).Figs. 5–10bring another visualization of thisresult, presenting the frequency of the two clusters in each city. Asa matter of fact, we can see that families from Boa Viagem ( Fig. 6)', 'Fig. 2.The t-SNE bidimensional graph for the found clusters.', 'Fig. 3.Frequency of cities in Cluster 1. 21% Barbalha, 17% Boa Viagem, 10%Guaraciaba do Norte, 16% Itarema, 16% Limoeiro do Norte, 20% Parambu.', 'Fig. 4.Frequency of cities in Cluster 2. 13% Barbalha, 16% Boa Viagem, 23%Guaraciaba do Norte, 17% Itarema, 17% Limoeiro do Norte, 13% Parambu.', 'Fig. 5.Barbalha. 60% Cluster 1, 40% Cluster 2.C.

Feature selection and classiﬁcationAfter determination of the clusters, we considered the clustervalue of each sample as class label and proceeded to develop clas-siﬁcation models capable of predicting in which cluster a new,unknown family, would be associated to. We also applied the CFSalgorithm to determine the most relevant features which differen-tiate the families of the two clusters. The best feature subset esti-mated by the CFS is shown inTable 1.The prediction results obtained by the classiﬁcation modelbefore and after feature selection are presented in Table 3. It is vis- ible that both SVM and MLP models achieved best accuracy whenall feature variables are used for training. The classiﬁcation modelwhich achieved the best performance was the MLP with 93.48%prediction accuracy when all variables are used.', 'Fig. 6.Boa Viagem. 49% Cluster 1, 51% Cluster 2.', 'Fig. 7.Guaraciaba do Norte. 28% Cluster 1, 72% Cluster 2.', 'Fig. 8.Itarema. 46% Cluster 1, 54% Cluster 2.', 'Fig. 9.Limoeiro do Norte. 44% Cluster 1, 56% Cluster 2.', 'Fig. 10.Parambu. 56% Cluster 1, 44% Cluster 2.160 C. Maione et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 153–1623.3. Interpretation and discussionWe used Weka software (version 3.6) to build a decision treeconsidering the cluster value of the samples as class label and onlythe most important features determined by the CFS as input vari-ables. The algorithm employed was the C4.5, which yielded85.5% prediction accuracy. The structure of the decision treeachieved is shown inFig. 11.The ﬁrst feature selected by the C4.5 to divide the samples andwhich present the highest information gain is R_2 (annual house-hold income from social security), which means that we can orga-nize the results in two cases: when the families have annualhousehold income from social security relatively higher than theothers (> R$5598), and otherwise.Considering the families which have annual income from socialsecurity higher than R$5598, we observe the following patterns:/C15Cluster 1: in this cluster, the families with higher income fromsocial security give support to others more frequently, other-wise they are characterized by a minimum access index./C15Cluster 2: in this cluster, the families with higher income do notgive support to others frequently, and have higher access indexthan the families with higher income associated to Cluster 1.Considering the families which have annual income from socialsecurity less than R$5598, we observe the following patterns:/C15Cluster 1: in this cluster, families with lower income from socialsecurity have the minimum value of food security index (1), butthey give support to other families more frequently./C15Cluster 2: in this cluster, families with lower income from socialsecurity have a higher food security index, and families withlow food security index do not give support to other familiesfrequently.An individual analysis of the variables and decision rules pre-sented in the tree’s structure lead us to the following conclusions:/C15Annual household income from social security (R_2): Consider-ing the prediction error rate, the tree shows that a total of 160families (71%) associated to Cluster 1 have income from socialsecurity higher than R$5598, while only 43 families (17%) ofthe families in Cluster 2 have income from social security alsohigher than this value. Therefore, the majority of families asso-ciated to Cluster 1 have income from social security higher thanfamilies associated to Cluster 2./C15Food security index (FS_1): This variable considers wheneverthe family has income from social security lower than R$5598.Given the 64 families from Cluster 1 which have this income,48 families (21% of the total of families of Cluster 1) are charac-terized by minimum food security index. On the other hand, inCluster 2, 173 families (69% of the total of families associated toCluster 2) have income from social security lower than R$5598and food security index higher than the minimum. Therefore, inthe few cases where a family from Cluster 1 has relatively lowincome from social security, it is likely that its food securityindex is also minimum. Moreover, the majority of families fromCluster 2 have income from social security lower than the fam-ilies from Cluster 1, however, they present higher food securityindex overall./C15Household gave support to other families (S2_c): This variable isalways considered to determine if a family belongs to Cluster 1.Around 70% of the families associated to Cluster 1 do give sup-port to other families. Considering the remaining 30% familiesthat do not give support, 13% have relatively high income fromsocial security, but are characterized by the minimum accessindex (FS_2), and 11% have relatively low income from socialsecurity and minimum food security index. For Cluster 2, wecan see that, considering the 43 families who have income fromsocial security higher than R$5598, 32 of them did not give sup-port the other families. Therefore, we can conclude that familiesassociated to Cluster 1 usually gave support to other families.Overall, the majority of families from Cluster 1 receive incomefrom social security higher than the families in Cluster 2, and gavesupport to other families even in the rare cases where they showlower income from social security and minimum food securityindex. When families of this cluster did not gave support, they pre-sent a minimum access index. As discussed previously, the major-ity of families from Barbalha (60% of the analyzed families) andParambu (56%) belong to this cluster.On the other hand, families from Cluster 2 received lowerincome from social security, but they had a higher access indexwhen they received lower income, and present higher food secu-rity index when the income from social security was low. As dis-cussed previously, most families from Boa Viagem, Guaraciaba doNorte, Itarema and Limoeiro do Norte are associated to this cluster– approximately 51%, 72%, 54% and 56%, respectively.4. ConclusionWe presented a data mining study and cluster analysis of socialdata obtained from small producers and family farmers from sixmunicipalities in Ceará state, Northeastern Brazil. The social datawere obtained through research conducted directly with the fam-ilies, which involved personal questions regarding demography,economics, agricultural production, and food security. The answersobtained were used as feature variables for our analysis. In order towork with this challenging data, we employed a methodology cap-able of handling variables of mixed types and null values. We esti-mated the best number of clusters within the data with theSilhouette technique, and the PAM clustering algorithm wasemployed in order to partition the data in the clusters. With the', 'aid of the C4.5 decision tree, we observed that, overall, familiesfrom Cluster 1 received higher income from social security thanthe families associated to Cluster 2, and gave more support to otherTable 3Accuracy values achieved by the classiﬁcation models before and after featureselection is performed.', 'Model Before CFS After CFSSVM 92.22% 86.76%MLP 93.48% 85.50%Decision trees 81.51% 85.50%', 'Fig. 11.Decision tree built for the analyzed data set, considering only the mostimportant features selected by the CFS method and the cluster value as class label.C. Maione et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 153–162 161families, even in the rare cases where the families presented lowerincome from social security and a in minimum value of food secu-rity. When families of the cluster did not give support to others,they present a minimum access index. Most of the analyzed fami-lies from Barbalha and Parambu belong to this cluster. On the otherhand, families from Cluster 2 receive less income from social secu-rity, but they have a higher access index when the income fromsocial security is higher. These families also have a higher foodsecurity index, even when the income from social security is low.Most of the analyzed families from Boa Viagem, Guaraciaba doNorte, Itarema and Limoeiro do Norte are associated with thiscluster.The proposed methodology presented promising results, how-ever, there are a few issues that could be addressed in futureworks.First, we worked with a relatively small data set, and the anal-ysis of a larger number of families could help us uncover moretrends regarding their proﬁle. Moreover, we investigated familiesfrom Ceará state only, and it would be interesting to extend ouranalysis to families from other states as well. Piauí, Rio Grandedo Norte, Paraíba and Pernambuco are states bordering Cearáand located in the Northeast region as well, sharing very similargeological, climatic and demographic characteristics, and familiesfrom these states could be inserted into the analysis in order forus to investigate demographic, economic and social proﬁles ofsmall producers and family farmers of the Northeast region as awhole instead of one state only.Also, working with categorical values is one of the major chal-lenges for data mining researches', '. We expect, for future works,to improve the processability of our data set, either by standardiz-ing our variables to numeric values only, changing the data collec-tion method (i.e., replace the common surveys) or by employingforthcoming clustering and classiﬁcation techniques in the datamining literature that can handle categorical variables.Declarations of interestNone.FundingThis research did not receive any speciﬁc grant from fundingagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-proﬁt sectors.References', '[1]A.

IntroductionWorld's population is growing at a rapid pace and is estimated toreach 10 billion by 2050. This puts an immense responsibility on the ag-riculture sector to enhance crop production and increase yield per hect-are (FAO, 2017). Several pain points for farmers such as small landholdings, labor shortage, climate change, extreme weather conditions,reduction in soil fertility, etc. are making agriculture less pro ﬁtable. For the last few years, agriculture is continuously challenged by climatechange and other environmental problems and they create a huge hur-dle in achieving enhanced productivity. Two possible options to tacklethe food shortage are increasing land usage and practicing farming inlarge area or adapting best practices and technology support to enhanceproductivity. Considering the case of developing countries with highlypopulated areas where increasing the land area is merely impossible,the only way is to go smarter with the help of cutting edge technologieslike the internet of things (IoT) and allied technologies like Arti ﬁcial In- telligence (AI). The recent advancement in ICT (Information and Com-munication Technology) and associated researches have identi ﬁed the ‘Internet of things’and 'Artiﬁcial Intelligence' as key technologies forrevolutionizing modern agriculture practices. By incorporating the useof digital technologies like artiﬁcial intelligence and internet of things,better insights can be formed effectively from data gathered from theﬁeld and allowing farming practices to be planned systematically withminimal manual labor. Over the decades, the agriculture sector hasrealised the importance of precision farming. Precision farming is a sus-tainable alternative that will enhance production by providing a preciseamount of inputs reducing the overuse of potential environmentallydamaging pesticides and other inputs. Despite the challenges due to cli-mate change and other factors, the digital technology driven agricultureprovides a plethora of methodologies for automating and enhancing ag-riculture production and productivity. Digitization in agriculture en-ables real-time analysis that helps in more effective spraying, landmanagement, water management, and even land surveillance. The useof emerging digital technology will allow the agriculture industry toachieve several other beneﬁts such as reducing input costs and wastage,achieving sustainable practices along with enhancing productivity tomeet the growing food demand. Digital technology driven agricultureis gaining more and more global attention due to the incredibly easyﬁeld management capability and powerful real-time monitoringsystems.Mechanization converted agricultural activities that require days ofhuman sweat and draft animal labor into a few hours of activities. Thiscan be considered as theﬁrst level of automation that transformed agri-culture tasks in developing countries like India. Agriculture mechaniza-tion in India is at an early stage and growing at a rate of 7.5% per annumand this is going to get smarter and faster with the advancement in dig-ital technologies. One of the main issues of recent times is extensivelabor migration. When studying the workforce employed in Indian agri-culture, it was observed that the percentage of agricultural workers tototal workers decreased from 59.1 in 1991 to 54.6% in 2011 and was ex-pected to be 40.6% in 2020 (Mehta et al., 2014). All these were a few main reasons for moving towards mechanization along with reducingthe drudgery. Minimizing the drudgery associated with the agriculturetasks helps the women workers to step forward and make a key contri-bution to agriculture activities.Fig. 1shows the levels of mechanization in the agriculture activitiesof rice crops. In developing countries like India, agriculture mechaniza-tion played a crucial role in uplifting economic growth hammering allthese hurdles (Mehta et al., 2019).Now in the digital era, further automation through digital technolo-gies has widened the horizon of agriculture mechanization especiallywhen backed up with the Internet of things and allied technologies.2. Internet of things and artiﬁcial intelligenceTechnology adoption is the need of the hour as our current tradi-tional farming practices would not be sufﬁcient for meeting the food de- mand. The Internet of things has a huge potential to become a game-changer in agriculture automation and it is already doing wonders intheﬁeld. It is referred to as a network of physical objects called ‘things\", '’ with network connectivity that can enable these objects to collect andexchange data and interact with the environment ( Matta and Pant, 2019). The application of the internet of things backed up with an ef ﬁ- cient intelligent decision-making system can lead to a signi ﬁcant reduc- tion in human intervention in various agricultural tasks. This intelligentdecision-making is the brain of the system, which decides the success,and failure of automated activities. The amalgamation of the internet', 'Fig. 1.Mechanization levels for farm operations in rice crop ( Mehta et al., 2019).A. Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291', '279of things with artiﬁcial intelligence results in powerful systems that caneven beat human decisions in terms of accuracy. Arti ﬁcial Intelligence enabled systems are computer systems that can able to perform opera-tions that generally require human intelligence such as speech recogni-tion, visual perception, decision making, and language translations(Yang, 2020). The Internet of things and artiﬁcial intelligence are con- sidered two sides of the same coin when it comes to the automationof agriculture tasks.Being connected to the internet, the main goal of the IoT device is togenerate real-time data and these data are mostly unstructured. Duringthe early stages of IoT, when the device was simpler, the data generatedwere very few and used to trigger simple alert messages without muchprocessing. There, the AI algorithms had no role to play. As the IoT sys-tems got more complex and sophisticated, this huge data (Big Data)gave rise to the need for data analysis. AI algorithms have the capabilityto handle and derive meaningful insights from the data which can leadto high-quality decision-making. Problem solving and automation havebeen made quite simple by the introduction of new logic and methodssuch as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Machine Vi-sion, Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) etc. Out of all these, Machinelearning and ANN are the most widely applied methods in researchesrelated to automation in agriculture (Jha et al., 2019). Machine learning algorithms can work with labeled (supervised learning) as well as unla-beled data (unsupervised learning). Most of the data driven automationand related operations follow the supervised learning algorithms. Thecurrent agriculture automation systems highly rely on the Arti ﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) which performs well on complex classi ﬁcation tasks. ANN is inspired by the biological neurons and is architectured ina layer fashion. The architecture enables them to learn complex non-linear relationships. Deep learning based computer vision techniquesthat are widely used in agriculture automation are generally builtbased on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).CNN has made tremendous progress and has shown exemplary per-formance in image segmentation, classiﬁcation, detection, and retrieval related tasks, thus reviving the interest of scienti ﬁc community in ANNs (Cireşan et al., 2012;Indolia et al., 2018). The powerful learning ability of CNN is mainly due to the multiple feature extraction stages using aset of layers and convolution operations ( Fig. 2). For a CNN model to classify an image, it has to go through a series of layers that areconvolutional (with kernels/ﬁlters), pooling and fully connected layers.Convolution layer is responsible for extracting the features from the im-ages using kernels. A 2D kernel is a matrix of weights that slides over theinput image data and performs elementwise multiplication with thepart of the input that it is currently on, then it sums the results to a singlepixel. This repetitive sliding operation generates a feature map of theimage. Convolutional operations with different kernels are helpful inoperations such as edge detection, sharpening, blurring, etc. This outputof the convolutional kernels is assigned to the activation units, wherethe non-linearity is added to the model. Tanh, Singmoid and ReLU arethe most commonly used activation functions. Pooling operation is per-formed in the next stage of the CNN in which a signi ﬁcant reduction in number of parameters is performed especially when the images are toolarge. Max pooling, average pooling, min pooling and sum pooling arethe important pooling operations applied over the feature map. Maxpooling identiﬁes the largest element from the output of previouslayer. Average pooling identiﬁes the average of each patch from the fea-ture map. In the next step, the matrix of values is ﬂattened to vector form and fed to a fully connected neural network. With all these fea-tures, a neural network model is constructed and activation functionssuch as softmax or sigmoid are used to classify the outputs into the var-ious classes based on the identiﬁed probability. Over the years, therewere modiﬁ', 'cations in-depth and structure of CNN and this resulted inimproved performance and learning capacity. The work ﬂow operations in image classiﬁcation using CNN is given inFig. 3. There are several deep learning architectures commonly used forimage classiﬁcation such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), VGGNet (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015), GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2014), InceptionNet (Szegedy et al., 2016), ResNet50 (He et al., 2015), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2018), XceptionNet (Chollet, 2017), EfﬁcientNet (Tan and Le, 2020)a n dN A S N e t(Adam and Lorraine, 2019), etc.Table 1shows the major CNN architectures used by re-searchers for image classiﬁcation.Brieﬂy, the Internet of Things and Artiﬁcial Intelligence have enough potential for revolutionizing the agriculture sector to ful ﬁll the increas- ing food demand and reduce the drudgery of agriculture workers.3. Generalized architecture of AI powered IoT ecosystem for agricul-tureAn IoT based agriculture automation system comprises multipletechnologies glued together for achieving the intended task. At the low-est level of the system, it has the IoT sensors deployed on the targetedsite (Fig. 4). This could beﬁelds for soil monitoring, ear tag for cattle,or sensors deployed in a greenhouse, farm machines, and so on. AnIoT device used in the agricultural site has multiple components. Rasp-berry Pi, Arduino, and Beagle Bone are some of the most commonlyused devices, which normally have limited processing memory butcan communicate effectively to outside using the communication mod-ule. They can send/receive signals from the external environment(Fig. 5). Any changes in the environment are captured by the sensorson a real-time basis and will be sent to a remote server or cloud throughan IoT Gateway. The remote server/cloud server is responsible for datamanagement. Data are normally stored in the database. Since the dataare huge and unstructured, traditional relational databases are not pre-ferred for storing this sort of data. NoSQL databases are mostly adoptedacross the cloud and found to be the best ﬁt for the unstructured data and faster accessibility. Features like auto-scaling, availability, and secu-rity make cloud servers a good choice for IoT based applications.In an AI-enabled data pipeline, the data are retrieved from the data-base as CSV, Excel, Images, or any format that can be handled by the an-alyzing program. The data pre-processing involves mainly the datacleaning in terms of removing outliers, normalizing, and so on. For a su-pervised algorithm, the data are divided into a train, validation and testset. Based on the data and the type of operation to be performed, a', 'Fig. 2.Architecture of convolutional neural network.A. Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291', '280variety of algorithms can be applied to the data. Table 2shows a sum- mary of various AI/ML algorithms that are commonly used for agricul-ture applications. A model is created and trained using the trainingdataset and to check the performance and accuracy of the model, thevalidation and test data are utilized. K-Fold Cross-validation methodsare widely used to check model stability. Confusion matrices and theprecision, recall values derived are used to estimate the quality of a clas-siﬁcation model. In the case of image data, CNN (Convolutional NeuralNetwork) and its architecture variations have given very promising re-sults. CNN is a type of artiﬁcial neural network with a speciﬁc architec- ture that uses convolution operation to extract image features. Once themodel is properly validated, it can be deployed in the cloud for generat-ing results for unknown data. Now based on the incoming data, the AImodel can generate intelligent predictions and decisions and thesecan be further communicated to the farmers or utilized for initiatingany operations in the farm. Farmers who are equipped with a smart-phone can easily get the recommendation, prediction results in simplerforms, and take necessary actions. The noti ﬁcations can be in the form ofSMS and email. During the recent period, farmer-friendly mobile andweb applications are also widely used for communicating informationto the farmers. The farmer can control the farm activities through mo-bile applications as well. They can send control signals and accordingly,the actuators can perform necessary actions.4. Applications of IoT and AI in agriculture automationAI-powered IoT ecosystem has tremendous potential to make thefarming practice more controlled and precise by introducing smarterapplications. The scope of recent advancements in these technologiesis endless in agriculture practices as it can automate complex taskswith minimal manual intervention. The brief details of applications ofAI and IoT in Agricultural Engineering are given below ( Fig. 6).4.1. Smart farm machinery4.1.1. Navigation and performance monitoring of tractorsModern farmers use various farm equipment and machinery to per-form various agriculture tasks. Among those, tractors are considered themost essential and irreplaceable farm power unit. Undoubtedly tractorsare an integral part of farm mechanization and constantly helping toraise agriculture productivity day by day. Being a vital part of the agri-culture mechanization system, the performance monitoring of thetractor-implement system is very crucial.The tractor performance monitors measure, record, and help in re-motely visualizing the entire operation. The parameters generallytaken into consideration are power, fuel consumption, draught andwheel slip. Optimization of these parameters can greatly improve thetractor performance. The draught was measured by strain-gaugemounted on a ring transducer at the front end of the drawbar. Thefuel consumption was measured by a positive displacement ﬂow meter and wheel speed by using toothed gears and magnetic pick-ups', 'Fig. 3.Pre-trained CNN model based image classi ﬁcation pipeline.', 'Table 1Comparison of Common CNN based deep learning architectures.Model Year Image Size Depth Size (in MB)No. of Parameters(million)AlexNet 2012 227 × 227 8 227 61VGG16 2014 224 × 224 16 515 138VGG19 2014 224 × 224 19 535 144GoogleNet 2014 224 × 224 22 27 7.0InceptionV3 2015 299 × 299 48 89 23.9ResNet50 2015 224 × 224 50 96 25.6ResNet101 2015 224 × 224 101 167 44.6Xception 2017 299 × 299 71 85 22.9MobileNet 2017 224 × 224 53 13 3.5DarkNet53 2018 256 × 256 53 155 41.6A. Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291', '281(Grogan et al., 1987). A data acquisition system is also handy for moni-toring the performance wherein the transducers are mounted for mea-suring the various operational parameters. The spatial mapping of thetractor-implement performance can be made possible using the Differ-ential Global Position System (DGPS). Global Positioning System (GPS)acts as a major component of this system that provides spatial values.This enables the system to measure, record, and monitor the perfor-mance of the tractor-implement system relative to the position. Sincethe performance of a tractor-implement system is in ﬂuenced by thefactors of soil condition and land slope, this mapping system is highlybeneﬁcial for calculation of the cost of crop production within the ﬁeld boundary (Yahya et al., 2009;Yule et al., 1999). Farms in developed countries now have tractors with an in-builtnavigation system and sensors, monitoring all macro-scopic andmicro-scopic elements in theﬁeld. Nowadays, as farms have becomemore and more connected and internet-enabled, the real potential ofthe internet of things and allied technologies can be effectively utilizedin monitoring the performance of tractors. A general system that mon-itors the tractor navigation and performance includes both hardwareand software parts. The hardware section encompasses the essentialsensors for measuring geo-location, fuelﬂow, and power consumption and these data are transferred to a processing unit or PCB. With a suit-able communication technology like LPWAN (Low Powered WideArea Network), the data are transferred to the network. For the softwareside, web applications developed by connecting with the real-time andscalable database is utilized (Civele, 2019).4.1.2. Autonomous tractors and farm machineryThe agriculture sector is continuously challenged by the shortage ofskilled laborers and low productivity. The advancement in technologyhas introduced tractors, cultivators, and plows that require minimumhuman dependency (Mehta et al., 2021). Farmland is undoubtedly the best place for the use of autonomous machines since they are freefrom crowds and pedestrians and activities can be carried out with min-imum risk. Sensors like radars and lasers are generally used in an auton-omous vehicle to identify any obstacles and handle them intelligently.But the same cannot be applied in the case of tractors as it cannot distin-guish between grass and obstacles. So it cannot be operated like normalautonomous vehicles. One general approach is to use GNSS (Global Nav-igation and Satellite System) using which the machine can locate its po-sition and move to an area autonomously. But since the system wouldbe unaware of the surroundings, this can lead to a collision. Also, in anorchard like environment, autonomous driving will not be possible', 'Fig. 4.Generalized internet of things –artiﬁcial intelligence/machine learning work ﬂow for agricultural solutions.', 'Fig. 5.Architecture of an IoT device.A.

Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291', \"283with GNSS as the satellite positioning will be less accurate. So recent au-tonomous systems in agriculture are heavily dependent on stereo-cameras, sensors and deep learning algorithms. RGB camera with mul-tiple infrared cameras is used to capture the depth images via stereomatching. A popular object detection algorithm YOLO ( Redmon et al., 2016), which is based on CNN, is used for object detection. This detectsthe objects in the bounding boxes of pixels ( Inoue et al., 2019). In the in- dustry abroad, tractor manufacturers like John Deere and Case IH havealready started offering autonomous tractors to the farmers. Case IH'sconcept tractor was enabled with cameras and LiDAR (Light Imaging,Detection, and Ranging) which can accurately identify the obstacles.Faster RCNN (Ren et al., 2016) and SSDs (Liu et al., 2016a) are other few object detection models that are being utilized for object detectionin agriculture applications.Autonomous tractors, rice transplanters, and harvesters have beendeveloped by researchers with nearly the same human ef ﬁciency using deep learning based computer vision methods. The autonomousfruits harvester prototype consisted of mainly an image acquisitionmodule and followed by an image manipulator module that wasmounted on a self-propelled carrier ( Blok et al., 2016). The input was fed into the computer vision-based object detection algorithm to iden-tify the vegetables and fruits for harvesting.4.1.3. UAV or dronesEven though the initial introduction of drones was into military appli-cations, slowly it has capitalized on agriculture applications. The intro-duction of drones into agriculture has become another breakthrough inautomating many of the agriculture tasks such as pesticide spraying,land monitoring, etc. Agricultural drones are a class of Unmanned Aerialvehicles (UAVs) considered as aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Ageneric drone system is shown inFig. 7. The ground station is responsiblefor communicating to the drone with the help of protocols such asMavelink. Most of the ground control stations are equipped with a userinterface to monitor the drone. The hardware is essential in controllingthe row, pitch, and yaw for the UAVs. The drone device consists of actu-ators and motors for performing necessary operations, a set of sensorssuch as laser, radar, camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, GPSreceiver for reading the environment information and a central process-ing unit. To communicate with this, the remote control is used andcommunication is done in the radio frequency range. UAVs are capableof monitoring hectares ofﬁelds in a singleﬂight using the thermal and multi-spectral cameras mounted on them ( El Hoummaidi et al., 2021; Mogili and Deepak, 2018). The cameras can capture the bands with dif-ferent wavelengths and based on the reﬂectance values, indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be calculatedusing the formula.NDVI¼R\", 'INR–RRED ðÞ=R INRþR RED ðÞWhere, R', 'INR=R eﬂectance in the Near Infra-red band, R RED= Reﬂectance in the Red range of the red band.NDVI value ranges from−1 to 1 and 1 being the highest density ofcrops (Bhandari et al., 2012; Reinecke and Prinsloo, 2017 ) and 0 indi- cates no vegetation. These kinds of analyses help to access the healthof the crops and identify the pest attacks.The pesticide application is another key focus area of drone applica-tion. The two main components of the system are the spraying systemand the controller. The spraying system is normally attached to thelower part of the UAV and is connected to the pesticide tank. The nozzleof the sprayer is activated using the controller. At present, the agricul-tural sector has embraced drone technology with both hands to trans-form modern precision farming (van der Merwe et al., 2020). In India, start-up and research organizations are leveraging the opportunity ofdrones in agriculture to make data-driven decision-making on the soilas well as crop health monitoring. The opportunities for drone-based so-lutions in India are endless as the landscape makes ground-based sur-veys costly and time-consuming. The major challenge is setting clearregulations for drone usage (Sylvester, 2018).4.1.4. Irrigation systemsFor our future food requirement, efﬁcient usage of water has para- mount importance and the “per drop more crop”strategy has been identiﬁed for right utilization of the scarce water resources. Technolog-ical intervention for efﬁcient water management has been started foryears, but the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) has taken it to an-other level. The complete workﬂow of an irrigation system can be intel-ligently automated using the Internet of things and decision supportsystems enabled with artiﬁcial intelligence and cloud computing(Fig. 8). The soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors act as', 'Fig. 7.High level architecture of drones.A. Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291', \"284the major source of data that are fed into the system. For a detailed anal-ysis, the data are stored in a database where historic data can be utilizedfor training the model. The artiﬁcial neural network serves as the good-to-go classiﬁcation technique which can be trained with data takenfrom the database for building the model. Once the model is trained, itcan be further used to classify unknown data. Real-time monitoring ismade possible by transferring the data from the sensors through proto-cols like MQTT. In MQTT, the data are published to topics and only thosewho subscribed to the topics can only view the data. The advantage ofusing MQTT is that it is lightweight and can be managed easily by thenetwork. The processing unit will be ready to accept requests from out-side and the module contains a relay and motor connected to it. Thedata can be visualized in an MQTT dashboard ( Nawandar and Satpute, 2019).In remote locations where water scarcity is profound, irrigationheavily depends on underground water. Depending on the water levelinside the well, the pumps should be turned on and off. Diesel engineoperated pumps are generally water-cooled, so the condition of lowwater level can also damage the pump. Hence, proper monitoring ofwater level inside the well may be considered along with the irrigationplanning. In regions with water scarcity and power shortage, an IoTbased solar energy system for smart irrigation can be developed. Inthose systems, during sunshine, the battery can be charged using solarenergy. As in other irrigation systems, these systems are also equippedwith sensors for measuring soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.Along with that, theﬂow rate can also be controlled using aﬂow rate sensor. These systems are designed to focus on the energy-savingcriteria in mind. A control algorithm using fuzzy logic adds value tothe existing irrigation method. Using various combinations of theinput values, conditions can be made to operate the water pump on ap-propriate occasions. Remote monitoring using mobile or web applica-tions makes these systems accessible from anywhere ( Al-Ali et al., 2019).4.1.5. Fertilizer applicationAlong with the presence of weeds, under or over-application of fer-tilizers is another major reason for low yield from the agricultural land.Soil testing is inevitable before adding the fertilizers and this reveals thenutrient requirements of the crop. Because of the complex laboratoryprocedures, the farmers often skip this process. These days, organiza-tions are motivating the farmers to go digital and practice technology-enabled farming practices. IoT technology can help in the applicationof fertilizers more smartly. Nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potas-sium (K) levels can be measured using an NPK sensor which can be de-signed using light-emitting diodes (LED), light-dependent resistor, andresistors. The sensor works based on the Colorimetric and photo-conductivity principles. The values from the NPK sensor are directlyread into a processing unit or system-on-chip. Further analysis is carriedout either using fog computing or edge computing. Fog computing isperformed by the processor directly in contact with the sensors andedge computing is done by an edge server connected through the inter-net. Fuzzy logic helps to analyze and arrive at a conclusion about theamount of fertilizer that needs to be applied. Since cloud services likegoogle cloud platforms provide scalable, timely, uninterrupted serviceand this option can be utilized for SMS service. The recommended fertil-izer quantities are generally sent as text messages to the farmer's mobilephones (Lavanya et al., 2019).The low-cost SPAD has been developed at CIAE, Bhopal for indirectmeasurement of chlorophyll content of leaves of crops in the ﬁeld. It is a compact handheld, portable unit and can be plugged into OTG enabledandroid smartphone for display and data logging of SPAD values. Ithelps in assessment of the nitrogen requirement of the crop.4.1.6. Pest and weed controlThe targeted application of herbicide for controlling weeds remainsa challenge as it induces harmful effects such as health andenvironment-related problems. Moreover, conventional weeding\", 'Fig. 8.Automated irrigation systems using internet of things.A. Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291', '285methods apply herbicides uniformly in the entire ﬁeld irrespective of the presence of weeds and result in increased herbicide cost and moreGHG emissions. To avoid all these problems, one effective approach isto develop a site-speciﬁc system combining the Internet of Things, Ro-botics, and advanced image analysis techniques. For weed detectionon aﬁeld, both RGB and Infrared (IR) imaging sensors can be used.These captured images from theﬁelds are fed into a pre-processingcomponent. The pre-processing component is responsible for resizing,transforming, alteration of the color spaces, and normalization opera-tions. Segmentation is performed on the pre-processed output whichgroups the associated pixels for forming a connected object that has ho-mogeneous properties. This includes separating the plants from the soiland other backgrounds and collecting only the vegetation part. The es-sential features from the segments are taken out in the next stage calledfeature extraction. These include biological morphology, spectral fea-tures, visual textures and spatial contexts. The extraction and combin-ing of various features result in an increased dimensionality. Foreffectiveness, only the essential feature combinations are selectedusing various algorithms such as Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis(SWLDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear DiscriminantAnalysis (LDA), and so on. For theﬁnal classiﬁcation of weeds and crops, either conventional machine learning-based classi ﬁcation or deep learning-based algorithms can be employed. Two major classi ﬁers that are broadly applied in weed detection are support vector machines(SVM) and artiﬁcial neural networks. The SVMs have been successfullyused inﬁelds for the identiﬁcation of weeds in maizeﬁelds (Akbarzadeh et al., 2018). Based on the recent studies, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is found to outperform the other classi ﬁers while analyzing the image. The only limitation of the CNN is that when the features arelarge, and many parameters are to be learned. It imparts heavy compu-tational load and demands higher hardware costs. This can be bypassedusing pre-trained models which can give the state of the art perfor-mance (Wang et al., 2019).Internet of Things based systems for weed control are enabled withprocessing components or system-on-chip such as Raspberry Pi, sen-sors, cameras, and sprayer (for spraying the herbicide on the weed).The vital part of the system is handled by an arti ﬁcial intelligence- based weed classiﬁcation model, which identiﬁes and separates the weed from the crop. The convolutional neural networks are used forbuilding image classiﬁers that can give high accuracy. Based on the out-put of the classiﬁer model, the sprayer gets triggered. The IoT- basedweed control system is very promising automation as it can drasticallydecrease the usage of herbicides and thus a signi ﬁcant reduction in health-related problems (Dankhara et al., 2019). Traditional pest control methods are heavily dependent on thechemicals and the consumers are increasingly concerned about the im-pact of these on the soil and human health. Various strategies can beplanned for saving crops from pests using the internet of things. Remotemonitoring of pests and their activities such as codling moths in appleorchards can be done using IoT devices. This helps to get prepared forthe counter measures. Weather also plays a key role in increasing thepopulation of pests. IoT can help remote weather monitoring very pre-cisely and at a very low cost. Another key aspect to be considered iscrop health. Image processing and AI-enabled systems can automati-cally assess crop growth and alert the probabilities of pest attacks. Oneof the recent trends that have been observed in pest control is the devel-opment of early warning models. These models are big-data driven and', \"as aﬁrst step collect various information that can cause pest growth.This involves real-time data collection from the ﬁelds which are related to soil, weather, other environmental conditions, and a neural networkis trained to predict the degree of pest occurrence in the ﬁeld (Cai et al., 2019). Object detection using Faster R-CNN (faster region-basedconvolutional neural network) is also found to be very effective inpests identiﬁcation in large farms and greenhouses ( Karar et al., 2021). Innovative spraying equipment such as air-assisted sprayers, ULVsprayers, ultrasonic sensor-based sprayers, canopy sprayers, andelectrostatic sprayers can improve the efﬁcacy of spray. This will reduce the application rate as well as the number of sprays in the ﬁeld and hor- ticultural crops, thereby, reducing the pesticide requirement, hazards ofover-application, and reducing the pollution of soil and groundwater.4.2. Automated livestock managementLivestock plays a vital role in rural development and the livelihood.Studies show that there is a huge yield gap since the farmers are follow-ing old age practices. The biggest concern is how to manage and orga-nize the growth of this livestock sector in such a way that the yieldgap can be minimized. Due to this, there is a research opportunitywith the help of advanced technologies that can provide a sustainablesolution. The Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) system automates thecomplete process of monitoring, analyzing and decision making thusensuring the health and wellbeing of the livestock.Backyard poultries are one of the old age practices of most of therural villages and a great asset to the women groups. A poultry manage-ment system facilitates automation through real-time advanced dataanalysis (Ren et al., 2020). There are three main sections for precisionpoultry farming namely the environment, precision feeding system,and poultry welfare. Environment monitoring systems comprisemulti-sensors that are capable of reading temperature, humidity, andgases like CO2and ammonia which can impact the bird's health. Also,deep learning-based prediction models can predict the broiler weightup to 72 h in advance. Robotics also serves as an essential technologyin managing poultry activities (Astill et al., 2020). Autonomous robots can enhance bird health by inducing the movement of birds. Advancedrobots can aerate the litter on the poultry ﬂoor. This will decrease the chance of infections and prevent diseases like Salmonella. The precisionfeeding systems can precisely control the intake of feed. Recent re-searches have proved that precision-fed broiler breeders contribute tomore fertile eggs (Zuidhof et al., 2017). Welfare monitoring systems, on the other hand, are equipped with non-invasive technologies likedigital imaging and vocalization analysis which are backed up with ad-vanced big data analytics.Behavior analysis of cattle provides better insights into their health,early disease detection, feed intake, heat, and estrus events. Monitoringall the cattle on the farm is often a tedious job and requires close obser-vation. Animal-attached sensors are one solution that can be employedfor automated monitoring and may be implemented in various smalland large-scale cattle farms (Williams et al., 2020). The current behavior monitoring and analysis automation system is commonly equippedwith components such as sensors attached to the leg, neck, or ear of an-imals, sensor nodes to process and transmit the observations, and an AI-enabled model to update the status of the animal ( Fig. 9). The machine learning models developed are fed with the time-series data generatedfrom the sensors. It is often a good practice to select only the relevantfeatures required to build the AI model. For this feature selection,methods are employed which identify the best combination of featuresthat can be handy in performing the decision making based on the sta-tistical importance of a combination of features. The algorithm perfor-mance is evaluated in two approaches viz. Leave Out One Animal(LOOA) and Stratiﬁed Cross-Validation (SCV). In LOOA, the data fromall the remaining animals act as the test set and others become the train-ing set. In the SCV approach, data from all the animals are combined andevaluated similar to the K fold cross-validation ( Rahman et al., 2018). The productivity on a dairy farm is heavily dependent on the ef ﬁ- cient and timely reproductivity of the cattle. The traditional system ofartiﬁcial insemination is not accurate because of the lack of techniquesfor timely identiﬁcation of the estrus and calving events. Automatedsystems using sensors like accelerometer, pedometer, temperature sen-sor, etc. can collect information about the current state of the cattle. Dur-ing estrus and calving events, their activity duration and patterns varyfrom a normal state. From the data collected, an arti ﬁcial intelligence model can analyze this pattern to identify anomalies in the activityA. Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291\", '286and thereby conclude that the cow is undergoing the calving or estrusevent. The most important three parameters that can determine thestate of the cattle are hourly ruminating time, feeding time, and restingtime. These can be easily obtained from the accelerometer data. The ru-minating time and feeding time are extracted from the accelerometermounted on the neck and standing time from the accelerometermounted on the leg of the cattle. While detecting the cattle is in estrusor not, any binary classiﬁcation models such as logistic regression canbe used (Benaissa et al., 2020).An IoT based livestock management system requires complex deci-sion making, often the data analysis is performed on the cloud or remoteservers. This is because of micro-controller inside the collar or ear, hasvery limited processing and consumes a lot of power in complex com-putations. Livestock automation systems are also data-driven andthese livestock data are generally unstructured. It can fall into any cate-gories of text, image, audio and so on. Generally, the statistical methodsperform poorly on the unstructured and noisy data. In simple classi ﬁca- tion problems and pattern recognition, multi-layer perceptron feed for-ward neural networks work well ( Gutierrez-Galan et al., 2018). However, for image analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)and their variations are proved to be much more accurate.4.3. Greenhouse managementMaintaining the environmental variables inside the greenhouse is atedious activity due to involvement of many parameters. These ﬂuctua- tions in climate can damage the crops as well, so it is one of the areaswhere technological intervention can make the life of farmers easierthan ever before. The local climate and environment parameters ofmodern greenhouses can be measured using sensors. Wireless SensorNetworks with a large number of nodes have the capability to performsensing, actuating, and communicating the information to the stake-holders. The architecture generally consists of a wireless sensor networkdata management sub-systems and a base station which are responsiblefor monitoring (Akkaşand Sokullu, 2017). For data storage, a remote server or cloud server is preferred. The general architecture of the sys-tem is quite similar to other IoT based monitoring systems. Along withthe monitoring, a signiﬁcant level of actuation can also be done withthe help of these systems. The systems can be connected with anyconnecting protocols like bluetooth or zigbee and collect the moisturedata from the soil. The connected micro-irrigation system can get trig-gered when the moisture level is below the threshold level. Similar ac-tivities can be performed in case of temperature and humidity as well.The data can be made available in a public dashboard that can beaccessed remotely from any location. Providing summary data on adaily basis can help in planning for the upcoming days ( Ullah et al., 2018).Another looming issue that greenhouses currently face is the pest at-tacks because of the favourable conditions inside the greenhouse. So In-tegrated Pest Management (IPM) is one of the core aspects of ef ﬁcient greenhouse implementation. The most basic method that generally im-plemented is the use of sticky paper traps which can attract pests. Thissticky paper can give the approximate population density of the pest.This helps in planning precise pest control and management strategies.This manual inspection can further be automated using image process-ing algorithms which partially solves this problem. To have a fully auto-mated system, the micro-controller enabled monitoring can beemployed. This method can collect sticky paper images using RGB cam-eras installed in various locations of the greenhouse. The core process-ing element of the system is Raspberry Pi or Arduino with an RGBcamera interfaced with it. The sensor nodes are designed normally ina waterproof structure and the nodes can be connected in a topologylike a star, such that they can send the data to the outside world throughthe Gateway. Images can be transferred to the remote server using HTTPPOST protocol. Further image analysis can be performed at the server.Theﬁndings of the analysis are directly visible in a dashboard main-tained by the server. Conventional machine learning algorithms likeSVM (Support Vector Machines) with a suitable kernel (radial basis ker-nel) can be used for analysis purposes. Labeling of the insects is done bythe entomologists so that the data can be modelled and trained effec-tively for identiﬁcation of unknown pests (Rustia et al., 2020). Object detection models are also found to be effective in identifying tinypests present in the greenhouses (Li et al., 2021). Prior to the actual cultivation of crops inside the greenhouses, it isrecommended to go for an evaluation of the micro-climatic conditionsinside the greenhouses. This helps in an optimal design of energy-', 'efﬁcient greenhouses with adaptive climate control methods. Data ac-quisition and interpretation help to monitor and plan strategies for min-imizing the cost of cooling systems that are often affordable for growers.Also with the help of the IoT and decision support system, a relationshipcan be established between the micro-climate variation and the growthof the crops which can help the growers, a better insight about the cropgrowth rate before the cultivation. A model that is built processes thedata from theﬁeld which may include temperature, humidity, vapourpressure, solar radiation, etc. and simulates the comfort ratio for differ-ent growth stages of the crops. This can be used to plan better control', 'Fig. 9.Smart collar system for smart dairy management.A. Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291', '287recommendations for managing the greenhouses effectively ( Shamshiri et al., 2020).4.4. Farm produce storage systemsDespite all the technologies and innovations that have become a partof the regular agricultural activities, some tasks such as monitoring thefarm produce storage systems continued to be done manually. A verysmall human error in this activity can create a recurring and seriousissue for the farm and supply chain beyond. As there is a common ten-dency to look at the technology for assistance, the internet of things canprovide a good solution in this case as well. Wireless sensor nodes canbe effectively used for monitoring the quality of the farm produce insidethe storage units. For ensuring the optimum temperature and humidityinside the storage, temperature and humidity sensors can be deployed.The time series values of the sensor reading may vary by a small margin.Cumulative values are derived from this to assess the temperature andhumidity variations in storage system. The threshold for each of theseparameters is set with respect to the farm produce stored in the storagestructure. Sensor nodes to the internet through a gateway and data ag-gregation is performed at the remote database server. Connecting thedata insights to the graphical user interface can help the farmers locallymonitor the storage conditions. This technique is adopted by farmersand widely used in seed potato storage systems in developed countries(Tervonen, 2018). Detection and removal of pesticide residues are alsovery important during the storage to ensure food safety. For effectivedetection of pesticide residues, CNN models can be applied on thehyperspectral images of the fruits and vegetables ( Jiang et al., 2019). A cold storage management system is generally designed to operatein a controlled environment. Automated cold storage systems are alsobeneﬁcial for storing agricultural produce for a longer duration. The sys-tem design remains the same as that of the normal storage system ex-cept automation using IoT. Connecting an appropriate alarmingsystem or mobile application that can help in local monitoring and con-trol of the system (Kumar et al., 2018). Apart from the temperature andhumidity of the container, often the carbon monoxide levels are alsomonitored for better control using MQ sensors. Some of the storage sys-tems use LDR sensors for providing proper lighting and smoke sensorsto detect any forms ofﬁre. If the system does not require advanced an-alytics, the data are managed locally than in the cloud platforms.5. Challenges and opportunitiesDespite the fact that technology can revolutionize the agriculturesector, a lack of technical knowledge among farmers to use thetechnology-led machinery is a major challenge in the ecosystem. Thebest way to tackle this is to keep the farmers in mind while developingthe systems. The designers need to focus on the user interface in thecase of digital products and providing solutions in local languages arethe possible ways to overcome the challenge. The quality and cost ofthe devices and sensors are major concerns for small scale farmers, toadopt the advanced technology. The reliability of the system also hasparamount importance in IoT solutions. The decision made using thedecision support systems directly impacts the agriculture practices soany threats to the operation or failure of any component will lead to re-liability issues. Regarding the data management and security of the gen-eral IoT applications, being a network of small objects which are widelydistributed, IoT systems have very limited resources in terms of theirprocessing and storage. Proper data management strategies are to beemployed to make the most out of these resource constraint networks.Since the IoT devices are heterogeneous, interoperability is very crucialand the devices need to be in proper synchronization for a better oper-ation. The presence of multiple vendors and a large number of devicesmake this a difﬁcult task. The data from the IoT devices are increasingday by day and horizontal scaling will be required at any point in time(Villa-Henriksen et al., 2020). The heterogeneity of the data from thedevices is also a major challenge that has been addressed by re-searchers, as the data can be structured, semi-structured, or even un-structured.The system should be able to handle and process all forms of data.Designing cloud-based architecture for IoT applications can be used totackle this challenge as the cloud service can provide immense comput-ing power, huge storage capacity, and is highly scalable. Also in the caseof AI algorithms, the quality and quantity of data decide the quality ofdecision making. Getting a huge volume of quality data is a big concernfor building AI-based models.Fig. 10showsﬁve major challenges in the adoption of IoT and analyt-ics solutions and it is clear that security is a major concern among all(Bosche et al., 2018). The agriculture solutions deal with very less per-sonal data as compared to other health care and military applications.Still, the farm and crop information is passed through a channel, there', '05101520253035404550', 'Security IT/OT Integra/g415on Unclear ROI Technical Exper/g415seInteroperabilityPercentage of Respondents', 'Challenges Iden/g415ﬁed', 'Fig. 10.Top 5 barriers in the adoption of IoT/analytics solutions ( Bosche et al., 2018).A. Subeesh and C.R. Mehta Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 278 –291', '288are high chances for a security breach. The communication delay is an-other major area that needs to be focused on. Since IoT solutions aretargeted to work in real-time, the messages and information passed tothe end user should reach them on time. Any delayed information willbe of no use as the user has to act on it spontaneously.IoT and AI systems are continuing to grow and they enhance the op-portunities for increased value creation and capture. Despite all thechallenges, they are expected to contribute in future to make agricultureautomated and smart. There are opportunities for these technologies intransforming the agriculture activities. The evolution of 5G technologywill be pivotal in enhancing the opportunity of the Internet of thingsin the upcoming years. 5G is having a hundred times better capacitythan 4G networks and this can incredibly contribute to increased inter-net speed. Since the communication delay is a constraint of current IoTsystems, this will be solved by the evolution of 5G, wherein the responsecan be obtained faster than the blink of an eye. The sensors and embed-ded technologies will continue to be cheaper and widely available in thefuture and will make IoT very promising in the future. The growth of Ar-tiﬁcial intelligence and advanced algorithms fuel up the decision mak-ing of smarter applications.6. ConclusionsIn this work, a comprehensive review of digitization and automationin agriculture using AI and IoT has been presented.

', 'For genomic  proﬁling  data, the underlying  mechanism  is the gene regu- ', 'latory pathway/network:  multiple  genes can interact  with one another  ', '(to activate,  inhibit,  or enhance  gene expression)  and compose  a struc- ', 'tured hieratical  network  to regulate  the biological  functions  [31] , which ', 'is the key to modeling  genomic  proﬁling  data through  deep learning.

However,  these methods  ', 'also have shortcomings.

', 'In machine  learning,  hyper-parameter  selection  and network  archi- ', 'tecture selection  usually  require  specialized  knowledge,  and machine  ', 'learning  methods  are very challenging  for people who are not experts  ', 'to use. The development  of automated  machine  learning  (AutoML)  aims ', 'to simplify  these processes  and democratize  AI for all. Automatic  model ', '2 D. Liu, C. Xu, W. He et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 1 (2021) 100017 ', 'selection,  feature selection,  hyper-parameter  search, and neural archi- ', 'tecture search are commonly  used in AutoML  [39–43]  . However,  in ge- ', 'nomics,  most studies are still limited to handcrafted  DNN structures  and ', 'parameter  space. ', 'To address  these challenges  and further facilitate  genomic  studies ', 'using deep learning,  we propose  AutoGenome,  an end-to-end  AutoML  ', 'framework  for genomic  study. In AutoGenome,  we propose  the RFCN ', 'and its variants  and validate  that they outperform  MLP and VAE. We ', 'also use hyper-parameter  search and the eﬃcient  network  architec-  ', 'ture search [41] (ENAS)  algorithm  in AutoGenome  to enable automatic  ', 'search for brand-new  neural network  architectures.

', '2. Results  ', 'RFCN outperforms  MLP in genomic  proﬁling  data modeling  ', 'Looking  back at the success  of deep learning  in the ImageNet  chal- ', 'lenge [44] , we can see that the increasing  network  depths played an im- ', 'portant  role [ 14 , 35 , 36 ]. However,  simply increasing  the network  depth ', 'can cause the vanishing  gradient  problem  [ 37 , 38 ]. A residual  network  ', 'was then proposed  to resolve this problem  by adding a shortcut  at each ', 'layer, achieving  smooth  gradient  backpropagation  ( Fig. 1 d). ResNets  ', '[45] , HighwayNets  [46] and DenseNets  [47] are major variants  of the ', 'residual  network.  The residual  network  also enhances  feature propaga-  ', 'tion and encourages  feature reuse. ', 'In order for the residual  network  to work for genomic  proﬁling  data, ', 'we propose  an RFCN. Unlike previous  residual  networks  [ 45 , 47 ], which ', 'use the convolution  layer as the basic unit, the RFCN uses the fully- ', 'connected  layer as the basic unit, and each layer may connect  to the next ', 'layer directly  ( Fig. 2 a left, Path 1), through  a skip connection  ( Fig. 2 a ', 'left, Path 2), or through  a branch ( Fig. 2 a left, Path 3). The basic fully- ', 'connected  (FC) unit is shown in Fig. 2 a right. The FC unit comprises  ', 'a sequence  of a fully-connected  layer, batch normalization  layer, and ', 'activation  function  layer. ', 'By replacing  the CNN unit with the FC unit in the standard  form of ', 'ResNet/DenseNet,  we introduce  the RFCN variants:  RFCN-ResNet  and ', 'RFCN-DenseNet  ( Fig. 2 b and c). In RFCN-ResNet,  each FC unit takes ', 'the summation  of the previous  unit’s output and input as its own input ', '( Fig. 2 b). In RFCN-DenseNet,  each FC unit takes the concatenation  of ', 'all the outputs  from previous  units as its input ( Fig. 2 c). To simplify  the ', 'use of RFCN-ResNet  and RFCN-DenseNet  for researchers,  we have imple- ', 'mented  the algorithms  in AutoGenome,  which can be used to search for ', 'the best RFCN-ResNet/RFCN-DenseNet  structures  and hyper-parameters  ', 'automatically  (see Methods).  ', 'To assess the performance  of RFCN-ResNet  and RFCN-DenseNet,  we ', 'designed  a series of experiments  on two independent  datasets  and com- ', 'pared the performances  with XGBoost  [48] (a popular  machine  learn- ', 'ing algorithm)  and AutoKeras  [39] (a popular  AutoML  tool). In the ﬁrst ', 'experiment,  we used gene expression  proﬁles  from 8127 samples,  cor- ', 'responding  to 24 tumor types from the TCGA [49] dataset,  to perform  ', 'a pan-cancer  classiﬁcation  task; somatic  mutation  proﬁles  from 6186 ', 'TCGA samples  (24 tumor types) were also used to perform  pan-cancer  ', 'classiﬁcation  independently.

Discussion  ', 'Genomic  proﬁling  data are crucial for biomedical  researches,  and ', 'they are growing  rapidly.  Hence machine  learning  methods  are being ', 'used by researchers  to predict and interpret  genomic  data. However,  ', 'many of the methods  also have shortcomings,  and new neural network  ', 'architectures,  which mirror the recent progresses  in computer  vision, ', 'natural  language  processing,  and speech processing,  are needed  to over- ', 'come challenges  in this area. Compared  with the widely used MLP ar- ', 'chitecture,  the advantages  of the RFCN architecture  are signiﬁcant:  a. ', 'RFCN can be used to train deeper neural networks;  b.

AutoGenome  has made it ', 'easy for researchers  to use the RFCN in their research.  ', 'After reviewing  several genomic  research  publications,  we found ', 'that most of the published  MLP-based  neural networks  have less than ', '4 layers (Fig. S4a). We have summarized  the depth (number  of hidden ', 'layers) of the best model for RFCN architectures  in experiments  1 and ', '2 (Supp. Table 4). The depth of RFCN-ResNet  and RRFCN  are around ', '6 to 7, and the depth of RFCN-DenseNet  is around 11. RFCN architec-  ', 'tures can be used to train neural networks  with more hidden layers. ', 'We also looked into the correlations  between  the depth of RRFCN  and ', 'accuracy  (Fig. S4b), and found that the model delivered  the highest  ac- ', 'curacy when the depth was around 6 to 7. Further  increasing  the depth ', 'would not improve  the performance.  This might be relevant  to the com- ', 'plexity of the problems  as well as the underlying  gene regulatory  path- ', 'way/network.  ', 'In our experiments,  RFCN architectures  were proven to have bet- ', 'ter performances  than MLP architectures,  but for the three RFCN vari- ', 'ants (RFCN-ResNet,  RFCN-DenseNet,  and RRFCN),  the performances  ', 'were similar ( Fig. 2 d).

This paper ', 'analyzes trends and highlights the potential benefits of blockchain deployment in IoT and healthcare. According ', 'to the literature, blockchain technology is mostly utilized for data management operations in healthcare and IoT, ', 'specifically to improve data security, which includes data integrity, access control, and privacy preservation. In ', 'both areas, six distinct types of data security preservation strategies are applied. Additionally, publications ', 'highlight how blockchain and IoT, including health IoT, can be used in an integrative way. Three integration ', 'mechanisms were seen to accomplish this goal. These solutions range from fully integrating blockchain into data ', 'exchanges between IoT devices to using it solely for metadata storage. The most frequently covered area of IoT is ', 'a smart city, where blockchain is utilized to improve real-time data sharing, and electricity trading, and so on. ', 'Additionally, it is learned that, despite the numerous benefits of blockchain in healthcare, authors typically use it ', 'for drug supply chain management and data management purposes in order to avoid counterfeiting and empower ', 'patients with regard to their data, respectively.   ', '1.Introduction ', 'Blockchain technology is a widely lauded technological advance -', 'ment that is projected to fundamentally revolutionize human activities ', 'and relationships [1,2]. As a result, academics, developers, and practi -', 'tioners have developed an increased level of interest. Thus, numerous ', 'platforms, systems, and prototypes are designed. Among the most ', 'notable platforms are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger, all of which ', 'have influenced various issues of blockchain usage. ', 'With the emergence of Bitcoin, blockchain technology became the ', 'cryptocurrency ’s foundation. Following that, Ethereum reintroduced ', 'smart contracts, reshaping the way blockchain is used, resulting in the ', 'emergence of varied smart contract-based applications such as crowd -', 'funding and smart property. Subsequently, it expanded to be used in a ', 'wide variety of application domains, including industry, healthcare, and ', 'supply chain, which is referred to as blockchain 3.0 [3]. ', 'This progress is the result of advances in computer and economics ', 'principles, most notably peer-to-peer networks, asymmetric cryptog -', 'raphy, consensus protocols, decentralized storage, decentralized ', 'computing & smart contracts, and incentive systems [4]. ', 'This review article discusses the use of blockchain in a single appli -', 'cation domain, namely healthcare, as well as other areas where block -', 'chain and IoT are employed simultaneously. This is done with a ', 'particular emphasis on smart city and drug supply chain, which are the two most notable applications of blockchain in the IoT and healthcare, ', 'respectively. ', 'The application of blockchain technology in an IoT environment is ', 'made possible by integrating the two technologies. Accordingly, this ', 'review examines numerous ways for integrating blockchain with IoT ', 'that can be used in a range of application domains. The integration ', 'approaches vary in terms of the role of blockchain in the overall system, ', 'the extent to which blockchain is involved in data exchanges between ', 'IoT devices, and the degree to which systems place an emphasis on ', 'blockchain for service provision. The integration mechanisms discussed ', 'in this review are classified broadly based on existing literature ', 'observations. ', 'Security is one of the benefits that blockchain can provide to ', 'healthcare and the Internet of Things. This benefit covers a variety of ', 'topics, including the protection of data, systems, and networks. Data ', 'security is a crucial component of data management. Data management ', 'is presented in this review as the acquisition, processing, dissemination, ', 'retrieval, security, and storage of data. For a variety of reasons, it is ', 'necessary to strengthen all data management activities in both health -', 'care and IoT settings. For example, in healthcare, the absence of unique ', 'patient identity, the unavailability of messaging that enables syntactic ', 'and semantic interoperability between systems, and the lack of data ', 'encoding standards can all be noted as impediments [5].

As a result, a more effective data management ', 'method has been required. Several authors have advocated ', 'blockchain-based systems as a solution. The usage of blockchain in ', 'healthcare and the Internet of Things is discussed in this review. ', 'Both smart city and drug supply chain management face challenges ', 'on multiple levels. These problems range from technical concerns, such ', 'as the explosion of big data, to economic issues, such as financial loss as ', 'a result of product counterfeiting. The following figure (Fig. 1) illus-', 'trates the issues and solutions that existed prior to the advent of ', 'blockchain. ', 'Recently, blockchain has been used alone or in combination with ', 'existing solutions in both smart city and the drug supply chain to address ', 'some of the issues. The usage of blockchain for these purposes is moti-', 'vated by its qualitative characteristics, which include the reliability, ', 'robustness, and fault-tolerant capabilities of the systems that can be ', 'developed on top of it [6–8]. However, designing blockchain-based ', 'systems in both the healthcare and IoT domains presents several chal-', 'lenges. The primary ones that the literatures describe the most include ', 'securing the confidentiality, increasing throughput and scalability, ', 'limited storage capacity, and a lack of regulatory guidance. ', 'Despite the challenges, various systems and prototypes are being ', 'developed in both healthcare and IoT. Along with demonstrating the ', 'benefits that blockchain brings to these two domains, this review dis-', 'cusses how it is being used for a variety of applications. As so, the review ', 'is organized as follows. Following this introduction, background infor-', 'mation on blockchain technology, the Internet of Things, and Health ', 'Information Technology (HIT) is provided. Following that, the meth -', 'odology followed to prepare this review is described. Subsequently the ', 'review ’s result is presented, which includes a full summary of the re-', 'view ’s findings. After that, succeeding sections include the review ’s ', 'discussion, open issues, conclusion, and limitations. ', '1.1. Prior reviews ', 'Despite the fact that blockchain is a relatively new study topic, ', 'various literature reviews have been undertaken on the subject in general and on certain application areas in particular. Additionally, ', 'there are researches that focus on specific issues within a particular ', 'application domain. The reviews that were chosen after meeting the ', 'screening criteria outlined in the methodology section are listed below ', '(Table 1). ', 'Hence the reviews are longlisted, it may be necessary to conduct a ', 'review of the reviews as a tertiary review to assess the areas addressed ', 'and the limitations of the research conducted thus far, identical to what ', 'is done by Kitchenham B. et al. [20]. Despite the abundance of reviews, ', 'there are still issues that have not been addressed by the prior reviews. It ', 'is noted that prior reviews.  ', 'a.

Somehow they don’t indicate how to extend solutions from one ', 'application area to the other, which [23] calls “exaptation ” and [24] ', 'labels it “knowledge brokering ” in which analogical reasoning is ', 'employed to deploy knowledge from where it is known to where it is ', 'unknown. ', 'Additionally, as illustrated in Table 1, there is no review that thor-', 'oughly addresses the integration of blockchain and IoT. Furthermore, ', 'data management activities are not exhaustively covered. When ', 'considering data security in isolation, the authors in Refs. [11,12] ', 'addressed it to a degree. However [11], does not go into detail about ', 'blockchain-based IoT security solutions. According to the authors, this is ', 'because there is a dearth of publications devoted to the actual usage of ', 'blockchain, and so the majority of works focus on illustrating the ben-', 'efits associated with its use.

Additionally, it contributes to a better knowledge of other ', 'issues, such as the privacy-preserving techniques used in blockchain- ', 'based systems.

For some, such as [11,25,26], blockchain is a distributed digital Table 1 ', 'List of selected prior reviews [9–19]. ', 'E.M. Adere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Array 14 (2022) 100139', '4ledger. Others, including [27–29], regard it as a data structure and there ', 'are also authors for example [30,31] that consider it as a transaction ', 'management technology. ', 'The differences arise due to the perspectives from which the authors ', 'consider blockchain and the continuous evolution of the technology, ', 'which makes it a moving target. As previously presented, blockchain ', 'technology has evolved from blockchain 1.0 to blockchain 3.0. The ', 'development is made on various aspects particularly those given as the ', 'foundations of blockchain in Refs. [32–34] where four distinct concepts ', 'are referred to as “fundamentals ” in each publication. While concepts ', 'are varied, peer-to-peer networks, distributed ledger, consensus mech -', 'anism, smart contract, and application area or use can all be considered ', 'as critical. ', '2.1.1. Peer to peer (P2P) network ', 'Essentially, blockchain is a peer-to-peer network. P2P networks have ', 'a variety of topologies, communication patterns between nodes, and ', 'types of nodes that participate. Predominantly, there are three main ', 'categories of network topologies, which are centralized, decentralized ', 'structured, and decentralized unstructured [35]. ', 'In centralized peer-to-peer networks, a central directory server keeps ', 'track of network resources and their addresses. However, in a decen -', 'tralized structured topology, there is no central directory server, but ', 'rather a structure in which selected nodes maintain a Distributed Hash ', 'Table (DHT) containing information on the placement of resources is ', 'utilized. On the other hand, with a decentralized unstructured topology, ', 'there is no central directory server and no file placement guideline ', 'dictating the location of data. Rather than that, there is a flexible rule ', 'allowing nodes to enter and quit the network freely, and nodes can join ', 'the network anonymously. In P2P networks, there are instances where ', 'several nodes participate. In these instances, strategies such as clustering ', 'are used to make the network manageable. Clustering techniques that ', 'are often used include partition-based, density-based, hierarchical- ', 'based, and grid-based clustering [36]. ', 'The topologies have an effect on the way nodes communicate. After ', 'receiving information about the location of data from the directory ', 'server, nodes in a centralized P2P network can initiate direct in-', 'teractions. DHT is maintained at nodes using key and value formats in a ', 'decentralized structured topology. The keys are used to denote infor-', 'mation about the value, or data. Nodes gain access to data by utilizing ', 'the information stored within. In decentralized unstructured networks, ', 'communication is accomplished using flooding, gossiping, and random ', 'walks, among other techniques. Nodes in this configuration deliver their ', 'messages to other nodes at random. ', 'P2P networks can also be characterized as homogeneous or hetero -', 'geneous based on the peer types involved. A homogeneous network is ', 'defined by nodes that have similar storage, computation, communica -', 'tion, sensing, and energy capabilities. In heterogeneous networks, there ', 'is variation in one of the above issues between nodes [37]. ', 'As indicated previously, peers can join a decentralized unstructured ', 'P2P network freely. In contrast, peers in a centralized P2P network are ', 'required to obtain permission. This property of peer-to-peer is inherited ', 'by blockchain. Additionally, the governance model is being used to ', 'classify blockchains. As a result, blockchain systems can be broadly ', 'classified into two classes based on the presence of permission and ', 'network governance followed. As per the presence of permission, there ', 'are two types, which are permissioned and permissionless. According to ', 'governance, there are also two kinds, which are public and private. ', 'Comparisons between the two is made in Ref. [38] and the adapted ', 'version is depicted in the following table (Table 2). ', '2.1.2. Distributed ledger ', 'A distributed ledger is made up of blocks that are formed by a group ', 'of transactions. To better understand block and transaction, the content ', 'of each is presented in the following table (Table 3). ', 'As illustrated above, the Merkle root hash value of transactions and the prior block ’s hash value are contained in the block header. This ', 'ensures the immutability and security of transactions and blocks. The ', 'creation of a block is contingent upon the solving of a mathematical ', 'puzzle, the difficulty level of which is specified in the block ’s header. ', 'Mining is the process of creating a block. This is accomplished crypto -', 'graphically by computing a value less than the specified difficulty level. ', 'The mining process consumes time and processing power therefore, the ', 'participant who solves the puzzle is compensated for the work, after ', 'submitting the evidence. ', 'It is worth noting, however, that the content of a block differs be-', 'tween platforms. In Ethereum, for example, in addition to the parent ’s ', 'block hash, the hash of the parent ’s sibling is included. Additionally, the ', 'transactions tree in Ethereum and Parity is formed using the Patricia- ', 'Merkle tree, but in Hyperledger, the Bucket-Merkle tree is used [33]. ', 'These are done to improve the efficiency of transaction search and ', 'updating. ', '2.1.3. Consensus mechanisms ', 'Consensus is used in blockchain to ensure that nodes agree on the ', 'validity of a block. Consensus methods range from those that are entirely ', 'computational in nature, such as proof of work, to those that are ', 'communication-based, such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance ', '(PBFT) [32,33]. There are various consensus mechanisms in between ', 'the two, including Proof of Stake (PoS), Threshold Relay, and Proof of ', 'Burn. Along with the popular ones, the reviewed literature makes use of ', 'their enhanced variants. In connection with this, there are other ', 'high-quality reviews, such as [40,41] that can be referred to for ', 'clarification.

Smart contract ', 'A smart contract can be thought of as an automatically invoked ', 'procedure that is initiated when a transaction is executed. All blockchain ', 'systems support smart contracts; however, they differ in terms of the ', 'language in which smart contracts can be written and the environment ', 'in which they are executed. Solidity, Golang, Serpent, Java, Python, and ', 'LLL are the most often used smart contract languages. There are ', 'numerous execution environments available, including the Ethereum ', 'Virtual Machine (EVM), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Docker Image, ', 'and Haskell execution environment [32,33]. ', '2.1.5. Application area and use of blockchain ', 'As previously presented, the advancement of blockchain is primarily ', 'demonstrated by the growth of its application area and the purpose for ', 'which it is used. The application domain and purpose of blockchain ', 'utilization have an effect on the aforementioned fundamental block -', 'chain issues. ', 'In this context, certain sectors such as healthcare, financial systems, ', 'and digital rights management necessitate the use of a centralized peer- ', 'to-peer network or a permissioned private blockchain. A single ledger is ', 'used at a central server in this scenario, with peers maintaining meta-', 'data or pointers to their data. Decentralized structured topology is also ', 'recommended to be employed in banking by Ref. [42], in which a DHT ', 'can be employed to maintain references to the data that can be acces -', 'sible through blockchain. The data can be stored in a centralized store ', 'such as a cloud or in randomly selected nodes and DHT is utilized to ', 'enhance data availability [43]. ', 'Decentralized unstructured topology is the most frequent way for ', 'developing blockchain-based architectural designs in cryptocurrency ', 'and some IoT contexts that involve several nodes. Clustering techniques ', 'similar to those mentioned above are also used in blockchain systems ', '[44]. The communication methods outlined above are equally appli -', 'cable in instances when blockchain technology is used. In this light, ', 'Bitcoin can be viewed as an illustration of a decentralized unstructured ', 'P2P network in which transactions are broadcasted to participants ', 'through gossiping. Similarly, gossip is utilized in Hyperledger Fabric to distribute metadata when a new peer joins the network and to construct ', 'and maintain a local view of other peers [45]. The following figure ', '(Fig. 2) depicts the fundamental components of blockchain. ', '2.2. Internet of Things (IoT) ', 'The Internet of Things is a subset of the Future Internet, in which ', '“things ” with identities, physical characteristics, and virtual personal -', 'ities integrate seamlessly through intelligent interfaces [46]. In IoT, ', 'numerous software, middleware, and hardware devices are involved. ', 'It is a well-known fact that IoT devices have fundamental constraints ', 'such as limited memory space, poor processing power, and limited ', 'battery life [47]. Additionally, they are typically scattered and may be ', 'located in an open setting in a variety of geographical locations. ', 'Furthermore, they are relatively new technology [48]. As a result, they ', 'are vulnerable to attacks, and their security methods must account for ', 'these. Moreover, communication between devices may be based on ad ', 'hoc IP protocols [49] such as Near Field Communication (NFC), Blue-', 'tooth, IEEE 802.15.4, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and 6LoWPAN [50]. Also, ad hoc ', 'communication can occur over the internet, a mobile communication ', 'network, a satellite network, or a wireless network [51]. There is a ', 'possibility that such communications will expose information systems to ', 'threats such as intrusion and data tampering. ', 'Additionally, due to the lack of a widely acknowledged layering ', 'scheme for IoT, there are architectural variances across them [52]. Ac-', 'cording to a number of publications, IoT devices consist of three layers: ', 'application layer, network layer, and perception layer [52]. Smart en-', 'ergy, healthcare, and smart city are all examples of the application layer ', 'in Ref. [53]. The network layer, on the other hand, includes devices such ', 'as routers, switches, gateways, and firewalls. Embedded systems and ', 'sensors are included in the perception layer. Despite this widespread ', 'layering, some add a business layer, a service management layer or ', 'middleware layer, and a physical layer to the above once [47]. The ', 'variation in layering is attributable to a variety of reasons, including the ', 'IoT device ’s release version, the standard that vendors adhere to, the ', 'device ’s functionality and complexity, and so on. This mismatch exposes ', 'Fig. 2.The fundamental components of a blockchain.  E.M. Adere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Array 14 (2022) 100139', '6IoT devices to attack and prevents them from communicating securely. ', 'Furthermore, unlike traditional devices, which share some operating ', 'systems, there are no dominant operating systems utilized by a large ', 'number of devices in IoT [54]. Moreover, there is a lack of specific data ', 'formats. As a result, establishing interoperability between them is ', 'challenging [47]. One option that has been used is the use of middleware ', 'to facilitate the integration of IoT devices [48], although this has ', 'inherent security problems. Although numerous other efforts have been ', 'made, blockchain technology has recently been suggested as a possible ', 'way to address some of the aforementioned challenges. ', '2.3. Health information technology (HIT) ', 'For decades, health information technology (HIT) has been the focus ', 'of various studies. Throughout, a variety of systems have been designed ', 'and implemented. Several of these include the Electronic Health Record ', '(EHR), Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE), Electronic Medical ', 'Record (EMR), clinical decision support, electronic result reporting, ', 'electronic prescribing, Personal Health Record (PHR), mobile ', 'computing, telemedicine (remote monitoring), electronic health ', 'communication, data exchange networks, knowledge retrieval systems, ', 'and Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) [55–57]. Addi-', 'tionally, there are others, like electronic Medication Administration ', 'Records (eMAR) and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems ', '(PACS) [58]. ', 'Recently, health IoT (HIoT), which is the subset of HIT, in which ', 'embedded medical devices, sensors, and IoT-enabled wearable devices ', 'are connected through long and short-range communication technolo -', 'gies are being synchronously utilized. In HIoT, identical to any IoT ', 'environment, sensors are employed but they take two forms, which are ', 'wearable and implantable. The wearable sensors are categorized in ', 'Ref. [59] into five groups that are pulse sensors, respiratory rate sensors, ', 'body temperature sensors, blood pressure sensors, and pulse oximetry ', 'sensors. ', 'The overall goal of HIT is to achieve benefits such as reduced medical ', 'errors, improved patient outcomes, enhanced patient care, increased ', 'physician productivity, increased hospital value, and improved opera -', 'tional and financial performance of hospitals [56,58]. When health IoT ', 'is considered in isolation, it enables triage, patient monitoring, ', 'personnel monitoring, disease spread modeling and containment, ', 'assisting practitioners by providing real-time health status and predic -', 'tive information, and providing information for policy decisions in ', 'pandemic scenarios, as explained in Ref. [60]. ', 'In general [58], demonstrates that HIT is effective when used in ', 'aggregate. However, it has been a long time since fragmentation in ', 'utilization has been noted, and governmental initiatives to improve ', 'health information interchange between providers have been passed ', '[61]. In this context, it has been challenging to delineate clearly what ', 'information should be retained in a particular system. For instance ', 'Ref. [62], notes that many providers view EHR as an internal system. ', 'From another perspective, PHR consumes data from a variety of systems, ', 'including EHR, and hence EHR has data that is useful to PHR [5,63]. ', 'Additionally, it is discovered that one system can induce the use of ', 'another. For instance, eMAR and PACS facilitate the use of EMR and ', 'CPOE [58]. ', 'The existence of various types of duplicate information and de-', 'pendency necessitates integration. Despite this necessity, system inte-', 'gration is uncommon [5,62]. Moreover, despite efforts, technological as ', 'well as non-technical challenges manifest on multiple levels. At the ', 'system level, incorrect workflow design and integration, combined with ', 'a mismatch in the rate of progress of HIT and the complexity of security ', 'and privacy issues in both distinct and integrated systems, preclude ', 'integration [64]. Data integration between systems is hampered by the ', 'absence of unique patient identification, a lack of messaging that per-', 'mits syntactic and semantic compatibility between systems and the ', 'absence of data encoding standards [5]. Despite its rarity, in the integration effort consideration is usually ', 'given to the different stakeholders of healthcare who can be categorized ', 'as primary such as providers, purveyors (custodian or keepers of health ', 'data), and patients; furthermore, secondary stakeholders who have an ', 'indirect role in the HIT such as insurers, health authorities, clinical re-', 'searchers and technology vendors [5]. These stakeholders have different ', 'interests and evolving information demands so HIT should address these ', 'issues. For instance, through time, the role of patients has transformed ', 'from being healthcare information receivers to becoming active partic -', 'ipants of HIT systems [62]. It is also documented in Ref. [65] that pa-', 'tients’ participation in HIT has an impact on improving patients’ health ', 'outcomes such as frequency of hospital and emergency visits, read-', 'mission risk, and length of stay. Therefore, deliberation that takes into ', 'account the various interests is mandatory. Thus, blockchain is viewed ', 'as a tool for developing patient-centric systems in a variety of ways, ', 'including managing digital access rules, increasing data availability, ', 'increasing data liquidity, and assigning unique patient identities [66], ', 'all of which are addressed in greater detail below. ', '3.Methodology ', 'Numerous authors, including [3,67], have emphasized the pervasive ', 'nature of blockchain, and as a result, several publications address the ', 'diverse prospective application domains. This increases the number of ', 'publications; as a result, the author must choose from a vast body of ', 'literature in order to undertake an in-depth review. To this purpose, the ', 'application domains, the technique for conducting the literature search, ', 'and the screening procedure for the gathered articles are as follows. ', '3.1. Search strategy and application area selection ', 'At the outset, a literature search strategy was designed by custom -', 'izing recommendations presented in Refs. [68–70]. Consequently, ', 'initially, in December 2018 literature search on various databases ', 'described below was conducted by using the key term “blockchain”, ', 'which yielded a large number of documents. A first evaluation that ', 'encompasses the publications’ application area, language, impact fac-', 'tor, etc. Were employed to conduct screening on the gathered docu-', 'ments. Afterward, through reading their titles and abstracts, the ', 'remaining publications were sorted as per their application areas such as ', 'cryptocurrency, IoT, healthcare, smart contract, supply chain manage -', 'ment, banking and finance, industry, and other areas. Next, analytical ', 'reading was made to decide on which application areas further review is ', 'needed. In this regard, although the majority of the publications deal ', 'with cryptocurrency, the scope of this review is on those that are ', 'commonly categorized under blockchain 3.0. From this class of publi -', 'cations, the most prominent usages are on healthcare and employing ', 'blockchain along with IoT. After sorting the documents and selecting the ', 'application areas from blockchain 3.0, the second search was started. ', 'This was conducted a year later, in December 2019 with search phrases, ', 'which are: “blockchain in IoT” and “blockchain in healthcare”. This was ', 'done together with forward and backward searches as necessary. The ', 'reason for conducting the second search with a year gap is to understand ', 'the shift in conceptualization and the trend in usage of blockchain in the ', 'application areas. ', 'Between the two searches, analytical reading was conducted to have ', 'a better grasp of the subject and to establish criteria for document in-', 'clusion or removal [69]. Other supporting literature from the applica -', 'tion fields was obtained and provided to substantiate the review based ', 'on the knowledge gained via the analytical reading. When a gap was ', 'discovered between prior information and publications dealing with ', 'blockchain, further publications were consumed to round out the eval-', 'uation and establish a connection between prior knowledge and the ', 'emerging trend in blockchain usage.

Inclusion criteria ', 'The inclusion criteria for the primary publications were as follows. ', 'Publications that belong to the application areas and are published on a ', 'journal with an impact factor greater than 1.0, as per the source data-', 'base of the publication and books or chapters of books are qualified for ', 'further processing. However, conference papers are considered ', 'cautiously as noted in Ref. [68], but those that are organized by trust-', 'worthy professional associations such as AIS, ACM, IEEE, ICIS, INFORM, ', 'etc. as suggested by Ref. [71] were qualified for the next processing. ', 'However, they were also assessed against the Google h-5 index, in which ', 'those that obtained 10 or more in the index were included. ', 'Setting such quality requirements has an effect on a number of issues, ', 'including the involuntary exclusion of valuable publications from ', 'sources with lower rankings. Apart from the impact factor 1.0 criterion ', 'indicated in Ref. [70] as an example of exclusion, there is no cutoff level ', 'that specifies a journal’s quality, which changes on a periodic basis. ', 'Furthermore, the h-5 index is used infrequently. As a result of these ', 'concerns, certain high-quality papers may be removed, although this has ', 'no effect on the review’s replicability. ', 'Despite this, on publications that pass the above criteria, a critical ', 'assessment was made. Critical assessment is elaborated in [69, p. 265] as ', 'a way that helps to broaden the “analysis of what is known, how ', 'knowledge is acquired, what types of knowledge is produced, how useful ', 'different types of knowledge are in understanding in explaining a problem of interest and where the boundaries and weaknesses of exist-', 'ing knowledge are”. The reason for making a critical analysis of litera -', 'ture is to get an understanding of the knowledge that has been gained ', 'from using blockchain for the application areas, to comprehend the level ', 'at which blockchain has been revolutionizing the application areas and ', 'to savvy the way the artifacts which are composed of constructs (vo-', 'cabulary and symbols), models (abstractions and representations), ', 'methods (algorithms and practices) and instantiations (implemented ', 'and prototype systems) [72] are being developed. The critical assess -', 'ment enables the author to conduct a second evaluation that helps to ', 'screen out publications that have fewer relevancies and are deprived of ', 'depth in their presentation.

However, of all the application ', 'domains that are typically classified as blockchain 3.0, this is the most ', 'prevalent use. Articles in this domain address a broader range of sub-', 'jects, including how blockchain can be integrated with IoT, how IoT data ', 'is managed, IoT security, and smart city-related challenges. ', 'The other area in which blockchain technology has the potential to ', 'make a big change is healthcare. Blockchain technology is mostly uti-', 'lized in healthcare to manage data. The following table presents a list of ', 'publications that discuss the applicability of blockchain technology in ', 'these two sectors (Table 4). ', 'In IoT, the most commonly covered topics include providing sub-', 'stantial information about the benefits of blockchain for IoT and ', 'designing systems that can help in enhancing the security of IoT data. ', 'Additionally, various publications demonstrate the integration of ', 'blockchain with IoT. Furthermore, some papers explain smart city- ', 'related usages. All these are presented in greater detail. ', 'On the other hand, some authors discuss the potential benefits of ', 'using blockchain in healthcare. To this aim, potential benefits of ', 'blockchain technology include the ability to develop a reliable, secure, ', 'immutable, robust against a single point of failure, and incentive-based ', 'decentralized and user-managed data provenance system.

', 'However, the use of blockchain in healthcare is not without chal-', 'lenges, as discussed in Refs. [6,7,77]. Maintaining confidentiality is a ', 'problem, as is increasing the throughput and scalability of ', 'blockchain-based systems. Moreover, security concerns and limited ', 'storage space make it difficult to store image data that is large enough to ', 'be maintained on a blockchain, and cost-effectiveness is another issue. ', '4.2. Integrating blockchain with IoT ', 'While the authors apply blockchain in an IoT setting, they do it in a ', 'way that they believe will enable them to take advantage of the benefits ', 'associated with the concurrent use of both technologies. However, their ', 'decision is determined by the application area in which they aim to ', 'develop the instantiation, the required latency and throughput, the ', 'application area ’s regulatory environment, and the manageability of the ', 'blockchain ’s participants, among other factors. ', 'With this in mind, two articles seek to classify the integration ', 'methods of blockchain and IoT into three distinct categories. On the one ', 'hand [81], classify integration solutions according to the amount of data ', 'that flows through blockchain during data exchange between IoT de-', 'vices. On the other hand [135], compares blockchain with cloud for ', 'service provision. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive; rather, they complement one another. For example, whereas [81] em-', 'phasizes the relationship between blockchain and IoT devices [135], ', 'broadens the association from IoT devices to the cloud. ', 'To this effect, in the first way of integration, while the normal ', 'communications between IoT devices are intact i.e. in the data exchange ', 'between IoT devices, blockchain plays no role rather it serves as a me-', 'dium of storage for some of the data or the metadata of the actual data; ', 'and this is usually termed as off-chain usage [81]. Prolonging this ', 'relationship to the cloud, in this integration method, blockchain isn’t ', 'considered as the main service outlet rather it assists the cloud and this is ', 'termed as Cloud over Blockchain (CoB) as per [135]. The second ar-', 'chitecture allows a significant involvement of blockchain; hence all data ', 'created through the interactions between IoT devices pass through it. In ', 'comparison to the cloud, in this architecture, blockchain serves as the ', 'central channel of service provision but obtains analytical and virtual -', 'ization services from the cloud, which is termed as Blockchain over ', 'Cloud (BoC) in Ref. [135]. In the last setting, a fair share of data in-', 'terchanges happens on both the blockchain and the IoT devices, which ', 'enables the simultaneous and direct utilization of the qualities of both ', 'technologies. From the perspective of cloud against blockchain domi -', 'nance viewpoint, this method is referred to as Mixed Blockchain-Cloud ', '(MBC) in Ref. [135]. ', 'While generalization is difficult, it is noticed in the literatures that ', 'systems that integrate blockchain and IoT come under one or more of the ', 'approaches discussed above (Table 5). ', '4.3. Blockchain and IT security ', 'The IoT is the topic of security-related literature, with a particular ', 'emphasis on data security. However, blockchain technology may be ', 'used to address a variety of additional security concerns. This section ', 'discusses the benefits of utilizing blockchain to accomplish this goal. ', 'However, the following section on data management discusses data ', 'security. ', 'In [11] the security challenges associated with IoT and the manner in ', 'which blockchain technology can assist overcome them is discussed. ', 'Similarly [12], conducted a review of the literature on the application of ', 'blockchain for security purposes, with an emphasis on IoT security.

As a result, the following benefits accrue in this regard:  ', '≡The immutability of transactions maintained on the blockchain can ', 'enable the registration, tracing, and management of the Identity of ', 'Things (IDoT) throughout their life.  ', '≡The use of cryptography and distributed ledger technology endows ', 'IoT devices with fault tolerance;  ', '≡The use of smart contracts facilitates user authorization, maintains ', 'software integrity, enhances software synchronization, and privacy;  ', '≡The presence of lightweight blockchain-based security protocols can ', 'simplify the process of establishing secure communication between ', 'IoT devices.

These data management operations are influenced by a ', 'variety of factors, including the requirements of an application area, the ', 'architecture chosen for the system, and the intended purpose for which ', 'the system is supposed to be used. Several blockchain-based data man-', 'agement solutions have been proposed in the literature. Due to the ', 'differences in the characteristics of healthcare and IoT-based applica -', 'tions, the usage of blockchain for data management activities varies. ', 'Those designed for IoT take into mind the qualitative characteristics ', 'mentioned above, such as the numerousness of sensors and the ad hoc ', 'nature of IoT networks. On the other hand, those that are healthcare- ', 'focused take into account the requirements of healthcare systems, ', 'such as latency susceptibility and high-security sensitivity of healthcare ', 'data. ', 'Numerous factors contribute to the use of blockchain technology for ', 'data management. To begin with, with IoT, which includes HIoT, de-', 'vices primarily collect data via sensors. Nowadays, the number of sen-', 'sors is expanding exponentially, heralding the arrival of an era of global ', 'sensor networks requiring a sophisticated data management system ', '[136]. Second, these devices generate heterogeneous data streams in ', 'real-time, resulting in the emergence of big data 3.0 [137]. However, ', 'standard data management approaches are not highly scalable enough ', 'to handle enormous volumes of data [138], necessitating the develop -', 'ment of a more robust data management system. Thirdly, traditional ', 'data management systems based on client/server interactions, which are ', 'currently employed in healthcare and IoT, are susceptible to a single ', 'point of failure. Even worse, the current distributed network architec -', 'ture, protocol, and techniques are unsuitable for addressing new diffi-', 'culties and developing service requirements [79]. Fourth, data kept on ', 'numerous servers are frequently unencrypted, posing a security concern ', '[39], whereas blockchain-based systems employ data storage mecha -', 'nisms that apply a variety of encryption techniques. Fifth, in IoT-enabled ', 'systems, data management operations are performed both online and ', 'offline, which traditional data management methods struggle to manage ', '[139]. As a result, there has been a search for a data management ', 'mechanism that enables the transmission of small data packets, does not ', 'require a big channel bandwidth with delay tolerance capability, and ', 'consumes lowenergy [140]. ', 'As a result, while blockchain does not meet all of the requirements, it ', 'is viewed as a tool for addressing these types of challenges.

Data acquisition ', 'Data acquisition is one of the data management operations that ', 'blockchain technology has the potential to improve by securely ', 'assigning a unique identifier to things, entities, and users throughout the ', 'authentication process. This property of blockchain enables data to be ', 'acquired from the right source. ', 'Acquiring data from the right source is accomplished by the ', 'enhancement of message authentication, transaction authentication, ', 'entity authentication, and key authentication through the distributed ', 'consensus processes. Various authentication designs and methodologies ', 'are used in the reviewed articles. To name a few, in an IoT context, for ', 'example, in Ref. [96], special devices called Manager Servers (MS) ', 'assign IDs to other devices using the devices’ private key. Secure virtual ', 'zones (bubbles with group ID) are employed in Ref.

However, ', 'the most widely used form of establishing identity is through the use of a ', 'public and private key pair, with the public key serving as the digital ', 'identity, as described in Ref. [111]. ', '4.4.2. Data processing ', 'Since smart contracts became a critical component of blockchain ', 'usage, the majority of blockchain-based systems now rely on them to ', 'process data autonomously. However, it is noted that the number of ', 'smart contracts used in systems varies. For example [27], employs six ', 'smart contracts [97], utilizes four smart contracts [101], plans to ', 'consume as many smart contracts as the amount of “sidechains” that will ', 'be constructed [95], uses three smart contracts, and [104] utilizes one ', 'smart contract for each resource owner. All of these articles defend their ', 'use; nevertheless, to the author’s knowledge, no publication compares ', 'the performance of such types of employment. ', 'On the other hand, authors create various architectural mechanisms ', 'for data processing, such as assigning nodes that have a better capability ', 'as processing nodes [78], besides in Refs.

[96,126], establish hierarchies of blockchains. ', 'These architectural solutions have an effect on system latency, as the ', 'presence of hierarchy and partition might impede consensus on a global ', 'truth. ', '4.4.3. Data security ', 'While data security involves a variety of issues, it is noticed that ', 'blockchain-based systems are primarily concerned with resolving three ', 'topics: data integrity, access control, and privacy preservation. Essen -', 'tially, security concerns are not distinct from one another; rather, they ', 'are inextricably linked. Despite, publications have concentrated on ', 'those subjects, which are discussed in detail below. ', '4.4.3.1. Data integrity. The term “data integrity” refers to the process of ', 'ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data throughout its lifecycle ', '[116]. Prior publications, such as [141,142] expound on the fact that ', 'data integrity strategies are concerned with avoiding, identifying, and ', 'correcting data integrity issues. Methods such as journaling and building ', 'encrypted file systems are aimed at avoiding data integrity issues. ', 'Additionally, check-summing, mirroring, Cyclic Redundancy Check ', '(CRC), and parity are used to detect data integrity risks. On the other ', 'side, correcting data integrity concerns are addressed using methods ', 'such as majority vote and RAID parity. Numerous strategies are applied in the publications reviewed, as ', 'summarized in the following table (Table 6). ', '4.4.3.2. Access control. Access control, or the management of the rights ', 'provided to a resource, is a critical component of security. It has been ', 'considered from a variety of angles in the literatures. For example [143], ', 'uses the Objective, Model, Architecture, and Mechanism (OMAM) ', 'reference model to categorize access control mechanisms used in IoT. To ', 'this purpose, models such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ', 'Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), Usage Control (UCON), and ', 'Capability-Based Access Control (CapBAC) are discussed. On the other ', 'hand, architectures include Extensible Access Control Markup Language ', '(XACML), Open Authorization (OAuth), and User Managed Access ', '(UMA). These models and architectures are used to accomplish objec -', 'tives such as ISO/EIC 27002/27,005 standards, among others, through ', 'the use of mechanisms such as Access Control Lists. On the other hand, ', 'as the review and classification offered in Ref. [144] demonstrate, the ', 'access control approaches discussed above and others have multiple ', 'variants. Additionally, there are access control models that combine ', 'access control and privacy protection, such as those described in Refs. ', '[145,146]. ', 'The literatures that employ blockchain technology make use of a ', 'variety of access control approaches and structures, including those ', 'listed in the following table (Table 7). ', '4.4.3.3. Privacy preservation. The other issue that the literatures ', 'address is the preservation of privacy. According to Ref. [147], privacy ', 'preservation techniques can be categorized into two broad categories: ', 'data privacy and context privacy. While data privacy concerns diffi-', 'culties such as maintaining privacy throughout data aggregation and ', 'Table 6 ', 'Techniques employed for maintaining data integrity.

', 'In situations when blockchain is used as part of a system [148], ', 'conducted a literature survey and classified privacy-preserving tech-', 'niques into four categories. These are (a) smart contract or key man-', 'agement derivation through the use of secure multiparty computation ', '(SMPC), and (b) identity anonymization, which focuses on securing the ', 'identities of users participating in a transaction through the use of ', 'mixing, ring signatures, and zero proof of knowledge. (c) Transaction ', 'data anonymization, which focuses on ensuring the privacy of trans -', 'action contents through mixing, differential privacy, zero-knowledge ', 'proofs, and homomorphic hiding; and (d) on-chain data protection, ', 'which focuses on securing data stored on the blockchain using encryp -', 'tion techniques such as asymmetric encryption and attribute-based ', 'encryption. ', 'While this is the case, the following table summarizes the privacy ', 'preservation techniques used by the publications (Table 8). ', '4.4.4. Dissemination ', 'Dissemination of data can take a variety of forms. Fundamentally, ', 'there are two main groups of data dissemination methods depending on ', 'who initiates the data transmission, i.e. whether a client requests or a ', 'server supplies the data. The first is push-based, while the second is pull- ', 'based. While push-based dissemination involves a server pushing data to clients, pull-based dissemination involves a client requesting data from a ', 'server. In terms of timing, both techniques of data dissemination allow ', 'for scheduled or random data transfer. Additionally, data delivery might ', 'be one-to-many or point-to-point. ', 'The data delivery mechanism used in pull-based aperiodic data ', 'dissemination with point-to-point communication is characterized by ', 'request and response. However, if the communication is one-to-many, ', 'the mechanism used to convey the request and response data is snoop -', 'ing. In contrast, polling is used to deliver data in a pull-based periodic ', 'point-to-point communication, whereas snooping is used to deliver data ', 'in a one-to-many communication. On the other hand, when data is ', 'delivered randomly in a push-based one-to-many communication, it is ', 'referred to as publish and subscribe; when data is delivered periodically, ', 'it is referred to as broadcast. Triggers are used to refer to aperiodic point- ', 'to-point data transmission [149]. ', 'On the other hand, in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), data routing ', 'strategies can be classified as flat, hierarchical, or location-based ac-', 'cording to their network topology. If the operation of their protocol is ', 'used to classify them, they fall into five categories: negotiation-based, ', 'multipath-based, query-based, Quality of Service (QoS)-based, and ', 'coherent-based [150]. ', 'Combinations of the aforementioned mechanisms, structures, and ', 'actions are noted in several of the reviewed literatures. For example, in ', 'Ref. [95], the data dissemination mechanism is publish and subscribe, in ', 'which a blockchain publisher provides information to an IoT-enabled ', 'blockchain, from which nodes can acquire data by subscribing. In ', 'Ref. [98] a hybrid of pull- and push-based data transmission techniques ', 'with a hierarchical framework is employed. The cluster head takes data ', 'from sensors and then distributes it to peers.

In Ref. [129], messaging between ', 'vehicles occurs in a one-to-many or point-to-point fashion. ', '4.4.5. Retrieval ', 'In blockchain-based systems; data is stored in an encrypted form. As ', 'a result, data retrieval approaches such as Searchable Symmetric ', 'Encryption (SSE), which was first presented as a Boolean search scheme ', 'by Song et al. [151], are helpful. Several authors have enhanced SSE, ', 'most notably Swaminathan et al. [152], who developed ranked ordered ', 'search for encrypted documents. These two approaches can serve as a ', 'starting point for developing appropriate data retrieval solutions. On the ', 'other hand, when image data is encrypted, Lu et al. [153] first proposed ', 'algorithm for image retrieval over an encrypted image. Since its incep -', 'tion, the mechanism has evolved to incorporate additional characteris -', 'tics such as privacy preservation. Ferreira et al. [154] proposed the ', 'approach for privacy-preserving encrypted picture retrieval, and it is ', 'currently considered an emerging field. ', 'Despite these, data retrieval is not a primary objective of many of the ', 'reviewed papers. The only publication that focuses on it is [30], in which ', 'blockchain is situated as a contract service between biomedical data-', 'bases and data consumers. The blockchain data acts as permanent proof ', 'of data retrieval activity, which is tracked in part by comparing the hash ', 'value of a query to the hash value of a result. ', 'In the remaining research, it is found that some researchers treat data ', 'retrieval from blockchain as a transaction, while others do not due to ', 'performance concerns. To name a few, whereas [29,38] consider it in ', 'the former manner [78], does not account for it as a transaction except ', 'for critical access control systems. ', 'Additionally, there are distinctions in the literatures about the pro-', 'vision of a right to retrieve and learn about data between blockchain ', 'participants. In this regard [39], mentions that the results of a query are ', 'decrypted by a designated entity called a leader [112], explains that a ', 'gateway server performs re-encryption and the requester decrypts it, ', 'and [113] states that a user decrypts data on their own but retrieves it ', 'through an intermediary called a Private Accessible Unit (PAU). In ', 'contrast, a query in Ref. [94] can be made by a variety of entities, ', 'including a provider, a user, and a healthcare insurance company. ', '4.4.6. Data storage ', 'According to some authors, blockchain is a distributed database. ', 'Despite their similarities, distributed databases and blockchains are not ', 'identical. To name a few, in blockchain, replicated copies of data are ', 'stored at nodes to circumvent the need for a central trust point; yet, ', 'distributed databases are maintained to optimize database efficiency by ', 'splitting information retrieval and processing. Additionally, the data ', 'stored in the nodes of a distributed database is not homogeneous. The ', 'other distinction is that, in contrast to distributed databases, blockchain ', 'technology incorporates an automatically executable program known as ', 'a smart contract [42]. ', 'There are numerous data storage strategies in an IoT environment, ', 'including (1) external storage, in which nodes send data to a base station ', 'or gateway without processing it, and (2) local storage, in which each ', 'node stores data. (3) data-centric storage, which involves nodes that are ', 'chosen to store data depending on a preset criterion (4) fully distributed ', 'data storage, which allocates storage responsibility in a fair manner to ', 'all participating nodes [155,156]. ', 'From the standpoint of data storage, disparities in blockchain utili-', 'zation are found. These are due to a variety of variables, including legal ', 'concerns about privacy, latency requirements, and the size of the file to ', 'be stored. In this context, healthcare is subject to a variety of legal challenges, making it particularly sensitive to privacy concerns. Addi-', 'tionally, the size of the data has an effect on its storage. As a result, huge ', 'files, the majority of which are the result of radiology, are treated ', 'differently than laboratory tests and other research data. ', 'The usage of blockchain in radiology focuses on leveraging it as a ', 'storage for some data, pointers, and metadata associated with imaging ', 'tests that are typically low in volume but high in cost [157], such as CT ', 'scans, X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrocardio -', 'gram (ECG) files. To cite a few publications [109], created a data lake to ', 'store large files off-chain [27], maintained the hash value of patients’ ', 'data pointers [110], uses blockchain to register only the list of images, ', 'the patients’ names, the names of individuals who have access to the ', 'images, and the parties who have accessed the files throughout the files’ ', 'existence [111], proposes storing metadata on the blockchain, and ', '[115] stores the address of a patient’s data pointer. ', 'In terms of regulations, several of the literatures discuss certain ', 'statutes. For example [111], focuses on a standard called Fast Health -', 'care Interoperability Resources (FHIR), which is primarily concerned ', 'with the exchange of medical data in transit and storage. As required by ', 'the standard, the system saves data pointers on the blockchain. Another ', 'paper, namely [118], examines the European Union’s General Data ', 'Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes constraints on the length ', 'of data storage, among other things. In accordance with this, one of the ', 'objections leveled towards blockchain-based systems is that their ', 'immutability precludes them from being regulated, however, the au-', 'thors address this concern through the use of ontology. Ontology has the ', 'potential to resolve semantic heterogeneity associated with the use of ', 'various IoT devices. This is accomplished, for example, by raising ', 'awareness of security threats. However, they use it for intelligence ', 'policy analysis in their system, which includes consent management for ', 'data acquisition, update, and disposal. ', '4.5. Blockchain and smart city ', 'The smart city concept is a subset of the smart planet agenda, with a ', 'spatial demarcation for its execution [158] that is conceptualized in two ', 'distinct ways. The first defines smart city or smartness as the level at ', 'which places are connected through IoT, implying that technocracy ', 'plays a role in cities management. On the other hand, the second one ', 'stresses the establishment and spread of a knowledge-based economy, in ', 'which information and communication technologies play a crucial role ', 'in the development of the envisioned economic model [159]. Both ', 'conceptualizations emphasize the importance of technology in the form ', 'of IoT. ', 'Smart city applications include smart buildings, smart education, ', 'smart healthcare, and social care, smart energy, smart grid (smart ', 'metering of natural gas, water, and electrical energy), smart utilities ', '(smart water distribution and waste management), smart parking, and ', 'smart & integrated transportation [160]. The implementation of a smart ', 'city presents various challenges, including the influx of big data, which ', 'demands real-time management and analyses of massive volumes of ', 'complicated data. Additionally, system-level challenges include ', 'ensuring the privacy and security of collected data, achieving low la-', 'tency and high mobility, structural scalability, network bandwidth ', 'constraints, single-point of failure, infrastructure security, operational ', 'security, and compliance with environmental and governmental regu-', 'latory policies [125,128,159,161–163]. The involvement of companies ', 'in the realization of smart city projects exacerbates the challenges. These ', 'kinds of “corporate smart city” schemes are criticized by Ref. [164] due ', 'to data privacy concerns, the hidden motives of companies, and the lack ', 'of community participation. ', 'To address these and other challenges, blockchain is considered to ', 'make a substantial contribution, as seen by the growth of publications ', 'addressing its usage. As a result, authors such as [123,125] suggest ', 'frameworks for utilizing blockchain technology in smart city applica -', 'tions. In Ref. [123], blockchain serves two purposes. On the one hand, it E.M. Adere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Array 14 (2022) 100139', '13is used at the prosumer level to connect smart devices to a smart meter. ', 'Additionally, the smart meter is linked to the micro-grid, smart appli -', 'ances, and sensors. The micro-grid acts as a data hub and a tool for ', 'energy exchange in the design. On the other side, each community and ', 'smart grid are connected through a blockchain at the household level. ', 'According to the authors, this type of usage enables a community to ', 'self-manage its energy consumption. The architecture described in ', 'Ref. [125] places edge computing between a blockchain, which serves as ', 'the core network, and an IoT device network. The obvious goal of pro-', 'cessing data at the edge network and then transmitting it to the block -', 'chain through edge computing is to alleviate the blockchain’s workload. ', 'In [128] a smart home architecture that layers blockchain on top of a ', 'smart home network but beneath the cloud computing network is pre-', 'sented. All transactions in the smart home are routed over the block -', 'chain and are handled by a block manager who is in charge of the ', 'generation, verification, and storage of transactions into blocks. ', 'The authors of [124,126] focus on the application of blockchain ', 'technology to smart transportation. In Ref. [124] an overview of how ', 'blockchain can be used in conjunction with smart transportation by ', 'describing seven tiers of intelligent transportation systems that utilize ', 'blockchain technology is provided. According to the article, the most ', 'successful application of blockchain in intelligent transportation sys-', 'tems is the real-time sharing of information. A similar issue is addressed ', 'in Ref. [126], which employs a point or token system that begins with ', 'the purchase of a car and subsequently accrues points based on ', 'traffic-related performance. They refer to their point-based system as ', 'Intelligent Vehicle Trust Point (IVTP), in which reward points are used ', 'as a prize, similar to how Bitcoin pays miners, but this time based on ', 'traffic-related performance. They propose a two-tiered blockchain sys-', 'tem comprised of a local and a central layer. While the local blockchain ', 'is branched and stores data for a limited length of time, the main ', 'blockchain tracks IVTP transactions in the same way as Bitcoin does. ', 'Smart grids have also garnered attention from authors, including ', '[83,127]. In Ref. [127], a survey of blockchain application cases is ', 'presented. As such, in conjunction with the smart grid, blockchain may ', 'be utilized primarily as an infrastructure for peer-to-peer energy trading ', 'and as a deterrent to data tampering in the power-producing and dis-', 'tribution industries. Consistent with this [83], a layered structure based ', 'on blockchain that they believe can enable energy policy enforcement, ', 'energy trading, and security enhancement is proposed. To accomplish ', 'these goals, the blockchain is deployed through a virtual private ', 'network, with each node implemented by software. ', '4.6. Blockchain and drug supply chain ', 'One of the difficulties in managing the pharmaceutical supply chain ', 'is avoiding fraudulent activities such as counterfeiting, sub standardi -', 'zation, and diversion (stealing and selling medicine) [130]. Counter -', 'feiting, for example, has three forms: (a) modification, (b) using the ', 'correct product’s information to create a forged one, and (c) removing ', 'the correct product’s information and reusing it to a fake one [165]. ', 'Numerous solutions are being used to overcome these challenges, ', 'including smartphone verification systems and pill image recognition ', 'tools. Additionally, RFID technology is being utilized, including micro- ', 'tags attached to individual pill units and data integration with other ', 'sources of data. Moreover, technology such as machine learning and ', 'online verification was employed. However, blockchain technology, ', 'which is comprised entirely of distributed ledgers and is coupled with ', 'IoT, is also being investigated as a possible remedy [130]. In comparison ', 'to all of these processes [130,131], credit blockchain with resolving the ', 'aforementioned issues by making the drug supply chain trustworthy, ', 'transparent, traceable, verifiable, and resistant to the intrusion of ', 'counterfeit medicines. Nonetheless, there are a number of disadvantages ', 'to blockchain implementation, including the lack of regulatory guide -', 'lines and the necessity to preserve pharmaceutical users’ privacy [132]. ', 'Several blockchain-based systems, on the other hand, are being proposed. In this regard [131], create a system that includes codes ', 'printed on tablets that can be read by stakeholders’ cellphones. Due to ', 'the fact that the code is stored on the blockchain and the movement of ', 'the medicine is tracked, each entity scans and signs the code as the drug ', 'passes through the supply chain, preventing counterfeiting. Similarly ', '[133], develops a method for ensuring the transparency of drug-related ', 'transaction data across the supply chain. Their system is comprised of ', 'four entities: alliance members who grant licenses to miners (govern -', 'ment and manufacturers), full nodes (wholesalers and hospitals), and ', 'normal nodes (pharmacies and consumers). According to their design ', 'description, a public key is utilized to generate a Quick Response (QR) ', 'code that acts as a unique identifier (ID) for medications. When medi -', 'cine is manufactured, information about it is stored on the blockchain as ', 'the hash value of its name, location, and timestamp of the ', 'manufacturing date and time. Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) ', 'and private keys, respectively, can be used to detect fraudulent trans -', 'actions such as sales by unlawful distributors and unauthorized persons. ', '5.Discussion ', 'The purpose of this review is to discuss how blockchain is utilized for ', 'data management and delves into the application areas of IoT and ', 'healthcare. Additionally, it assesses the integration strategies utilized to ', 'integrate blockchain with IoT. As a result, selected works from a list of ', 'publications are reviewed to demonstrate the approaches used to inte-', 'grate blockchain and IoT. Moreover, data management activities which ', 'are data acquiring, processing, security, dissemination, retrieval, and ', 'storage strategies used in blockchain-based systems are demonstrated. ', 'Furthermore, the use of blockchain in smart cities and the drug supply ', 'chain is discussed. ', '5.1. On integrating blockchain and IoT ', 'Clearly, blockchain, like IoT, is pervasive [3,67], and its adoption ', 'can benefit a wide variety of applications. Healthcare is one sector ', 'where HIoT has the potential to make an impact. However, while the ', 'integrative use of both technologies is beneficial, the qualitative aspects ', 'of both technologies have an effect on the integration efforts. These ', 'include the existence of a large number of sensors, the low memory ', 'capacity of blockchain and IoT, the low processing capacity and battery ', 'life of IoT, and the low latency of various blockchain-based consensus ', 'processes. Blockchain is being used in IoT not only for its qualitative ', 'benefits but also to resolve some of the shortcomings that IoT currently ', 'possesses. ', 'According to the publications cited previously, there are three ', 'methods for integrating blockchain with IoT. The methods used are ', 'influenced by the sensitivity of the data, the legal requirements, the ', 'amount of the data, and the system’s latency and throughput ', 'requirements. ', 'The degree of interaction between IoT devices and the degree to ', 'which blockchain is integrated into systems, as well as the level of ', 'emphasis placed on the blockchain, serve as the basis for categorizing ', 'integration mechanisms. According to these, blockchain plays a minor ', 'part in the first method, dubbed IoT-IoT or CoB. The second technique, ', 'known as IoT-blockchain or BoC, utilizes blockchain heavily for data ', 'storage, while the hybrid model incorporates an edge, fog, or overlay ', 'network into the grand system. It should be noted that these strategies ', 'do not cover all possible applications; thus, some circumstances require ', 'a combination of them. Nonetheless, some typical works are shown in a ', 'tabular fashion above, taking into account the primary classification ', 'criteria. ', 'In contrast to other domains, the presentation demonstrates that the ', 'dominating architecture in HIoT is the first type in which blockchain is ', 'utilized as a store for the metadata associated with actual files. This is ', 'mostly owing to the existence of radiology-related data, as previously ', 'noted. One advantage of utilizing this type of integration in healthcare is E.M. Adere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Array 14 (2022) 100139', '14that it resolves the bandwidth issue associated with storing a file on the ', 'blockchain. Additionally, it enables blockchain-based systems to comply ', 'with some regulatory obligations for the secure storage and sharing of ', 'data. The intricacies of one regulation in terms of blockchain application ', 'are discussed in Ref. [111]. On the other hand, the hybrid integration ', 'leverages the benefits of both blockchain and IoT, making it ideal for ', 'situations requiring a high level of latency. Additionally, it is suitable for ', 'systems with a high number of sensors. ', '5.2. On data management in IoT and healthcare ', 'Data management is described in this review as the key duties per-', 'formed throughout the data life cycle, including data acquiring, pro-', 'cessing, security, dissemination, retrieval, and storage. According to the ', 'literatures, blockchain technology helps all of these data management ', 'processes, most notably data security. ', 'In terms of data security, blockchain is most frequently used to ', 'ensure data integrity, access control, and privacy preservation. These ', 'will have a number of benefits across a range of application domains, ', 'including those that incorporate both blockchain and IoT. As mentioned ', 'before, an IoT network is comprised of numerous and heterogeneous ', 'devices that generate large amounts of data; also, their network func-', 'tions in both online and offline modes. As a result, systems developed for ', 'data management tasks must take these considerations into account. ', 'Additionally, the adoption of blockchain for data management purposes ', 'is motivated by a desire to compensate for the deficiencies of IoT in the ', 'aforementioned data management functions. ', 'In healthcare, blockchain-based data management is designed to ', 'provide patients authority over their data. Their empowerment enables ', 'individuals to control who has access to their data and to track who has ', 'accessed it. Additionally, blockchain technology improves the integrity, ', 'availability, access control, and preservation of privacy. ', 'Acquiring data from the appropriate source is crucial to data man-', 'agement success. In this regard, the authors demonstrate that, in addi-', 'tion to the widely used technique of identifying objects and persons ', 'through their public key and pseudonym names, alternative means of ', 'authentication, such as voice recognition, have been used in blockchain- ', 'based systems. Additionally, it is noticed that architecturally assigning ', 'entities, such as management servers, are utilized for assigning unique ', 'IDs to objects and users. ', 'In terms of data processing, smart contracts and the design of data- ', 'processing-friendly architecture have been employed. In this regard, it ', 'has been revealed that it is difficult to justify the number and purpose of ', 'smart contract usage, which explains why, as previously said, the ', 'number of smart contracts utilized in systems is inconsistent. ', 'The reviewed literature indicates that the most frequently used ', 'strategy for assuring data integrity is to encrypt data prior to hashing it, ', 'or vice versa. Moreover, third-party systems such as IPFS, Argon2, and ', 'Chainpoint are used to produce unique identifiers, form a digital ', 'signature, and generate data structures. These techniques and applica -', 'tions are unrelated to the area of the application. ', 'There is no single dominating strategy for access control and privacy ', 'preservation that has been widely adopted by a significant number of ', 'authors. However, due to their certificate authority and multi-signature ', 'provisioning capabilities, established blockchain platforms such as ', 'Hyperledger and NEM are being used for access control. In some works, ', 'on the other hand, access control is believed to be managed structurally, ', 'for example, by allocating access control tasks to selected participant ', 'nodes. On the other hand, there is a publication that demonstrates how ', 'to utilize a decoder to ensure compatibility between multiple access ', 'control models. ', 'Meanwhile, many encryption techniques such as proxy re-encryption ', 'with blinding, attribute-based re-encryption, and pseudonym-based ', 'encryption with multiple authorities are considered to maintain pri-', 'vacy preservation. Certain encryption techniques are also employed to ', 'ensure the integrity, access control, and privacy of a single system. In this regard [91], for example, combines ring signatures, addition rota-', 'tion, and XOR with public encryption to accomplish all three goals. ', 'To protect privacy, some authors employ architectural strategies ', 'such as segmenting the network into “sidechains,” while another pub-', 'lication establishes a hierarchy of blockchains at the local and global ', 'levels. This kind of clustering minimizes the danger of identification and ', 'transaction exposure beyond the cluster bounds. Additional techniques ', 'are applied to bolster the architectural solutions. Generally, no ', 'discernible pattern has evolved in this direction. The figure below, ', 'Fig. 4, illustrates the taxonomy of data security methods in general. ', 'The other data management activities are dissemination and ', 'retrieval. This review’s application domains include smart trans -', 'portation, which is one of the dissemination-based applications. The ', 'common mechanism in this area is a method called trigger but publi -', 'cations differ in the architecture they follow. On top of disseminating ', 'data from a vehicle to a vehicle, some authors include the dissemination ', 'of data from infrastructure to vehicles as well. In other publications, ', 'hybrids of pull and push data dissemination methods are being ', 'employed. In all these dissemination methods blockchain plays a ', 'differing role depending on the integration method followed. Regarding ', 'data retrieval, the majority of the publications don’t explicitly specify ', 'the data retrieval methods that should be employed on data stored on ', 'and off-chain. However, many applicable ways of data retrieval methods ', 'are compatible with blockchain. ', 'Regarding data storage, which is heavily influenced by the method of ', 'integration chosen, legal requirements, data size, throughput, and la-', 'tency demanded from a system, the application area a system is intended ', 'to be employed, and the number of participants of a blockchain system. ', 'Therefore, the three integration methods discussed above have a direct ', 'bearing on the placement and type of data maintained in the system. It is ', 'observed that literatures solve these issues by following appropriate ', 'integration methods, and by creatively designing architectures that take ', 'those concerns into consideration. ', '6.Open issues ', 'An examination of the literature reveals some unresolved issues that ', 'require attention. Additionally, it is clear from the explanations pro-', 'vided in the publications and the analysis conducted on them that in the ', 'two application areas, a set of factors dictate the integration methods ', 'and data management activities. These include the legal requirements ', 'imposed on an application area, the intended use of a system, the ', 'number of IoT devices involved, the architecture chosen, the application ', 'area itself, the sensitivity of data, and the required throughput and la-', 'tency. The inre-relationships between the usage areas and their deter -', 'minant factors is presented in Fig. 5. ', 'The examined researches develop instantiations within the confines ', 'of those influencing criteria. Despite the fact that these publications had ', 'several remarkable solutions, there are some concerns they did not ', 'address and there are inconsistencies between them about specific ', 'themes, such as the following. ', 'To begin, the numerous instantiations mentioned here strive to ', 'establish the prototype’s superiority over other comparable solutions ', 'that they believe are related to resolving the problem at hand. However, ', 'when doing this review, the author observed inconsistencies between ', 'them, such that what one publication considers a strength is shown as a ', 'flaw in another publication. As a result, a review is necessary that fo-', 'cuses on comparing the performance of these different types of ', 'instantiations. ', 'Second, data processing is listed as a data management operation in ', 'the preceding sections. In blockchain-based systems, more autonomous ', 'processing capacity is provided by smart contracts. However, it has been ', 'discovered that the number of smart contracts employed in such systems ', 'varies. As such use may have an effect on system performance, research ', 'examining the number of smart contracts that are suitable for use on ', 'systems can serve as a foundation for future work. E.M.

As a result, this field requires additional research. ', 'Fourth, is the disintegrative use of HIT, which is caused, among other ', 'things, by the lack of a trustworthy technique for assigning unique IDs.

Thus, inte-', 'grative HIT utilization has a beneficial effect on the domain; these issues ', 'can be viewed as a solution to a long-standing problem. ', 'Fifth, there are further challenges, such as how blockchain can be ', 'used to monitor patients, triage, providers’ operational and financial ', 'performance, and disease spread surveillance, that has received scant ', 'attention in publications but require additional investigation. ', '7.Conclusion ', 'This review examines how the selected publications leverage ', 'blockchain technology to streamline data management activities and ', 'how they integrate blockchain with IoT. Furthermore, in addition to ', 'examining the presence of trends in developing instantiations, the ', 'article demonstrates the benefits of adopting blockchain in subsets of the ', 'two domains, namely smart cities and drug supply chains. The preceding ', 'observations allow us to deduce the following. ', 'Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly improve a ', 'variety of application areas within a smart city. This includes enabling ', 'self-management of energy consumption and trade in conjunction with ', 'smart utilities. Additionally, it facilitates real-time information ex-', 'change and improves traffic-related performance in the context of smart ', 'transportation applications through a reward system that is demon -', 'strated with designed instantiations. Similarly, blockchain technology ', 'can assist in combating counterfeiting, sub-standardization and diver -', 'sion through increasing transparency throughout the drug supply chain. ', 'The primary application of blockchain is for data management. The ', 'premise that blockchain can manage heterogeneous big data prevent a ', 'single point of failure, and function with encrypted data both online and ', 'offline is driving the adoption of blockchain for data management. To ', 'determine whether these objectives have been met, several publications ', 'focusing on data management activities such as data acquisition, pro-', 'cessing, security, distribution, retrieval, and storage have been assessed. ', 'As a result, it is learned that the primary focus of the literatures is ', 'data security, which includes three components: data integrity, access ', 'control, and privacy preservation. Through the use of blockchain tech-', 'nology, a variety of ways are being used to enhance these areas. The ', 'strategies employed for those topics are classified into the following six ', 'categories: Equivalence verification, the usage of third-party systems, ', 'encryption techniques, architectural methods, a hardware solution, and ', 'smart contracts. From them, the most frequently used strategies include ', 'the use of various encryption technologies, third-party solutions, ', 'architectural designs, and smart contracts. ', 'Other data management tasks, such as data acquisition, benefit from ', 'the authentication enhancement capabilities of blockchain-based sys-', 'tems. Various authentication methods have been reported to be applied, ', 'ranging from biological mechanisms to public-key encryption schemes. ', 'This means that independent of the application domain, a variety of ', 'decentralized autonomous authentication procedures for blockchain- ', 'based systems can be developed. Similarly, one of the benefits of ', 'blockchain for data processing is the revival of smart contracts, which ', 'were available before the widespread use of blockchain but were not ', 'widely used as a data processing tool. However, blockchain-based sys-', 'tems leverage it for a range of activities, including autonomous data ', 'processing. Dissemination and retrieval of data are the least targeted tasks in ', 'data management. Nonetheless, numerous authors present the dissem -', 'ination mechanisms employed in their instantiations in an unambiguous ', 'manner. It is learned that the majority of dissemination mechanisms are ', 'based on publish and subscribe, hierarchical structures, and trigger- ', 'based one-to-many and many-to-many procedures. However, despite ', 'the fact that blockchain adoption has an effect on data retrieval pro-', 'cesses, the literatures do not discuss or address data retrieval methods to ', 'be used in blockchain-based systems. ', 'Alternatively, it is recognized that a large number of variables have a ', 'significant impact on data storage. To circumvent these obstacles, de-', 'signers employ solutions such as creating a data lake, preserving only ', 'file locations, and registering a list of files. To address legal problems, ', 'developers customize their systems to conform to the applicable legal ', 'standards. ', 'By and large, data management tasks and integration approaches are ', 'inextricably linked. In this regard, the three approaches to integrating ', 'blockchain and IoT are diverse in terms of the complexity introduced to ', 'data management. This is because metadata management is required in ', 'addition to data management. However, when (a) file size increases, (b) ', 'regulation is strict, (c) the number of participants is large, (d) data ', 'sensitivity is subtle, and (e) throughput and latency requirements are ', 'high, designers opt for IoT-IoT (BoC) and hybrid integration approaches. ', 'This is a prevalent trend in both healthcare and the Internet of Things. ', '8.Limitations ', 'As with any research, this review is not without limits. To begin, it is ', 'subject to publication bias due to the scarcity of literatures reporting ', 'negative outcomes associated with the use of blockchain, with the ', 'exception of some, such as [121], which rejects the use of blockchain for ', 'assigning unique IDs to patients, and [32], which casts doubt on the ', 'usability of blockchain for large-scale purposes due to the disadvantages ', 'associated with data processing activities. Similarly, while many advo-', 'cates for the use of blockchain to boost security [166], discusses the ', 'security issues associated with blockchain-based systems designed uti-', 'lizing Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus tech-', 'niques. Despite this, publications suggest prototypes and solutions and ', 'advocate for blockchain’s benefits. As a result, the review is influenced ', 'by a lack of negative reporting and exaggerated claims about positive ', 'research outcomes in the form of instantiations with an uncertain future. ', 'Second, independent of the reputation of the journals in which they ', 'are published or the conferences at which they are presented, this review ', 'assigns equal weight to all literature that meets the screening re-', 'quirements. However, the majority of blockchain-related noble publi -', 'cations are presented as white papers, which are disqualified. This has ', 'an effect on the unintentional exclusion of valuable publications. ', 'Declaration of competing interest ', 'The authors declare that they have no known competing financial ', 'interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence ', 'the work reported in this paper.

Occlusion and scale problems are the key problems to be solved in pedestrian detection. The purpose of ', 'this paper is to discuss the research progress of pedestrian detection. Firstly, this paper explores the research ', 'status of pedestrian detection in the past four years (2019 –2022), focuses on analyzing the occlusion and scale ', 'problems of pedestrian detection and corresponding solutions, summarizes the data sets and evaluation methods ', 'of pedestrian detection, and finally looks forward to the development trend of the occlusion and scale problems ', 'of pedestrian detection.   ', '1.Introduction ', 'Pedestrian detection is a special task of target detection, which is ', 'closely related to the development of general target detection. Pedes -', 'trian detection aims to find pedestrians and mark the location and size of ', 'pedestrians from given images and videos. It is the basis of multiple tasks ', 'such as pedestrian rerecognition [1,2], pedestrian tracking [3,4], ', 'pedestrian trajectory prediction [5,6] and has a wide range of applica -', 'tion prospects in intelligent monitoring [7,8], automatic driving [9,10], ', 'intelligent robots [11,12] and other fields. Therefore, pedestrian ', 'detection has always been a hot and difficult topic in the field of com-', 'puter vision. Because pedestrian detection is easily affected by factors ', 'such as occlusion, scale, illumination, weather and similarity, the ac-', 'curacy of pedestrian detection in complex scenes is poor and false pos-', 'itives are easy to occur. Therefore, every year, a large number of scholars ', 'focus on coming up with a more robust, faster and more advanced ', 'method. Fig. 1 shows the number of studies related to pedestrian ', 'detection between 2003 and 2022 (data from Web of Science search, ', 'year of publication selected, search results 20). ', 'Pedestrian detection methods are mainly divided into two cate-', 'gories: hand-crafted feature-based methods and deep feature-based methods. The first kind of methods include VJ, HOG, ICF, etc. In ', '2003, Viola and Jones [13] first combined motion and appearance in-', 'formation together with Adaboost classifier to constitute VJ detector, ', 'which can robustly detect pedestrians from various angles with low false ', 'alarm rate. In 2005, Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs [14] proposed HOG ', 'detector and used HOG features to train SVM classifier. HOG can ', 'describe local shape information and offset the influence of illumination ', 'to a certain extent, reducing the data dimension of the characterized ', 'image. In 2009, Piotr Dollar et al. [15] proposed the integral channel ', 'feature ICF. The second category of methods is mainly divided into ', 'one-stage detection methods YOLO series, SSD series, etc., and two-stage ', 'detection methods RCNN series. Joseph Redmon et al. [16] proposed ', 'YOLO method as a very representative one-stage detection method in ', '2016. YOLO treats detection as a regression task, divides the whole ', 'image into S*S grids, and each grid is responsible for detecting objects ', 'within the grid. It uses bounding box localization, conditional proba -', 'bility, confidence, etc., to complete the prediction in one go. Subse -', 'quently, YOLOv2 [17], YOLOv3 [18] and other versions were ', 'developed. Wei Liu et al. [19] proposed SSD as a one-stage detection ', 'method different from YOLO.

At the ', 'same time, multiple convolution layers with different scales are gener -', 'ated in the convolution layer to detect multi-scale objects and improve ', 'the detection accuracy. Ross Girshick et al. [20] introduced Convolu -', 'tional Neural Network (CNN) into the field of object detection for the ', 'first time in 2014, and proposed R-CNN by combining CNN with tradi-', 'tional machine learning methods. R-CNN uses selective search to obtain ', 'as many pre-selected boxes as possible, uses CNN network to extract ', 'features instead of manually designed features for the first time, and uses ', 'multiple SVM classifiers for classification and regression. Then in 2015, ', 'Ross Girshick [21] designed a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to ', 'replace the selective search in R-CNN, and selected Softmax classifier to ', 'replace multiple SVM classifiers, which greatly improved the detection ', 'performance. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, ', 'many researchers have proposed many detection methods with better ', 'performance, such as Faster RCNN [22], MSCNN [23], YOLOv4 [24], ', 'CSP [25], SAF-RCNN [26] and other methods based on R-CNN. ', 'Although hand-designed features are effective in simple cases, their ', 'generalization ability is weak and it is difficult to obtain high-level se-', 'mantic information. Deep features obtain feature representations based ', 'on the learning of a large number of samples, which can be learned ', 'end-to-end, with strong robustness and better generalization ability. In ', 'recent years, pedestrian detection has gradually evolved from ', 'hand-crafted features to deep features. ', 'The detection speed and accuracy of pedestrian detection methods ', 'have improved significantly. However, the most advanced pedestrian ', 'detection methods are still not comparable to human perception. ', 'Pedestrian detection still faces a number of challenges, for example:  ', '(1) Multiple gestures of pedestrian object: Pedestrian objects are both ', 'rigid and flexible and pedestrians may present a wide variety of ', 'postures, such as stationary, standing, squatting, bending, or ', 'walking. In addition, the appearance of pedestrians are all ', 'dressed differently, in various colors and styles. These variations ', 'pose a great challenge to current pedestrian detection. How to ', 'design a pedestrian detection method that is not affected by ', 'changes in pedestrian posture and clothing appearance is a ', 'challenge that needs to be solved for pedestrian detection ', 'nowadays.  ', '(2) Weather and low-lighting: Rain, snow, fog, haze, dust storms and ', 'other phenomena seriously reduce the clarity of photos, the ', 'reduced visibility of the pedestrian object and the blurred con-', 'tours severely limit the performance of pedestrian detection. At ', 'night when the light intensity is low, the pedestrian images have ', 'higher gray values, lack of color information, and increased ', 'interference information. Also low light conditions generally use ', 'infrared images, which have low resolution, contain less pedes -', 'trian information, and have blurred pedestrian object outlines. ', 'These problems seriously affect the accuracy of pedestrian ', 'detection. How to solve the problem of pedestrian object contouring due to bad weather and low light is a major challenge ', 'in pedestrian detection.  ', '(3) Occlusion: Occlusion in pedestrian detection is divided into two ', 'main categories: One is intra-class occlusion between pedes -', 'trians, and the other is inter-class occlusion of pedestrian objects ', 'by other objects. The mutual occlusion between pedestrians ', 'brings a lot of interference information, which may lead to false ', 'detection and affects detection performance. When the pedes -', 'trian object is obscured by other objects, the structure of the ', 'pedestrian is incomplete and the information of the pedestrian ', 'object is missing, which can easily produce missed detection and ', 'reduce the accuracy of pedestrian detection.  ', '(4) Multi-scale pedestrian: Different distances of pedestrian objects ', 'from the camera will bring different spatial scales of pedestrians, ', 'there may be multiple pedestrians at different scales in the same ', 'image. This has caused a significant negative impact on pedes -', 'trian detection. Large-scale pedestrians have richer information ', 'for better detection. But small-scale pedestrians tend to have ', 'lower pixels, blurred appearance and contours, contain less valid ', 'information, which easily misses detection and seriously affects ', 'the accuracy of pedestrian detection. It is a great challenge to ', 'accurately detect pedestrian objects at different scales.  ', '(5) Real-time detection: The application of pedestrian detection in ', 'automatic driving, intelligent monitoring, etc. has high re-', 'quirements for detection speed and needs to be able to detect in ', 'real time. With the development of deep learning, the pedestrian ', 'detection model is becoming more and more complex. While the ', 'detection accuracy is improved, it also brings a lot of calculations, ', 'which reduces the detection speed of pedestrian detection. How ', 'to achieve real-time detection while improving the accuracy of ', 'pedestrian detection is a great challenge in the field of pedestrian ', 'detection. ', 'Faced with many challenges, pedestrian detection, although a cate-', 'gory of general object detection, can still be studied as an independent ', 'problem. In recent years, in order to improve the detection accuracy and ', 'detection speed of pedestrian detection, researchers have proposed ', 'many new detection methods with better performance. This paper dis-', 'cusses and explores the research status of pedestrian detection from ', '2019 to 2022, summarizes commonly used pedestrian data sets and ', 'evaluation indicators, and focuses on the analysis of occlusion and scale ', 'problems and corresponding solutions of pedestrian detection.

Zijie Xie [36] et al. serially concatenated HOG features and ', 'three-layer LBP features extracted in three times to form a new ', 'multi-level concatenated feature, and performed dimensionality reduc -', 'tion operation (PCA) before feature fusion.

', '2.2. Deep features based ', 'Pedestrian detection based on deep features is further divided into ', 'one-stage and two-stage.

The algorithm process is ', 'shown in Fig. 5. ', 'There are many two-stage pedestrian detection algorithms with ', 'excellent performance that have been proposed in recent years.

Zhihang Fu [49] et al. think that although rich context ', 'information is important, the core area of the target instance is more ', 'important, and propose the ExtAtt two-stage pedestrian detection ', 'framework. Jin Ren [50] et al. improved Faster RCNN, designed a ', 'method of pooling Context Environment (PCE) around the candidate ', 'window, and fused different levels of features to improve the detection ', 'accuracy. Fiseha B. Tesema [51] et al. believe that manual features can ', 'be a good supplement to CNN features, and combine manual features ', 'and CNN features for detection on the basis of RPN\\x87BF.

In 2020, Zhaoqing Li ', '[102] et al. proposed the SCN model by combining segmentation ideas ', 'and context information.

Sheping Zhai [103] et al. proposed FCF ', 'R-CNN, which adopts a progressive cascade strategy in the backbone ', 'network to extract features from different layers for fusion, and the ', 'feature information of shallow layers is utilized. A multi-layer LSTM ', 'module is also designed to extract the global context information of the image. In 2022, Hangzhi Jiang [104] et al. proposed the SMPD pedes -', 'trian detector, designed a semantic integration module, independently ', 'of the CSP detector, used the semantic context of urban scenes for ', 'detection, and fused the output of CSP detector and semantic integration ', 'module as the final detection result.

In addition, dozens of detection ', 'methods proposed to solve the scale problem and occlusion problem in ', 'pedestrian detection are discussed. In the past 4 years, the detection ', 'accuracy and detection speed of pedestrian detection have been signif -', 'icantly improved. Researchers have done a lot of work. Aiming at the ', 'scale problem, some researchers use context information and attention ', 'mechanism to improve multi-scale pedestrian detection, some re-', 'searchers improve the robustness of pedestrian detection for pedestrians ', 'at different scales by fusing multi-scale features, and some researchers ', 'fuse deep features and shallow features to enrich the semantic infor-', 'mation and spatial features of features. The MR-2 index of MPAF-Net ', 'network with better performance on the Small, Medium and Large ', 'subsets of Cityperson dataset reaches 14.0%, 3.3% and 5.2%. For the ', 'occlusion problem, some researchers use pedestrian detection based on ', 'body parts to reduce the impact of occlusion. Some researchers use ', 'center point detection to transform pedestrian detection into high-level ', 'semantic feature detection, which effectively improves the detection ', 'accuracy in the presence of occlusion. Some researchers enhance feature ', 'representation through attention mechanism, context information and ', 'other methods to significantly improve the detection performance of ', 'occluded pedestrians. Some researchers introduce saliency map, edge ', 'perception and other methods to cope with occlusion. The MR-2 index of ', 'SA-DPM network with better performance reaches 30.18% in the ', 'severely occluded subset of Caltech dataset. However, there is still a big ', 'gap between the detection ability of pedestrian detection and human ', 'ability. In order to better apply pedestrian detection to unmanned ', 'driving, intelligent video surveillance and other fields, there is still a lot ', 'of work to be done: ', 'Scale problem: Despite the rapid development of pedestrian detection technology, the detection accuracy and detection speed have ', 'been greatly improved, but the scale problem of pedestrians is still a big ', 'challenge. Constructing multi-scale feature maps is a common method to ', 'deal with the scale problem of pedestrian detection. Deep feature maps ', 'often have rich semantic information, while shallow feature maps ', 'contain accurate positioning information, and fusing multi-scale feature ', 'maps can obtain more effective information. Exploring a better fusion ', 'method of multi-scale feature maps and designing a more reasonable ', 'and efficient pyramid structure are important ways to solve the multi- ', 'scale problem of pedestrian detection. At the same time, improving ', 'the representation ability of features by fusing features is also an ', 'effective way to deal with the scale problem. In the future, multiple ', 'attention mechanisms such as competitive attention can be explored for ', 'feature fusion. Multi-scale representation is an important solution to the ', 'problem of pedestrian detection scale. This method improves the ', 'detection performance while inevitably increasing the amount of ', 'calculation. How to balance the accuracy and calculation needs further ', 'exploration, and designing a more reasonable FPN structure is also ', 'worth studying. Context information improves the performance of ', 'pedestrian detection by enriching feature information, but not all ', 'context information can play a positive role in improving detection ', 'performance. How to select effective context information and be able to ', 'better insert it in the network is a direction worthy of research. Adding ', 'pre-processing and post-processing modules to the pedestrian detection ', 'framework can significantly improve the detection performance, such as ', 'Mosaic, flip, etc. Exploring more efficient pre-processing and post- ', 'processing methods is also an important way to improve the perfor -', 'mance of the detector. Multi-task joint learning is also a good research ', 'direction, which can obtain richer visual information through multiple ', 'visual tasks. Therefore, how to effectively use multi-task joint learning ', 'to improve the accuracy of multi-scale pedestrian detection is a good ', 'research direction in the future. The method based on super-resolution is ', 'a new direction to solve the pedestrian scaling problem in recent years, ', 'and its biggest difficulty is the training of GAN network. How to balance ', 'the generator and discriminator is a direction to be explored in the ', 'future. Data augmentation strategies can reduce the negative impact of ', 'imbalanced data to improve detection performance. How to design ', 'efficient data augmentation strategies is also worth studying. ', 'Occlusion problem: Pedestrian detection technology develops very ', 'rapidly, and has a high detection accuracy under normal circumstances. ', 'However, when there is occlusion in the image, the detection accuracy is ', 'significantly reduced, especially in severe occlusion, pedestrian detec -', 'tion can not maintain good robustness, which is still a huge challenge for ', 'us. Deep convolutional networks can extract higher dimensional ', 'pedestrian information, but some shallow information will be lost with ', 'the increase of dimension. The fusion of feature information of different ', 'dimensions can effectively improve the adverse impact of occlusion. ', 'Feature fusion has always been a common method to deal with occlu -', 'sion. The fusion feature has rich information and strong representation ', 'ability. Exploring how to design an efficient feature fusion network is ', 'also an effective method to solve the occlusion problem. Pedestrian ', 'detection is only one task of computer vision, which also includes se-', 'mantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Using other vision ', 'tasks to assist pedestrian detection is a way to improve the performance ', 'of occluded pedestrian detection, and the integration of multiple vision ', 'tasks is also an important research direction. In the future, the accuracy ', 'of occlusion pedestrian detection can be improved by exploring the ', 'degree of help of different body parts of pedestrians for occlusion ', 'detection to select the most appropriate body part for detection. At the ', 'same time, different training strategies will also affect the detection ', 'effect, and it is very important to explore efficient training strategies. ', 'Context information can make up for the lack of information in the ', 'invisible part, and how to design a more efficient context information ', 'extraction network can be explored in the future.

Segmentation using multimodality consists of fusing multi-information to improve the seg-mentation. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have presented the state-of-the-art performance in imageclassiﬁcation, segmentation, object detection and tracking tasks. Due to their self-learning and generalizationability over large amounts of data, deep learning recently has also gained great interest in multi-modal medicalimage segmentation.

In general, compared to the earlierfusion, the later fusion can give more accurate result if the fusion method is effective enough. We also discusssome common problems in medical image segmentation. Finally, we summarize and provide some perspectives onthe future research.', '1. IntroductionSegmentation using multi-modality has been widely studied with thedevelopment of medical image acquisition systems. Different strategiesfor image fusion, such as probability theory [1,2], fuzzy concept[3,4], believe functions[5,6], and machine learning[7–10]have been devel- oped with success. For the methods based on the probability theory andmachine learning, different data modalities have different statisticalproperties which makes it difﬁcult to model them using shallow models.For the methods based on the fuzzy concept, the fuzzy measure quanti ﬁes the degree of membership relative to a decision for each source. Thefusion of several sources is achieved by applying the fuzzy operators tothe fuzzy sets. For the methods based on the belief function theory, eachsource isﬁrst modeled by an evidential mass, the DempsterShafer rule isthen applied to fuse all sources. The main dif ﬁculty to use the belief function theory and the fuzzy set theory relates to the choice of theevidential mass, the fuzzy measure and the fuzzy conjunction function.However, a deep learning-based network can directly encode the map-ping. Therefore, the deep learning-based method has a great potential toproduce better fusion results than conventional methods. Since 2012,several deep convolutional neural network models have been proposedsuch as AlexNet[11], ZFNet[12], VGG[13], GoogleNet[14], Residual Net[15], DenseNet[16], FCN[17]and U-Net[18]. These models have not only provided state-of-the-art performance for image classi ﬁcation, segmentation, object detection and tracking tasks, but also provide a newpoint of view for image fusion. There are mainly four reasons contrib-uting to their success: Firstly, the main reason behind the amazing suc-cess of deep learning over traditional machine learning models is theadvancements in neural networks, it learns high-level features from datain an incremental manner, which eliminates the need of domain expertiseand hard feature extraction. And it solves the problem in an end to endmanner. Secondly, the appearance of GPU and GPU-computing librariesmake the model can be trained 10 to 30 times faster than on CPUs. Andthe open source software packages provide ef ﬁcient GPU implementa- tions. Thirdly, publicly available datasets such as ImageNet, can be usedfor training, which allow researchers to train and test new variants ofdeep learning models. Finally, several available ef ﬁcient optimization techniques also contributes theﬁnal success of deep learning, such as', '* Corresponding author.E-mail address:tongxue.zhou@insa-rouen.fr(T.

Medical image seg- mentation is an important area in medical image analysis and is neces-sary for diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. The goal is to assign thelabel to each pixel in images, it generally includes two phases, ﬁrstly, detect the unhealthy tissue or areas of interest; secondly, decliner thedifferent anatomical structures or areas of interest. These deeplearning-based methods have achieved superior performance comparedto traditional methods in medical image segmentation task. In order toobtain more accurate segmentation for better diagnosis, usingmulti-modal medical images has been a growing trend strategy. A thor-ough analysis of the literature with the keywords ‘deep learning’, ‘medical image segmentation ’and‘multi modality’on Google Scholar search engine is performed inFig. 1, which is queired on July 17, 2019.We can observe that the number of papers increases every year from2014 to 2018, which means multi-modal medical image segmentation indeep learning are obtaining more and more attention in recent years. Tohave a better understanding of the dimension of this research ﬁeld, we compare the scientiﬁc production of the image segmentation community,the medical image segmentation community, and the medical imagesegmentation using multi-modality fusion with and without deeplearning inFig. 2. From theﬁgure we can see, the amount of papers has adescent or even tendency in the methods without deep learning, butthere is an increase number of papers using deep learning method inevery researchﬁeld. Especially in medial image segmentation ﬁeld, due to the limited datasets, classical methods take still a more dominantposition, but we can see an obvious increasing tendency in the methodsusing deep learning. The principal modalities in medical images analysisare computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) andpositron emission tomography (PET). Compared to single images,multi-modal images help to extract features from different views andbring complementary information, contributing to better data represen-tation and discriminative power of the network. As pointed out inRef.[28], the CT image can diagnose muscle and bone disorders, such asbone tumors and fractures, while the MR image can offer a good softtissue contrast without radiation. Functional images, such as PET, lackanatomical characterization, while can provide quantitative metabolicand functional information about diseases. MRI modality can providecomplementary information due to its dependence on variable acquisi-tion parameters, such as T1-weighted (T1), contrast-enhancedT1-weighted (T1c), T2-weighted (T2) and Fluid attenuation inversionrecovery (Flair) images. T2 and Flair are suitable to detect the tumor withperitumoral edema, while T1 and T1c to detect the tumor core withoutperitumoral edema. Therefore, applying multi-modal images can reducethe information uncertainty and improve clinical diagnosis and seg-mentation accuracy[29]. Several widely used multi-modal medical im-ages are described inFig. 3. The earlier fusion is simple and most worksuse the fusion strategy to do the segmentation, it focuses on the subse-quent complex segmentation network architecture designs, but it doesn ’t', 'consider the relationship between different modalities and doesn ’t analyze how to fuse the different feature information to improve thesegmentation performance. However, the later fusion pays more atten-tion on the fusion problem, because each modality is employed as aninput of one network which can learn complex and complementaryfeature information of each modality. In general, compared to the earlierfusion, the later fusion can achieve better segmentation performance ifthe fusion method is ffective enough. And the selection of fusion methoddepends on the speciﬁc problem.There are also some other reviews on medical image analysis usingdeep learning. However, they don ’t focus on the fusion strategy. Forexample, Litjens et al.[30]reviewed the major deep learning concepts inmedical image analysis. Bernal et al. [31]gave an overview in deep CNN for brain MRI analysis. In this paper, we focus on fusion methods ofmulti-modal medical images for medical image segmentation.The rest of the paper is structured as followed. In Section 2we introduce the general principle of deep learning and multi-modal medicalimage segmentation. In Section3, we present how to prepare the databefore feeding to the network. In Section 4, we describe the detailed multi-modal segmentation network based on different fusion strategies.In Section5, we discuss some common problems appeared in the ﬁeld. Finally, we summarize and discuss the future perspective in the ﬁeld of multi-modal medical image segmentation.2. Deep learning based methods2.1. Deep learningDeep learning refers to a neural network with multiple layers ofnonlinear processing units[32]. Each successive layer uses the outputfrom the previous layer as input. The network can extract the complexhierarchy features from a large amount of data by using these layers. In', 'Fig. 1.The tendency of multi-modal medical image segmentation in deep learning.T. Zhou et al. Array 3-4 (2019) 100004', '2recent years, deep learning has made signiﬁcant improvements in image classiﬁcation, recognition, object detection and medical image analysis,where they have produced excellent results comparable to or sometimessuperior to human experts. Among the known deep learning algorithms,such as stacked auto-encoders[33], deep Boltzmann machines[34], and convolutional neural networks[35], the most successful one for imagesegmentation is convolutional neural networks (CNN). It was ﬁrst pro- posed in 1989 by LeCun and theﬁrst successful real-world application[36]is the hand-written digit recognition in 1998 by LeCun, where hepresented aﬁve-layer fully-adaptive architecture. Due to its accuracyresults (1% error rate and 9% reject rate from a dataset of 2007 hand-written characters), the neural networks can be applied into a real-worldproblem. However, it did not gather much attention until the contribu-tion of Krizhevsky et al. to the ImageNet challenge in 2012. The proposedAlexNet[11], similar to LeNet but deeper, outperformed all the com-petitors and won the challenge by reducing the top-5 error (the per-centage of test examples for which the correct class was not in the top 5predicted classes) from 26% to 15.3%. In the subsequent years, otherbased on CNN architectures are proposed, including VGGNet [13], GoogleNet[14], Residual Net[15]and DenseNet[16],Table 1describes the details of these network architectures.CNN is a multi-layer neural network containing convolution, pooling,activation and fully connected layers. Convolution layers are the core ofCNNs and are used for feature extraction. The convolution operation canproduce different feature maps depending on the ﬁlters used. Pooling layer performs a downsampling operation by using maximum or averageof the deﬁned neighborhood as the value to reduce the spatial size of eachfeature map. Non-linear rectiﬁed layer (ReLU) and its modiﬁcations such as Leaky ReLU are among the most commonly used activation functions[37], which transforms data by clipping any negative input values to zerowhile positive input values are passed as output. Neurons in a fullyconnected layer are fully connected to all activations in the previouslayer. They are placed before the classiﬁcation output of a CNN and are used toﬂatten the results before a prediction is made using linear clas-siﬁers. While training the CNN architecture, the model predicts the classscores for training images, computes the loss using the selected loss', 'Fig. 2.The tendency of relative researchﬁeld with/without deep learning.', 'Fig. 3.The multi-modal medical images, (a) –(c) are the commonly used multi-modal medical images and (d) –(g) are the different sequences of brain MRI.T. Zhou et al. Array 3-4 (2019) 100004', '3function andﬁnally updates the weights using the gradient descentmethod by back-propagation. The cross-entropy loss is one of the mostwidely used loss functions and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is themost popular method to operate gradient descent.2.2. Multi-modal medical image segmentationDue to the variable size, shape and location of target tissue, medicalimage segmentation is one of the most challenging tasks in the ﬁeld of medical image analysis. Despite the variety of proposed segmentationnetwork architectures, it is still hard to compare the performance ofdifferent algorithms, because most of the algorithms are evaluated ondifferent sets of data and reported in different metrics. In order to obtainaccurate segmentation and compare different state-of-the-art methods,some well-known publicly challenges for segmentation are created, suchas Brain tumor Segmentation (BraTS) [21], Ischemic Stroke Lesion Seg- mentation(ISLES),', '1MR Brain Image Segmentation (MRBrainS) [38], Neonatal Brain Segmentation (NeoBrainS) [39], Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation (CHAOS),', '26-month infant brain MRI Segmentation (Iseg-2017) [40]and Automatic intervertebral disc localization and segmentation from 3D Multi-modality MR (M3)Images (IVDM3Seg).', '3Table 2describes the detailed dataset informationmentioned above.Table 3shows the main evaluation metrics in thesedatasets.We describe a pipeline of multi-modal medical image segmentationbased on deep learning, shown inFig. 4. The pipeline consists of four parts: data preparation, network architecture, fusion strategy and datapost-processing. In the data preparation stage, the data dimension isﬁrstly chosen, and the pre-processing is used to reduce the variationbetween images, and data augmentation strategy can also be used toincrease the training data to avoid the over- ﬁtting problem. In the network architecture and fusion strategy stages, the basic network anddetailed multi-modal images fusion strategies are presented to train thesegmentation network. In the data post-processing stage, some post-pressing techniques such as morphological techniques and conditionalrandomﬁeld are implanted to reﬁne theﬁnal segmentation result. In the task of multi-modal medical image segmentation, fusing multiple mo-dalities is the key problem of the task. According to the level in thenetwork architecture where the fusion is performed, the fusion strategiescan be categorized into three groups: input-level fusion, layer-levelfusion, and decision-level fusion, the details refers to Section 4.3. Data processingThis section will describe the data processing including data dimen-sion selection, image pre-processing, data augmentation and post-processing techniques. This step is important in deep learning-basedsegmentation network.3.1. Data dimensionMedical image segmentation usually deals with 3D images. Somemodels directly use the 3D images to train models [41–44], while some models process the 3D image slice by slice [20,45–48]. The 3D approach takes the 3D image as input and applies the 3D convolution kernel toexploit the spatial contextual information of the image. The maindrawback is its expensive computational cost. Compared to utilizing thewhole volume image to train the model, some 3D small patches can beused to reduce the computational cost. For instance, Kamnitsas et al. [49] extracts 10 k random 3D patches at regular intervals for training tosegment the brain lesion. The 2D approach takes the image slice or patchextracted from the 3D image as input and applies the 2D convolutionalkernel, the 2D approach can efﬁciently reduce the computational cost,while it ignores the spatial information of the image in z direction. Forexample, Zhao, et al.[50]trainedﬁrstly FCNNs using image patches andthen CRFs as Recurrent Neural Networks using image slices with theparameters of FCNNsﬁxed,ﬁnally theyﬁne-tuned the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices. To exploit the feature information of the 2Dimage and 3D image, Mlynarski, et al. [51]described a CNN-based model for brain tumor segmentation, itﬁrst extracts the 2D features of the imagefrom axial, coronal and sagittal views and then takes them as the addi-tional input of the 3D CNN-based model. The method can learn richfeature information in three dimensions, which achieve good perfor-mance with median Dice scores of 0.918 (whole tumor), 0.883 (tumorcore) and 0.854 (enhancing core).3.2. Pre-processingPre-processing plays an important role in subsequent segmentationtask, especially for the multi-modal medical image segmentation becausethere are variant intensity, contrast and noise in the images. Therefore, tomake the images appear more similar and make the network trainingsmooth and quantiﬁable, some pre-processing techniques are appliedbefore feeding to the segmentation network. The typical pre-processingtechniques consist of image registration, bias', 'ﬁeld correction and in- tensity normalization. For BraTS dataset, the image registration hasalready done before provided to the public [20,45,49,50,52]. used the N4ITK method to correct the distortion of MRI data [19,20,41,45,48,49]. proposed to normalize each modality of each patient independently bysubtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the brainregion.3.3. Data augmentationMost of the time, a large number of labels for training is not availablefor several reasons. Labelling the dataset requires an expert in this ﬁeld which is expensive and time-consuming. When training large neuralnetworks from limited training data, the over- ﬁtting problem needs to be considered[53]. Data augmentation is a way to reduce over- ﬁtting and increase the amount of training data. It creates new images by trans-forming (rotated, translated, scaled,ﬂipped, distorted and adding some noise such as Gaussian noise) the ones in training dataset. Both theoriginal image and created images are fed into the neural network. Forexample, Isensee, et al.[41]proposed to address over-ﬁtting by utilizing a large variety of data augmentation techniques like random rotations,random scaling, random elastic deformations, gamma correctionaugmentation and mirroring on theﬂy during training.Table 1Summary of deep learning network architectures, ILSVRC: ImageNet Large ScaleVisual Recognition Challenge.', 'Architecture Article Rank on ILSVRCTop-5error rateNumber ofparametersLeNet[36]LeCun et al.,1998N/A N/A 60 thousandAlexNet[11]Krizhevskyet al., 20121st 16.4% 60 millionZFNet[12]Zeiler et al.,20131st 11.7% N/AVGG Net[13]Simonyan et al.,20142nd 7.3% 138 millionGoogleNet[14]Szegedy et al.,20151st 6.7% 5 million (V1) &23million (V2) ResNet[15]He.

Zhou et al. Array 3-4 (2019) 100004', '43.4. Post-processing[54]Post-processing is applied to reﬁne theﬁnal result in segmen- tation network. The isolated segmentation labels with small size areprone to artefacts and the largest volume are usually kept in the ﬁnal segmentation. In this case, morphological techniques are preferred toremove incorrect small fragments and keep the largest volume. And somepost-processing techniques can be designed according to the structure ofdetected region. For example, considering LGG patients may don ’t have enhancing tumor, Isensee, et al.[42]proposed to replace all enhancing tumor voxels with necrosis if the number of predicted enhancing tumor isless than a threshold. Because if there is a false positive voxel in predictedsegmentation where no enhancing tumor presents in the ground truthwill result in a Dice score of 0. Another case in Ref. [49], a 3D fully connected Condition Random Field (CRF) is applied for post-processingto effectively remove false positives to reﬁne the segmentation result.4. Multi-modal segmentation networksOver the years, various semi-automated and automated techniqueshave been proposed for multi-modal medical image segmentation usingdeep learning-based methods, such as CNN [36]and FCN[17]especially U-Net[18]. According to the multi-modal fusion strategies, we categorythe network architectures into input-level fusion network, layer-levelfusion network and decision-level fusion network, for each fusion strat-egy we conclude some common used methods, shown in Fig. 5.4.1. Input-level fusion networkIn the input-level fusion strategy, multi-modality images are fusedchannel by channel as the multi-channel inputs to learn a fused featurerepresentation, and then to train the segmentation network. Most of theexisting multi-modal medical image segmentation networks adopt theinput-level fusion strategy, which directly integrates the multi-modalTable 2Summary of the multi-modal medical image segmentation datasets.', 'Dataset Train Validation Test Segmentation Task Modality Image SizeBrats2012 35 N/A 15 Brain tumor T1, T1C, T2, Flair 160 /C2216/C2176176/C2176/C2216 Brats2013 35 N/A 25 Brain tumor T1, T1C, T2, Flair 160 /C2216/C2176 176/C2176/C2216 Brats2014 200 N/A 38 Brain tumor T1, T1C, T2, Flair 160 /C2216/C2176 176/C2176/C2216 Brats2015 200 N/A 53 Brain tumor T1, T1C, T2, Flair 240 /C2240/C2155 Brats2016 200 N/A 191 Brain tumor T1, T1C, T2, Flair 240 /C2240/C2155 Brats2017 285 46 146 Brain tumor T1, T1C, T2, Flair 240 /C2240/C2155 Brats2018 285 66 191 Brain tumor T1, T1C, T2, Flair 240 /C2240/C2155 ISLES2015 28 N/A 36 Ischemic stroke lesion T1, T2, TSE, Flair, DWI, TFE/TSE 230 /C2230/C2154 30 N/A 20 T1c, T2, DWI, CBF, CBV, TTP, Tmax N/AMRBrainS13 5 N/A 15 Brain Tissue T1, T1_1 mm, T1_IR, Flair 256 /C2256/C2192 240/C2240/C248 NeoBrainS12 20 N/A 5 Brain Tissue T1, T2 384 /C2384/C250 512/C2512/C2110 512/C2512/C250 iSeg-2017 10 N/A 13 Brain Tissue T1,T2 N/ACHAOS 20 N/A 20 Abdominal Organs CT, T1-DUAL, T2-SPIR N/AIVD 16 N/A 8 Intervertebral Disc In-phase, Opposed-phase, Fat, Water N/A', 'Table 3Summary of the evaluation metrics commonly used for these datasets.

Zhou et al. Array 3-4 (2019) 100004', '5images in the original input space [20,41,42,45,48–50,55,56].Fig. 6 describes the generic network architecture of the input-level fusionsegmentation network. We take CT and MRI as two input modalities,convolutional neural network as the segmentation network and the braintumor segmentation as the segmentation task. By using the input-levelfusion strategy, the rich feature information from different modalitiescan be fully exploited in all layers, from the ﬁrst layer to the last one. This kind of fusion uses usually four techniques, multi-task segmentation,multi-view segmentation, multi-scale segmentation and GAN-basedsegmentation.To name a few, Wang, et al.[48]proposes a multi-modal segmenta- tion network using BraTS dataset to segment the brain tumor into threesubregions including the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumorcore. It uses multi-task and multi-view techniques. In order to obtain aunited feature set, it directly integrates the four modalities (T1, T1c, T2and Flair of MRI) as the multi-channel inputs in the input space. Then itseparates the complex multi-class segmentation task into several simplersegmentation tasks according to the hierarchical structure of the braintumor. The whole tumor isﬁrstly segmented and then the bounding boxincluding the whole tumor is used for the tumor core segmentation.Based on the obtained bounding box of the tumor core, the enhancingtumor core isﬁnally segmented. Furthermore, to take advantage of 3Dcontextual information, for each individual task, they fused the seg-mentation results from three different orthogonal views (axial, coronaland sagittal) by averaging the softmax outputs of the individual task.Experiments with the testing set of BraTS 2017 data show that the pro-posed method achieves an average Dice scores of 0.7831, 0.8739, and0.7748 for enhancing tumor core, whole tumor and tumor core, respec-tively, which won the second place on BraTS 2017 challenge. Themulti-task segmentation separates the complex task of multiple classsegmentation into several simpler segmentation tasks and takes advan-tage of the hierarchical structure of tumour subregions to improve seg-mentation accuracy.Zhou et al.[57]also proposes a multi-task segmentation network onBraTS dataset, it fuses the multi-modal MR images channel by channel inthe input space to learn a fused feature representation. Compared tosegmentation of[48]which suffers from network complexity and ignoresthe correlation between the three sequential segmentation tasks, it de-composes brain tumor segmentation into three different but related tasks.Each task has an independent convolutional layer, one classi ﬁcation layer, one loss layer and different input data. Based on curriculumlearning[58], which means gradually increasing the difﬁculty of training tasks, they applied an effective strategy to improve the convergencequality of the model by training theﬁrst task only until the loss curve tends toﬂatten, then theﬁrst data and the second data are concatenatedalong the batch dimension as the input for the second task. The operationof the third task is like the second one. In this way, not only the modelparameters but also the training data are transferred from an easier taskto a more difﬁcult task. The proposed approach ranksﬁrst on the BRATS 2015 test set and achieves top performance on the BRATS 2017 dataset.It’s likely to require different receptiveﬁeld when segmenting different regions in an image. For example, large regions may need alarge receptiveﬁeld at the expense ofﬁne details, while small regions may require high resolution local information. Qin et al. [43]proposed the autofocus convolutional layer to enhance the abilities of neural net-works by using multi-scale processing. After integrating the multi-modalimages in the input space, they applied an autofocus convolutional layerby using multiple convolutional layers with different dilation rates tochange the size of the receptive', 'ﬁeld. Autofocus convolutional layer canindicate the importance of each scale when processing different locationsof an image. Also, they used an attention mechanism to choose theoptimal scale. The proposed autofocus layer can be easily integrated intoexisting networks to improve a model ’s performance. The proposed method gained promising performance on the challenging tasks ofmulti-organ segmentation in pelvic CT and brain tumor segmentation inMRI.Motivated by the success of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)[59], which models a mini-max game between the generator and thediscriminator, some methods propose to apply the discriminator as theextra constraint to improve the segmentation performance [60,61].I n Ref.[60], by fusing the multi-modal images as multi-channel inputs, theytrained two separate networks: a residual U-net as the generativenetwork and a discriminator network, the segmentation network willgenerate a segmentation, while the discriminator network will distin-guish between the generated segmentations and ground truth masks. Thediscriminator is a shallow network containing three 3D convolutionblocks, each followed by a max-pooling layer. In order to obtain a robustsegmentation, they introduced extra constraints via contours to themodel. Hausdorff distance between ground truth contours and predictioncontours is used as a measure of dissimilarity. The proposed method wasevaluated on the BraTS 2018 dataset and achieved competitive results,demonstrating that raw segmentation results can be improved by incor-porating extra constraints in contours and adversarial training. Huo et al.[61]employed the PatchGAN[62]as an additional discriminator to su-pervise the training procedure of the network. The method based on GANcan obtain a robust segmentation due to the extra constrain of discrim-inator, but it costs more memory to train the extra discriminator.The input-level fusion strategy can maximumly keep the originalimage information and learn the intrinsic image feature. Using sequentialsegmentation networks allows to take different strategies, such as multi-task, multi-view, multi-scale and GAN-based segmentation network, tofully exploit the feature representation from multi-modal images.4.2. Layer-level fusionIn the layer-level fusion strategy, single or two modal images are usedas the single input to train individual segmentation network, and thenthese learned individual feature representations will be fused in thelayers of the network,ﬁnally the fused result will be fed to the decisionlayer to obtain theﬁnal segmentation result. The layer-level fusionnetwork can effectively integrate and fully leverage multi-modal images[44,46,63,64].Fig. 7describes the generic network architecture oflayer-level fusion segmentation work.To name a few, we also take the brain tumor segmentation in multi-sequence of MRI to illustrate this kind of fusion. It is well known that T1weighed MRI and T1c are suitable to segment the tumor core without theperitumoral edema, while T2 and Flair are suitable to segment the per-itumoral edema. Chen et al.[63]proposes a dual-pathway multi-modalbrain tumor segmentation network. Theﬁrst pathway uses the T2 and Flair to extract the relative feature to segment the whole tumor from thebackground, and the second pathway uses the T1 and T1c to train thesame segmentation network to learn other relative feature', 'Fig. 6.The generic network architecture of the input-level fusion.T. Zhou et al. Array 3-4 (2019) 100004', '6representation, and then the features from the both pathways are fusedandﬁnally fed into a four-class softmax classiﬁer to segments the back- ground, ED, ET and NCR/NET. The dual-pathway segmentation networkcan exploit the effective feature information of different modalities andachieve an accurate segmentation result.Dolz et al.[44]proposes a 3D fully convolutional neural networkbased on DenseNets that extends the deﬁnition of dense connectivity to multi-modal segmentation. Each imaging modality has a path and denseconnections exist both in the layers within the same path and in thedifferent paths. Therefore, the proposed network can learn more complexfeature representations between the modalities. The extensive experi-ment results on two different and highly competitive multi-modal braintissue segmentation challenges: iSEG 2017 [40]and MRBrainS 2013 [38], show that the proposed method yielded signi ﬁcant improvements over many other state-of-the-art segmentation networks, ranking at thetop on both benchmarks.Inspired by Ref.[44], Dolz, et al.[46]proposes an architecture for IVD (Intervertebral Disc) localization and segmentation in multi-modalMRI. Each MRI modality is processed in a corresponding single path tobetter exploit its feature representation. The network is densely con-nected both within each path and across different paths, granting thenthe freedom of the model to learn where and how the different modalitiesshould be processed and combined. It also improves the standard U-Netmodules by extending inception modules using two convolutional blockswith dilated convolutions of a different scale to help handle multi-scalecontext information.To summarize, in the layer-level fusion segmentation network, Den-seNets are the commonly used networks which bring the three followingbeneﬁts. First, direct connections between all layers help to improve theﬂow of information and gradients through the entire network, alleviatingthe problem of vanishing gradient. Second, short paths to all the featuremaps in the architecture introduce implicit deep supervision. Third,dense connections have a regularizing effect, which reduces the risk ofover-ﬁtting on tasks with smaller training sets. Therefore, DenseNetsallow to improved effectiveness and efﬁciency in the layer-level fusion segmentation network. In the layer-level fusion segmentation network,the connection among the different layers can capture complex re-lationships between modalities, which fully exploit the feature repre-sentation of multi-modal images.4.3. Decision-level fusionIn decision-level fusion segmentation network, like the layer-levelfusion, each modality image is used as the single input of single seg-mentation network. The single network can better exploit the uniqueinformation of the corresponding modality. The outputs of the individualnetworks will then be integrated to get the ﬁnal segmentation result. The decision-level fusion segmentation network is designed to independentlylearn the complementary information from different modalities, sincemulti-modal images have little direct complementary information intheir original image spaces due to different image acquisition techniques.Fig. 8describes the generic network architecture of layer-level fusionsegmentation work.For example, to effectively employ multi-modalities from T1, T2 andfractional anisotropy (FA) modality, Nie, et al. [47]proposes a new multi-FCNs network architecture for the infant brain tissue segmentation(white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF)). Instead of simply combining three modality data from the input space,they trained one network for each modality and then fused multiplemodality features from high-layer of each network. Results showed thatthe proposed model signiﬁcantly outperformed previous methods interms of accuracy.For the decision-level fusion, many fusion strategies have been pro-posed[64]. The most of them are based on averaging and majorityvoting. For averaging strategy, Kamnitsas, et al. [52]trains three net- works separately and then averaged the con ﬁ', 'dence of the individual networks. Theﬁnal segmentation is obtained by assigning each voxelwith the highest conﬁdence. For majority voting strategy, theﬁnal label of a voxel depends on the majority of the labels of the individualnetworks.The statistical properties of the different modalities are different,which make it difﬁcult for a single model to directlyﬁnd correlations', 'Fig. 7.The generic network architecture of the layer-level fusion.', 'Fig. 8.The generic network architecture of the decision-level fusion.T. Zhou et al. Array 3-4 (2019) 100004', '7across modalities. Therefore, in decision-level fusion segmentationnetwork, the multiple segmentation networks can be trained to fullyexploit the multi-modal features. Aygn et al. [65]investigates different fusion methods on the brain tumor segmentation problem in terms ofmemory and performance. In terms of memory usage, the decision-levelfusion strategies require more memory since the model fuses the featureslater and more parameters are needed for layers to perform convolutionand other operations. However, the later fusion can achieve better per-formance, because each modality is employed as input of one networkwhich can learn complex and complementary feature informationcompared to input-level fusion network.5. Common problems5.1. Over-ﬁttingOne limitation in medical image segmentation is data scarcity, usu-ally leading to the over-ﬁtting which refers to a model that has a goodperformance on the training dataset but does not perform well on newdata. Most of the time, a large number of labels for training is notavailable for medical image analysis, because labelling the dataset re-quires experts in thisﬁeld, and it is time-consuming and sometimes proneto error. When training complex neural networks with limited trainingdata, special care must be taken to prevent the over- ﬁtting. The complexity of a neural network model is de ﬁned by both its structure and the parameters. Therefore, we can reduce the complexity of the networkarchitecture by reducing the layers or parameters or focus on methodsthat artiﬁcially increase the number of training data instead of changingthe network architecture[32,66]. The latter is commonly used to pro-duce new synthetic images by performing data transformations and thecorresponding ground truth that include operations of scaling, rotation,translation, brightness variation, elastic deformations, horizontal ﬂip- ping and mirroring (for details refer to Section 3.3data augmentation).5.2. Class imbalanceOne of the major challenges in medical image analysis is to deal withimbalanced data. In medical imagingﬁeld, the problem is even more glaring. For example, for a segmentation of brain tumor or that of whitematter lesion, the normal brain region is larger than the abnormal region.Training with the class imbalanced data can cause an unstable segmen-tation network, which is biased towards the class with a large region.Table 4illustrate the distribution of the classes in the training data ofBraTS 2017, the number of positives (NEC/NET, ED and ET) and nega-tives (Background) are highly imbalanced and the background is over-whelmingly dominant. As result, the choice of the loss functions is crucialin segmentation networks, especially when dealing with highly unbal-anced problems. We present several types of loss function which arewidely used individually or combined in medical image segmentationnetworks. From the data-level, the problem can be addressed by resam-pling the data space. There are three main approaches: under-samplingthe negative class[67]or upsampling the negative class [68]and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) [69]generating synthetic samples along the line segment that joins minority class sam-ples. These approaches are simple to follow but they may remove someimportant data or add redundant data to the training set.The patch sampling-based method can also mitigate the imbalanceddata problem. For example, Kamnitsas, et al. [49]proposes the balanced strategy to alleviate class imbalance problem. They extract the trainingpatches with 50% probability being cantered either on the lesion orhealthy voxels. Clrigues et al.[56]uses the lesion centered strategy, inwhich all training patches are extracted from the region centered on alesion voxel. Additionally, a random offset is added to a sampling 475point to avoid location bias, where a lesion voxel is always expected atthe patch center, contributing then to some data augmentations.As for the algorithm-level, Havaei, et al. [19]proposes a two-phase training procedure. Itﬁrst constructs a patch dataset such that all la-bels are equiprobable by taking into account the diversity in all classes,and then retrains only the output layer to calibrate the output probabil-ities correctly. In this way, the class imbalance problem is overcome.', 'Another approach consists of using a multi-task segmentation [48,57,63, 70]that decomposes the complex multi-class segmentation task intoseveral simple tasks, since each training task segments only one region,where the label distribution will be less unbalanced than segmentationmultiple classes at one time. Some approaches address class imbalanceproblem through an ensemble learning by combining same or differentclassiﬁers to improve their generalization ability [71]. Otherwise, the loss functions can also alleviate this problem by modifying the distribu-tions of the training data. We present them as below.Cross-Entropy (CE) loss:Cross-entropy loss function is the mostcommonly used for the task of image segmentation. It is calculated byequation(1). Because the cross-entropy loss evaluates individually theclass predictions for each pixel vector and then averages all pixels, thiscan lead some error if an unbalanced class representation exists in theimage. Long et al.[17]proposes to weight or sample the loss function foreach output channel in order to alleviate the class imbalance problem.Loss', 'CE¼/C0X', 'i2NX', 'l2LyðlÞilogbyðlÞi(1)whereNis the set of all examples andLthe set of all labels,y', 'ðlÞiis the one- hot encoding (0 or 1) for example and label l,by', 'ðlÞiis the predicted probability for the same example/label pair.Weighted Cross Entropy (WCE): Since the background regions dominate the training set, it is reasonable to incorporate the weights ofmultiple classes into the cross-entropy as de ﬁned as follows[32]:Loss', 'WCE¼/C0X', 'iεNX', 'l2LwiyðlÞilogbyðlÞi(2)wherew', 'irepresents the weight assigned to the ith label. Dice Loss (DL):Dice loss is a popular loss function for medical imagesegmentation which is a measure of overlap between the predictedsample and real sample.

Discussion and conclusionIn the above sections, we presented a large set of state-of-the-artmultimodal medical image segmentation networks based on deeplearning. They are summarized inTable 5. For BraTS challenge, these methods are concluded since 2013, because deep learning methods areapplied since 2013. Publicly available multi-modal medical image data-sets for segmentation task are rare, the most used dataset is the BraTSdataset having proposed since 2012. For their segmentation, the currentbest method is proposed in Ref.[55], they use the input-level fusionstrategy to directly integrate the different modalities in the input space,they apply the encoder-decoder structure of CNN combined with anadditional VAE (variational autoencoder) branch to the encoder part. TheVAE branch can reconstruct the input image and exploit better the fea-tures of the encoder endpoint. It also provides an additional guidance anda regularization to the encoder part. The authors demonstrate that moresophisticated data augmentation techniques, data post-processing tech-niques, or deeper network will not further improve the network perfor-mance, which means the network architecture plays a crucial role in thesegmentation network than other data processing operations.For multi-modal medical image segmentation, the fusion strategytakes an important role in order to achieve an accurate segmentationresult. Conventional image fusion strategy learns a direct mapping be-tween source images and target images, the fusion strategy consists oftwo basic stages: activity level measurement and fusion rule [79]. Ac- tivity level measurement is implemented by designing local ﬁlters to extract high-frequency details, and the calculated clarity information ofdifferent source images are then compared using some designed rules toobtain a clarity image. To achieve better performance, these issuesbecome more and more complicated, so it is dif ﬁcult to manually propose an ideal fusion strategy which fully concerns the important issues. To thisend, a deep learning-based network can directly encode the mapping.Deep learning-based methods outperform in three aspects. First, deep', 'Table 5Summary of the deep learning approaches for multi-modal medical image segmentation, the bold presents the best performance in the challenge.

Zhou et al. Array 3-4 (2019) 100004', '9learning-based networks learn a complex and abstract hierarchicalfeature representation for image data to overcome the dif ﬁculty of manual feature design. Second, deep learning-based networks can pre-sent the complex relationships between different modalities by using thehierarchical network layer, such as the layer-level fusion strategy. Third,the image transform and fusion strategy in the conventional fusionstrategy can be jointly generated by training a deep learning model, inthis way some potential deep learning network architectures can beinvestigated for designing an effective image fusion strategy. Therefore,the deep learning-based method has a great potential to produce betterfusion results than conventional methods.Choosing an effective deep learning fusion strategy is still an impor-tant issue. In 2013–2018 BraTS Challenge, all the methods applied theinput-level fusion to directly integrate the different MR images in theinput space, which is simple and can remain the intrinsic image featureand allow the method to focus on the subsequent segmentation networkarchitecture designs, such as multi-task, multi-view, multi-scale andGAN-based strategies. While the strategy just concatenates the modalitiesin the input space, but it does not exploit the relationships among thedifferent modalities. For layer-level fusion, with the dense connectionamong the layers, the fusion strategy often takes the DenseNet as thebasic network. The connection among the different layers can capturecomplex relationships between modalities, which can help the segmen-tation network learn more valuable information and achieve better per-formance than directly integrating different modalities in the inputspace. For decision-level fusion strategy, it can achieve better perfor-mance compared to the input-level fusion, because each modality isemployed to train a single network to learn independent feature repre-sentation, while this requires much memory and computational time.Compared the last two fusion strategies, the layer fusion strategy seemsbetter, since the dense connection among the layers can exploit morecomplex and complementary information to enhance the networktraining, while the decision-level fusion only learns the independentfeature representation in single modality. Since the results of the threefusion strategies are not obtained from the same data, their comparisonin terms of performance is difﬁcult. Methodologically, each strategy hasits advantages and disadvantages.Although we observed the advantages of these fusion strategies basedon deep learning, based on the previous works, we can still observe thatthere are some locks to lift in multi-modal medical image segmentationbased on deep learning. It is known that multi-modal fusion networksgenerally perform better than single-modal network for segmentationtask. The problem is how to fuse different modalities to get the bestcompromise for a precise segmentation. Hence, how to design multi-modal networks to efﬁciently combine different modalities, how toexploit the latent relationship between different modalities, and how tointegrate the multi-information into the segmentation network toimprove the segmentation performance can be the topics of future works.Other problem concerns the data. First, since it is dif ﬁcult to obtain a large number of medical image data, the limited training data can easilylead to over-adjustment. To deal with it, reducing the complexity of thenetwork architecture or increasing the number of training data has beenproved to alleviate the problem. Second, training with the imbalanceddata can cause an unstable segmentation network especially with smalllesion or structure segmentation. Resampling the data space, using two-phase training procedure, careful path sampling and appropriate lossfunction are the proposed strategies to overcome the problem. Third, likecommon problems for deep learning, it ’s difﬁcult to train a deep network with original limited data without data augmentation or other optimizedtechniques. Therefore, designing faster methods to perform convolutionsand appropriate optimization methods can help to train an effectivesegmentation network. It is becoming a widespread practice in thecomputer vision community to release source codes to the public. Wehave indicated the available code in Table 5. This practice helps to expedite the research in theﬁeld. Another recommended practice isvalidating the model on different datasets, which can open the door todesign a robust model that can be applied to datasets of similarapplications.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.References', '[1]Dubois D, Prade H.

This topic is motivated by two observations. Due to crossings of tyre traces such transitions in practice often cause an increase ofcompacted area. Furthermore, for very tight angles between headland path and interior lanes undesired hairpinturns may become necessary due to the limited agility of in- ﬁeld operating tractors. By minimising the number of interior lanes both detrimental effects can be mitigated.

IntroductionAccording toAhumada and Villalobos (2009)there are four main functional sectors for the agri-food supply chain: production, harvest-ing, storage and distribution. Optimising logistics and routing play animportant role in all of the four functional areas for improved supplychain efﬁciency. Furthermore, according toSorensen and Bochtis (2010)it can be distinguished between in-ﬁeld, inter-ﬁeld, inter- sector and inter-regional logistics. This paper relates to the ﬁrst func- tional area of the agri-food supply chain, i.e., production, and furtherto in-ﬁeld logistics. The difﬁculty of in-ﬁeld logistics arises from the vast variety ofﬁeld shapes encountered in practice. In this perspectiveOksanen (2013)presented eight indices for measuring the complexityofﬁeld shapes. For an application, seeJanulevicius et al. (2019)who studied the effect of differentﬁeld width-to-length ratios on tractor per-formance measures such as fuel consumption and exhaust emissionswhen ploughing.For in-ﬁeld logistics it can be differentiated between three hierarchi-cal planning layers: (i) theﬁtting of lanes withinﬁeld contours, (ii) route planning for the traversal of these lanes, and (iii) trajectory plan-ning accounting for agility and actuation constraints of the in- ﬁeld oper- ating vehicle to smooth outﬁnal paths. This paper focuses on theﬁrst hierachical layer and, in particular, how freeform path ﬁtting compares to the more common method ofﬁtting straights as interior lanes. Forbackground, the coverage of agriculturalﬁelds growing, e.g., cereals orrapeseed requires lanes to beﬁtted withinﬁeld contours such that in- ﬁeld operating machinery can repeatedly travel along them during thework cycle after seeding and before harvest. These traversals typicallyoccur many times throughout the year for multiple spraying and fertil-izing applications.Oksanen and Visala (2009)presented two greedy algorithms forﬁeld coverage path planning. Theﬁrst algorithm splits a singleﬁeld using a trapezoidal split-and-merge scheme into multiple smaller con-vex or near convex subﬁelds that are then simpler to drive or operateusing the best driving direction and best selection of sub ﬁelds. Straight driving lanes are assumed. In contrast, in the second algorithm the pathis planned on the basis of the machine's current state and the searchover a limited search horizon is on the next lanes instead of the nextsubﬁeld. Lanes are now permitted to be curved. Note that for both algo-rithms multiple different path patterns may result within the same ﬁ\", 'eld. Thus, in general, also multiple new headland paths must be generatedwithin theﬁeld in order to bound the different pattern regions, wherebysegments of headland paths coincide for neighbouring regions. Conse-quently, more transitions between interior lanes and headlands andmore compacted areas result. Thus, while partitioning of a ﬁeld into multiple subﬁelds may be inevitable for strongly non-convex ﬁeld shapes that demand very different driving behaviour, it also comes atac o s t .Hameed et al. (1086)computed optimal driving directions forstraight interior lanes based on the minimization of overlapped areausing a genetic algorithm, before optimal routing is determined basedon the minimization of the non-working distance. Freeform path plan-ning is not discussed. Results are evaluated on two obstacle-free testﬁelds.Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 233 –239', '⁎Corresponding author.E-mail address:mgplessen@gmail.com(M.

(2010)presented a method for automated generationof guidance lines for operationalﬁeld planning. A geometrical represen-tation of theﬁeld is constructed as a geometrical entity comprising dis-crete geometric primitives such as points, lines, and polygons. For theirgeneration of parallel lanes the concept of “longest edge”of theﬁeld or partitioned subﬁelds is crucial. It is selected to determine the driving di-rection. The curved edge is determined as a collection of sequentialstraight edges satisfying the criterion that the angle between two suc-cessive edges is less than or equal to a threshold. Complex ﬁeld shapes are partitioned into a number of simpler sub ﬁelds, typically convex polygons.Jin and Tang (2011)accounted for 3D terrain topography. Four crit-ical tasks were therefore addressed: terrain modeling and representa-tion, coverage cost analysis, terrain decomposition, and determining asuitable reference path such that by offsetting a lane pattern for fullﬁeld coverage is obtained. Field boundary segments and topographicterrain contour lines were considered as the two categories for refer-ence curve candidates. InGuo (2018)a similar study is discussed, where soil and water conservation is also considered for the design ofreference curves. InSpekken et al. (2016)3D terrain topograpgy is also examined. The objective was soil loss minimisation for sugarcaneproduction. Therefore,“hybrid”curves were proposed as referencepaths. These are generated by continuously offsetting multiple ﬁeld contour segments towards each other until the hybrid curve is formedas their intersection points. While corresponding results were foundto be beneﬁcial, a disadvantage of this method is that the shape of thehybrid curve does not follow any particular segment of the ﬁeld contour such that realisation in practice is difﬁcult due to lack of nature-given vi-sual reference landmarks.Once lanes areﬁtted withinﬁeld contours available methods fromthe literature can be employed for the two other aforementioned hier-archical planning layers (routing algorithms for traversal of lanes andtrajectory planning forﬁnal path smoothing) including, for example,Jensen et al., 2015,Bochtis et al., 2013,Hameed et al., 2016,Yu et al., 2015,Spekken et al., 2015,Seyyedhasani and Dvorak, 2018,Plessen, 2018,Paraforos et al., 2018andBackman et al., 2012. Consider also Plessen, 2019for the coupling of crop assignment and and vehiclerouting.To summarise, given UTM-coordinates of a ﬁeld contour and of all its in-', 'ﬁeld obstacles, theﬁrst step is toﬁt interior lanes. Because of beingthe primary step laneﬁtting presents the foundation for all upstream lo-gistical optimisation layers on top, including routing, trajectory plan-ning and even multi-robot coordination. This underlines theimportance of laneﬁtting. Furthermore, as satellite pictures show, thevast majority ofﬁelds in practice isﬁtted with straight lanes. Obviously,straights are attractive due to their simplicity and absence of turning. Onthe other hand, almost allﬁelds are irregularly and very often even(strongly) non-convexly shaped. In view of this discrepancy the re-search question arises whether freeform path ﬁtting may yet beunderestimated for improved agricultural in- ﬁeld operations and merit more studying. This argument is supported particularly by thefact that straights can be considered as just a subset of the more generalclass of freeform paths. It is therefore expected that freeform paths canproduce improved or at least equally good solutions for a variety ofoptimisation objectives.Within this context the motivation and contribution of this paper isto discuss the potential of freeform pathﬁtting for the minimisation of the number of transitions between headland path and interior laneswithin agriculturalﬁelds. As a proxy therefore, the number of interiorlanes is minimised. This is achieved by optimised freeform ﬁtting of in- terior lanes to arbitrarily non-convexly shaped ﬁeld areas, that also may include obstacle areas. While freeformﬁtting of interior lanes is not new and sometimes in practice even performed intuitively by farmers,e.g., on wavy or curvedly shapedﬁelds, the outcome of a quantitativecomparison with respect to optimal straights ﬁtting and explicit evalu- ation of the number of interior lanes that can be saved in real-world sce-narios is not obvious.The remaining paper is organised as follows: problem modeling andproposed solution, numerical results and the conclusion are describedin Sections2–4.2.

SeeFigs. 3and4for real- world visualisation on satellite images and problem motivation.Problem input are location data of the ﬁeld contourand all available obstacle contours.I naﬁrst step, theﬁeld contour is eroded to generatetheheadland path. Similarly, obstacle contours are dilated to constructobstacle headland paths. In a second step, areference pathis selected as a partial segment of the headland path. In a third step, this referenceis offset to generate a grid ofinterior lanesﬁtted withinﬁeld contours with inter-lane distance selected as the machinery operating width w.

In ﬁnal evalua- tion experiments it is setw¼36m andε= 99%, which implies a spatial interpolation grid of at least 5 m along headland and obstacle headlandpaths and 10m along interior lanes. Note that when collecting ﬁeld and obstacle contour data points from real-world ﬁelds, these typically are already recorded to be sufﬁciently well shape-deﬁning. Therefore, interpolation points along theﬁeld and obstacle contours are hereadded spatially only for improved constraint checking. The ﬁeld and obstacle shape as deﬁned by originally recorded contour data is notaltered.A pruned point does not abort interior lanes construction. It merely ﬁl- ters out some location points. In contrast, any constraint violation resultsin the dismissal of the entire corresponding reference path candidate. Be-fore discussing constraints in detail, two more implementation details aretherefore described. First, the last point of any interior lane is linearly ex-trapolated (leveraging the penultimate point for the direction) to obtainthe intersection with the headland path. Second, after ﬁtting of any inte- rior lane its coordinates are extended by above discussed spatial interpo-lation technique with spacing according to Eq. (2). Constraints are discussed. First, any crossings of any two interiorlanes are prohibited. Second, too tight turns (expressed as the changeof directions between two adjacent lane segments) are not admittedsuch that candidates withjθ', 'ðiÞkþ1−θðiÞkj>Δθ max; ð3Þfor anyk¼1,...,jfθ', 'ðiÞkgj−1,∀i¼1,...,N lare dismissed. In experi- ments the threshold was set toΔθ', 'max= 135°. This somewhat aggressive choice is here motivated to determine a conservative upperbound on the saving potential of freeform path ﬁtting.

As illustrated, the transitions between headland path and inter ior lanes can be“messy”in the sense that these often cause an increased amount of compacted ﬁeld areas due to crossings of tyre traces. This motivates the minimisation of such transitions, and therefore to minimise the number of interior lanes as a proxy.M.

For example, for spraying applications on ﬁelds growing cereals or rapeseed in central Europe it is often w¼36m orw¼24m. To sum up, for the proposed method three hyperparameters occur: ε∈[0, 1], Δθ', 'max∈[0,π]a n dΔk> 0. For the latter a lower bound can bedetermined asΔk>', 'wd. Then all three hyperparameters are lowerbounded. The choice ofε= 99% as discussed above is reasonable foran accurate interpolation grid. To account for two operating widthsone may heuristically selectΔk≍⌈', '2wd⌉. Then, only one shaping hyperparameter,Δθ', 'max∈[0,π], remains.As a proxy for the task of minimising the number of transitions be-tween headland path and interior lanes the minimisation of the numberof interior lanes,N', 'l, is selected as the optimisation criterion. This is validsince for everyﬁeld run every interior lane must typically be coveredexactlyonce, thus requiring exactly one entrance and one exittransition from and to the headland path, respectively.Before discussing data-dependent results for 10 real-world ﬁelds, the comparative method ofﬁttingstraightsas interior lanes is reconsidered.Remark 1.The method ofﬁtting straights as interior lanes can, in gen-eral, be regarded as a special case of freeform path ﬁtting. Instead of selecting a reference path deﬁned by a segment ormultiplesequential location data points along the headland path for the latter scenario, itis deﬁned by onlytwopoints for the former case for the generation ofstraight interior lanes. For rectangularﬁeld shapes this method is opti- mal. However, for the general case of arbitrarily shaped ﬁelds optimality of straight interior lanes is not guaranteed. Since the problem class ofstraightsﬁtting is included as a subset in the problem class of freeformpathﬁtting, the latter will always be at least as good as the former forany objective, including, e.g., minimisation of total accumulated pathlength of interior lanes or total travel time along interior lanes. The crit-ical disadvantage of freeform pathﬁtting is the requirement of at leastone shaping hyperparameter to constrain desired turning or curvaturesof resulting paths. In contrast, for straights ﬁtting no such shaping hyperparameter is required. Instead, it must solely be accounted forthe physical machine operating width.3. Numerical results and discussionThe potential of minimising the number of interior lanes by freeformpathﬁtting is evaluated on a variety of 10 real-world ﬁelds, and com- pared to the more common technique of ﬁtting straight interior lanes. For the latter solution, the orientation of straights is also optimised tominimise the number of interior lanes N', 'l.', 'Fig. 4.For very tight angles between headland path and interior lanes undesired hairpin turns may become necessary due to the limited agility of in- ﬁeld operating tractors. The more transitions between headland path and interior lanes the higher also the probability that such turns may occur, in particular, for complex ﬁelds. This provides the second motivation for the minimisation of the number of interior lanes by freeform path ﬁtting.', 'Fig. 5.Derivation of spatial interpolation distance d>0 .Table 1Data source: latitude and longitude locations of 10 real-world ﬁelds.Field Latitude Longitude1 53.59770954380925 11.881279091526012 53.61823042559124 11.149532041624113 53.72742495969927 11.663648032359824 54.18747037363151 10.364523032048245 53.57461963247646 11.00426334689726 53.61806582717429 11.156107916411777 54.19332379320142 10.435628002562278 53.69782126551283 11.712642840088499 53.77552865867575 11.1866795576743710 54.28618542958617 10.37204982106118M.

Note that for allﬁelds a large operating width ofw¼36 m is con- sidered. For smaller operating widths savings scale linearly.Second, while in some scenarios the optimised freeform path plan-ning is intuitive such as for Field 8, it is surprising in other cases suchas for Field 4. There are also subtle details about the exact optimal lengthof reference paths. In general, it therefore seems to be dif ﬁcult to devise a reliable rule of thumb to select optimal reference paths. Thus, for gen-eralﬁeld shapes it clearly is best to turn to a data-dependent numericaloptimisation method such as the proposed algorithm.Third, the comparative method ofﬁtting straights as interior lanes is discussed in more detail. For implementation simplicity it is in generaldesired to align straights to an approximately straight and typicallyalso the longest segment of theﬁeld contour. For Field 1,Fig. 7illustrates the resulting number of interior lanes N', 'las a function of the rotation angle of interior lanes, whereby 0', '∘implies a vertical or y-axis aligned in-terior lane. The minimising solution is obtained for N', 'l=1 4a n di s displayed inFig. 6. When straight interior lanes were rotated by anadditional 90', '∘to obtain alignment with theﬁeld contour in the north east,N', 'l= 17 resulted. Then, savings for freeform path ﬁtting would amount to−4 lanes and−24%. This underlines the importance ofcareful selection of the orientation for straight interior lanes. To stressthis more, when performing the grid search for Field 3 a range of N', 'l∈ [13, 33] resulted, i.e., with possible variation of ±20 interior lanes. Fi-nally, a detail with respect toFig. 7is discussed. The lack of exact sym-metry, for example, visible for rotation angles 40 –120', '∘and 220–300∘, is explained by the fact that theﬁrst interior lane is offset by distance wfrom the headland path in the rotated coordinate system. Conse-quently, a residual distance results at the last othogonal interior lanewith respect to the headland path. Since the ﬁeld shape is not perfectly symmetric for Field 1, the resulting function in Fig. 7is also not exactly repeating with a phase-shift of 180', \"∘.Fourth, as already pointed out inRemark 1, the strength of freeform pathﬁtting is itsﬂexibility in that it may (i) be used as a technique toalso optimisealternativeobjectives besides the number of interiorlanes or to optimise a weighted trade-off among different criteria, and(ii) that solutions can easily be constrained to limit the desired amountof steering and to tailor results to the vehicle's agility capabilities. In par-ticular, forΔθmax= 0 in Eq.(3)the solution ofﬁtting straights as interior lanes, i.e., theleast-steeringsolution, is recovered.Ultimately, after havingﬁtted interior lanes withinﬁeld contours one can on top (i) determineﬁeld coverage path plans, e.g., accordingto the methods inPlessen (2018)andPlessen (2019), before (ii) smoothing out trajectories by accounting for actuation constraints ofthe in-ﬁeld operating vehicle, for example, according to the controlmethods inBackman et al. (2012)orPlessen and Bemporad (2017). The most obvious disadvantage of freeform path ﬁtting is the in- creased amount of steering that is needed along interior lanes. However,this is largely relevant only as long as there is a human vehicle driver.Currrently, such a driver would have to apply signi ﬁcantly increased ef- fort for freeform path tracking. However, for an envisioned future withfully automated roboticﬁeld coverage this disadvantage is dismissed.Because of path-ﬁtting being the foundation for all upstream logisti-cal optimization layers on top (including routing, trajectory planningand even multi-robot coordination) the subject of this research is crucialfor the overall optimization of agricultural in- ﬁeld work.4. ConclusionThis paper contributed to the task of in-ﬁeld path planning within agriculturalﬁelds by proposing a freeform pathﬁtting method for the minimisation of the number of transitions between headland path andinterior lanes. Therefore, as a proxy the minimisation of the number ofinterior lanes was selected as optimisation criterion. Spatial interpola-tion distances for pruning during the generation of interior lanes andconstraints for the shaping of freeform paths were discussed. The poten-tial of minimising the number of interior lanes by freeform path ﬁtting was evaluated on 10 real-worldﬁelds and compared to the more com-mon technique ofﬁtting straight interior lanes. Field sizes varied be-tween 10.3 ha and 62.9 ha with some including in- ﬁeld obstacle areas. For an operating width of 36 m optimal straights ﬁtting resulted in a range of between 9 to 39 interior lanes. In comparison, freeform pathﬁtting resulted in savings in the range of−1l a n et o−9 lanes or, perentage-wise speaking, in a reduction of the number of interiorlanes by−7% to−67%.This paper focused on the very clear to quantify number of interiorlanes as the optimisation criterion, which served as a proxy for theminimisation of the number of transitions between headland path andinterior lanes. For future work an alternative objective such as thetotal accumulated path length along interior lanes may be considered.Then, ideally three consecutive layers are evaluated for determiningthe optimal grid of interior lanesﬁtted withinﬁeld contours. These\", 'three layers represent (i) selecting a reference path candidate as partialsegment of the headland path and generating a corresponding grid ofinterior lanes as discussed in this paper, (ii) determining a routing solu-tion for the coverage of all lane segments, before (iii) generatingsmoothed out trajectories accounting for agility and actuation con-straints of the in-ﬁeld operating vehicle, whereby theﬁnal detailed tra- jectory must also be planned such as to minimise spraying gaps.Similarly to as presented in this paper, it must then be iterated over ref-erence path candidates before the total path length minimising solutionis returned.Declaration of Competing InterestThe author declare no conﬂict of interests.References', 'Ahumada, O., Villalobos, J.R., 2009.

Chaos is a mo vement controlled by nonlinear dynamic system. Its regularity, ergodicity and intrinsic stochastic prope rties of chaotic motion and unpredictablity makes its popular in encrypting pictures. Encryption transfers and hides the information before transferring in order to improve safety during the process. The receivers can use encryption key to restore encrypted information. Information hiding technology uses the insensitivity of human beings and redundancy in multi-media digital signals to hide secret information so that it can be safely transferred. 2. DualChaotic systems 2.1 Logistic Chaotic system Logistic projection is a very simple yet widely researched chaotic model with the definition as follows ', ') 1 (1k kk x x x                                                                                   (1) Among which ', '4   0 is the branch parameter, ) 1 , 0 (0x , when  4  ..3.5699456., under the influence of Logistic projection with initial condition ', '0x,the chaotic sequence it produces is non-periodic, non-constringency and sensitivity to the initial value of the model of Logistic. Among chaotic systems, Logistic projection chaotic syst em is widely noticed because of its ergodicity and sensitivity to initial values. In formula (1),  ', ' is the coefficient, n is the number of iteration. When ', 'probability function distribution is ()x,    ', '() 1 / ( 1 ) ( 0 1 )xx x x                                                                    (2) which proves the ergodicity of formula (1) and the probability density function has nothing to do with the initial values. Thus it provides theory for projection function to scramble pictures. 2.2   Lorenz system  Lorenz system is a classic three-dimentional chaotic system. Its dynamic formular is :                                                      (3)               In which a,b,c are system parameters,the typ ical value are a=10,b=28,c=8/3,while a,c remain unchanged,when b>24.74 ,Lorenz system enters chaotic state. Numerical Integration can be used to solve the differential equations. The four-step Runge-Kutta is used to get the solution and the step size is 0.01. As a result, a numerical sequence is achieved at good ramdon. Lorenz system is a three-dimentional chaotic system, so the numerical sequence achieved is a three-dimention al real value array. The different ways of three chaotic encryption process undergoing single variable and multiv ariable make the designs of encryption sequences multiple. 3.

Encription picture hidden arithmetic based on DCT DCT is a picture orthogonal transformation in real  number field.  DCT can move the information in image to frequency domain, which takes advantage of the characteristics of human visual system and compacts the image while maitaining its quality. The DCT formula is as follows:                                                                               (4)   ', '1 , , 1 , 0 ; 1 , , 1 , 0N q M pthe reverse change DCT formula is as follows ', '1010', '2) 1 2 (cos2) 1 2 (cos) , ( ) ( ) () , (MpNq', 'Nq nMp mq p F q a p an m f                                           (5) ', '1 , , 1 , 0 ; 1 , , 1 , 0N n Mmin those two formulae,  () ,()ap aq is defined by  ', '. 1 , , 2 , 1 ,20,1) (MpMpMp a', ' . 1 , , 2 , 1 ,20,1) (NqNqNq a', '                             (6) First, divide the carrier picture into several segments with different pixels. Then transform each segment via DCT. Take frequence coefficient matrix sized 8*8 for  example. The value of the matirx reaches the maximum with coordinate (0,0). Which is called DC. The other 63 frequency coefficie nts mostly approaches the  positive or negative floating-point numbers', 'which are called AC.  DC represents the brightness of the segment. The larger the data are, the brighter the picture will be. The high frequency parts of AC shows the complex degree of the picture texture. The small high frequency value reflects the smooth zone in the picture while the big value shows the complex texture picture. In other words, most of the picture', 's energy is focused on DC and some high frequencyAC while other absolute values of AC are relatively small', 'the absolute values of most low and middle frequency coefficients approches 0[4,5]. So DC and some high frequency AC can be characteristic data of the segment. Divide the encripiton picture into pixel segment of the same size, 4*4 for example. Replace the 16 smallest coefficient in AC of in the carr ier picture segments with the information in encription picture. Then use DCT to get the reverse change and get the new picture embedded with encripted information.

To solve the problems, another way of embedding information  is offered. First, change the size of the carrier picture and make it the same size as the encripted p icture. Second, segment boththe carrierpicture and the encription picture by 8*8 at the same time. Third, tranform each segment of the carrier picture via DCT and keep only two decimal fractions of  the coefficient. Then ensure that each part is a realdecimal no bigger than 0.01, add it to the related part in DCT coefficient matr ix and finish the embedment of the data in encription picture. Last, transform the embedded data via DCT and get the carrier picture with encripted information. Fig. 4 gives the carrier picture with embedded information. Though there are slight differences in color, no mos aic effects appear and the visual effect is much better. Because the size of the segments are the same in encription picture and carrier picture, the arithmetic is much simplier than the privious one in the realization process.  In addition, the time is shorter in the simulation process with the former arithmetic 15.307s and the latter only 4.1099 s. 5.The extract and decoding of the hidden information in encription picture The process of extacting hidden information in encrip tion picture is the reverse operation of encripting information.Through the encription key, conversion code  encripting data can be easily gotten and encription picture can be restored through anti-scrambling data. Fig. 5 shows the restored picture.  ', 'Fig. 5 picture restored 6. Arithmetic effect measurement based on pixel Arithmetic effect measurement based on pixel is a quantitativen measurement which allows fair comparism among different arithmetics. Many distortion measures or quality measures dealing with visual information belong to difference distortion measures . Now the measure index in picture visual coding compression are Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) or Peak Sign al to Noise Ratio (PSNR) with dB as their unit. The SNR of the picture reflects the changes before and after the picture data are processed. It shows the statistical average of the change of the picture data.

', 'The most successful  multi-target  drugs to date have been kinase in- ', 'hibitors,  due to the important  role kinases  play in critical biological  ', 'pathways  such as cancer development  and progression.  Over the past ', 'decade,  several multi-kinase  inhibitors  emerged  from the drug discov- ', 'ery pipelines  into clinical  use [13] . As shown in Fig. 1 , twenty-eight  an- ', 'ticancer  drugs targeting  the human kinome  were approved  by the U.S. ', 'Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) between  2011 and 2021. These ap- ', 'proved drugs cope with the multifactorial  nature of cancer by simultane-  ', 'ously targeting  multiple  tyrosine  kinases.  For example,  the therapeutic  eﬃcacy  of regorafenib  (Stivarga®;  Bayer HealthCare  Pharmaceuticals,  ', 'Inc.) is partly due to its ability to inhibit 10 kinases  involved  in the ', 'regulation  of tumor angiogenesis  [angiopoietin-1  receptor  and vascu- ', 'lar endothelial  growth  factor receptors  (VEGFRs)  1, 2, and 3], mainte-  ', 'nance of the tumor microenvironment  [ﬁbroblast  growth  factor receptor  ', 'and platelet-derived  growth  factor receptor  (PDGFR)-  𝛽], and oncogen-  ', 'esis [serine/threonine  kinase protein  B-raf (BRAF),  Raf proto-oncogene  ', 'serine/threonine-protein  kinase, stem cell growth  factor receptor,  and ', 'proto-oncogene  tyrosine-protein  kinase receptor  Ret] [14–16]  .

Consequently,  mas- ', 'sive amounts  of data can be found in public domain  databases  of dif- ', 'ferent categories,  including:  bioactivity  databases  (PubChem  [22] and ', 'ChEMBL  [23] ); databases  for three-dimensional  structures  (RCSB Pro- ', 'tein Data Bank (PDB) [24] ); protein-protein  interaction  databases  ', '(STITCH  [25] and STRING  [25] ); pathway/genome  databases  (BRENDA  ', '[26] and BioCyc [27] ); chemical  toxicology  databases  (CompTox  ', '[28] and EFSA’s OpenFoodTox  database  [29] ); and clinical  databases  ', '(ClinicalTrials.gov  [30] and PharmaGKB  [31] ).

Machine  learning  methods  ', 'More than 50 years ago, classical  quantitative  structure-activity  rela- ', 'tionship  (QSAR)  modeling  started using linear models such as linear re- ', 'gression  and k -nearest  neighbors  to make predictions  of chemical  prop- ', 'erties [42–44]  .

DTs consists  of a group of rules that enable establish  ', 'between  molecular  features  (represented  as molecular  descriptors)  and ', 'the activity  of the compounds  [ 47 , 48 ]. ', 'DTs are tree-shaped,  presenting  a root node at the top, where the ', 'data is divided  into branches.  These branches  will continue  to divide ', 'into gradually  smaller  subsets until an outcome  (represented  as a leaf ', 'node) is reached  [ 17 , 49 ]. DTs are simple to interpret  and validate  and ', 'ﬂexible  enough  to deal with numerical  and categorical  inputs and mul- ', 'ticlass problems  [ 17 , 50 , 51 ]. The disadvantages  of DTs include  the loss ', 'of performance  in noisy or incomplete  data, and the sensitivity  to high ', 'variance  data (i.e., small changes  can result in diﬀerent  data splits and ', 'propagation  of errors) [ 49 , 52 ]. An approach  to alleviating  the bias and ', 'variance  problem  is the use of an ensemble  of DTs [53] . In this sense, ', 'one of the most widely used and best-performing  ensemble  algorithms  ', 'is RF ( Fig. 2 a) [ 54 , 55 ]. RF comprises  an ensemble  of individual  DTs ', 'constructed  using diﬀerent  subsets obtained  from the training  data with ', 'replacement  [56] . Thereafter,  predictions  for unseen data are obtained  ', 'via majority  voting (classiﬁcation)  or predictions  (regression)  of the in- ', 'dividual  trees. ', 'Another  non-linear  ML method  is the SVM algorithm  developed  ', 'by Vapnik and coworkers  [ 57 , 58 ]. SVM is a supervised  ML algorithm  ', 'able to perform  regression  and classiﬁcation  tasks for compound  prop- ', 'erty/activity  predictions  [48] . As shown in Fig. 2 b, SVM transforms  the ', 'original  molecular  descriptors  space into a high-dimensional  feature ', 'Fig. 2. Classiﬁcation  process based on the (a) Random  Forest and (b) Support ', 'Vector Machines.  ', 'space, where samples  can be linearly  separable  [49] . This mapping  is ', 'achieved  through  the use of a kernel function,  (e.g., polynomial,  linear, ', 'sigmoid,  or radial basis) [59] . Then, a hyperplane  that best separates  the ', 'diﬀerent  classes of compounds  (e.g., active/inactive)  is generated  via ', 'the deﬁnition  of the larger margins  (support  hyperplanes)  traced using ', 'the nearest  data points of each class (support  vectors)  [ 17 , 45 , 49 ]. Thus, ', 'unseen compounds  are also mapped  into this high-dimensional  feature ', 'space and classiﬁed  according  to the side of the boundary  where they lie ', '[45] . SVM is one of the best-performing  algorithms  for the prediction  of ', 'chemical  and biological  properties  thanks to its ability to deal with com- ', 'plex, non-linear,  high-dimensional,  and noisy problems  [ 45 , 48 , 54 , 60 ]. ', 'However,  depending  on the size of the dataset,  feature space, and kernel, ', 'SVMs can be computationally  expensive  [49] . ', 'Blaschke  and coworkers  [61] developed  SVM, RF, Feedforward  Deep ', 'Neural Networks  (FNNs, see section 5), and Graph Convolution  Neu- ', 'ral Networks  (GCNNs)  to identify  promiscuous  and non-promiscuous  ', 'compounds  based on screening  assays and kinase inhibitors  data re- ', 'trieved from several data sources  such as PubChem.  Then, the com- ', 'pounds  were divided  into classes using a promiscuity  diﬀerence  (PD) cri- ', 'terion, where compounds  active in one target or compounds  consistently  ', 'inactive  (screening  molecules:  PD = 1 and PD = 0, respectively)  were ', 'considered  non-promiscuous  while compounds  with activity  against  10 ', 'or more targets (PD ≥ 10) were considered  promiscuous.  For the SMV, ', 'RF, and DNN models,  compounds  were represented  using the extended  ', 'connectivity  ﬁngerprints  with a diameter  of 4 interactions  (ECFP4)  and ', 'represented  as chemical  graphs for GCNNs.  In general,  all models were ', 'predictive,  with an overall accuracy  around 70%, and diﬀerences  be- ', 'tween the ML approaches  were minimal.  In another  study, Heikamp  and ', 'Bajorath  [62] investigated  a multi-label  prediction  model (i.e., mod- ', 'els able to address  more than two classes)  with compounds  present-  ', 'ing activity  against  distinct  combinations  of targets using SVM models.  ', 'First, compound  datasets  with single-,  dual-, and triple-target  activity  to- ', 'gether with inactive  compounds  were retrieved  from PubChem  database  ', '[63] for three cytochrome  P450 isoforms  and three diﬀerent  dehydro-  ', 'genases.  All Compounds  were represented  using the ECFP4;  however,  ', 'the generated  standard  SVM models were not able to distinguish  com- ', 'pounds  with overlapping  yet distinct  activity  proﬁles.  Then, the authors  ', 'developed  an SVM linear combination  approach  through  the weighting  ', '3 J.T. Moreira-Filho, M.F.B. da Silva, J.V.V.B. Borba et al.

Consequently,  ', 'reﬁned models eﬃciently  distinguished  between  compounds  with over- ', 'lapping  activity  proﬁles.  ', 'In recent decades,  proteochemometric  modeling  (PCM) has emerged  ', 'as a suitable  technique  for discovering  multi-target  drugs [ 64 , 65 ]. PCM ', 'is a computational  chemogenomic  approach  that draws heavily  on re- ', 'cent ML developments.  The PCM models can be trained  on datasets  ', 'composed  of a series of compounds  and protein  targets or binding  pock- ', 'ets (i.e., to allow distinction  between  allosteric/orthosteric  binding  and ', 'binding  modes),  where ideally,  compounds  have been measured  on as ', 'many targets as possible  [64] . The simultaneous  modeling  of the ligand ', 'descriptor  (e.g., Hashed  ﬁngerprints,  circular  ﬁngerprints,  MACCS  keys, ', 'atom counts)  and target descriptor  (e.g., Atom-type  based, Z-scales,  se- ', 'quence descriptors)  spaces and cross-term  descriptors  (i.e., an additional  ', 'class of descriptors  that multiplies  ligand and target descriptors)  allows ', 'the researcher  to understand  better complex  drug–target  interactions  ', '(e.g., multi-target  proﬁle)  as the inﬂuence  of target variability  on com- ', 'pound activity  can be evaluated  [64] . ', '3. The rise of deep learning  ', 'The term “Deep Learning  (DL) ”refers  to a growing  ﬁeld of ML that ', 'uses Artiﬁcial  Neural Networks  (ANNs)  composed  of multiple  hidden ', 'layers, also called Deep Neural Networks  (DNNs),  for learning  data rep- ', 'resentations.  The structure  of these DNNs mimics  the operations  of neu- ', 'rons found in the cerebral  cortex to learn from feature representations  ', 'of data with multiple  levels of abstraction  [66–68]  . Much of the exten- ', 'sive popularization  of DL is related to cloud computing  [69] and the ', 'availability  of new hardware  technologies,  such as graphical  processing  ', 'units (GPUs) [70] and tensor processing  units (TPUs) [71] , that allowed  ', 'researchers  to train networks  up to 35 times faster. Importantly,  the ', 'main advantage  of DL is the ability to learn complex  features  from mas- ', 'sive volumes  of data. Fig. 3 a shows the comparison  between  DL and ML ', 'performance  as the training  data size increases.  For smaller  datasets,  ML ', 'algorithms  usually  show better performance  as compared  to DL [ 72 , 73 ]. ', 'On the other hand, when the amount  of data increases,  the performance  ', 'of ML methods  reaches  a saturation  point and does not improve  any fur- ', 'ther, whereas  the performance  of DL keeps increasing  [72] . For instance,  ', 'recently,  Mayr et al. [74] showed  that DNN-based  architectures  trained  ', 'using a large-scale  drug discovery  dataset signiﬁcantly  outperformed  all ', 'competing  classical  ML methods  (KNN, SVM, Random  Forest, and Naive ', 'Bayes).  However,  the superior  performance  of DL over ML models has ', 'not been consistently  observed  in applications  using datasets  of diﬀer- ', 'ent origins and compositions  [ 75 , 76 ]. Kato et al. [76] suggest  that the ', 'performance  of DL and ML models may be impacted  by the insuﬃcient  ', 'level of molecular  feature representations  to predict complex  biological  ', 'mechanisms  observed  in molecular  activity  measurements  [76] . In ad- ', 'dition, alternative  data splitting  strategies  and the resulting  test systems  ', '(hyperparameters)  can inﬂuence  the relative  performance  of models,  es- ', 'pecially  for the most challenging  compound  datasets  [ 75 , 77 ]. ', 'The fully connected  feedforward  neural network  (FNN) was the ﬁrst ', 'and simplest  type of DNN devised.  A typical FNN contains  many artiﬁ- ', 'cial neurons  arranged  in three types of layers ( Fig. 3 b) [78] : ', '• Input layer: accepts  the input data and passes it to the ﬁrst hidden ', 'layer; ', '• Hidden  layers: located  between  the input and output of the algo- ', 'rithm. The hidden layers perform  non-linear  transformations  on the ', 'input data that will produce  a predicted  output that is close enough  ', 'to the expected  output;  ', '• Output layer: is mostly responsible  for production  output predic- ', 'tions. ', 'The network  is composed  of an interconnected  system of perceptrons  ', 'that act as basic information-processing  units. Fig. 3 c displays  a percep-  ', 'tron in more detail. The perceptron  algorithm  consists  of four parts: (i) ', 'input values, (ii) weights  and a bias, (iii) a weighted  sum, and (iv) an activation  function.  The inputs can either come from the input layer or ', 'perceptrons  in a previous  hidden layer [ 79 , 80 ]. ', 'The perceptron’s  operation  consists  of a function  that multiplies  in- ', 'put values by corresponding  weights  and adds a bias. The bias term is ', 'an adjustable  term added to a perceptron’s  sum of inputs and weights,  ', 'and it serves as another  model parameter  [79] . The weights  are initial- ', 'ized with random  values at the beginning  of the input layer. Then, all ', 'of these multiplied  values are added together  to create the weighted  ', 'sum. The weighted  sum is then applied  to an activation  function  that ', 'passes through  the activation  function,  which can add a non-linear  com- ', 'ponent or assign linearization  to the network.  Finally,  the output from ', 'the activation  function  moves to the next layer. This forward  movement  ', 'is known as “forward  propagation  ”[79] . Mathematically,  the output ', 'value ( 𝑌 𝑖 ) is a non-linear  weighted  sum of input signals of a neuron i . ', 'The 𝑌 𝑖 can be calculated  as shown in Eq. (1) : ', '𝑌 𝑖 = 𝑔 ( ', '∑', '𝑗 𝑊 𝑖𝑗 ∗ 𝑎 𝑗 ) ', '(1) ', 'where a j refers to the input features,  W ij is the weight of input neuron j ', 'on neuron i , and g is the activation  function.  ', 'The ﬁrst perceptron  model was created  for simple classiﬁcation,  con- ', 'sidering  a linear classiﬁer  capable  of predicting  binary outputs.  How- ', 'ever, most computational  problems  need a classiﬁer  able to model non- ', 'linear, separable  data. Consequently,  several non-linear  activation  func- ', 'tions emerged  to identify  more complex  features  in the data. Well- ', 'known activation  functions  ( Fig. 3 d) in the ﬁeld of cheminformatics  ', 'include  the Sigmoid,  Hyperbolic  Tangent  (TanH),  Rectiﬁed  Linear Unit ', '(ReLU),  Leaky Rectiﬁed  Linear Unit (Leaky ReLU), and Exponential  Lin- ', 'ear Unit (ELU). The correct choice of an activation  function  should con- ', 'sider the type of input feature,  as well as the architecture  and complex-  ', 'ity of the DNN. For instance,  the Sigmoid  and TanH activation  functions  ', 'cannot be used in DNNs with many layers due to the vanishing  gradi- ', 'ent problem  (i.e., unstable  behavior  encountered  during the training  of ', 'a DNN). The gradient-based  learning  methods  by backpropagation  re- ', 'ceives an update weight from each of the neural network  and then the ', 'error function  with respect to the current  weight.  The problem  is that in ', 'some cases, the gradient  is vanishingly  small, eﬀectively  preventing  the ', 'weight from changing  value. On the other hand, the weight can receive  ', 'updated  values that culminate  in a convergence  of very high values, thus ', 'causing  exploding  gradient  problem.  ', 'At present,  ReLU is the most popular  activation  function,  since it ', 'typically  overcomes  the vanishing  gradient  problem  [81] . ReLU outputs  ', 'the input directly  if it is positive;  otherwise,  it will output zero. ReLU has ', 'become  the gold standard  activation  function  for many types of DNNs ', 'because  models that use it are easier to train and often achieves  better ', 'performance  [82] . ', 'For any type of problem,  the DNN architecture  needs to be speciﬁed  ', 'before training.  Untrained  DNNs are created  as \"ignorant\"  systems,  and ', 'it is only through  exposure  to the data, that their ignorance  slowly de- ', 'creases.  The main way to measure  such learning  is by monitoring  the ', 'error produced  by the network  each time it makes a prediction.  Mech- ', 'anistically,  the signal of the input data moves forward  through  the pre- ', 'speciﬁed  network  towards  the output layer and then backpropagates  in- ', 'formation  about the error measured  with a loss function,  at which point ', 'the neuron connection  weights  are updated  [83] . The propagation  and ', 'backpropagation  ( Fig. 3 e) are repeated  several times, according  to the ', 'speciﬁed  number  of epochs,  a hyperparameter  that deﬁnes the number  ', 'of times (i.e., interactions)  the error will backpropagate  through  the net- ', 'work [84] . An epoch is made up of one or more batches,  where a part ', 'of the dataset is used to train the neural network.  Therefore,  to train ', 'a DNN is to maximize  an objective  function  by optimizing  the weights  ', 'and biases of each neuron [ 67 , 83 ]. ', 'Another  characteristic  of DNNs is that they have ﬂexible  architec-  ', 'tures. The most popular  architectures  are FNNs [85] , Recurrent  Neural ', 'Networks  (RNNs)  [85] , and Graph Neural Networks  (GNNs)  [ 86 , 87 ]. ', '4 J.T. Moreira-Filho, M.F.B. da Silva, J.V.V.B.

', 'Each architecture  has advantages  and disadvantages,  which are related ', 'to the type of feature being modeled.  ', 'The fully connected  FNN ( Fig. 3 b) is the most common  architecture  ', 'of DNNs. In this network,  the information  moves in a single direction,  ', 'from the input layer to the output layer, without  loops or backward  con- ', 'nections  [85] . Already,  the RNNs were designed  to identify  patterns  in ', 'sequential  data, such as Simpliﬁed  Molecular  Input Line Entry Speci- ﬁcation  (SMILES)  strings.

In view of this, ', 'SELF-referencing  Embedded  Strings (SELFIES)  have been suggested  as a ', 'chemically  more intuitive  alternative,  as every combination  of symbols  ', 'in its alphabet  maps to a chemically  valid graph [88] . The RNN archi- ', 'tecture ( Fig. 4 a) has three types of layers: the input layer X 0 , the hidden ', '5 J.T. Moreira-Filho, M.F.B. da Silva, J.V.V.B. Borba et al.

', 'layer A (recurrent  state), and the output layer h 0 . If the hidden layer ', 'loop is unfolded,  the default RNNs copy the same structure  multiple  ', 'times, and the “state vector ”A (memory)  of each copy is taken as input ', 'to its successor  [85] . Thus, RNNs are a memory-gated  architecture:  they ', 'allow the evaluation  of new inputs through  persistent  information  from ', 'previous  states, meaning  that the same input could produce  a diﬀerent  ', 'output depending  on previous  inputs in the series [102] . However,  a ', 'default RNN ( Fig. 4 b) is unable to capture  temporal  dependencies  that ', 'extend to more than a limited number  of time steps (long-term  depen- ', 'dencies).  Therefore,  Long-Short-Term  Memory  (LSTM)  [89] and Gated ', 'Recurrent  Unit (GRU) [90] networks  speciﬁcally  address  this limitation.  ', 'Compared  to the default RNN ( Fig. 4 b), the cell state of LSTM ', '( Fig. 4 c) architecture,  introduced  by Hochreiter  and Schmidhuber  [89] , ', 'oﬀers a solution  for vanishing/exploding  gradients  by preserving  and ', 'learning  long-term  dependencies  in data. As shown in Fig. 4 c, LSTM ', 'uses three gates to control a cell state ( 𝐶 𝑡 ): (i) forget gate, (ii) input gate, ', 'and (iii) output gate. The forget gate decides  which information  needs ', 'attention  and which can be ignored.  The information  from the current  ', 'input ( 𝑋 𝑡 ) and previous  hidden state ( ℎ 𝑡 −1 ) is passed through  a Sigmoid  ', 'function.  This function  generates  values between  0 and 1, which are ', 'multiplied  by the previous  cell state ( 𝐶 𝑡 −1 ) [ 90 , 91 ]. The input gate then ', 'decides  what new information  can be stored in the cell state. This is ', 'usually  controlled  by a Sigmoid  function  that decides  which values will ', 'be updated  and a TanH operator  that creates a vector of new candidate  ', 'values (between  − 1 and 1). The output values generated  from these ac- ', 'tivation  functions  are point-by-point  multiplied  and then added to the ', 'cell state. Finally,  an output gate determines  the value of the next hid- ', 'den state ( ℎ 𝑡 ). In this step, the values of current  and previous  hidden ', 'states are passed into Sigmoid  and TanH functions.  Both these outputs  ', 'are multiplied  point-by-point.  Ultimately,  based upon the ﬁnal values, ', 'the network  decides  which information  the ℎ 𝑡 should carry [ 90 , 91 ]. ', 'The GRU [90] ( Fig. 4 d) was proposed  as variant of LSTM to support  ', 'gating and a hidden state to control the ﬂow of information.  When com- pared to LSTM network,  GRU uses only two gates: (i) update gate and ', '(ii) reset gate. The weights  from update and reset gate can be calculated  ', 'as shown in Eq. (2) : ', '𝑧 𝑡 = 𝜎( 𝑊 𝑧 ⋅[ℎ 𝑡 −1 , 𝑥 𝑡 ]+', ' 𝑏 𝑧 (2) ', 'where 𝑋 𝑡 refers to the input vector, W z is the weight matrix,  the ( 𝜎) is the ', 'sigmoid  function,  while the 𝑏 𝑧 e 𝑧 𝑡 are connection  bias and update gate, ', 'respectively.  The time step in ℎ 𝑡 −1 signiﬁes  that it holds the information  ', 'of the previous  unit and it’s multiplied  by its weight.  The summed  values ', 'are passed through  the sigmoid  function  ( 𝜎) with connection  bias at ', 'timestep  ( 𝑏 𝑧 ) . The update gate ( 𝑧 𝑡 ) is used to control how much of the ', 'new state is just a copy of the old state, i.e., the amount  of information  ', 'from ℎ 𝑡 −1 that needs to be passed along to the next state ℎ 𝑡 . In contrast,  ', 'the reset gate controls  how much of the ℎ 𝑡 −1 needs to be neglected  [92] . ', 'The GNNs can be categorized  into four groups:  (i) graph autoen-  ', 'coders, (ii) spatial-temporal  graph neural networks,  graph convolutional  ', 'neural networks  (GCNNs),  and recurrent  graph neural networks  (i.e., ', 'GAT: graph attention  network  [93] ; MPNN:  message  passing  neural net- ', 'work [94] ). The GCNNs  ( Fig. 4 e) are a very powerful  type of Convo- ', 'lutional  Neural Networks  (CNNs)  designed  to work directly  on graphs ', '[ 86 , 87 ]. Mechanistically,  convolution  is the most fundamental  opera- ', 'tion in GCNNs.  However,  the standard  convolution  operation  generally  ', 'used for processing  regular  grid-like  structures  (e.g., images)  in CNNs ', 'cannot be directly  applied  to graphs,  since the number  of node con- ', 'nections  may acquire  diﬀerent  shapes and sizes (non-Euclidean  vector ', 'space) [95–97]  . To solve this problem,  nodes from diﬀerent  graphs are ', 'assigned  into similar positions  if their feature representations  are re- ', 'lated. Given the selected  node sequence,  the neighborhood  is then as- ', 'sembled  for each node by minimizing  the expected  distance  between  ', 'two graphs in a ﬁxed-size  vector space [ 95 , 98 ]. The convolution  op- ', 'eration can be run at diﬀerent  levels by considering  the contribution  ', 'of neighboring  atoms. The vectors  generated  from convolutions  ﬁrst go ', 'through  a non-linear  transformation  and are then summed  to form a ', '6 J.T. Moreira-Filho, M.F.B. da Silva, J.V.V.B. Borba et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 3 (2023) 100055 ', 'neural ﬁngerprint  encoding  chemical  information.  Finally,  the neural ', 'ﬁngerprints  are passed through  another  fully connected  neural network  ', 'to generate  the ﬁnal output task [68] . ', 'Among  GCNN representations,  geometric  DL approaches  have been ', 'employed  for predicting  the binding  conformations  of ligands  to pro- ', 'tein targets.  Concretely,  the model learns based on distance  likelihood  ', 'which is tailor-made  for each ligand-target  pair. In the ﬁrst step, the ', 'neural network  extracts  a pool of mesh (i.e., collection  of nodes, edges, ', 'and faces) which deﬁnes the shapes of the molecular  surfaces  of bind- ', 'ing sites. In a similar way, ligands  are represented  as a two-dimensional  ', 'undirected  graph, where atoms and bonds are represented  by nodes and ', 'edges, respectively.  Both the target mesh and the ligand graph are pro- ', 'cessed by independent  residual  GCNNs.  In the following  step, the pro- ', 'cessed features  from the protein  targets and ligands  are concatenated  ', 'using a mixture  density  network  to model the interaction  of the ligands  ', 'with the targets [99] . ', '3.1. Multi-task  learning  ', 'To tackle the challenges  of multi-target  drug design, numerous  ef- ', 'forts are being made in the DL ﬁeld to develop  multi-task  models.  Multi- ', 'task learning  (MTL) is an inductive  transfer  approach  in which multiple  ', 'tasks (e.g., targets)  are simultaneously  learned  by a shared model. Such ', 'an approach  is particularly  interesting  since MTL-DNNs  can explore  rep- ', 'resentations  learned  across diﬀerent  tasks and boost the performance  of ', 'tasks with fewer training  examples  [ 100 , 101 ]. Previous  studies suggest  ', 'that MTL can oﬀer a strong improvement  in predictive  performance  over ', 'single-task  methods  [102] . According  to Rodríguez  Pérez and Bajorath  ', '[75] , MTL models provided  incremental  advantages  for predicting  the ', 'most challenging  biological  properties.  When MTL models were evalu- ', 'ated on tasks that share chemical  information,  the obtained  results were ', 'generally  superior  to single-task  learning  (STL) models.  In cases where ', 'STL model accuracy  was limited,  the largest relative  performance  gains ', 'of MTL models were observed  [75] . ', 'There are several approaches  for optimizing  and calibrating  MTL ', 'models.  Existing  works often focus on developing  aggregated  loss func- ', 'tions adapted  to sparse data as a way to learn multiple  tasks at once. ', 'Diﬀerent  loss weighing  mechanisms  may be used to aid MTL optimiza-  ', 'tion, such as adding weights  to the individual  loss functions  to prevent  ', 'a task with more data from dominating  the optimization  [103] . ', 'Most existing  MTL models are based on sharing  parameters  across ', 'hidden layers. The parameter-sharing  mechanisms  in MTL are divided  ', 'into four categories:  (i) hard parameter  sharing  [104] , (ii) soft param- ', 'eter sharing  [104] , (iii) hierarchical  sharing  [ 105 , 106 ], and (iv) sparse ', 'sharing  [ 107 , 108 ]. In hard parameter  sharing,  the hidden layers of the ', 'neural network  are shared while keeping  some task-speciﬁc  output lay- ', 'ers. Sharing  most of the layers for the related tasks reduces  the chances  ', 'of overﬁtting,  but when tasks conﬂict,  the learning  is easily aﬀected  ', 'by negative  transferring,  which is harmful  to the model performance  ', '[104] . The soft parameter  sharing  mechanism  has independent  param- ', 'eters and subnet for each task, but their information  can be mutually  ', 'learned.  The approach  regularizes  the distance  between  the parameters  ', 'of the individual  subnets  to the overall training  objective  to encourage  ', 'similar model parameters  between  the diﬀerent  tasks [104] . The hier- ', 'archical  sharing  considers  the progressive  relationship  between  tasks, ', 'which means that a task may be a subtask  of another  one, thus placing  ', 'them on diﬀerent  network  layers [104–106]  . On the other hand, the hi- ', 'erarchical  sharing  mechanism  may be a complex  problem  that relies on ', 'prior knowledge  of task relations  [ 104 , 109 ]. The sparse sharing  mech- ', 'anism automatically  extracts  subnets  for each task based on the idea of ', 'the lottery ticket hypothesis.  The obtained  subnets  are overlapped  and ', 'trained  in parallel  [ 107 , 108 ]. ', 'The MTL modeling  is potentially  useful for designing  multi-kinase  ', 'inhibitors,  given that a considerable  number  of kinases  remains  poorly ', 'studied  and the labeled  compounds  for such targets are scarce. Conven-  ', 'tionally,  this limits the opportunities  for constructing  high-quality  pre- diction models and advancing  the understanding  of these drug targets.  ', 'To overcome  this issue, a MTL [ 110 , 111 ] was developed  to predict the ', 'kinome-wide  activity  proﬁles  of untested  compounds.  Initially,  the net- ', 'work was trained  with over 170,000  bioactivity  data points ( ∼32,000  ', 'chemical  structures  and of 391 kinases)  using ECFP4 ﬁngerprints  as in- ', 'puts [ 110 , 111 ]. Then, the trained  MTDNN  was implemented  to the pub- ', 'lic in the KinomeX  web app ( https://kinome.dddc.ac.cn  ) [110] . ', 'This app has an intuitive  user interface,  in which the user may draw ', 'a compound  of interest  or directly  submit the SMILES  string of a queried  ', 'chemical  structure  to prediction.  Given the veriﬁed  generalizability  of ', 'KinomeX,  Li and coworkers  [111] then performed  a comprehensive  in ', 'silico analysis  of diverse  compounds  with unknown  kinase activity  pro- ', 'ﬁles ( Fig. 5 a). Importantly,  the experimental  validation  of the predicted  ', 'spectrum  shows signiﬁcant  agreement  with the experimental  data, sug- ', 'gesting that KinomeX  can be used to discover  multi-target  kinase in- ', 'hibitors  [111] . ', '3.2. De novo design ', 'Computational  de novo design is an eﬃcient  approach  to create new ', 'molecular  structures  with desired  multi-target  proﬁles  at a very low cost ', 'and in a time-eﬃcient  manner.  The increase  in the use of DL for de ', 'novo design has motivated  the generation  of platforms  such as Molecular  ', 'Sets (MOSES)  [112] , REINVENT  v.2.0 [113] , and GuacaMol  [114] to ', 'evaluate  and compare  generative  approaches  in a standardized  way. The ', 'approach  aims to obtain compounds  with valid structures,  similar to ', 'known compounds  in terms of chemical  and biological  properties,  and ', 'structural  diversity  of scaﬀolds  and fragments.  ', 'Inspired  by this opportunity,  deep generative  modeling  techniques  ', 'have been used as emergent  de novo design approaches  in the early ', 'stages of drug discovery,  yielding  the autonomous  ability to which au- ', 'tomatically  design new multi-target  drug candidates  [115] . The devel- ', 'opment  of generative  models typically  involves  a two-step  process.  Ini- ', 'tially, a generative  network  is trained  to generate  syntactically  plausi- ', 'ble structures  using a benchmarking  dataset of representative  structures.  ', 'Then, the model is ﬁne-tuned  to generate  only compounds  with the de- ', 'sired properties.  Fine-tuning  of the generative  model is either carried out ', 'using transfer  or reinforcement  learning  ( Fig. 5 b) [ 116 , 117 ]. Whereas  ', 'early works used transfer  learning  to bias the generation  task by using a ', 'focused  dataset of compounds  with the desired  properties  [ 118 , 119 ], it ', 'is now common  to couple the generation  task to a reinforcement  learn- ', 'ing algorithm,  which uses a supervised  model to provide  property-based  ', 'feedback  to the generative  model [ 119 , 120 ]. By interactively  exposing  ', 'the generative  model to ﬁne-tuning,  it learns common  features  and then ', 'updates  its structural  outputs  to increasingly  meet desired  properties.  ', 'Recently,  Blaschke  and Bajorath  [119] developed  an approach  to create ', 'multi-target  compounds  by ﬁne- tuning REINVENT  [113] , an LSTM cell- ', 'based deep generative  network  [121] originally  pre-trained  with ∼1.4 ', 'million  bioactive  compounds  from ChEMBL  [122] . Initially,  the authors  ', 'compiled  a set of experimentally  conﬁrmed  no-target  (inactive),  single- ', 'target, and multi-target  compounds  in the SMILES  format.  Then, a ran- ', 'dom selection  of 1000 multi-target  compounds  was used to ﬁne-tuning  ', 'the REINVENT  generative  model via transfer  learning  ( Fig. 5 b). After ', 'ﬁne-tuning,  a decision  tree ensemble  classiﬁer  systematically  showed  ', 'a clear tendency  of the generative  model to create multi-target  com- ', 'pounds  (26.6%  of the newly generated  compounds),  while decreasing  ', 'the likelihood  of producing  single- or no-target  compounds.  Taken to- ', 'gether, these ﬁndings  indicate  that generative  models can be adopted  ', 'for de novo multi-target  compound  design [119] .

Among  these new compounds,  the high-ranking  com- ', 'pound 1 demonstrated  potent activity  against  D 2 (IC 50 = 0.216 μM), ', '5-HT 1A (IC 50 = 0.0005 μM), and 5-HT 2A (IC 50 = 0.001 μM) receptors  ', 'in biochemical  experiments.  The structural  optimization  of compound  1 ', 'based on the MTL-DNNs  also led to the discovery  of compound  2, which ', 'not only exhibited  a multi-target  proﬁle but also showed  a potent an- ', 'tipsychotic  eﬀect in mice (80% hyperactivity  reduction)  with low po- ', 'tential for catalepsy  and sedation  [123] . ', '3.2.1. Multi-objective  optimization  problems  ', 'The drug discovery  literature  is riddled  with MOO approaches  to ', 'address  multi-target  optimization  problems.  Despite  many of which are ', 'labeled  “multi-objective  ”, the line between  multi- and single-objective  ', 'molecular  optimization  is quite blurred  [ 124 , 125 ]. The MOO refers to ', 'ﬁnding  the optimal  solution  values of more than one desired  target. ', 'The motivation  for using the MOO is that optimization  requires  trivial ', 'equations,  which simpliﬁes  the problem  [125] . The equation  of the MOO ', 'problem  is deﬁned  as follows:  ', '𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∕ 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑓 1 ( 𝑥 ) , 𝑓 2 ( 𝑥 ) , ... 𝑓 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) ', 'subject to ∶ 𝑥 ∈𝑈 (2) ', 'where n is the number  of objective  functions,  U is feasible  set, x is so- ', 'lution, 𝑓 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) is the n th objective  function,  and min/max  is combined  ', 'object operations  [125] . ', 'A MOO task always begins with some statement  of desired  proper-  ', 'ties. First, the chemical  and biological  properties  must be converted  to ', 'mathematical  objectives.  If more than one objective  exists, they must ei- ', 'ther be treated with an appropriate  multi-objective  formulation  [124] . ', 'In this section,  we explore  two of these MOO formulations  in detail, ', 'namely  scalarization  and Pareto method.  An in-depth  discussion  of MOO ', 'methods  in drug discovery  is provided  by Former  and Coley [124] . ', 'The scalarization  method  reduces  the multi-objective  optimization  ', 'problem  into a single scalar vector function  as follows:  ', '𝐹 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑤 1 𝑓 1 ( 𝑥 ) + 𝑤 2 𝑓 2 ( 𝑥 ) + …+ 𝑤 𝑛 𝑓 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) (3) ', 'where n is the number  of objective  functions,  𝐹 ( 𝑥 ) is a combined  ﬁtness ', 'function,  x is a solution,  𝑓 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) is the n th objective  function,  and w is a ', 'constant  weight for 𝐹 ( 𝑥 ) [126] . The weight of an objective  function  will ', 'determine  the solution  of the ﬁtness function  and show the performance  ', 'priority.  For example,  if a large weight is given to an objective  function,  ', 'it will have priority  compared  to the ones with a smaller  weight [126] . ', 'In contrast  to scalarization,  the Pareto method  discovers  a set of so- ', 'lutions that reveal the trade-oﬀs  between  objectives  without  a choice ', 'of any weighting  factor of importance  for the competing  objectives  ', '[ 124 , 125 ]. The Pareto optimization  can be written  as follows:  ', '𝑓 1 ,𝑜𝑝𝑡 = min 𝑓 1 ( 𝑥 ) ', '𝑓 2 ,𝑜𝑝𝑡 = min 𝑓 2 ( 𝑥 ) ', '. ', '. ', '𝑓 𝑛,𝑜𝑝𝑡 = max 𝑓 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) (4) ', 'where n is the number  of objective  functions,  𝑓 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) is the n th objective  ', 'function,  x is a solution,  and min/max  is the threshold  of the n th objec- ', 'tive. Meanwhile,  the 𝑓 1 ,𝑜𝑝𝑡 e 𝑓 2 ,𝑜𝑝𝑡 are the ﬁrst two functions  of the set ', 'optimal  solution  space that minimize  the objective  functions  of 𝑓 1 and ', '𝑓 2 . Mathematically,  the Pareto optimization  keeps the elements  of the ', 'solution  vectors  independent  during optimization,  and the concept  of ', 'dominance  is there to diﬀerentiate  the non-dominated  and dominated  ', 'solutions.  The goodness  of a solution  is determined  by dominance.  A ', 'solution  is called non-dominated  if none of the objective  functions  can ', 'be improved  without  being detrimental  to at least one other objective.  ', 'The dominated  solution  is usually  achieved  when an objective  function  ', 'can be improved  without  reducing  the remaining  objective  functions  ', '[ 124 , 125 ]. ', 'In view of the above, Pareto optimization  is considered  the standard  ', 'gold MOO approach  for de novo design [124] . Despite  this, there is a lack of de novo design studies based on the Pareto front. Apparently,  the ', 'main example  in this ﬁeld is DrugEx  v.2.0, presented  by Liu et al. [127] . ', 'The work consists  of an LSTM cell-based  deep generative  network  and ', 'a pool of ML predictors  for estimating  the activity  towards  the targets ', '(A 1 AR and A 2A AR) and one anti-target  (hERG)  [127] . Both the gener- ', 'ative model and the predictors  were pre-trained  in advance  and then ', 'interplayed  under a reinforcement  learning  framework.  During the in- ', 'teraction  loop, the generative  model creates a batch of SMILES-based  ', 'molecules,  whereas  the scores provided  by the predictors  were used to ', 'construct  Pareto ranks of the generated  molecules  [127] . The ﬁnal re- ', 'ward of each SMILES  is calculated  based on the Pareto ranking  with the ', 'non-dominated  sorting genetic  algorithm  (NSGA-II)  [128] . At the end ', 'of this process,  the framework  was able to generate  a large percentage  ', 'of valid SMILES  with a predicted  selectivity  proﬁle towards  multiple  ', 'targets,  oﬀering  the potential  of high eﬃcacy  and low toxicity  [127] . ', '4. Biological  signature  proﬁles  ', 'Biological  signature  matching  is based on the comparison  of the ', 'unique characteristics  or “signature  ”o f a drug with that of another  ', 'compound,  disease,  or clinical  phenotype.  The biological  signature  of ', 'a drug could be derived  from at least ﬁve general  types of data: chemi- ', 'cal information,  OMICs (genomics,  proteomics,  metabolomics,  metage-  ', 'nomics,  and transcriptomics),  biological  pathways,  Cells/Organs,  and ', 'Clinics [129] . ', 'Duran-Frigola  and co-workers  [128] have presented  the Chemical  ', 'Checker,  a database  of these signatures  containing  ∼800,000  molecules  ', 'and their similarity  at diﬀerent  levels of biology.  Chemical  Checker  di- ', 'vides data into ﬁve levels of increasing  complexity.  The drug is often ', 'a compound  (chemistry)  that interacts  with one or several protein  re- ', 'ceptors  (targets),  triggering  perturbations  of biological  pathways  (net- ', 'works) and eliciting  phenotypic,  cell-based  assays (cells), which can ', 'then be translated  into their clinical  outcomes  (clinics).  The authors  ', 'showed  that these signatures  can aid drug discovery  tasks, including  ', 'target identiﬁcation  and library characterization.  ', 'Finding  new molecules  with a desired  biological  activity  is a labori- ', 'ous task. At the beginning  of the SARS-CoV-2  outbreak  [130] , in an open ', 'collaboration  to ﬁnd “old drugs ”against  SARS-CoV-2  we employed  the ', 'PHAARM  MatchMaker®InsilicAll’s  software,  which used groundbreak-  ', 'ing polypharmacology  technology  to set up the “molecular  and biolog- ', 'ical signature  ” patterns,  an approach  that could bridge chemistry  and ', 'biology  in the long and diﬃcult  road of drug discovery.  They showed  ', 'AI tools capable  of presenting  the complex  relationships  between  the ', 'chemical  substance  with molecular  targets,  cells and/or organs.  This ', 'could create a more complete  understanding  of the “multi-biological  ', 'proﬁle ”caused  by the drug analyzed  in response  to a disease.  ', 'Example  use cases of PHAARM  MatchMaker® include:  (a) therapy  ', 'explorer  templates  focused  on diseases  or multiple  targets as well as ', 'oﬀ-target  aﬃnity;  (b) scaﬀold  hopping  to ﬁnd new oﬀ-patent  chemi- ', 'cals with similar or superior  properties  of the respective  compounds  ', 'approved  for clinical  use; (c) determining  the likelihood  of a preclini-  ', 'cal toxicology  event translating  into the clinic by biological  signature  ', 'matched  compound  with the drug safety data across preclinical,  clini- ', 'cal, and post-market  commercial  data; (d) comparison  of comparing  the ', 'biological  signature  of matched  compound  with the pharmacokinetic  ', 'parameters  available  for marketed  drugs (over one million  commercial  ', 'preclinical  and clinical  PK data, oral bioavailability,  volume  of distri- ', 'bution,  C max , T max , T 1/2 , AUC, etc.), targets,  oﬀ-targets,  phenotypic  as- ', 'says (cells), and clinical  outcomes;  (e) better anticipation  of drug-drug  ', 'interactions  via the metabolizing  enzymes  and transporters  and com- ', 'pare to DDI including  positive  and negative  interaction  cases; (f) ﬁnding  ', 'drug repurposing  opportunities  by searching  biological  signatures  with ', 'shared polypharmacology  features  [130] . ', 'Taken together,  a pipeline  of these AI tools can be generated  for ', 'multi-target  drug discovery.  For example,  recently,  we created  a proce- ', 'dure to test the marketed  multikinase  inhibitor  imatinib.  First, we used ', '9 J.T. Moreira-Filho, M.F.B. da Silva, J.V.V.B. Borba et al.

The compounds  share a rather large common  substructure.  ', '10 J.T. Moreira-Filho, M.F.B. da Silva, J.V.V.B. Borba et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the Life Sciences 3 (2023) 100055 ', 'imatinib  as a template  for PHAARM  MatchMaker  to evaluate  its molec- ', 'ular and biological  signature.  Then, we used the de novo Drug Design ', 'with Shape-Based  Generative  Modeling,  in which 3D spatial information  ', 'is incorporated  in two major phases:  (i) a shape variational  autoencoder  ', 'employing  CNNs encodes  the compound  representation,  and (ii) a mix ', 'of CNNs and LSTM networks  create SMILES  strings.  In Fig. 6 , one can see ', 'a visual representation  of the procedure.  With the new approach,  which ', 'uses autoencoders  and captioning  networks  to vary molecules  starting  ', 'from a single volumetric  representation,  using the imatinib  template,  ', 'compounds  were generated  by AI (Figure  S1a-n) with similar shape and ', 'pharmacophore  features.  ', 'Partial charges  are calculated  using a neural network  that combines  ', 'B3LYP/6–31G  ∗ ∗ calculations  with multi-task  constraint  message  passing  ', 'neural networks  for atomic/bond  properties.  This allows the calculation  ', 'of high-quality  RESPs and shape scores for any given structure  query giv- ', 'ing an accurate  prediction  on whether  it will have desirable  sweet spot ', 'properties  [131–133]  . Finally,  we generated  the “molecular  and biolog- ', 'ical signature  ”patterns  for newly designed  compounds  with predicted  ', 'multikinase  inhibition  (Figure  S2). The compounds  share a rather large ', 'common  substructure.  Importantly,  all compounds  activated  more than ', '10 kinases  models with strong binding  aﬃnity  and IC 50 . We showed  ', 'compound  with high MB signature  and 3D Shape and ESP similarities.  ', 'The shape and electrostatic  properties  of molecules  are what deter- ', 'mine how similar two diﬀerent  substances  can be. Learning  from past ', 'drug discovery  experiences,  these characteristics  should therefore  play ', 'a major role in determining  which comparison  method  is used. Some- ', 'times, it is hard to reach the desired  complex  eﬀect with one, one drug ', '(even considering  magic shotgun  drugs). In this case, combining  the ', 'drugs with diﬀerent  mechanisms  of action and/or hitting a variety of ', 'selected  targets could serve as an alternative  approach.  The application  ', 'of such approaches  in the discovery  of synergistic  drug combinations  ', 'against  SARS-CoV-2  has been reviewed  elsewhere.  ', '5. Conclusion  ', 'Historically,  the discovery  of new chemical  entities  with multi-target  ', 'proﬁle has been a huge challenge.  Methodologically,  the activity  of these ', 'compounds  needs to be simultaneously  optimized  toward several tar- ', 'gets with dissimilar  binding  pockets.  However,  intuitively  ﬁnding  hid- ', 'den structural  patterns  in chemical  accessible  space of multi-target  com- ', 'pounds  is quite diﬃcult.  To overcome  this challenge,  ML and DL tools ', 'stand out as cutting-edge  decision  support  systems  to optimize  research  ', 'pipelines  and revolutionize  multi-target  drug discovery.  Such AI systems  ', 'are able to identify  and learn from complex  structural  patterns  and to ', 'design new molecular  structures  with desired  multi-target  proﬁles  at a ', 'very low cost and in a time-eﬃcient  manner.  However,  many of these ', 'techniques  are currently  being evaluated  in the context  of prospective  ', 'drug discovery.  Thus, only a limited number  of studies present  experi- ', 'mental validation  results.  In this paper, we have highlighted  some stud- ', 'ies showing  encouraging  experimental  results inspired  by an automated  ', 'design of multi-target  compounds  using deep generative  networks  and ', 'MTL-DNNs.  Full development  of these tools will require  project-oriented  ', 'interdisciplinary  teams that closely integrate  data science,  synthesis,  and ', 'biological  evaluation  to guide the next generation  of multi-target  drugs.

The systems were developed by means of various input membership functions, outputmembership functions, defuzziﬁcation methods, and training cycles. The prominent developed system for esti-mation of the drawbar pull yielded a user-friendly intelligent fuzzy calculator with admissible accuracy (coef ﬁ- cient of determination = 0.993). Data obtained from the calculator revealed increasing nonlinear trend of thedrawbar pull in range of 12.9 –57.5 kN as concurrent augment of slip of the wheels and tractor weight, for2WD mode. In case of the 4WD mode, it nonlinearly raised from 12.8 to 77.7 kN. Therefore, effect of the slipand weight on the drawbar pull was found synergetic. Moreover, the drawbar pull ranges elucidated that thedrawbar pull proliferated as the 4WD mode was employed rather than the 2WD mode. Generally, benchmarkof the prominent developed intelligent fuzzy system, not only provide simple calculator with the widest applica-bility for different tractor models, but also produces added values in enrichment of realization level in domain oftractor drawbar pull concepts.© 2020 The Authors.

IntroductionInvestigation on drawbar pull supplied by off road driving wheelshas been interest for researchers from six decades ago. Available pub-lished documents indicate that, for theﬁrst time,Forrest et al. (1962) attempted to ascertain effect of various parameters on the drawbarpull. This attempt was followed afterwards by other agricultural engi-neers in time periods of sixties and seventies of the twentieth century(McLeod et al., 1966;Zombori, 1967;Burt et al., 1974;Burt et al., 1979;Raghavan and McKyes, 1979). These researches have been con-tinued until recent years (Bailey and Burt, 1981;Burt and Bailey, 1982;Burt et al., 1984;Foda, 1991;Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015; Kumar et al., 2019). In the mentioned research works, for speci ﬁc soil conditions, main inﬂuential factors affecting the drawbar pull were re-ported as dynamic weight, slip, and dimensions of the wheel.Parallel to these researches in the sixties, army engineers of theUnited States of America in Waterways Experiment Station startedtheir efforts for studying drawbar pull of off road driving wheels.Outcome of their efforts led to presentation of a new engineering pa-rameter for wheel size and soil characteristics. The parameter hasbeen called wheel mobility number (Freitag, 1966;Freitag, 1968). The parameter was subsequently employed by engineers ( Wismer and Luth, 1973;Wismer and Luth, 1974) in technical center of Deere & Com-pany in order to develop mathematical model for estimation of grosstraction force and the drawbar pull of the wheel. The model proposedby the engineers estimates the gross traction force and drawbar pullbased on dynamic weight, slip, and dimensions of the wheel. This ap-proach of mathematical modeling has been followed by other re-searchers (Gee-Clough, 1980;Wulfsohn et al., 1988;Sharma and Pandey, 1998;Srivastava et al., 2006;Maclaurin, 2014;Mason et al., 2018) based on the main mentioned inﬂuential factors. However, some miscellaneous mathematical models have been yet developedby other researchers (Hayes and Ligon, 1981;Ashmore et al., 1987; Upadhyaya et al., 1989;Evans et al., 1991;Vechinski et al., 1998; Sharma and Pandey, 2001;Rosca et al., 2014). Since some agricultural engineers (Southwell, 1964;Steinbruegge and Larsen, 1966;', 'Kliefoth, 1966;Southwell, 1967;Domier and Persson, 1968;Domier and Friesen, 1969;Wang et al., 1989)i nt h e sixties and seventies of the twentieth century tended to ascertain draw-bar pull supplied by tractor in various processes, the aforementioned re-searchers who concerned with development of mathematical modelssuggested utilization of the models for estimation of tractor drawbarArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 209 –218', 'Abbreviations:MFWD, mechanical front wheel drive; NTTL, Nebraska Tractor TestLaboratory; OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; 2WD,two-wheel drive; 4WD, four-wheel drive.⁎Corresponding author.E-mail address:smshafaei@shirazu.ac.ir(S.M.

The utilization can be performed by summation of drawbar pullprovided by each driving wheel. Main drawback of this method is attrib-uted to model conditions which are established for speci ﬁc tire type (bias and radial ply), soil texture (silt, clay, and sandy), slip value, testedsurface and environment (Tiwari et al., 2010;Keen et al., 2013;Sunusi et al., 2020). Another drawback of the method is related to its applica-tion for the MFWD tractors. Front and rear driving wheels of theMFWD tractors have different dimensions, dynamic weight, and tire in-ﬂation pressure. Thus, utilization of the mathematical models for esti-mation of drawbar pull of the MFWD tractors in speci ﬁc conditions results in frequently consequent calculations. These calculations canbe partly decreased by employment of new parameter of tractor mobil-ity number (tractor vehicle number). Concept of the tractor vehiclenumber was initially introduced byGrisso et al. (1992)and completed byTaylor et al. (1995), afterward. However, this scheme was also nota drastic effort for presenting a method for direct estimation of thedrawbar pull. Hence, development of a general model for estimationof drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractor based on some majortractor parameters is a highlight topic for researchers, undoubtedly.Notable progress of computer simulation tools for multivariate esti-mations of phenomena leads to worldwide application of the tools inengineering and scientiﬁc works. Literature screening process provedthis fact for attempts conducted by researchers ( Battiato and Diserens, 2013;Battiato and Diserens, 2017) in case of estimation of drawbarpull supplied by the MFWD tractor. In the cited works, the researchersdeveloped a computer program for estimation of the tractor drawbarpull as function of several input parameters (weight of front and rearaxles, soil mechanical characterizations, tire speci ﬁcations, tractor ge- ometry, and slip of driving wheels). The developed program was fedwith constant soil characterizations for the front and rear wheels. How-ever, bulk density and cone index of soil are proliferated after passage offront wheels (Rush, 1969;Holm, 1969;Bashford et al., 1988;Abebe et al., 1989;Srivastava et al., 2006;Lyasko, 2010;Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014a). Thus, the rear wheels encounter with higher coneindex and bulk density of soil. This deﬁciency in assumptions results in decrement of conﬁdence level of the program for accurate estimationof the drawbar pull. From another point of view, although estimation ofthe tractor drawbar pull by the developed program is relatively appro-priate for broad spectrum of conditions, high numbers of prerequisiteinput parameters of the program prevent the widest employment ofthe program by engineers, researchers, and associated managers. There-fore, it is indispensable to take a drastic effort for development ofgeneral computer simulation system working like simple calculatorfor estimation of the drawbar pull based on minimum major input pa-rameters of the MFWD tractor.Among several computer simulation systems, intelligent types aresimulation workspaces typically worked through predetermined se-quential calculations for foundation of correlation between output andinput data. These types are well known simulation systems due totheir capability for intelligent simulation of multiple input and outputparameters with self-training algorithm for nonlinear and uncertainphenomena. These outstanding capabilities result in applying intelli-gent simulation systems inﬁeld of Biosystems Engineering researchesin recent years in case of two well-known types of the simulation sys-tems (neural and fuzzy systems). Details of development and validationof neural simulation systems in these researches can be found in somepublished documents (Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014b;Shafaei et al.,2016a;Taghavifar and Mardani, 2017;Shafaei et al., 2018a;Shafaei et al., 2019a). Furthermore, there are some documents in literature forsuccessful application of fuzzy simulation systems in these researches(Khoshnevisan et al., 2014;Daneshmand et al., 2015;Shafaei et al., 2018b;Elijah et al., 2020). Analysis of the literature for performance ofintelligent neural and fuzzy simulation systems approved that thefuzzy systems can estimate phenomena with higher accuracy than neu-ral systems. This fact has been remarkably publicized by the same au-thors (Shafaei et al., 2015;Shafaei et al., 2018c;Shafaei et al., 2019b; Shafaei et al., 2019c;Shafaei et al., 2019d) in case of compound effect of nominal and numeral input parameter on output target.According to dearth of information in the published works for offer-ing general computer simulation system for estimation of drawbar pullsupplied by the MFWD tractor and reliability of fuzzy simulation sys-tems for multivariate estimation of nominal and numeral input vari-ables, proved in the literature, this study was intended to developfuzzy simulation systems for estimation of the drawbar pull on thebasis of combined major nominal input variable of tractor drivingmode (2WD and 4WD) and numeral input variables of tractor weight,and slip of driving wheels. In this regard, it was expected to provideprominent simulation system with user-friendly environment whichworks like a simple calculator.2. Research methodology2.1. Speciﬁcations of tractorsEleven MFWD models of New Holland tractors were considered inthis study. The New Holland type was selected because it is a populartractor that is frequently sold and supported in Iran. The models in con-junction with some engineering speciﬁcations are tabulated inTable 1.2.2. Drawbar pull testsThe NTTL has spearhead for testing tractors and reported source ofreliable data. These data have been arranged for fuel consumption,wheel slip, engine speed, forward speed, drawbar pull, drawbarpower, and hydraulic oil temperature of tested tractor. The hydraulicoil temperature was measured and monitored to verify steady state op-erating conditions of the tractor and data collection procedure ( Roeber et al., 2017).From 1986, the NTTL has tested performance of tractors based on of-ﬁcial procedure described by the OECD standard ( Kocher et al., 2011). Currently, the OECD standard Code 2 was devoted for of ﬁcial testing of performance of agricultural and forestry tractors under steady statecontrolled conditions (OECD, 2020). According to the standard, thetests must be conducted on concreteﬂat surface in order to eliminate ef-fect of soil characteristics on tractor performance. During the tests, thetractor was loaded by a load car. The load car controlled the loads ap-plied to the tractor. The load car was a Caterpillar articulated dumptruck. The load car was outﬁtted with two load cell transducersNomenclatureAFS actual forward speed (km/h)CNU coefﬁcient of non-uniformity (%)CV coefﬁcient of variation (%)DP', 'i ith drawbar pull (kN)DP', 'actave average of actual drawbar pull (kN)DP', 'act,i ith actual drawbar pull (kN)DP', 'est,i ith estimated drawbar pull (kN)DP', 'max maximum value of drawbar pull (kN)DP', 'min minimum value of drawbar pull (kN)M mean of drawbar pull (kN)MAVEE mean of absolute values of estimation errors (kN)MRDM mean relative deviation modulus (%)N number of used dataR', '2coefﬁcient of determinationRMSE root mean square error (kN)S', 'dw slip of driving wheels (%)SD standard deviation of drawbar pull (kN)TFS theoretical forward speed (km/h)S.M.

The drawbar pull was initially measured in the ﬁrst load cell transducer, while the second one was employed to con ﬁrm measured load by theﬁrst one (Roeber et al., 2017). Moreover, the load car was equipped with two controllers for data acquisition withcollection rate of 1 kHz and load control. The exterior-mounted control-ler was a NI CRIO 9073 and the controller inside the cab was a NIPIX1042Q. Software interface was LabVIEW version 12.0F3 ( Kocher et al., 2017). Actual forward speed was also measured using a non-drivingﬁfth wheel traveled under the load car. Meanwhile, forwardspeed of rear wheels of the tested tractor was measured as theoreticalforward speed (Howard et al., 2013). Therefore, slip values of the testedtractor wheels were ascertained and logged in the data acquisitionbased on Eq.(1)(Muro and O'Brien, 2004;Andreev et al., 2010; Maclaurin, 2018).S\", 'dw¼TFS−AFSTFS/C2100 ð1ÞThe data collecting procedures were carried out twice over approx-imately 61 m length of straightaway.

Development of intelligent fuzzy systemsIntelligent fuzzy systems were developed to estimate drawbar pullsupplied by the MFWD tractor, based on three independent input vari-ables of slip of driving wheels, tractor weight, and tractor driving mode.The intelligent fuzzy system hasﬁve layers comprising various nodesin each layer. Theseﬁve layers are called fuzziﬁcation, normalization, fuzzy rule, defuzziﬁcation, and output layer, respectively. The intelli-gent fuzzy estimation is accomplished through passing data sets intheseﬁve layers. The estimation scenario is explained in followingparagraph.When input data sets are imported into the system in the ﬁrst layer nodes, they are graded between zero and one by input membershipfunctions (trapezium, triangular, sigmoid, constant, generalized bell(Gbell) and Gaussian). The graded data are transferred to the secondlayer nodes as input data. The numerical weights are assigned to thedata in the second layer. Additionally, the second layer normalizes theweighted input data. The weighted input data are shifted to the thirdlayer nodes as input data of fuzzy rules. These rules are de ﬁned based on the IF and THEN structure through self-training algorithm. These def-initions are intelligently tuned regarding relationships between inputand output data. Output data obtained by the rules are collected and ag-gregated to one output value in the fourth layer nodes. This value is con-verted to anticipate output target by defuzzi ﬁcation method (weighted sum and weighted average). Output membership functions (constantand linear) are used for this task. The desired output target is ultimatelyachieved in theﬁfth layer node.I nt h ef u z z yw o r k s p a c eo fM a t l a bR 2016b software, data sets obtainedfrom the ofﬁcial NTTL reports were randomly shufﬂed and classiﬁed into three clusters. The clusters including 70% (202 data sets), 15% (43 datasets) and 15% (43 data sets) for training, validating and testing, respec-tively, of each developed system. To estimate the drawbar pull(12.9–57.5 kN) based on input variables of tractor weight (53.04 –78.45 kN), slip of driving wheels (1.4 –15.1%), and tractor driving mode(2WD and 4WD), the ranges of the tractor weight and slip of drivingwheels were directly deﬁned in the workspace and integers 2 and 4were assigned for the 2WD and 4WD, respectively. Development processwas frequently accomplished until the best structure of the system withthe highest estimation accuracy was reached. The process was ﬁnalized utilizing different types of input membership functions (trapezium, tri-angular, sigmoid, constant, generalized bell (Gbell) and Gaussian), thenumbers of input membership functions, types of output membershipfunctions (constant and linear), training cycles, and defuzzi ﬁcation methods (weighted sum and weighted average). To avoid prolongationof the paper, equation descriptions of input membership functions, out-put membership functions, and defuzziﬁcation methods are referred to Jang (1993).O p e r a t i o n a lﬂowchart for selection of the prominent systemis depicted inFig. 1.2.5. Performance appraisal of developed intelligent fuzzy systemsTo apprise performance of developed intelligent fuzzy systems forestimation of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractor, suitabilitycriteria of regression coefﬁcient of determination was calculated basedon Eq.(6)(Shafaei et al., 2016b). Moreover, absolute and relative errorsof estimation were ascertained by Eqs.(7) and (8), respectively (Shafaei et al., 2017a). Mean of absolute values of estimation errors was also cal-culated by Eq.(9). The highest values of coefﬁcient of determination and the lowest values of absolute and relative errors of estimation indicatedthe best system for estimation of the drawbar pull.R', '2¼∑i¼Ni¼1DPacti−DP actave ðÞ−∑i¼Ni¼1DPacti−DP esti ðÞ∑', 'i¼Ni¼1DPacti−DP actave ðÞ ð6ÞTable 1Some engineering speciﬁcations of the MFWD tractors considered in this study.Model Total testedweight (kN)Type offront tiresType ofrear tiresInﬂation pressureof the tires (kPa)Height ofdrawbar(m)TM115 53.044 14.9R28 18.4R38 83 0.425TM120 53.358 14.9R28 18.4R38 95 0.500TM125 53.074 14.9R28 18.4R38 83 0.430TM130 53.740 14.9R28 18.4R38 95 0.510TM135 60.860 16.9R28 20.8R38 83 0.470TM140 58.281 16.9R28 20.8R38 90 0.545TM150 62.841 16.9R28 20.8R38 83 0.470TM155 58.203 16.9R28 20.8R38 90 0.540TM165 65.038 16.9R28 20.8R38 83 0.465TM175 71.000 540/65R30 650/65R42 85 0.475TM190 78.453 540/65R30 650/65R42 85 0.560S.M.

The calculator can be simply employed based on importing values oftractor driving mode, tractor weight, and slip of driving wheels in allow-able range in predetermined place (bottom red bold framework in theFig. 8). Consequently, tractor drawbar pull can be also observed inpredetermined place (top red bold framework in the Fig. 8).3.3.

Physicalperception obtained from theFig. 9indicates that the drawbar pullnonlinearly proliferated as slip of driving wheels and tractor weight in-creased in ranges of 1.4–15.1% and 53.04–78.45 kN, respectively, for both tractor driving modes of the 2WD and 4WD. These results havebeen obtained for the drawbar pull of the tractors tested in the NTTLon concreteﬂat surface. For the drawbar pull augmentation of tractorsworking on soil surface, some interpretations have been addressed byprevious authors as mentioned in following paragraph.When tractor weight augments, weight of its wheels increases, de-terministically. As weight of driving wheels ascends, greater soil volumebetween tire lugs is trapped which is led to increase resistive shearforces of soil volume. This task reinforces interaction of soil and tire,and consequently results in proliferation of net traction force(Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015;Taghavifar et al., 2015). When net trac- tion force developed by the driving wheels augments, obtained drawbarpull of the tractor increases. Meanwhile, the drawbar pull augmentationwith wheel slip increment could be attributed to rise of resistive tangen-tial forces of deformable soil layers compacted by the wheel, as the slipincreases and thereby results in increment of net traction force(Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014c;Taghavifar and Mardani, 2014d; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015). When net traction force generated bydriving wheels increases, obtained drawbar pull for the tractor rises.The same results for increase of the tractor drawbar pull as a result of in-crement of slip of driving wheels and tractor weight have been found byRichardson and Cooper (1970)andRasool and Raheman (2018). It must be spotlighted that slip of driving wheels have indirect rela-tion with inﬂation pressure, dynamic load, and tire type (bias and radialply). Tire types of the New Holland tractors in this study were radial ply.Radial ply tires develop higher gross traction force than bias ply ones(VandenBerg and Reed, 1962;Forrest et al., 1962;Taylor et al., 1976; Gee-Clough et al., 1977;Wulfsohn et al., 1988;Kumar et al., 2019). Moreover, the radial ply tires have lower slip ( Cegnar and Fausti, 1961;Worthington, 1962;Coates, 1985) and rolling resistance force (Thaden, 1962;McAllister, 1983;Kurjenluoma et al., 2009;Kumar et al., 2019) in comparison with the bias ply tires in the same conditionsof tire and soil. These facts are corresponded to footprint of radial plytire on soil than that of the bias ply tires ( Thaden, 1962;Kumar et al.,', 'Fig. 7.Frequency of estimation error of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors.', 'Fig. 8.User interface of intelligent fuzzy calculator for estimation of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors.S.M. Shafaei, M. Loghavi and S. Kamgar Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 209 –218', '2152018). The higher footprint with narrower and longer shape ( Cegnar and Fausti, 1961;VandenBerg and Reed, 1962;Taylor et al., 1976)d i s - tributes uniform ground contact pressure and decreases rolling resis-tance force, andﬁnally leads to lower slip and higher gross tractionforce (Cegnar and Fausti, 1961). Therefore, in the same conditions ofsoil and wheels, employment of radial ply tire rather than bias ply tiretype could be an effective way for increment of net traction force gener-ated by driving wheel as well as the tractor drawbar pull.To more clearly inspect trend of variations of the drawbar pull as af-fected by the variables, dual effect of slip of driving wheels and tractorweight on the drawbar pull should be considered. To do this, projectedarea of the three-dimensional surfaces on horizontal plane are mani-fested inFig. 10. The projected areas in theFig. 10clarify that the dual effect of slip of driving wheels and tractor weight on the drawbar pullwas increasingly synergistic. It is plausible in the 2WD projected areathat the drawbar pull proliferated from the lowest bound (<10kN) tothe highest bound (>50 kN) as congruent increment of slip of drivingwheels and tractor weight from 0 to 16% and 50 to 80 kN, respectively.In case of the 4WD, it proliferated from the lowest bound (<10 kN)to the highest bound (>80 kN). According to these bounds, it wasfound that the drawbar pull of the 4WD was changed in higher bound(average bound = 45.45 kN) than that of the 2WD (average bound =37.92 kN). This fact could be attributed to employment of four drivingwheels of the 4WD tractor than two driving wheels of the 2WD tractorwhich is resulted in higher total net traction force produced by drivingwheels. Consequently, drawbar pull supplied by the 4WD mode ishigher than that of the 2WD mode. This result is compatible with thatof statistical reports obtained from the Table 2.3.4. Application restrictions of developed calculatorIn this study, the intelligent fuzzy system of developed calculator hasbeen trained based on the drawbar pull data sets of some tractors testedin the NTTL. It must be acknowledged that drawbar pull tests in theNTTL have been commonly performed on concrete ﬂat surface. There- fore, the calculator in this form can be used for construction and indus-trial environments with concreteﬂat surface and it cannot be employedfor various soil conditions and types of the MFWD tractor. This restric-tion implies necessity of adoption of the calculator for different modelsof the MFWD tractors and soil conditions in future research works byretraining the intelligent system of the calculator with more speci ﬁc data sets. Another inherent drawback of the calculator is regarded toworkspace of its user interface. Since the calculator has been developedin fuzzy workspace of the Matlab software, dependency of its user inter-face on the software restricts its broad employment. Therefore, this re-striction dictates necessity of a drastic effort for development ofspreadsheet graphical user interface for the calculator like ones sug-gested by some previous researchers ( Al-Hamed and Al-Janobi, 2001;', 'Fig. 9.Three-dimensional surface plots obtained from intelligent fuzzy calculator for estimation of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors.', 'Fig. 10.Projected area of the three-dimensional surfaces on horizontal plane obtained from intelligent fuzzy calculator for estimation of drawbar pull sup plied by the MFWD tractors.S.M. Shafaei, M. Loghavi and S. Kamgar Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 4 (2020) 209 –218', '216Sahu and Raheman, 2008;Pranav and Pandey, 2008;Catalan et al., 2008;Kumar and Pandey, 2009;Al-Hamed et al., 2010;Mehta et al., 2011;Pranav et al., 2012;AI-Hamed et al., 2014;Kumar and Pandey, 2015;Aboukarima, 2016;Kumar et al., 2017).4. Summary and conclusionThis paper deals with benchmark of a simple calculator for admissi-ble estimation of drawbar pull supplied by the MFWD tractors. To dothis, different intelligent fuzzy systems were developed and appraisedbased on nominal input variable of tractor driving mode (2WD and4WD), and numeral input variables of tractor weight (53.04 –78.45 kN) and slip of driving wheels (1.4 –15.1%). The prominent developedsystem yielded a user-friendly intelligent fuzzy calculator with admissi-ble accuracy (coefﬁcient of determination = 0.993, root mean squareerror = 1.289 kN, mean relative deviation modulus = 2.893% andmean of absolute values of estimation errors = 1.043 kN). Hence, itcan be asserted that problematic challenge of estimation of tractordrawbar pull by frequent employments of mathematical models foreach tractor driving wheels was obviated and thereby, improvementof state of the art was achieved in this realm. Moreover, physical percep-tion obtained from calculator data emphasized that the drawbar pullwas augmented as slip of driving wheels and tractor weight increased.Meanwhile, higher capability in supply of drawbar pull for the 4WDcompared to the 2WD mode of the MFWD tractor was approved. There-fore, it can beﬁnally concluded that the calculator is bene ﬁcial for trac- tor manufacturers and researchers to study and compare the drawbarpull of the MFWD tractors.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂu- ence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentThe authors would like to appreciate expert views of four anony-mous reviewers who meticulously revised the manuscript and furtherenriched content of the paper.References', 'Abebe, A.T., Tanaka, T., Yamazaki, M., 1989.

IntroductionThe Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) repre-sent unprecedented opportunities to move the power systems intoa new era of reliability and efﬁciency that will contribute to oper-ational, economical and ecological improvements. During thistransition period, it is important to implement adequate tech-niques allowing to ensure that the beneﬁts envisioned from theSG (cf.Fig. 1) become a reality. Commonly considered as a keymechanism towards a more efﬁcient and cost effective SG, theDemand Side Management (DSM) [6,16]refers to the planning and implementation of the utility companies’ programs', '1designed to directly or indirectly inﬂuence the consumer consumption inthe aim of reducing the system peak load and electricity costs.DSM techniques can be mainly gathered in two maincategories:– Theload shifting[12]which involves shifting the power con-sumption from on-peak to off-peak periods– Theenergy efﬁciency and conservation[2]which encourages con- sumers to reduce their consumption in order to reduce theirelectricity bills and the peak load.Although important the emergence of tools provided by theenergy efﬁciency and conservation approaches, such as TiDomus[7], we focus here on the load shifting, and more speciﬁcally onthe power scheduling, since it has been observed that it is easierto motivate users to reschedule their needs rather than askingthem to reduce their consumption [12]. Several approaches have been provided in the literature to address the power schedulingproblem[11,19,15,1,5,17]. However, and to the best of our knowl-edge, none of the them fully addresses the following challenges:–Operational Challenges: Several limitations can be mentionedregarding the operational aspect:1.The consumer discomfort: while the consumers are enjoy-ing their reduced electricity bills when shifting their con-sumption from on-peak to off-peak periods, they might risk', 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aci.2017.10.0052210-8327//C2112017 The Authors.

This would conduct to increase the relia-bility of the components and decrease the local failure risks.3.The consumption wise: the current shifting programs[11,19,15,5]provide consumption scheduling without con-sidering the production nor the storage scheduling (withthe exception of few approaches[1,17]) which negatively impact their efﬁciency in shaping the peak load, reducingthe electricity bills and minimizing the gas emissions effects.–Economical Challenges: Knowing that the electricity pricerelies on the demand and supply over a speciﬁc period [10], an adequate scheduling is expected to shift loads during periodsof high market prices (peak hours) and consequently minimizethe electricity costs.–Ecological Challenges: A signiﬁcant power production frompollutant energy sources leads to a signiﬁcant toxic gas emis-sions. Hence, it is essential to provide a power productionscheduling allowing to reduce the bad emissions and effectson the environment by reducing the simultaneous toxic powerproduction.To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce hereMOCSF, a ‘Multi-Objective Cooperative Scheduling Framework’designed for the power scheduling in the SG. MOCSFaims at scheduling a set of couples, each consisting of a seller and buyer,working together in a mutual spirit so to ensure a better reductionof the economical, operational and ecological costs and impactswithin the SG. In addition, our approach presents several advan-tages over existing approaches, namely:1. It provides a scheduling coverage able to consider all of thepower consumption, production and storage entities of the SG,2. It considers multiple energy sources (unlike existingapproaches[11,19,15,1,5,17]that studied the interaction ofthe consumers with only one energy source),3. It takes into account the SG components’ preferences unlikecurrent approaches[19,1,17]that consider them partially.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2provides details about existing power scheduling techniques and theirdrawbacks regarding aforementioned challenges. Section 3details the ‘MOCSF’ modules. An illustrative example is provided aftereach step to ease the understanding of each module. In Section 4, the experiments conducted to validate our approach and the mainresults obtained are presented. Section 5concludes the paper.2. Related workMany approaches have been proposed in the literature to solvethe power scheduling problem. Current approaches can be catego-rized into two main groups[8]: semi-automatic schedulers [11,19,5]and automatic schedulers[17,15,1]schedulers. In the semi-automatic schedulers, the consumers inject their desiredpreferences (e.g., desired temperature, appliances start time pref-erences, etc.) during the scheduling, contrarily to the automaticschedulers where there is no human intervention. In our work,we will be focusing on six scheduling approaches, that vary in theirscheduler, optimization problem type, appliances types andobjectives.2.1. Semi-automatic schedulersIn[11], the authors developed a distributed power consumptionscheduling algorithm aiming at reducing the electricity bills andbalancing the total power demand when multiple consumers sharea single energy source. To do so, the authors formulated a game-theory technique, where the players are the consumers and thestrategies are their corresponding power consumption schedules(represented as vectors).

Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79For each playern2N, the power consumption scheduling isgenerated randomly. The intuition behind this choice is that theauthors considered that, at the beginning, a player nhas no prior information about others players. Then, a loop is executed untilthe algorithm converges. Within the loop, the objective functionis resolved using an IPM algorithm [3], resulting a new schedule for each player. The same process is repeated until there is nonew announced schedule for all the players. Simulations resultsshowed that the proposed distributed algorithm can reduce theelectricity bills and the peak of average ratio.In[19], the authors developed a meta-heuristic scheduling algo-rithm, aiming at reducing the dissatisfaction and the energy cost ofa set of homes in a district, and the variance of the grid. To do so,the authors divided the home appliances into two categories:power-shiftable and time-shiftable appliances. The objective func-tion is formulated as follows:', 'MinXTt¼1XSj¼1IijðtÞ/C3U ijðtÞþ a/C3ðcðtÞ/C3XSj¼1PijðtÞÞ\"þb/C3X', 'Tt¼1XSj¼1/C3PijðtÞ/C01=jTj/C3XNi¼1XTt¼1XSj¼1PijðtÞ !2#ð2Þ', 'whereTis the set of time interval,Nis the set of households,Sis the set of electric appliances,I', 'ijðtÞis a binary variable denoting theworking status of the appliance jin the householdiat time t;U', 'ijðtÞis the dissatisfaction caused by operating the appliance iin the householdiat timet;', 'cðtÞis the electricity sale price at time t, andP', 'ijðtÞis the working power of the appliance jin the household iat timet.', 'The dissatisfaction functionU ijðtÞrepresents the difference between the desired temperature and the actual indoor tempera-ture for the space heater at time t, and the difference between the desired hot water temperature and the actual hot water tem-perature for the water heater at time t. The authors used the Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization(CPSO) (cf.Fig. 2) to ﬁnd the optimal scheduling of the appliances.Experimental results showed the positive impact of the householdscoordination in decreasing the peak loads and reducing the powercosts.In[5], the authors developed a power consumption schedulingaiming at reducing the electricity bills of the consumers with aminimum impact on their consumption preferences.

Without giving details about the obtainedresults, the authors assume that the proposed model can minimizethe electricity consumption costs while including the consumers’preferences.', '2.2. Automatic schedulersIn[15], the authors formulated an optimization model forhouseholds power scheduling, aiming at reducing the electricitycosts and the peak load of the grid. To do so, the authors integratedthe incentive and inconvenience concepts. The incentive is offeredto the users during peak times to encourage them to reduce theirconsumption, while the inconvenience seeks to reduce the differ-ence between the baseline and the optimal appliances schedule.The objective function is deﬁned as follows:', 'MinXTt¼1XIj¼1½Piðct/C3Uopti;t/C0bt/C3dðUbli;t/C0Uopti;tÞÞ /C3D:tþðUbli;t/C0Uopti;tÞ2/C138ð4Þ', 'whereP iis the rated power of the appliance i;Uopti;tis the new on/off status of the applianceiat timet;U', 'bli;tis the baseline on/off status of the applianceiat timet;I¼10;T¼144;dðU', 'bli;t/C0Uopti;tÞ¼1i f', 'Fig. 1.Smart Electricity Network (Source: www.actia.com, 2017).', 'Fig. 2.CPSO conﬁguration and operation.K.

DiscussionTable 1shows a comparison between the existing DSMapproaches highlighting their strengths and drawbacks withrespect to the aforementioned challenges. On can observe thefollowing:–Scheduling coverage: All the existing DSM approaches[11,19,15,1,5,17]focused only on the power consumptionscheduling, with the exception of[1,17]that addressed the stor- age scheduling as well. However, none of them covers thepower production scheduling.–Consumer satisfaction: Few approaches[1,17,19]took into account the consumers’ satisfaction. In [19], the consumers’ comfort is ensured by reducing the gap between the desiredand the actual hot water, and between the desired and theactual indoor temperature. However, in [1,17], the satisfaction is measured by the delay time between the desired start timeand the real operation of its household appliances. Contrariwiseto[11,15,5], where this aspect was completely absent.–Multiple energy sources: To the best of our knowledge, all theDSM approaches[11,19,15,1,5,17]target the interaction of theconsumers while assuming having only one utility grid and con-sequently one energy source.–Restricted goal: Another limitation of all the existingapproaches is that they do not cope with the three objectives(operational, ecological, and economical) of a successful DSM.In almost all the approaches[11,19,15,1,5,17], the goal was mainly to reduce the electricity costs (economical aspect). In[11,19], the peak load reduction (operational aspect) isaddressed aiming at reducing the peak hours in the power grid.However, none of the approaches considers the gas emissionreduction (ecological aspect).All these limitations lead us to develop a new DSM cooperativemodel, allowing the scheduling of the power production, consump-tion and storage while considering the three-objective aspect ofthe DSM and the components’ preferences.3. Multi-objective cooperative schedulingIn this section, we detail our ‘Multi-Objective CooperativeScheduling Framework’ orMOCSFaiming at reducing electricity bills, peak loads and environmental bad effects, while enhancingthe comfort of the SG components. In order to conceive a coopera-tive environment,MOCSFtakes as input a set of couples, or whatwe call: seller-to-buyer associations, each consisting of a sellerand buyer having mutual beneﬁts in working together, with theirdesired schedules reﬂecting their operational preferences in termsof: start time, end time and power quantity (to sell or to buy). Themain reason behind this choice relies on the fact that we do notwant to schedule the sellers and the buyers randomly but werather want to maintain the power exchange between the sellersand the buyers having the biggest interest in working together(the interest can be expressed via an objective function that takes', 'Table 1Comparing existing DSM approaches.', 'Scheduling Coverage Satisfaction Multiple Energy Sources Restricted GoalRad et al.[11] Partial /C0/C0 Partial Koukam et al.[19] Partial Partial /C0 Partial Ditiro et al.[15] Partial + /C0 Partial Peruknishnen et al.[17] Partial Partial /C0 Partial Christopher et al.[1] Partial /C0/C0 Partial Amin et al.[5] Partial + /C0 Partial Our Approach + + + +70 K.

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature toprovide appropriate associations[13,14]. Our approach is based on[14], where the authors provided a dedicated clustering algo-rithm aiming at gathering the components that have mutual ben-eﬁts. To do so, they proposed a Digital Ecosystem DE cooperativemodel for SG management, that consists of two main modules:(1) the Alliances Builder and (2) the Seller2Buyer matcher. The Alli-ances Builder provides an appropriate clustering algorithm, aimingat gathering all theDEheterogeneous components, having similarneeds and preferences. Once done, the Seller2Buyer matcher isapplied inside each cluster and between clusters, targeting a bettercollaboration inside the SG. Note that, their needs and preferencesare expressed via a three-dimensional objective function that takesinto account the operational aspect by reducing the transmissionpower losses wasted over the distribution lines and maintaininga power balance (between the generation and the consumption),the economical aspect by minimizing the environmental impactdue to the conventional energy sources, and the ecological aspectby ensuring a stable energy trading via a cost reduction.For the rest of our paper, we will be using the following exam-ple: Let us consider an SG consisting of 9 components having thepower generation(g), demand (d) and storage (s) as shown in Table 3. After classifying the SG components, they will be put intothree main categories: the sellers willing to sell their power sur-plus (nR', '1!nRþ1,nR 4!nRþ2;nR 6!nRþ3;nR 8!nRþ4), the buyers willing to buy their power needs ( nR', '2!nR/C01;nR 3!nR/C02;nR 5! nR', '/C03;nR 9!nR/C04), and the self-satisﬁed components ( nR 5!nR01) (c.f.Table 2.).After applying a clustering algorithm aiming at gathering the SGcomponents having mutual interests in working together based onthe minimization of an objective function that takes into accountthe ecological, economical and operational costs, the result is aset of couples or seller-to-buyer associations as follows:', 'Association1:ðnRþ1;nR/C03Þ/C0nRþ1should sellnR/C03a quantity of 14 kW Association2:ðnR', 'þ1;nR/C01Þ/C0nRþ1should sellnR/C01a quantity of 3 kW Association3:ðnR', 'þ4;nR/C01Þ/C0nRþ4should sellnR/C01a quantity of 1 kW Association4:ðnR', 'þ4;nR/C02Þ/C0nRþ4should sellnR/C02a quantity of 2 kW8>>><>>>:As shown inFig. 3,MOCSFconsists of two main modules:Preference-based compromise builder andMulti-objective Schedulerdetailed in what follows.3.1. Preference-based compromise builderAs mentioned before, the input of this module is a set of seller-to-buyer associations, each composed of a seller and a buyer. Note that,each seller or buyer might belong to one or several associations.While sellers and buyers of the same association have to exchangepower, each one of them has its own preferences to be respectedso to establish a successful cooperative SG. Hence, the ﬁrst steptowards each association scheduling is to ﬁnd the best balance orwhat we call the compromise, between the preferences of therelated seller and buyer. Let us consider the ﬁrst association(nR', 'þ1;nR/C03) of the illustrative example.nRþ1andnR/C03should be sched- uled together, howevernR', 'þ1may have several preferences that aredifferent fromnR', '/C03’s: for instance, this latter prefers to buy powerat 7:00 am, whilenR', 'þ1prefers to sell its surplus at 8:00 am. Hence,our goal is to ﬁnd the trade-off between the sellers and the buyerspreferences. The problem becomes more and more complicatedwhen each seller and buyer exchanges power with several compo-nents (since each can belong to several associations). For instance,nR', 'þ1belongs to another association as well, ( nRþ1;nR/C01), wherenR/C01', 'prefers also to buy power at 7:00 am. Hence, our module should pro-pose an optimal distribution of the sellers’ available power at eachtime t, in that it can meet its preferences and the buyers preferences,as well. Note that, for privacy reasons, a component has no priorinformation with whom he will exchange power, he can only precisethe quantity he needs to sell or buy at each time t.Before detailing the process, we present ﬁrst some deﬁnitionsused in our study.

They aredetailed below.3.1.1. Candidate components’ preschedulingThe aim of this module is to dissociate the desired schedule ofeach seller/buyer, so as to distribute the power quantity at eachtime t (its capacity of selling/buying) between the componentswith which, it must exchange, without exceeding nor being inferiorto its desired capacity at time t. The pseudo-code of the candidatecomponents’ prescheduling is provided in Algorithm 2. Brieﬂy, for each seller/buyer, we retrieve the list of edges to which the seller/buyer belongs. Then, we generate the list of all the possible permu-tations of the retrieved edges (Lines 7–16). For each possible per-mutation list of edges at a time t, we verify if the seller/buyerhas enough power to sell/to buy to the buyer/from the seller ofthe same edge (Line 17). If there is enough power (Lines 18–20),we ﬁll the schedule with the quantity to buy/to sell and recall', 'Fig. 4.Preferences-based compromise builder framework.K. Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79 73the process by the next seller/buyer. If not, we ﬁll the schedulewith the quantity to buy/sell, reduce the quantity to sell/buy, andverify the quantity to sell/buy to the next buyer/from the nextseller of the next edge (Lines 21–25).', '3.1.2. Final components’ preschedulingThe aim of this module is to select the candidate components’schedules that guarantee that each edge is provided with itsexchanged value (EV) at each time t (e.g., at the end of the day,where t = 24 h). In other words, for each edge, the sum of thepower quantity exchanged between its sellers and the buyers atT, should be equal to their exchanged value ( EV) in thePG. So, the sellers sell all their power surplus and the buyers satisfy alltheir needs. The pseudo-code of the ﬁnal components’ schedulesis provided inAlgorithm 3. Brieﬂy, for each candidate schedule ofeach seller (Lines 2–9) and for each time t of the day, we calculatethe sum of the energy exchanged of the edges to which the seller/buyer belongs. The schedule is accepted if the sum is equal to theexchanged value of the edge (Lines 12–13). If the equality is veri-ﬁed for all the edges, we add the candidate schedule to the ﬁnalcomponents’ schedules (Lines 13–16).3.1.3. Compromise preschedulingThe aim of this module is to generate every seller-to-buyerassociation (edge) desired schedule. It consists of selecting the bestcombination between the ﬁnal preschedules of the sellers and buy-', 'ers. This can be done by selecting the combination that ensures theminimum gap between the desired schedules of the sellers andbuyers and the proposed compromise desired schedule. Thepseudo-code of the ﬁnal components’ schedules is provided inAlgorithm 4. First, we generate the combinations between the ﬁnalpreschedules of the sellers and the buyers (Lines 1–3). Then, foreach seller/buyer of each combination, we calculate the powerquantity for each edge in each candidate schedule for all combina-tions at a time t and ﬁll it into a new vector ( FinalQuantity) (Lines 4–17). After that, a similarity computation of the resulting vectorand the initial desired schedule (vector) of each seller/buyer isdone using the cosine similarity measure (Line 18). In fact, weadopted the commonly adopted cosine measure to calculate thedistance between the proposed and the desired schedule vectors(instead of many others such the Euclidean Distance, the PearsonCorrelation Coefﬁcient, etc.) since it provides better results whenAlgorithm 2.Candidate Components’ Prescheduling', 'Algorithm 3.Final Components’ Prescheduling74 K. Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79there are many values in common between the two schedules tocompare.

Multi-objective SchedulerOnce done with the preferences-based combination generatorthat aims at extracting the desired schedules of the seller-to-buyer associations based on the sellers and buyers desired sched-ules given as input, it is time to schedule the resulting associationsin a way to minimize the operational, economical and ecologicalaspects. As deﬁned in Eq.(3), our objective function takes intoaccount: 1)- the operational aspect by considering the comfort ofthe sellers and buyers measured by the delay time between thedesired schedule and the real operation, the peak load reductionof the SG and the components calculated using the variance ofthe power at a time t 2)- the economical aspect is considered bymeasuring the electricity price at a time t, and 3)- the ecologicalaspect is treated by calculating the toxic gas emissions producedat a time t in the SG.In our work, we adopted Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), tosearch for the near-optimal scheduling for each seller-to-buyerassociation, because of its straightforward implementation anddemonstrated ability of optimization. In essence, PSO is a compu-tational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying toimprove a candidate solution with regard to a given measure ofquality using an objective function. It is considered as a powerfultool to solve complex non-linear and non-convex optimizationproblems. Moreover, it has several other advantages, such as fewerparameters to adjust, and easier to escape from local optimalsolutions.76 K. Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79Brieﬂy, the problem is solved by having a population of candi-date solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particlesaround in the search-space according to simple mathematical for-mula over the particle’s position and velocity. Each particle’smovement is inﬂuenced by its local best known position, but is alsoguided toward the best-known positions in the search-space,which are updated as better positions are found by other particles.This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.The pseudo-code of the adapted PSO is provided in Algorithm 5. The goal is to ﬁnd a solution a for which DisðaÞ<DisðbÞfor allb, which would mean thatais the global minimum. LetSbe the num- ber of particles in the swarm, each having a position x', 'iand a veloc- ity', 'vi. Letpibe the best known position of particle iand letgbe the best known position of the entire swarm. The values b', 'loandb upare respectively the lower and upper boundaries. The termination cri-terion can be number of iterations performed, or a solution withadequate objective function value is found. In our method, weset the parameters as in[19]to calibrate the PSO problem, usedfor mathematical models of Smart Homes.4. ExperimentsA set of experiments have been conducted to highlight the efﬁ-ciency of our approach as explained below.4.1. Experimental contextA prototype has been implemented using Java to conduct thetest on a PC with an Intel Core i7-3630 QM CPU, 2.40 GHz proces-sor with 8 GB RAM. Since the SG is relatively a recent concept inthe power systems area, there is a lack of a current Benchmarkto be based on. Hence, we carried out our experimental scenarioinspired by the one provided in[13]but adapted to ﬁt better the scope of our study. Here, we set up an SG within an area of 10km/C210 km with: 1) the main grid located at the onshore, and2) the SG components randomly located within this area. Thepower gap (G) of any SG componentnR:1 0 M W6GðnRÞ6316 MW. Note that, the power cost per kW is set to 11 :6 cents based on the US electricity prices', '3and the conventional power generatorgas emissions is set to 0:26 kgCO2/kWh.', '4The prototype includes the following functionalities: (1) the Preference-based compromisebuilder and the (2) Multi-objective scheduler.4.2. Experimental metrics and resultsThe main criteria used to evaluate the effectiveness of ourapproach are: (i) the preference-based compromise builder effec-tiveness, (ii) the time needed to generate the compromises, as wellas, (iii) the multi-objective scheduler impact on the electricity costreduction, the peak loads and the gas emissions.4.2.1. Preferences-based compromise builder effectivenessThe efﬁciency of the generated desired compromise schedule ismeasured by its similarity with the desired schedules of the sellersand the buyers given as an input. The similarity measure used inour module is the ‘Cosine Similarity Measure’, which results a sim-ilarity between 0 and 1 (from an absence of similarity ‘0’ to the big-gest similarity ‘1’).Fig. 6shows that the worst similarity ratioobtained is 0:72 and the best one is 0:95. This result reﬂects that our module ensures nice results providing an adequate compro-mise between the seller and the buyer preferences.4.2.2. Preferences-based compromise builder performanceIn addition to testing the effectiveness of our module in reduc-ing the gap between the proposed compromise desired scheduleand the desired sellers and buyers, we also evaluated its time per-formance. This test consisted of measuring the necessary time tobuild the compromise from the sellers and buyers associations(cf.Fig. 7), and showed a linear complexity of our algorithm.4.2.3. Multi-objective scheduler impact on the SGThe cooperation and the multi-objective aspects of the SG arethe key features of our scheduling. Hence, we measured the follow-ing resulting costs: the total electricity prices, the total toxic gasemissions, the components comfort, and the peak loads.Algorithm 5.Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm', 'Fig. 6.Compromise similarity w.r.t the number of SG components.3https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energ y-guides/average-electricity-prices- kWh.html.', '4https://www.carte-grise.org/explication-calcul-bilan-co2.htm .K. Salameh et al. / Applied Computing and Informatics 15 (2019) 67–79 77In this test, two different scenarios were considered: (1) a non-cooperative scheduling, where each association is selﬁsh in that itonly considers its desired schedule, and (2) a cooperative schedul-ing based on our proposed multi-objective scheduling. To remaincoherent, we will consider the scheduling of the seller-to-buyerassociations of our same previous illustration. Note that, the out-put of the preference-based compromise builder will be used hereto calculate the comfort of the components by calculating the gapbetween the resulting schedule and the compromise desiredschedule.Fig. 8shows the electricity load resulting from the non-cooperative case. At T = 2, a peak load (Electricity load = 14 kW)appeared having several bad effects on the economical, ecologicaland the operational costs. From the economical perspective, thispeak load leads to a total electricity cost of 163 cents. From theecological perspective, and having at T = 2, a conventional powergenerator (emitting 0.26 kgCO2/kWh), the non-cooperationscheduling caused a simultaneous gas emissions of 3.64 kgCO2.The only advantage of this scheduling is that it answers exactlythe desired preferences of the components, which gives a similar-ity of 1 (the highest), between the proposed and the desiredschedules.Fig. 9shows the electricity load resulting from our multi-objective scheduler. It shows how the peak loads are shaved (High-est electricity load = 6 kW). The result is a trade-off between theeconomical, ecological and operational aspects. From the econom-ical perspective, the total electricity cost is reduced to 136 c. Fromthe ecological perspective, the highest simultaneous gas emissionsis reduced to 1.57 KgCO2. The only feature affected negatively isthe similarity between the desired and the proposed schedule,reduced to 0:75. Despite this reduction, the value remains a verygood result.5. ConclusionIn this paper, we proposedMOCSF, a Multi-Objective Coopera- tive Scheduling Framework providing a multi-type scheduling forthe power generation, storage and consumption, while taking intoaccount the ecological, economical and operational costs in apower system.MOCSFconsists of two main modules: thePreference-based Compromise Builder, providing the best balancebetween the desired schedulers of the sellers and the buyers givenas an input, and the Multi-objective Scheduler, providing seller-to-buyer associations scheduling aiming at ensuring the economical,ecological and operational satisfactions. Experiments resultsshowed the potential of our modules in providing efﬁcientpreference-based compromises able to reduce the gap with the ini-tial components preferences and in minimizing the three-dimensional costs. Currently, we are working on implementing aprivacy-by-design[9]grid control allowing to protect the compo-nents privacy whilst preserving the advanced control and monitor-ing functionalities of the power systems. Further, it is interesting toapply strategy-proof techniques, in order to avoid cheating in thedesired schedules,References', '[1]Christopher O.

IntroductionAccording to the seminal institute of medicine report, medical errorsranked as the leading cause of death in the United States [ 1], and recently climbed to the third leading cause of death [ 2]. It is estimated that about 44,000 to 98,000 people die annually from medical errors [ 1]. These numbers are higher than deaths from breast cancer, AIDS, and car acci-dents combined. Medication errors are the most frequently occurringmedical error in healthcare settings [ 3]. Unfortunately, serious life threatening errors are usually reported, but the majority of other medi-cation errors are not [4].Medication delivery is a complex multi-stage process that involvesseveral healthcare professionals [5]. Medication errors could occur ateach step of the medication process [ 6], with 38% of errors occurring at the administration phase [7]. Nurses spend about 40% of their timeadministering medications, and by virtue of their position represent thelast safety defense to intercept errors before reaching their patients [ 8]. Most hospitals relay on nurses to report medication errors, in some casesnurses might be the witness or committer of medication error [ 9]. Medication error reporting is a voluntary process [ 10]. Reviewing and analyzing medication error report, known as incident report, pro-vides healthcare administrators and safety of ﬁcers with opportunities for understanding error root causes and subsequently design interventions toprevent subsequent errors [11–13]. However, having less than 5% oferrors reported, makes developing a proper medication error interven-tion a tough challenge [14]. Fear of blame, punishment, humiliation,retaliation from managers and/or peers were some of the reasons de-terring nurses from reporting errors bib15[9,15]. Mayo and Duncan (2004) [9] argued that all efforts of healthcare administrators, policymakers and scholars to create effective medication errors reporting sys-tems, could fail if nurses remain unwilling to report errors. Limited in-formation exist about organizational and interpersonal variables neededto motivate nurses to report medication errors. Therefore, the purpose ofthe three nursing studies is to identify interpersonal and organizationalvariables inﬂuencing nurses’willingness to report medication errors.Given the complexity of healthcare organizations, and the non-linearrelationships among aspects of healthcare systems, interpersonal re-lationships, and nurses willingness to report medication errors, usingtraditional regression approaches might often lead to inaccurate results[16,17], and limited interpretability [18,19] which will challenge pro- posing appropriate improvement interventions. Another challenge isthat: generally there are large number of the predictor variables, so thepossible combinations of the variables (predictors) are extremely large,which makes it difﬁcult to identify which combination is the mosteffective for predicting nurses’willingness to report.In this paper, a new method has been proposed to analyze predictors', '* Corresponding author.E-mail address:rh2703@columbia.edu(R.

To identify the top predictors a new parallel variable selection method ispresented with Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) [ 20–23]. ELMs is accurate by extremely fast prediction models [ 20], therefore, it is possible with them to test a very large number of possible variables.The selected variables are visualized by comprehensive Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) [24–27]. Self-Organizing Maps are perform-ing non-linear dimensionality reduction [ 24] to get an accurate visuali- zation of the data, which signiﬁcantly enhances the interpretability of theselected predictors, and reveals the determinant factors for nurses ’ willingness to report medication errors, therefore guides the hospital toconduct intervention to improve the likelihood of receiving medicationerror reports from nurses.The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2the detailed problem description is provided. Section3discusses about the process of identi-fying the top predictors. Visualization technique is introduced in Section4. The complete experiment settings are presented in Section 5. Final results are included in Section6. Conclusions and the future works are inSection7.2. Nurses error report datasetThree survey data were collected from three funded nursing projects.The projects were conducted to identify interpersonal and organizationalpredictors of nurses’willingness to report medication errors.Study Design: non-experimental cross-sectional design was used inthe three projects. Setting: data for the three projects were collected fromRegistered Nurses (RN) working in general medical surgical units, criticalcare units, nursing homes, and Emergency Departments (ED) from mul-tiple hospitals in one Midwestern state.Study Sample: Full-time, part time, and as needed base nurses (PRN),with no leadership responsibilities regardless their age, gender, years ofexperience were invited to the studies. Nurse managers, nurse practi-tioners, and those who are not involved in passing medication wereexcluded from the studies.Study Measures/Instruments: Nurses’demographics were measured using a PI developed demographic questionnaire that includes: nurses ’ age, gender, total years of experience, highest nursing degree, type ofunit, years of experience with the current nurse manager, years ofexperience in the current unit, number of hours worked per week andtype of shift (morning, evening, or rotating). In addition to the previousmeasurements the surveys included further measurements including,Interpersonal variables, Organizational variables (leadership and unitclimate) and Outcome variables of nurses’willingness to report medi- cation errors.2.1. Data preparationEach survey data is collected in a separate.csv ﬁle. The variables in the dataset are corresponding to the questions from the survey, and thevalues of the variables are the subjects’answers to the questions, which are coded in the numerical Likert scales. The name of the variables arecoded in two parts: the abbreviation of the survey section name followedby the question number. For example: variable LSHPQ1means question 1 in the section of Nurse manager’s leadership style, representing thequestion: My unite manager provides me with assistance in exchange formy efforts.Table 1shows the correspondences among the Measurements,', 'and the Number of Questions in this category. Three distinct outcomesvariables are asked in the survey to measure the nurses ’willingness to report medication errors in different scenarios.The samples with missing values in the dataset have been omitted.Theﬁnal experimental data contains 68 variables and 328 samples/nurses.There are three different outcome scenarios corresponding to threedistinct outcome variables, which are measured in the survey as follows:ERREPQ1: When a mistake is made, but caught and corrected beforeaffecting the patient, how likely are you to report this error?ERREPQ2: When a mistake is made, but has no potential harm to thepatient, how likely are you to report this error?ERREPQ3: When a mistake is made that could harm the patient, but doesnot, how likely are you to report this error?Table 2presents the math notations used in this paper.To summarize, the training data isX2ℝ328/C268. Three outcome var- iables areY', '1;Y2;Y32ℝ328/C21, corresponding to the three distinctoutcome scenarios: ERREPQ1, ERREPQ2, and ERREPQ3.3. Identify top predictor variables with parallel ELMsThe survey data after pre-processing had 68 variables in total. Suchmulti-variable data is usually called high-dimensional data, which can bechallenging to interpret and to analyze due to the curse of the dimen-sionality, data redundancy and noises [ 28–30]. Any model built upon high-dimensional data directly usually suffers from the poor general-ization performances [28]. More importantly, such high-dimensionaldata is also limiting the analysis model’s interpretability [29,31]. Last but not least, it is difﬁcult to create visualization of multi-dimensionaldata, which is an effective way of presenting the comprehensive data[29,32], enhancing the data analysis, and guiding the future actions. Inthis study the visualization plays an important role of guiding the man-agement of hospitals to improve the willingness of nurses to reportmedication error. For the purpose of increasing the interpretability, andobtain comprehensive visualization, it is critical to conduct proper var-iable selection to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify toppredictor variables.A fast parallel variable selection model is proposed by using ExtremeLearning Machines [20–22] incorporated in a wrapper variable selectionmechanism [33], to identify top predictors of nurses’willingness to report the medication errors. Extreme Learning Machines are accurate,Table 1Survey measurements summary.', 'Measurements Number of QuestionsNurse manager’s leadership style 28Warmth and belonging climate 11Organizational trust 12Nurses Basic information* 12Hospital error reporting system 5Willingness to report in scenario 1 1Willingness to report in scenario 2 1Willingness to report in scenario 3 1', 'Note*: All category variables are converted to numerical values by label encoder.', 'Table 2Math notations.', 'Symbols DescriptionY All Outcome Variables Y', 'i Outcome Variablei X Predictor Variables for all the samples x', 'i ithsample fromX S', 'k Randomly selectedkvariables fromX W ELM Input Layer Weights b ELM Input Layer biases L Number of Hidden Neurons in ELM h ELM Hidden Neurons output ϕ Non-linear transformation function in ELM β ELM Output Layer Weights c', 's Best Matching Unit in SOM', 'α Learning Rate in SOM', 'σλ Neighborhood Function in SOM d Distance Function in SOMR.

The ELM model is explained in Sec-tion3.1. The wrapper variable selection method is explained in Section3.3. In the variable selection process, the variables are evaluated by theR', '2value of each ELM model, this is explained in Section 3.2.3.1. Extreme Learning MachineExtreme Learning Machine in Ref. [ 23,36] as important emergent machine learning techniques, are proposed for training Single-hiddenLayer Feed-forward Neural Networks (SLFNs) [ 20,22,37–40]. In contrast with the traditional Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs),which generally are trained by the well-known backpropagation (BP)algorithms, in ELM, the wight for the hidden layer are randomly initiatedand thenﬁxed without iteratively tuning. Then commonly used activa-tion functions are applied on the hidden neurons. The only parameterslearned in ELM are the weights between hidden layer and the outputlayer. In this way, the parameters of the hidden neurons can be inde-pendent of the training data, which makes it possible for ELM to attainthe near optimal generalization bound of traditional FNN. Theoreticalstudies as in Ref. [22,38,39] has shown that ELM has the universalapproximation and classiﬁcation properties.The unique training process of ELM provides a huge leverage for thelearning speed. A non-iterative solution of ELM provides a speedup of 5orders of magnitude compared to Multilayer Perceptron ([ 41], MLP) or 6 orders of magnitude compared to Support Vector Machines ([ 42], SVM). ELM was proposed for the fast training for the Single-hidden LayerFeed-forward Networks (Fig. 1). An SLFN has three layers of neurons:Input layer provides data features and performs no computations; Hiddenlayers is the only layer where the non-linear transformation happens;Output layer is linear without any transformation function and bias.ELM is trained in two stages: First, random feature mapping. In thisstage, the input data are projected randomly into a new space. ELMrandomly initializes the input layer weights W2ℝ', 'd/C2Land biasesb2ℝL, whereLis the number of the hidden neurons. An input data x2ℝ', 'dare mapped non-linearly by an activation function h', 'ionto the hidden neuron i, denoted as:hiðxÞ¼ϕðw i;x;b iÞ;w i2ℝdb2ℝ; (1)whereϕis a non-linear piecewise continues function, generally can beselected from the following functions:The hidden layer is not constrained to have only one type of trans-formation function in neurons. Different functions (see Table 3) can be used together. Some neurons may have no transformation function at all.They are linear neurons, and learn linear dependencies between datafeatures and targets directly, without approximating them by a nonlinearfunction. Usually, the number of linear neurons equals the number ofdata features, and each of these neurons copies the corresponding feature(by using an identityW¼Iand zerob¼0). The second stage of ELM is solving the linear system, ﬁnding the optimalβ, that minimize the following cost function:MSEðX;YÞ¼min', 'βkHβ/C0Yk2; (2)where,His the output from the hidden layer:H¼0@ϕðw', '1;x1;b1Þ…ϕðw L;x1;bLÞ…⋱…ϕðw', '1;xN;b1Þ…ϕðw L;xN;bLÞ1A:(3)The cost function itself is the Mean Square Error (MSE) between theapproximation of ELM (Hβ) and the true target valueY.

Evaluating predictor variables with R', '2valueR', '2value can be used as an accurate measurement of variable selectionperformance [43]. Due to the distinct scenarios of the outcomes, therelationship between predictor variables and each outcome variables areevaluated separately, with the calculated R', '2values.

Hu et al. Array 8 (2020) 100049', '33.3. Wrapper variable selection with ELMThe wrapper variable selection method [ 44] targets on improving the generalization performance of theﬁnal model [45]. Although the wrapper method is more computationally expensive than the ﬁlter method [33,45], the generalization performance of the former approachis better than the later approach [33]. Multiple ELMs are built in parallelin the wrapper variable selection (see Fig. 2). Each ELM evaluates ak randomly selected variables fromX. TheR', '2value is computed to mea- sure the prediction performance of the selected kvariables. The larger the R', '2values are, the better prediction ofY ican be obtained from these selected variables. Therefore, variables that can produce larger R', '2values are selected over the ones produce smaller R', '2values. The detailed variable selection process is broken down into 5 stepsand theﬂowchart below (Fig. 3) describes the process.Step 1. Random Variable Selection. From original dataset X, randomly selectkvariables, to create a subset of the original data: S', 'k. Initially,k¼1. The current best variable setS', '*k¼S k. Theﬁnal best variable setS', '**k¼S k.Step 2. ELM Training. An ELM is built upon the selected data S', 'kand the outcome variableY', 'i. TheR2value is computed.Step 3. Updating Current Optimal Predictor Variable Set. If the cur-rentR', '2value is higher than the previous calculation update S*k¼S k. Otherwise,S', 'kstays the same.Step 4. Iterative Updation. Repeat iterative Step 1 to 3 until thestopping criteria is met. The stop criteria is de ﬁned by the maximum iteration number, which is a fairly large number. If the maximumiteration is reached, theﬁnal best variable setS', '**kis updated byS*k. Step 5. IncreasingkValue. The number of variable selection isincreased by one and restart from Step 1.4. Visualize predictor variables with SOMSelf-Organization Maps [24] are used to perform visualization afterthe top predictors are identiﬁed. SOM is capable of revealing thenonlinear relationship between the predictors and the outcomes, which ismore preferable technique than linear visualization method like PCA[25–27].4.1. Self-Organizing MapsSOM is a popular nonlinear dimensionality reduction tool that uses apredeﬁned 2-D grid to capture the topology of the data in the highdimension [46,47] (seeFig. 4).Besides the two-dimensional map representation, each point on thegrid will attain a weight, or prototype, which is basically its d-dimen- sional representation in the original d-dimensional data space.The grid, which consists of a rectangle including the points located ona rectangular lattice, is accompanied with randomly initialized weightsfor each point. Finally, after a considerable number of iterations, theseweights will be updated to the points’positions in the originald- dimensional data space. In the iterative algorithm, units (or prototypes)cs, fors¼½1;…;N/C138, in whichNis the number of points on a 2-D grid, areupdated with the following rule:c', 's←c sþασλðr;sÞðx i/C0csÞ (8)wherex', 'iis theith data point, αis a learning rate between 0 and 1, and σλ', 'which is called the neighborhood function returns zeros for non-neighbors, and ones for other non-zero values for valid neighbors. Inaddition,dis a distance function andr¼argmin', 'sfdðx i;csÞg. After the projection, according to SOM algorithm, each point c', 's,s¼ ½1;…;N/C138on the 2-D grid is a representative of a group of points in d- dimensional data space. Basically,c', 'sis the Best Matching Unit (BMU) of agroup of points in original data space.Therefore, Self-Organizing Maps are performing a discrete nonlineardimensionality reductions.In order to understand the visualization, colors are used to transformthe SOM into a heat map that helps understanding the importance of agiven variable. Using several heat maps help analyzing the data asillustrated in the next Section.5. Experiment setupsIn this section, detailed experiment setups are discussed, includingthe experiment equipment, Machine Learning models ’parameters, and experimental procedures.In theﬁrst part of the experiment, the top predictor variables areidentiﬁed using ELMs. Given the large amount of calculations need toperform, this part of the experiment is conducted on the University ofIowa’s Argon High Performing Computing System. One CentOS-7.4Linux Compute Node is used, with 24 processing cores and 512GB ofNode Memory.Since the three outcome questions are evaluated independently, thevariable selectionsY', '1;Y2;Y3are running in parallel on the cluster.Every ELM built is using 50 hidden neurons. The maximum iterationis set up as 10', '8times. The total processing time used are about 2 weeks.One important thing to consider when conduct variable selection is', 'Fig. 2.Parallel ELMs for variable selection.R. Hu et al. Array 8 (2020) 100049', '4the total possible subsets of the variables. Since there are 68 variables intotal, selecting, for example, 7 variables out of 68 variables, the totalpossible subsets are nearly 10', '8. If select 20 variables, the number ofsubsets could reach 8/C210', '16. Therefor, if selecting less than 7 variables,the selection is the optimal predictors; if selecting more than 7 variables,it is not possible to guaranteeﬁnding the optimal predictor variables.Fortunately, it is not necessary to do exhaust test for all possiblevariable subsets toﬁnd top predictors. This is because: 1) in this study,after the optimal 3 or 4 predictors are found, the R', '2value start to gainonly marginal improvements when the adding more variables. In otherwords, adding extra variables does not improve the prediction ability bymuch. Please see Section6.1, 6.2, and 6.3. 2) to create comprehensive visualizations for human, only a few variables should be used [ 49,50], and some study suggests that no more than 4 variables should use [ 51]. Therefore, there are another set of screening rules to decide whichvariable sets from the selected top predictors to visualize. The twocriteria used are: 1) there should not be more than 4 variables to bevisualized. 2) if adding one more variable is NOT providing signi ﬁcantR2', 'increasing, then the it shouldn’t be added.By applying the above criteria, the visualization is created by SOM,using the selected top predictors. The SOM map size is 6 /C28 to ensure 328 samples spreading to each units on SOM. Too large map size will leadto empty unites, while too small size will lead to overpack some unites.The learning rate', 'αis 0.5 by default in the SOM ToolBox in Matlab, whichis sufﬁcient to guarantee quick convergence and training accuracy.The visualization is performed on the local laptop wiht Intel(R) i7processor and 16 GB memories.6. Experiment resultsSince the experiments for the different outcome variables are inde-pendent, the experiment results are organized by the distinct outcomevariables.6.1. ERREPQ1ERREPQ1: When a mistake is made, but caught and corrected beforeaffecting the patient, how likely are you to report this error?TheR', '2values for the bestkvariables are showing inFig. 5. The best variable setsS', '**k, wherek¼1;2;…20, forY 1are selected by ELMs. The followingTable 4lists selected variable names fork¼1t ok¼ 5.R', '2value increases signiﬁcantly atS**4forERREPQ 1. Thus, it is chosen for visualization. The corresponding survey questions are as follows:/C15EXPCURRUNIT: Years of experience in the current unit./C15ORGTRUSTQ5: I can rely on my peers/colleagues to lend me hand(help me) if I needed it./C15ORGTRUSTQ10: Most of my peers/colleagues ef ﬁciently do their work even if the unit manager is not around./C15WARMCLIMQ7N: People in this unit really do not trust each other.SOM is built upon this top predictor variable set and the outcomevariable.In the visualization of SOMs (seeFigs. 6–10), the bright orange color is associated with the higher value of the variable, while the dark bluecolor means a lower value of the variable. The color code is representedby the color reference bar on the right.The number on the top of each cell indicate the SOM unit number; thebottom number is the variable value of the cell.Each cell represents a group of subjects that are similar in the selectedmeasurements (variables). The subjects are grouped in the same way forall the predictor variables maps and the outcome variable map.The outline marks several region of interests on the visualizationmaps, that is revealing important information for nurses ’willingness to report medication errors.6.1.1. Region one: cells 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 13Subjects in these cells have high values (above 2.3) for the outcomevariable 1,ERREPQ', '1, which indicates that they are more willing to reportwhen a mistake is made, but caught and corrected before affecting thepatient.

Conclusions and future workResults of this data analysis using SOM showed that nurses ’willing- ness to report medication error is contingent on three factors of', 'experience in the unit, nursing experience, organizational trust particu-larly trust in peers, and nurse manager leadership behaviors. Further-more, the results showed that outcome predictors varied based on level oferror severity. Based on this result, hospital administrators shouldconsider focusing on the previously outlined predictors if they want toimprove nurses’willingness to report medication errors regardless itslevel of severity. Using SOM, accounted for the non-liner relationshipthat exist among the different study variables. Most importantly itshowed the pattern of organizational trust development. This informa-tion was not evident when we used traditional liner modeling.The new methodology that is combining ELMs and SOMs has pro-vided an clear understanding of the studied dataset. Some of the analysisare obviously right and similar to the conclusions that can be obtainedwith traditional data analysis. Nevertheless, more understanding hasbeen obtained. For example, the model is sparse (few variables). It is awell-known results in theﬁeld of perception that only 5 to 6 variables canbe easily understood by humans [ 49,50]. Furthermore unknowns nonlinear interactions between variables have been discovered using ourapproach.

IntroductionCharacteristics of a second, non-native language are largely inﬂuenced by the ﬁrst(native) language. As a result, the performance of automatic speech recognitionsystems, usually trained by native speakers, often degrades when they are usedby non-native speakers. This is mainly due to both acoustic and phonological dif-ferences between accents (Hang et al., 2000; Zheng et al., 2005). These differences are not only due to different phoneme inventories of the languages, but even forthe same phoneme, non-native and native speakers pronounce different sounds.The modeling of separate accents remains difﬁcult and inaccurate due to the largenumber of non-native accents and to the insufﬁciency of non-native speech dataavailable for training. It is the reason why many studies propose to adapt nativephoneme models to accented phoneme models using ﬁrst language data. Numer-ous studies have been carried out to improve the automatic recognition of speechuttered by non-native speakers.Fakotakis (2004)worked on the adaptation of standard Greek speech recogni-tion systems to work with Cypriot dialect by using HTK toolkit ( Young, 2006), MLLR, MAP, and combined MLLR and MAP techniques ( Lee and Gauvain, 1993; Leggeter and Woodland, 1995). He considered Cypriot Greek as a variationdialect of standard Greek with the same set of phonemes. He used utterances readfrom isolated digits, digit strings, application words, dates, and dictionary assis-tance names. In this study 500 native Greek speakers were involved in the training,while 450 speakers were used to adapt to the system, and 50 speakers to test it.When the system was trained by pure Cypriot Greek, the performance degradeddue to inadequate training data. The best accuracy improvement was encounteredwith digits strings database and the combined MLLR and MAP technique. Thisimprovement was 2.1%.Bartkova and Jouvet (2004)proposed multiple models for improved speech rec-ognition of non-native French speakers. They addressed the problem of foreignaccent by using acoustic models of the target language phonemes (French pho-nemes in their case) adapted with speech data from three other languages: English,German, and Spanish. Their results obtained for 11 language groups of speakersshowed that error rate can be signiﬁcantly reduced when standard acoustic modelsof phonemes are adapted using speech data from other languages. In their outputs,the highest error rate reduction of 40% was obtained on English native speakers.They improved the recognition performance on almost all language groups, eventhough only three foreign languages were available in their study for acousticmodel adaptation.Hui et al. (2000)worked on principal mixture speaker adaptation for improvedcontinuous speech recognition. They introduced a method that reduced HMMcomplexity by choosing only the principle mixtures corresponding to particularspeaker’s characteristics. This method improved both recognition accuracy (by2 S.-A. Selouani, Y.A. Alotaibi31%) and recognition speed (by 30%) when compared to full mixture speakeradaptation models.The research on Arabic language mainly focuses on Modern standard Arabic,which is used throughout the media, courtrooms and academic institutions of theArabic countries. Previous work on developing ASR was dedicated to dialectaland colloquial Arabic within the 1997 NIST benchmark evaluations, and morerecently on the recognition of conversational and dialectal speech, as it is reportedinKirchhoff et al. (2003). Moreover, and compared to other languages, the Arabiclanguage beneﬁts from very limited number of research efforts. The goal of thispaper is to investigate how adaptation techniques could improve a trained recog-nition system to be used by non-native Arabic speakers to get minimum amount ofdegradation in system accuracy. This adaptation is accomplished by using theadaptation techniques; namely, MLLR, MAP, and combination of MLLR andMAP. The original recognition system was designed for and trained by nativeArabic speakers. Before adaptation, the system was tested by non-native Arabicspeakers and the performance was considered for the sake comparisons with thoseof the adapted systems. We have four adaptation lists and three adaptation tech-niques; hence we have 12 adapted systems. Each system is evaluated at both wordlevel and phoneme level.The organization of this paper is as follows. The second section gives a basicbackground on Arabic language. In the third section, adaptation methods arebrieﬂy presented. Then, the fourth section presents the experimental framework,and the ﬁfth section proceeds with a discussion of the obtained results. Finally,the sixth section concludes and indicates the perspective of this work.2. Basic Arabic language backgroundArabic is a Semitic language, and it is one of the oldest languages in the world to-day. It is the ﬁfth widely used language nowadays (Al-Zabibi, 1990). The Arabic language has many differences when compared to European languages such asEnglish. Some of the other differences are Arabic unique phonemes, phonetic fea-tures, and complicated morphological structures. A major difference lies in theArabic text, where it is written with the absence of any information that leadsto short vowels, geminate, and pharyngealization. This might lead to many iden-tical-looking forms in a large variety of contexts, which decreases predictability incorrect word pronunciation, sentence meaning, and language model rules. Hence,the determination of accurate language model from texts becomes very difﬁcultwhen the type and position of short vowels, for example, are unknown ( United Nations, 2003; Selouani and Caelen, 1998). Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)has 34 basic phonemes, of which six are vowels and 28 are consonants. The Arabiclanguage has fewer vowels than English. It has three long and three short vowels,while American English has at least 12 vowels. Permissible syllables in the Arabiclanguage include the following: CV, CVC, and CVCC, where V indicates a (longAdaptation of foreign accented speakers in native Arabic ASR systems 3or short) vowel, while C indicates a consonant. Arabic utterances can only startwith a consonant.Arabic is characterized by the presence of emphatic and pharyngeal phonemes.There are a total of ﬁve pharyngeal phonemes; among which two are fricatives:/H/ and /C/. These phonemes are characterized by the constriction formedbetween the tongue and the lower pharynx in addition to the rising of the larynx.There are three uvular pharyngeal phonemes, /x/, /G/, and /q/ characterized by aconstriction formed between the tongue and the upper pharynx for /x/ and /G/and a complete closure for /q/ at the same level. On the other hand, there are fouremphatic phonemes: /S/, /D/, /T/, and /Z/. These phonemes are emphatic versionsof the oral dental consonants /s/, /d/, /t/, and /TH/.3. System adaptation methodsThe widely-used adaptation technique is MLLR (Leggeter and Woodland, 1995). It is a parameter transformation technique that has proven successful while using asmall amount of adaptation data. It computes a set of transformations that willreduce the mismatch between an initial model set and the adaptation data. MLLRis a model adaptation technique that estimates a set of linear transformations forthe mean of Gaussian mixture HMM system. The effect of these transformationsis to shift the component means in the initial system so that each state in theHMM is more likely to generate the adaptation data. The MLLR transformationmatrix used to give a new estimate of the adapted mean is stated as:~l¼Wl', '0; ð1Þ whereWis then/C2nðnþ1Þtransformation matrix (wherenis the dimensionality of the data) andl', '0is the extended mean vector deﬁned as follows:l', '0¼½wl1l2...ln/C138T; ð2Þ wherewrepresents a bias offset whose value here is ﬁxed at 1.

For MAP adaptation, the re-estima-tion formula for Gaussian mean is a weighted sum of the prior mean with the max-imum likelihood mean estimate. It is formulated as:4 S.-A. Selouani, Y.A.

One of the drawbacks of MAP adaptation is that it requires more adaptationdata to be effective compared to MLLR. When MLLR is combined with MAPwe can beneﬁt from both of the techniques. Theoretically, the combination offerscompact transformations for rapid adaptation when only limited amount of datais available, thanks to MLLR, and the asymptotical efﬁcacy of MAP adaptationwhen the amount of data increases. There are many ways to combine MLLR andMAP. We choose to use the MLLR transformed means as the priors for MAPadaptation. Hence, the adapted means can be written as:^l', 'ik¼sik~likþPTt¼1ntði;kÞx t', 'sikþPTt¼1ntði;kÞ:ð5Þ The principal difﬁculty in MAP adaptation is to determine the mixing param-eters. As it is commonly used, we chose a single mixing parameter for each modelthat we built, i.e.,s', 'ik=s.4. Experimental setupThe WestPoint Arabic Corpus, provided byLDC (2002), is used in our experi- ments. It consists of collections of four main Arabic scripts. First is CollectionScript 1, which contains 155 sentences, used by all 74 native Arabic speakers.Script 1 has a total of 1152 tokens and 724 types. Second is Collection Script2, which contains 40 sentences, used by 23 of the non-native speakers. Script 2has a total of 150 tokens and 124 types. Third is Collection Script 3, whichcontains 41 sentences, used by 4 of the non-native speakers. It has a total of138 tokens and 84 types. Finally, there is Collection Script 4, which contains22 sentences, used by 9 of the non-native speakers, all of them are third yearArabic speakers. It has a total of 72 tokens and 59 types. The total number ofdistinct words is 1131 Arabic words. All scripts were written with MSA as the tar-get language and were diacritized. In the LDC-Westpoint database, the amountof data provided by the Arabic native speakers is signiﬁcantly larger than that ofthe data provided by the Arabic non-native speakers. Note that the WestPointcorpus has three phonemes more than the number of MSA phonemes mentionedin the linguistic literature (Kirchhoff et al., 2003; Ouni et al., 2005). These phonemes are: /g/ ‘‘voiced velar stop’’, /aw/ ‘‘back upgliding diphthong’’, and/ey/ ‘‘upper mid front vowel’’. In fact, the phoneme /g/ does not exist in MSAat all, but we think that the WestPoint corpus used it because some native andnon-native speakers are using it popularly in some MSA words. We can conﬁrmAdaptation of foreign accented speakers in native Arabic ASR systems 5this fact by hearing some WestPoint audio ﬁles. On the other hand, the extravowel and diphthong were used because of variations in pronunciations of speak-ers inﬂuenced by English and other Latin languages. This type of phoneme existsin these languages but not in MSA. For our study, we ﬁnally decided to stickwith WestPoint phonemes and transcriptions without any modiﬁcation. We con-sidered this to make it more easy and logical to compare these results with otherresearches results which used the same corpus. Using the same settings and vari-ables values will give more correct and comparable outcomes.4.1. DataFrom the WestPoint corpus we selected four different and disjointed lists; all havebeen chosen randomly from non-native Arabic speakers only. The ﬁrst list calledAD100, contains 100 utterances; the second list called AD150, contains 150 utter-ances; the third list called AD200, contains 200 utterances; the last list calledAD250, contains 250 utterances. The four lists are chosen randomly from all avail-able scripts, speakers, and genders. The designed lists were used to adapt a nativeArabic speaker based system to deal with non-native Arabic speakers. For thispurpose, three different adaptation techniques were used: MLLR, MAP and acombination of MLLR and MAP. The performance is analyzed both at the wordlevel (by incorporating a language model) and at the phoneme level. The phonemelevel permits us to investigate the improvement (if any) of system accuracy on indi-vidual phonemes; hence giving us the chance to analyze the weakness of non-native Arabic speakers’ pronunciation as a phoneme-wise way of analysis. Basedon the above explanations, we refer to our experiments as AD100/MLLR, AD100/MAP, AD100/MLLRMAP, etc.4.2. Recognition platform and parametersThe Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) (Young et al., 2006) is used for design- ing and testing the speech recognition systems throughout all experiments. Thebaseline system was initially designed as a phoneme level recognizer with threeactive states, continuous, left-to-right, no skip HMM models. The system wasdesigned by considering all 37 MSA phones as given by the LDC catalog. Sincemost of the words consisted of more than two phonemes, context-dependenttriphone models were created from monophone models. The training phaseconsists of re-estimating HMM models by using Baum-Welch algorithm afteraligning and tying the models by using the decision tree method. Phoneme-basedmodels are good at capturing phonetic details. Also context-dependent phonememodels can be used to characterize formant transition information, which is veryimportant for the discrimination of confusable speech units.The parameters of the system consist of a 22 kHz sampling rate with a 16 bitsample resolution, a 25 ms Hamming window duration with a step size of6 S.-A. Selouani, Y.A. Alotaibi10 ms, MFCC coefﬁcients with 22 as the length of cepstral leftering and 26 ﬁlterbank channels of which 13 were the number of MFCC coefﬁcients, and of which0.95 were the pre-emphasis coefﬁcients.5. Results and discussionAll native Arabic speakers’ data provided by the LDC WestPoint corpus were usedfor training the original recognition system. After that, all non-native Arabic speak-ers’ data provided by the same corpus was used for testing the system. As a result ofthat test, the accuracy (correctness) of the system was 89.02% and 93.19% for wordlevel and phoneme level, respectively. This performance is relatively low comparedto the same system but with testing data taken from native Arabic speakers wherethe percentage for word level and the percentage for phoneme level have been,respectively, obtained.Fig. 1shows the system performance for the four adaptationlists and for the three adaptation techniques. This performance is compared to theaccuracy of the system prior to any kind of adaptation.As it can be inferred from the results (cf.Fig. 1), the improvement of systemperformance increases when the size of the adaptation list is increased. Thisperformance is improved rapidly to reach its best at 96.39% which represents a7.37% improvement (at word level) in comparison with the original system. Thisresult is obtained by the adaptation list AD250 and the adaptation combiningMLLR and MAP techniques (i.e., experiment AD250/MLLRMAP). We noticedthat in AD150 and AD250, the combined MLLR and MAP adaptation techniquesgave better performance compared to others.The improvements in accuracy for the different experiments are depicted inTable 1. We notice that there is no ﬁxed rule governing the comparisons of', 'Figure 1System accuracies for MLLR, MAP and MLLR/MAP techniques with different sizes of adaptationdata.Adaptation of foreign accented speakers in native Arabic ASR systems 7MLLR, MAP, and their combination. In some experiments, MLLR gaveimprovement better that that of MAP. In other experiments MAP gave betteraccuracy improvement. The combined MLLR and MAP techniques sometimesgave less improvement compared to either MLLR or MAP. For instance, exper-iment AD100/MLLRMAP gave 1.97% as accuracy improvement but AD100/MAP gave better performance with a 2.65% improvement. We believe that thisis due to the random choice of sentences used in adaptation. In some cases, morerelevant and speciﬁc Arabic phonemes are included in the adaptation data, whilein other cases, the adaptation set contains less of these phonemes. As a generalobservation, we noticed that MAP gave better accuracy improvements comparedto MLLR, and MLLRMAP gave generally better accuracy improvements com-pared to MAP and MLLR.By investigating the system performances for individual phonemes we can no-tice that the phonemes /H/, /TH/, /g/, /q/, and /z/ gained more improvement intheir performances for all experiments.Table 2shows the increases in performancefor these phonemes for all conducted experiments. Except for phoneme /z/, thesephonemes are Arabic phonemes that cannot be found in English.

Alotaibiencouraging result since the adaptation process permits the enhancement of theperformance of phonemes that are hard for non-native Arabic speakers to pro-nounce, especially /H/ which is a fricative unvoiced non-emphatic pharyngealsound. Thus, in the non-adapted system these sounds and other particular Arabicphonemes produced errors due to the phonological and acoustical changes in-duced by the pronunciation of non-native speakers. Consequently, these resultsconﬁrm that by the means of the adaptation process, the performance of auto-matic recognition of Arabic foreign-accented speech can be signiﬁcantly improved.6. Conclusion and future workAn automatic Arabic speech recognition system was trained by using nativeArabic speakers’ speech data provided by the LDC WestPoint corpus for MSAArabic. After that, the system was adapted to non-native Arabic speakers’ speechdata provided by the same corpus. The adaptation techniques were MLLR, MAP,and a combination of them. The accuracies of the non-adapted system were89.02% for word level accuracy and 93.19% for phoneme level accuracy. The bestsystem accuracy improvement was 7.37% and this was obtained in experimentAD250/MLLRMAP. Among others, the speciﬁc Arabic phonemes /H/, /TH/, /q/, and /H/ known as being hard to pronounce for a non-native Arabic speakergot better accuracy improvements in all experiments.This work will be continued by investigating the performance of an evolution-ary-based technique to give the Arabic speech recognition system an auto-adapta-tion capability in the context of more foreign accents. Also this work will beexpanded to use a better in quality and bigger in size speech corpora. In Additionto this, we are planning to check the effects of other languages (in addition to Eng-lish) as a ﬁrst language of speakers on improving the performance of Arabic ASRsystems. Also we can do it for the opposite way in improving English ASR systemsin case of using them by Arabic native speakers whom can pronounce unique(compared to Arabic) English phonemes such as /p/, /v/, and /g/.References', 'Al-Zabibi, M., 1990.

Hydroponic and aquaponic growth techniqueshave proven to be viable alternatives, but the lack of ef ﬁcient and optimal practices for irrigation and nutrient supply limits its applications on a large-scale commercial basis. The main purpose of this research was to developstatistical methods and Machine Learning algorithms to regulate nutrient concentrations in aquaponic irrigationwater based on plant needs, for achieving optimal plant growth and promoting broader adoption of aquaponicculture on a commercial scale. One of the key challenges to developing these algorithms is the sparsity of datawhich requires the use of Bolstered error estimation approaches. In this paper, several linear and non-linear al-gorithms trained on relatively small datasets using Bolstered error estimation techniques were evaluated, forselecting the best method in making decisions regarding the regulation of nutrients in hydroponic environments.After repeated tests on the dataset, it was decided that Semi-Bolstered Resubstitution Error estimation techniqueworks best in our case using Linear Support Vector Machine as the classi ﬁer with the value of penalty parameter set to one. A set of recommended rules have been prescribed as a Decision Support System, using the output ofthe Machine Learning algorithm, which have been tested against the results of the baseline model.

IntroductionAquaponics is an agricultural technique that is touted as a promisingalternative to solve the food and environmental crisis that the worldfaces today. As it is a combination of aquaculture ( Pillay, 2003;Pillay and Kutty, 2009) and hydroponics (Jensen, 1997;Roberto, 2003;Jones Jr, 2016), this technique can have high water use ef ﬁciency, and reduce the dependency on pesticides and fertilizers which adds to the sustain-ability of the system. This system has been shown to consume 50 –70% less water compared to traditional agricultural systems, owing to its re-cyclability. Moreover, this system requires less pest control and hasproven to be less impacted by harsh weather conditions, leading toyield increase.As we are moving towards the era of digital agriculture, efforts havebeen made to design physical prototypes for smart commercialaquaponic systems. Lobanov et al. has focused on proposing a new sys-tem for reducing the carbon and nitrogen content from ﬁsh waste to produce liquid fertilizer which is added to facilitate the growth of let-tuce in aquaponic set-ups (Lobanov et al., 2021). Karimanzira et al. in- troduced the concept of building an intelligent aquaponics systemincorporating predictive analysis, system optimization and anomaly de-tection for maximizing productivity in commercial aquaponics throughearly fault detection (Karimanzira et al., 2021). Mahanta et al. formu- lated a laboratory set-up as a prototype to grow soybeans in hydroponicsolution using plasma activated water to decrease the amount of heavymetal uptake and optimize yield (Mahanta et al., 2022). Rau et al. de- signed a smart IoT based sensing and actuation system for growingrice by controlling the concentration of magnesium and nitrogen in hy-droponic solution along with monitoring the environmental parametersof the greenhouse (Rau et al., 2017). A similar design was proposed byDhal et al. using a smart IoT system for real time sensing and regulationof nutrients in commercial aquaponic set-ups depending on the seasonin which the crops were grown (Dhal et al., 2022). Timsina et al. pro- posed the use of Machine Learning models to regulate nutrients forgrowing cereals in farmlands, but efforts are yet to be made for growingthem in aquaponic set-ups (Timsina et al., 2021).Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 68 –76', '∗Corresponding author at: Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, TexasA&M University, USAE-mail addresses:sambandh@tamu.edu(S.B.

Arvind et al. implemented an AutoML model trained with anXGradientboost algorithm, with 10-fold cross-validation taking into ac-count the different sensor values recorded in the greenhouse and theﬁsh count in the aquaponic tank which was extracted using the maskR-CNN image segmentation. This algorithm was used to control the trig-gering of the actuators in the system that in turn control the environ-mental parameters in the greenhouse; ensuring signi ﬁcant improvements in yield and water conservation, when compared withthe conventional methods. Languico et al. did a comparative study ofthree ML estimators: K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression(LR), and Linear Support Vector Machine (L-SVM), on the vision-feature extracted images of lettuce in a smart aquaponics set-up tomonitor diseases that the crop may incur in its lifetime. A similar kindof study was done by Maleki-Kakelar et al. where multiple ML algo-rithms like linear and quadratic regression models, fuzzy systems andgenetic programming was used to conduct regression analysis for im-proving urease activity aimed at strengthening the behaviour of soils(Maleki-Kakelar et al., 2021). A study on images of lettuce leaves wasconducted by Concepcion II et al. to detect diseases, wherein differentfeature selection processes were used to select the top four attributesfor training the ML models (Concepcion II et al., 2020). A study on smart nutrient regularization for replenishing the Nitrogen, Phosphorusand Potassium content of the soil has been done by Ahmed et al. usinggenetic algorithms to provide the optimal level of nutrients needed forhigh production level of crops (Ahmed et al., 2021). Hiram Ponce et al. used a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) forextracting features from tomato leaves along with a combination of Ar-tiﬁcial Hydrocarbon Network (AHN) as the dense layer to predict de ﬁ- ciency of nutrients in tomato plants (Ponce et al., 2021). A similar kind of Deep Neural Network was implemented by Yadav et al. for apple fo-liar disease classiﬁcation using Plant Pathology image datasets ( Yadav et al., 2022). Nevertheless, limited research has been conducted onmonitoring and regulating nutrient concentrations in the aquaponic so-lution using ML-based approaches. The current work focuses on build-ing a ML algorithm that monitors the nutrient status of hydroponicirrigation water and outputs a recommendation system for regulationof these parameters. The main motivation behind this entire approachis to select the most important nutrients that need to be regulated inaquaponic environments depending on the output of Machine Learningclassiﬁers trained on small datasets. The main issues which one mayface while designing such a data-driven approach has been discussedin the next paragraph.One of the major challenges with automation in aquaponics is thelack of sufﬁcient data and the vast number of predictors that have tobe used for making any inferences. This could result in what is referredto as the“Curse of Dimensionality”leading to the available data becom-ing sparse (Köppen, 2000). Thus, it becomes extremely important to re-duce the dimensionality of the dataset without losing valuableinformation. For this, feature selection ( Chandrashekar and Sahin, 2014) techniques become more relevant. To state a few, Recursive Fea-ture Elimination (Granitto et al., 2006) and ensemble techniques such asthe ExtraTreesClassiﬁer (Shaﬁque et al., 2019) have proven to be highly effective. It is also equally important to check for the separability of theclasses in the dataset. Many data visualization techniques like Principal', 'Component Analysis (Wold et al., 1987;Abdi and Williams, 2010)a n d Multi-Dimensional Scaling (Cox and Cox, 2008) plots can be used to un- derstand how linearly separable the data is and what classi ﬁers would be best suited for the purpose.Another major drawback especially in the case of small datasets isthe problem of“overﬁtting”the data (Dietterich, 1995). Traditional ML and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have a high probability of per-forming poorly on small datasets. A solution to this problem wassuggested by Shao et al. who proposed deep Reinforcement Learning al-gorithms named MONEADD and did a comparative study with Knap-sack and Traveling Salesman problem to design neural networks fordifferent combinatorial optimization problems without much featureengineering which showed better scalability when distributed on mul-tiple GPUs (Shao et al., 2021). On a similar note, to address this problemof overﬁtting, Braga-Neto et al. proposed Bolstered Error Estimationmethod, which uses the same data for both classi ﬁer design and error estimation (Braga-Neto and Dougherty, 2004;Sima et al., 2004). In this form of error estimation, the variance setting for the Bolstering ker-nel is determined in a non-parametric manner from the data. For all thelinear classiﬁcation rules, the integrals in the Bolstered error estimationare computed in the same way. For the non-linear classi ﬁcation rules, a small number of Monte-Carlo samples are generated. In this study,three types of Bolstered error estimators, namely the Gaussian-Bolstered resubstitution error estimator, semi-Bolstered resubstitutionerror estimator, and the Gaussian Bolstered Leave-One-Out error esti-mator, have been used with linear classi ﬁers like LDA and SVC, along with non-linear classiﬁers like CART and KNN, and their results havebeen compared to identify the best performing classi ﬁer in this case. Based on the performance of the classiﬁer with utmost optimal perfor- mance, a set of recommendation rules were prescribed and a compara-tive study was done on how this proposed Machine Learning basedapproach resulted in more optimal yield as compared to the baselinemodel.2. MethodologyThe dataset which was used in this case was recorded from threecommercial aquaponic facilities located in Caldwell, Bryan, and Grimescounties in Texas, USA which are large producers of lettuce and othergreens. From the aquaponic facility at Caldwell, two water sampleswere collected per week: one from theﬁsh tank and the other from the plant bed which was used to grow Romaine Lettuce, watercress, let-tuce and green peppers. Similarly, from the facility at Bryan, three watersamples were collected: one from the Tilapia tank, one from the Gold-ﬁsh tank, and the other from the main plant bed where lettuce andkale were cultivated. The aquaponic facility at Grimes was one of thelargest in the state and four water samples were collected each week:one each from the main growth tank which was used for breeding Tila-pia and certain shrimps, one from the tank which bred bluegill ﬁsh, one from the tank which was used to grow plant seedlings and the otherfrom the main greenhouse where tomatoes, lettuce and collard greenswere grown. All of these tanks were connected together with continu-ous waterﬂow between them, and water puriﬁers were installed in each of these tanks to ensure that the recycled water meets the optimalwater quality requirements needed for growth of ﬁsh and plants. A set up where the experiments were recorded have been shown in Fig. 1. The wastewater from theﬁsh tank is connected to the main set-up,where extra nutrients are added to the aquaponic solution to optimizeplant growth. After collecting the water samples, they were sent tothe Soil, Water, and Forage Testing Laboratory, Texas A&M Universityto determine the nutrient concentration for each of the samples. Themethod used to carry out each of these nutrient concentrations in thelaboratory is described as follows inTable 1. This process was carried out each week for 9 months and then thedata were analysed. Before explaining the analysis part, a pipeline onhow the data was processed to design the Decision Support Systemhas been elaborately stated inFig. 2below.2.1. Data analysisIn this study, a total of 143 observations were used with a total of 21predictors. The initial set included 11 predictors for chemicals namelycalcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, boron, carbonate, bicarbonate,sulfate, chloride, nitrates, and potassium (all of these measured inS.B. Dhal, M. Bagavathiannan, U. Braga-Neto et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 68 –76', '69ppm); 8 predictors that deﬁne the property of the solution namely thepH, conductivity (measured in umhos/cm), 2 measures of hardness(one measured in grams of calcium carbonate per gallon and the othermeasured in ppm), alkalinity (measured in ppm of calcium carbonate),Total Dissolved Salts (measured in ppm) and Sodium Adsorption Ratio(SAR) coupled with two categorical predictors (one stores the locationof the farm and the other stores the month in which the observationswere recorded). The months in which the data were recorded werebinned into 5 categories as follows: January to March (category I),April and May (category II), June to August (category III), Septemberand October (category IV), November and December (category V).To have a clear understanding of the data, the entire dataset wastreated with an unsupervised approach. K-means algorithm (algorithm=‘auto’, number of iterations = 600) (Likas et al., 2003) was used to classify the datapoints into either of the two classes.2.2. Dimensionality reductionAs mentioned above, due to the limited size of the dataset, it is notpossible to make accurate inferences taking all the predictors into ac-count. Thus, several dimensionality reduction techniques have beenused on the dataset to select the top predictors that de ﬁne the nutrient concentration of the aquaponic solution. The predictors which had zerovariance were removed from the dataset. Then, a correlation matrix wasconstructed between the predictors, and one of the two predictors,which had higher than 90% pair-wise correlation among them, wasremoved.Next, all the predictors with less than 5% importance in the datasetwere eliminated as they would likely incorrectly skew any inferencingmade from the dataset. As the primary goal was to bring down thesize of the dataset to 5 primary chemical predictors, Recursive FeatureElimination technique with XGBoost classi ﬁer was used, which ranked the predictors in the order of their importance. This resulted in bringingdown the size of the dataset to 5 chemical predictors. In addition to this,2 categorical predictors were also appended to the dataset, one storingthe month and the other storing the place in which the observationswere recorded. Therefore, a total of 143 observations with 7 predictorswere used to design classiﬁcation rules and carry out inferences.2.3. Data visualizationTo perform any classiﬁcation rules on a given dataset, Data Visualiza-tion is an important tool as it aids in understanding the structure of thedata. It equally helps in choosing the classi ﬁcation techniques that can be used on the dataset depending on the separability between the clas-ses. In this case, Principal Component Analysis was used. As PCA treatsthe entire analysis as an unsupervised learning approach and performsan orthogonal transformation of the data, Principal Components werecalculated to visualize the variance in the dataset.The loading matrix was analysed to determine the predictor thatcontributes the most in each Principal Component and therefore, aninference can be drawn about the relative importance of each pre-dictor from their holding values depending on the value of correla-tion, which was observed between the predictors and the respectivePCs.To further explore the interpretation from the PCs, the pairwise PCplots have been studied to infer which classi ﬁers would suit the best depending on the pattern of separability of the data. All the datapointsbelonging to class 0 have been color-coded in red and the data pointsbelonging to class 1 have been color-coded in green to have a clearvisual understanding of the binary distribution of the data.2.4. Classiﬁcation techniques and error estimation algorithmsAs stated above, the size of the dataset poses a serious issue whiledesigning the classiﬁer in this context, due to which, the classi ﬁers', 'Fig. 1.An aquaponic set-up in aquatics Green Farm, Bryan, TX showing the tank with the lettuce plant bed (Left) and The Gold ﬁsh tank which provided nutrients for the plants (Right).', 'Table 1Method of measurement of different chemical properties in the Aquaponic solution(Provin and Pitt, 2002).Sl. no.

This method of errorestimation is referred to as Bolstered Error Estimation. One of themain reasons for choosing this type of estimator is its low bias aswell as low variance. This also results in a faster estimator comparedto other resampling methods like the bootstrap ( Hesterberg, 2011). The error estimates have been calculated for each of theseestimators for the four popular classiﬁcation rules by varying the size from small to moderate-sized datasets. The basic idea is to bol-ster the original empirical distribution of the available data utilizingsuitable Bolstering kernels placed at each datapoint location.For this case, a uniform zero-mean, spherical Bolstering kernel f', 'i⋄', 'was chosen for analysis, with covariance matrices of the form σ i2Ip. In each case, there would be a family of Bolstered estimatorscorresponding to each value ofσ', 'iwhere i varies from 1 to n. Largervalues ofσ', 'iwould result in wider Bolstering kernels resulting inlower variance estimators, but after a point, bias starts to increase.Therefore, choosing the values of standard deviations (SD) for theBolstering kernels is a challenge and several approaches have beenattempted toﬁnd the best error estimator in this case whichminimizes the bias-variance trade-off.The value of SD for the Bolstering kernels is given by:σ', 'i¼d^yiðÞα', 'p,ifor i¼1,2,...,n ð1Þhere,α', 'p,iis the“constant”correction factor which is a function of thedimensionality of the dataset.d', '^yiðÞis the mean minimum distance between the points belonging to the class y', 'iand is computed using the equation:d^yiðÞ ¼∑ni¼1min', 'j≠ixi/C0x j/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C8/C9I', 'yi¼y/C18/C19 =∑ ni¼1Iyi¼y/C18/C19ð2ÞBased on the value of calculated standard deviations of these Bol-stered kernels, three types of Bolstered Error estimators namely the Bol-stered Resubstitution error, Bolstered Leave-One-Out error, and semi-Bolstered Resubstitution error estimates were calculated in conjunctionwith linear (LDA and Linear SVM) and non-linear classi ﬁers (KNN and CART), and depending on the results, an appropriate decision wasmade as to which classiﬁer would suit our purpose.3. ResultsAs stated before, the entire approach was treated as an unsupervisedapproach and the K-means algorithm (algorithm = ‘auto’,n u m b e ro fi t - erations = 600) was used to classify the observations into two classes.Out of the 143 observations used for analysis, 84 were classi ﬁed into class 0 and 59 into class 1. As it was difﬁcult to derive inferences consid- ering all the predictors, dimensionality reduction techniques were used.‘Carbonate (ppm)’was dropped as the variance was zero throughout.Then, a correlation matrix (Fig. 3) was constructed between the rest ofthe predictors.This led to the removal of 6 predictors from the dataset namely mag-nesium, both the measures of hardness, alkalinity, Total Dissolved Salts,and conductivity. Then, ExtraTreesClassiﬁer (Fig. 4)w a su s e dt oﬁnd the percentages of importance for each of the 14 predictors.Now, the predictors that had less than 5% importance were removedfrom the dataset.

In addition tothis, 2 categorical predictors were also appended to the dataset, onestoring the month and the other storing the place in which the observa-tions were recorded. Therefore, a total of 143 observations with 7 pre-dictors were used to design classiﬁcation rules and to carry out inferences.Next, visualizations were carried out on the dataset to gauge the sep-arability of the data and the classiﬁers which can be used for inferencing. Principal Component Analysis was carried out on thedataset to visualize the dataset in orthogonal projections.As inferred fromFig. 5, theﬁrst three PCs go on to explain 46.34%,34.40%, and 9.36% (total 90.1%) of the total variance in the dataset re-spectively. The loading matrix was analysed to get an idea aboutwhich predictor contributes the most in each PC and therefore, an infer-ence can be drawn about the relative importance of each predictor fromtheir holding values.FromTable 2, it can be inferred that the PLACE_CLASS,MONTH_CLASS, and the bicarbonate variables had the highest holdingvalues in the 1st, 2nd', ',and 3rd PC respectively, indicating their strongcorrelations with the respective PCs. From this, one of the strongest in-ferences that can be drawn is that both the categorical predictors, onestoring the place and the other storing the month in which the observa-tions were recorded, are the most important predictors as they showhigh holding values in theﬁrst two PCs which explain about 80% ofthe variance in the dataset.To further explore the interpretation from the PCs, the pairwise PCplots (Fig. 6) have been studied to infer which classi ﬁers would suit the best depending on the pattern of separability of the data. All thedatapoints belonging to class 0 have been color-coded in red andthose belonging to class 1 in green, giving a clear visual understandingthat the data follows a binary distribution.From the PC plots, it has been observed that most of the discrimina-tory information is contained in theﬁrst PC, as expected, as it explains most of the variance in the dataset.Next, due to the low sample size, there is a high probability ofoverﬁtting the data because of which, the notion of different Bolsterederror estimators has been introduced in this domain. The performanceof linear classiﬁers like LDA and Linear SVM along with the performanceof non-linear classiﬁers like CART (Depth = 2) and 3-NN have beenused along with these Bolstered error estimators, and results havebeen discussed below. The value of the depth of the decision tree waschosen as 2 due to the low volume of the dataset as a higher value ofthe depth would result in overﬁtting the data and lead to unreasonablyhigh accuracy on the training dataset. The value of the K for the K-Nearest Neighbor was chosen to be 3 using Elbow method as themean cluster distance on the training dataset was optimal.3.1. Bolstered resubstitution error estimationThis type of error is calculated as the sum of all error contributionsdivided by the total number of points. For a linear classi ﬁer where the decision boundary is a hyperplane, the analytical expressions for the in-tegrals were calculated. For the non-linear classi ﬁers, a small number of Monte-Carlo samples were generated (M = 10).

However, when the error estimateis made for non-linear classiﬁers like CART and KNN, an approximate so-lution is needed which is obtained by applying Monte-Carlo integration.The error estimates for all the four classiﬁers i.e. LDA, KNN(K = 3), CART and Linear SVM have been tabulated and the results are shownbelow. The value of N i.e. the number of randomly sampled datapointshas been varied from 20% to 100% in increments of 10 for each of theclassiﬁers.As shown inFig. 7, the Bolstered Error Estimates reduced from 8% to2.5% for LDA when the size of the sample set increased. For the non-linear classiﬁers, it can be observed that they overﬁt the training set due to their minuscule size thereby increasing the chance of the classi-ﬁer performing badly on the testing set. Therefore, a decision not to pro-ceed with either of these classiﬁers was made using Bolstered Errorresubstitution as it is very likely to overﬁt when the size of the dataset is small.Here, the opposite is observed when a linear SVC is used with differ-ent values of penalty parameters (Table 3). Irrespective of the amount of data, the error estimates for each of the classi ﬁers are around 50% which makes it unsuitable to be used as an ideal classi ﬁer for the separation of data between the classes as it showcases an ideal case of under ﬁtting.3.2. Bolstered leave one out (BLOO) error estimationAs the name suggests, in this type of error estimation, the classi ﬁers are trained on each subset separately. Every subset contains all the datapoints belonging to one particular class except one which is used as thetest datapoint. Therefore, in a binary classi ﬁcation problem, ifm datapoints belong to class 0 andndatapoints belong to class 1, therewill be a total ofm-1 subsets for class 0 andn-1 subsets for class 1; and the classiﬁers will be trained separately on all of them. In the end,an aggregate of the error on each of these subsets is calculated to ﬁnd out the total Bolstered Leave One Out Error estimate for each of theseclassiﬁers.', 'Fig. 6.(a), (b) and (c).

For the non- linear classiﬁers where the integrals cannot be computed exactly, aMonte-Carlo approach is used toﬁnd out the error estimates.The BLOO error estimates for LDA, KNN, and CART have been calcu-lated for each of the classiﬁers and have been shown inFig. 8. From the aboveﬁgure, it can be observed that as the size of thedataset increases from 20% to 100%, the value of the BLOO error estimatedeclines to less than 1%. This makes the BLOO error estimate an unrea-sonable metric to be used both in conjunction with either linear ornon-linear classiﬁers. In the case of Linear SVM, the BLOO error estimatecould not be calculated. This is because the BLOO error estimate is calcu-lated on a single class of data at a time and aggregates the error esti-mates in the end, but SVM works on the principle of separatinghyperplane between the classes which makes it impossible to train ona single class of data. Therefore, the third type of error estimate,known as the Semi-Bolstered Error Estimation, is proposed which is dis-cussed in detail in the next sub-section.3.3. Semi-bolstered resubstitution error estimationSometimes, in the case of small datasets, there is a high chance of in-creasing the optimism of the error estimate due to over ﬁtting classiﬁca- tion rules. So, it is not a good idea to spread the incorrectly classi ﬁed datapoints. Therefore, to reduce the bias of the estimator, σ', 'iis assigned to 0 for the incorrectly classiﬁed datapoints. This increases variance because there is less bolstering, which has proven to improvethe bias-variance trade-off when trained with non-linear classi ﬁers. Therefore, the semi-Bolstered resubstitution error estimation techniquehas been implemented with the linear and non-linear classi ﬁers stated above, and the results have been discussed in the tables below.FromFig. 9, it is evident that the semi-Bolstered resubstitution errorvalues for LDA, CART, and KNN are almost negligible (approachingzero). Therefore, it can be stated that owing to the small size of thedataset, even reducing the bias of the estimator by assigning the Stan-dard Deviation of the Bolstering kernel for the incorrectly classi ﬁed data points to zero does not work as they tend to over ﬁt the classiﬁers. Contrary to the above, when the same dataset was trained using Lin-ear SVC with Semi-Bolstered resubstitution as the error metric, thevalues of error estimates seemed reasonable ( Table 4) It can be ob- served that when Linear SVM was trained using 100% of the data, thesemi-Bolstered error estimates remained constant irrespective of thevalues of the penalty parameter used. Therefore, it was decided to pro-ceed with Linear SVC with the penalty parameter set to 1 and Semi-Bolstered resubstitution as the error estimate.Based on the value of this Machine Learning model which either out-puts 0 or 1, a set of recommended rules have been prescribed to regulatethe nutrient parameters in the aquaponic solution which have beenstated inTable 5.4. DiscussionThe main motivation behind using this entire approach is designinga recommendation system so that the users of the hydroponic set-upsget an alert on the appropriate levels of nutrient concentrations thatshould be maintained to obtain the maximum yield. To achieve this,the training dataset has been used to design the approach. From thevalues of the pre-recorded observations, a set of rules were developedfor both the classes.For the observations to which the output class was 0, a certain set ofinferences can be made. The period in which we are most likely to re-ceive this output is generally during the Spring and Summer months(January to August). During these months when the temperatures in-crease (to about 80 F in a typical year), the concentration of nutrientsin water also increase due to evaporation and often results in nutrientimbalance in the aquaponic solution. The electrical conductivity of thesolution declines fast, which is addressed by addition of potassium tomaintain conductivity at 350 umhos/cm. During these months, thegrowth of both the crop and theﬁsh is much slower when comparedto the winter months; therefore, caution needs to be exercised to bal-ance the nutrient concentrations of the solution while trying to keepthe hardness of the solution as low as possible. Another important con-sideration is the concentration of magnesium in the solution as it is oneof the important constituents ofﬁsh culture. Since the goal during thespring and summer months is mostly to sustain the ﬁsh rather than grow them, a concentration of 1 ppm of magnesium is enough for theaquaponic solution. Lastly, the concentration of sodium should be keptat a maximum of 60 ppm since sodium increases water salinity, whichdirectly impacts the growth of green leafy vegetables.Similarly, for the observations with output class 1, irrigation is likelydone during autumn and winter months (September to December).During these months as the atmospheric temperatures fall to an averageof 50 F, evaporation slows down and as a result, the conductivity and', '00.511.522.533.5', '20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1000.692.323.162.541.1110.860.781.2602.861.70.230.150.090.080.060.053.212.161.930.90.80.680.480.470.38Bolstered Leave-One-Out Error estimates for LDA, CART and KNN', 'LDA CART (Depth=2) KNN (K=3)', 'Percentage of data taken for experimentssetamitserorrEOOLderetsloB', 'Fig. 8.Bolstered leave-one-out error estimates for LDA, CART, and KNN.S.B.

Any increase in these prop-erties can increase the hardness of the solution, resulting in eutrophica-tion (Glibert et al., 2005). To control this and maintain the hardness ofthe solution within 140 ppm, anoxic mixers need to be installed to de-nitrify the wastewater with the use of bacteria, which breaks downthe nitrates to release oxygen and nitrogen gas ( Peng et al., 2008). Based on this set of recommendations, two different types oftemperature-controlled environments were set up, one with a temper-ature of 75 F to replicate Texas summers and the other with a tempera-ture of 45 F to replicate Texas winters. The nutrient concentrations ofthe aquaponic solution were regulated as per the above recommenda-tions and the observations are listed as follows. In the ﬁrst tank, lettuce was grown using the recommended nutrient concentrations. It was ob-served that the harvest time for lettuce decreased to 4 weeks as com-pared to 6 to 8 weeks when cultivated using traditional aquaponictechniques. There was also a signiﬁcant increase in the yield and sizeof lettuce and some were as large as 40 –45 in. in diameter which were signiﬁcantly bigger compared to the ones grown in the soil orthe unregulated aquaponic solution. Kale was grown in the secondtank and similar to that of lettuce, the growth period was reducedfrom 12 weeks to 4.5 weeks.Kledal et al. have stated that the pH needs to be maintained between6.5 and 8 by maintaining a balance between the chemical concentra-tions of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, calcium, magnesiumand heavy metals namely iron, manganese, boron, copper, zinc and mo-lybdenum to facilitate growth of microbes in the aquaponic solutionwhich is vital for nutrient uptake by plants ( Kledal et al., 2019). How- ever, the ideal range of nutrients that should be maintained in the solu-tion has not been discussed by Kledal et al., and our work can be viewedas a quantiﬁcation to facilitate theﬁndings that were made in this paper.Likewise, Nozzi et al. have compared the nutritional quality of lettuce,mint and mushroom herbs grown in three different aquaponic set-upswith varying amounts of additional macronutrients and nutrient uptakefromﬁsh feed, but there has been no concrete explanation for how nu-trient addition in each case supplemented the growth of these plants(Nozzi et al., 2018). In our case, a proper description of how the pro-posed recommendations of the Machine Learning model affected thequality of the crops in the aquaponic solution, as compared to the base-line model, has been elaborately discussed.This is theﬁrst study of its kind to use AI for optimizing nutrient con-centrations in aquaponic solution. Our proposed method is much supe-rior to the conventional methods of growing plants in aquaponics as itemphasizes on quantifying the regulation of nutrients and routine mon-itoring according to the month in which the crops are grown. The num-ber of nutrients that need to be regulated in the aquaponic solution asmentioned before were chosen using feature selection and dimension-ality reduction techniques, and weﬁnalizedﬁve most important chem- ical parameters from the initial set of 20 parameters, which resulted inreducing the cost of nutrients by around 75%. Further, the AI modelwe developed here is scalable and could be implemented in aquaponicoperations at various sizes. Our model also overestimates the possibilityof toxicity to the plants andﬁsh, which in fact ensures produce quality.The most important issue which has been addressed by automation inaquaponics is the cost incurred due to human labor as aquaponicsonly involves an initial cost of setting up the farm and water puri ﬁcation units for each of the tanks, with the only recurring cost being the cost in-curred with utilities.However, the approach presented here does have some limitations.The sparse data makes it difﬁcult to gauge the structure of the data forapplying any Bayesian statistical approaches. This can be compensatedwith an increase in the volume of the dataset, which needs to be ad-dressed in future. Another limitation is the weather conditions inwhich the observations were recorded, i.e. all the three aquaponicfarms were located in Southeast Texas, with warm summers and mildwinters. Addition of data from geographical locations with much morevariable weather conditions is expected to further improve the robust-', 'ness of the model presented here.', '024', '20304050607080901000.038.97E-102.48E-128.53E-125.16E-1800003.573.11.751.691.1610.860.780.693.573.11.751.41.1610.860.780.69Semi-Bolstered Resubstitution error estimates for LDA, CART, and KNN', 'LDA CART (Depth=2) KNN (K=3)', 'Percentage of data taken for experimentsSemi-Bolstered n', 'oitutitsbuseR Error          estimates', 'Fig. 9.Semi-bolstered resubstitution error estimates for LDA, CART, and KNN.', 'Table 4Semi-bolstered resubstitution error estimates for linear SVM with varying values of pen-alty parameter (C).Sl no N C = 1 2 3 5 10 20 1001 20 15.2 17.94 22.28 22.37 17.7 13.8 18.22 30 16.3 18.66 16.34 11.76 21.3 18.9 14.13 40 14.04 21.06 17.57 21.97 14.3 21.1 24.74 50 19.71 22.54 12.69 18.39 19.8 15.6 23.15 60 17.44 12.85 19.87 17.47 23.3 12.7 17.46 70 19 16.01 21 18.06 17 16.1 207 80 19.13 19.13 17.39 19.13 19.1 20 208 90 19.53 20.31 18.7 17.97 17.2 19.5 18.89 100 18.18 18.18 18.18 18.18 18.2 18.2 18.2', 'Table 5Recommendation system for each predicted class.Nutrient concentrations Class 0 Class 1Magnesium (ppm) 1 12Sodium (ppm) 60 320Conductivity (umhos/cm) 350 1970Hardness (ppm of calcium carbonate) 27 140S.B.

ConclusionFrom the above experimental results, it can be concluded that theSemi-Bolstered resubstitution Error estimation technique works bestwith Linear SVC as the classiﬁer with the value of penalty parameterset to 1. A set of recommendations have also been prescribed for eachof the predicted classes, which have been discussed in detail in thispaper. It has been veriﬁed experimentally as to how the proposed rec-ommendations positively impacted plant and ﬁsh growth in a single system. In the future, more attention would be paid on how the concen-tration of heavy metals affects the growth of plants in aquaponic envi-ronments. Moreover, the success of the classi ﬁcation technique presented here can be extended to other data-depleted domains,which is another contribution of this paper.Credit authorship contribution statementSambandh Bhusan Dhal:Conceptualization, Methodology, Soft-ware, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Datacuration, Writing–original draft, Writing–review & editing, Visualiza- tion.Muthukumar Bagavathiannan:Conceptualization, Validation, Writing–review & editing.Ulisses Braga-Neto:Methodology, Soft- ware, Investigation, Project administration.

IntroductionBlueberries constitute an important crop, covering an estimated areaof >76,000 ha in Canada, and distributed among >3500 farms ( Statistics Canada, 2018). During the 2014 to 2018 production years, these farmsproduced an average of ca. 190,000 T annually ( Statistics Canada, 2019). This amounted to an average of ca. CAD 253 million in farmgate price over the same duration (Statistics Canada, 2019). It is also in- dicated that wild blueberry makes up ca. 30% of the North Americanblueberry production(Yarborough, 2017)–proving the economic sig- niﬁcance of wild blueberry production.Due to the wild and perennial nature of wild blueberry plants, cul-tural practices of weed control are meagre to nonexistent. This necessi-tates reliance on herbicides for weed control. As a result, millions ofdollars are spent by the industry on herbicides ( Esau et al., 2016). It is widely recognized that site-speciﬁc agrochemical application re- duces the economic as well as environmental costs incurred in wildblueberry production (Chang et al., 2012;Tian and Reid, 1999). Various investigations on weed detection methods were made and varyingdegrees of success achieved using different technologies, in differentcropping systems, including wild blueberry.These technologies included digital colour image based co-occurrence matrix algorithm to classify wild blueberry plantationscenes into bare patches, weed or plant ( Chang et al., 2012); ultrasonic ranging to differentiate between wild blueberry plants, weeds and barepatches (Swain et al., 2009); Gabor wavelets to differentiate betweenbroad leaf and grassy weeds (Tang et al., 2003) and discrete wavelet transforms of digital images for the development of site-speci ﬁch e r b i - cide application (Tian and Reid, 1999).Among these, those systems utilizing digital image classi ﬁcation are reported to demonstrate the ability to identify weeds and bare patchesmore effectively irrespective of plant or weed height ( Chang et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2003;Tian and Reid, 1999). Particularly, in wild blueberryﬁelds, image based spot application of fertilizer ( Chang et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2014), herbicide (Esau et al., 2016;Esau et al., 2014a; Chang et al., 2012)a n df u n g i c i d e(Esau et al., 2014b) were investigated in more recent studies, and promising results obtained.However, the features extracted in the digital image based tech-niques were largely dependent on colour variations, a parameter thatis affected by lighting and plant conditions ( Yazawa, 1977). These ef- fects, coupled to variations in camera settings and potential similaritiesin colour between blueberry and weed plants, and the promising resultsArtiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 72 –81', '⁎Corresponding author.E-mail addresses:gayalew@niagaracollege.ca,gayalew@addisscience.net(G.

For instance, it has been shown that chlorophyll estimation ispossible from the ratio, (Red−Blue)/(Red+Blue), of colour compo- nents of wheat and rye crop images under different weather conditions(Kawashima and Nakatani, 1998), nitrogen deﬁciency in barley (Pagola et al., 2009), and yield in wild blueberry (Swain et al., 2010). It is, there- fore, held that colour based preprocessing will aid in accentuating dif-ferences between plants and weeds.The Gabor wavelet transform enables the analysis of image scenesboth in spatial and frequency domains ( Daugman, 1985). Selection of this technique for the current study is inspired by previous successfulinvestigations byTang et al. (2003)andTian and Reid (1999), in the identiﬁcation of isolated broad-leaved and grassy weeds; Tian et al. (2000), on identiﬁcation of weeds interspersed with corn plants; andKurtulmus et al. (2014), on the detection of immature peach. It is tobe noted that wavelet transform of images is an established techniqueof multi-resolutionﬁltering to extract textural features. As such it canbe thought of as an“orientation and scale tunable”line and edge detec- tor (Manjunath and Ma, 1996).A Gabor wavelet transform of an image is obtained by its convolu-tion with a Gabor waveletﬁlter. Waveletﬁlters, as applied to images, are designed to selectively pass regions containing a certain size and ori-entation of a given shape structure. For instance, a wavelet transform,based on a mother wavelet designed to pass elliptic shapes, would pri-marily allow the passage of similarly shaped and sized objects withclose orientation to the particularﬁlter (Castleman, 1996;Daugman, 1988). In Gabor wavelet transforms such mother wavelet is generatedby a Gabor function given (Manjunath and Ma, 1996)a s :gx,yðÞ¼', '12πσ', 'xσy/C18/C19exp−12x2', 'σ2xþy2', 'σ2y !þ2πjWx\"# ð1Þand its Fourier transform, given (Manjunath and Ma, 1996)b y :Gu,vðÞ ¼exp−', '12u−WðÞ2', 'σ2uþv2', 'σ2v\"#() ð2Þwhereσ', 'u=1 / 2πσ x,σv=1 / 2πσ y,a n dσ xandσ yare scale factors along thexandydimensions, respectively. The self-similar Gabor wavelet ﬁl- ters are produced through scaling and rotation of the mother waveletdescribed in Eq.1according to the equations:g', 'mnx,yðÞ ¼a−mgx0,y0ðÞx', '0¼a−mxcosθþysinθðÞy', '0¼a−m−xsinθþycosθðÞ ð3Þwhereθ=nπK,a>1 ,m,n= 0,1,2,…,a n dKis the total number of ori- entations, and the scale factora', \"−mis included to ensure independence ofspectral energy onm–the scale for a particularﬁlter (Manjunath and Ma, 1996). The Gaussian envelope that is responsible for the shape ofthe function is evident from Eq.2. It is shown by (Manjunath and Ma, 1996;Daugman, 1988;Daugman, 1985) that redundancy of information inﬁltered images is reduced by ensuring that the half-peak amplitudes ofﬁlter responses (for the given set of scale and orientation parameters) donot overlap.Daugman (1985)also shows that two-dimensional Gaborﬁlters are optimal in the sense that they closely approach the theoreti-cally attainable limit of minimum joint uncertainty in space and fre-quency. Detailed treatment of the subject is available elsewhere(Manjunath and Ma, 1996;Daugman, 1993;Daugman, 1988). Once images are convolved with the given bank of Gabor ﬁlters, the mean and standard deviations of the transformed images are computedas features of the image, for the given scale and orientation ( Manjunath and Ma, 1996).This study aimed at the assessment of the potential of Gabor waveletfeatures for automatic classiﬁcation of digital color scenes from wildblueberryﬁelds.2. Materials and methods2.1. Wild blueberryﬁelds and imaging conditionsDigital color images were collected fromﬁve wild blueberry produc- tionﬁelds located in central Nova Scotia, Canada. Table 1provides data on theﬁelds and the images collected.Field 1 was in its fruit year, and was made up of predominantlydense plant patches–some plants being inﬂorescent. The lighting con- dition was a mid-day sunlight. Some of the blueberry leaves had huesranging from yellow to pink. The predominant weed in this ﬁeld was goldenrod (Solidago spp.). Dead grassy and woody plant materialswere visually classiﬁed as bare patches.Field 2 and Field 3 were in their vegetative year, and the lighting con-dition was cloudy in both cases. They generally consisted of sparselypopulated wild blueberry plants interspersed with weeds and barepatches. Predominant weeds were lamb's-quarters ( Chenopodium album L.), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella L.,b o t hv e g e t a t i v ea n di nﬂores- cence), goldenrod, poplar (Populus spp.) spreading dogbane (Apocynum androsaemifolium), mouse-eared hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella L.)a n d a few black bulrush (Scirpus atrocinctus).Field 4 was in its fruit year, with scattered colony of dense wild blue-berry plants. The lighting condition was a mid-afternoon sunlight. Pre-dominant weeds were sheep sorrel, lamb's-quarters, goldenrod andwire grass (Danthonia spicata (L.) Beauv.). Bare patches comprised of bare soil and areas covered with dead plant remains.Field 5 was in its fruit year, and the lighting condition was an earlyafternoon sunlight. Predominant weeds were goldenrod and sheep sor-rel, the inﬂorescence of the latter being dominant. A few incidences ofwire grass also existed. Some wild blueberry plant colonies had pre-dominantly pink leaves, and others had yellowish colored leaves. Themajority, however, had leaves with a mixture of these colors. In fewother cases, the blueberry leaves at the shoot apex had hues rangingfrom yellow to pink. Some bare patches were covered with dead grassand woody weeds, others constituted completely bare soil.Anonymous (2019),LeBlanc and McCully (2005)andSampson et al. (1990)were used as references for the identiﬁcation of weed.2.2. Acquisition and preprocessing of imagesWild blueberry canopy images were acquired using an IDS μEye 1220SE/C industrial camera (IDS Imaging Development Systems Inc.,Woburn, MA 01801, USA),ﬁtted with an LM4NCL C-mount lens(Kowa Optimed Inc., Torrance, CA 90502, USA), with 3.5 mm focallength and set at an aperture off/4. The camera was kept approximatelyat 1.2 m above the ground surface. Resolution of the collected imageswas 720 × 128 pixel, and stored in the 24-bit colour bitmap format.The 720 × 128 pixel images wereﬁrst divided into two 360 × 128 pixel regions, and then each was further divided into three regions of\", 'Table 1Wild blueberryﬁelds and scene characteristics.Field Stage of growth Number of images PriorsBARE PLANT WEEDField 1 Fruit year⁎108 11 67 30 Field 2 Vegetative year⁎⁎999 100 651 248 Field 3 Vegetative year 1110 117 608 385Field 4 Fruit year 411 12 11 388Field 5 Fruit year 653 65 387 201Pooled Mixed 3281 305 1724 1252⁎The growth year immediately before harvest.⁎⁎The growth year following harvest and subsequent mowing of the stand.G.

Overlapping patches of 12 × 128 pixel regions wereallowed between consecutive 128 × 128 pixel regions to avoid the re-quirement for zero padding for use with the Fast Fourier Transform(Gonzalez and Wintz, 1987). Each of these 128 × 128 pixel regionscorresponded approximately to a ground surface area of 27.5 cm ×27.5 cm.Fig. 1shows representative images from theﬁveﬁelds. Due to dependence on plant (Yazawa, 1977) and lighting conditions (Kawashima and Nakatani, 1998), it was decided to use differences and/or ratios of the primary color components, Red (R), Green (G) and Blue(B). 2D arrays were populated with numerical ﬁgures derived according to the relationships given in Eqs.4a–4j, and subsequently Gabor trans-formed to enable the computation of features used to carryout sceneclassiﬁcation. Eqs.4ato 4 are due toKawashima and Nakatani (1998), whereas Eq.4jrepresented the difference in the magnitude of theGreen component on one hand and the Red and the Blue componentson the other, and is applied in the differentiation of green plants andsoil (Hamuda et al., 2016).Redratio,RR¼R=RþGþBðÞ ð 4aÞ Green ratio,GR¼G=RþGþBðÞ ð 4bÞ Blue ratio,BR¼B=RþGþBðÞ ð 4cÞ Red−Green normalized index,RGI¼R−GðÞ=RþGðÞ ð4dÞ Red−Blue normalized index,RBI¼R−BðÞ=RþBðÞ ð4eÞ Green−Blue normalized index,GBI¼G−BðÞ=GþBðÞð4fÞ Red−Green ratio,RGR¼R−GðÞ=RþGþBðÞ ð 4gÞ Red−Blue ratio,RBR¼R−BðÞ=RþGþBðÞð4hÞ Green−Blue ratio,GBR¼G−BðÞ=RþGþBðÞ ð 4iÞ Excess Green,ExG¼2G−0:8R−1:2B', 'ð4jÞ2.3. Visual classiﬁcation of scenesArguably, the most popular approach for classi ﬁcation of wild blue- berryﬁeld scenes is along whether they are bare patch, all wild blue-berry plants or weed (or weed interspersed with wild blueberryplants) (Chang et al., 2012;Swain et al., 2010;Zaman et al., 2009). To fa- cilitate the visual classiﬁcation of wild blueberry scenes along the abovescheme quickly and consistently, a GUI-based tool was developed andused (Fig. 2).The user would choose whether to start a new classi ﬁcation task or to resume an ongoing one. This would allow the user to open an appro-priateﬁle, containing a list ofﬁles to begin a new task, or a decisionﬁle to resume a previous task, respectively. The user would then choose theimage with which to begin the classiﬁcation. The six parts of the se- lected image would then be displayed in the respective windows. The', 'Fig. 1.Sample images from eachﬁeld.', 'Fig. 2.Custom made visual classiﬁcation tool.G. Ayalew, Q.U. Zaman, A.W. Schumann et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 72 –81', '74user would then click on the button below each of the image segmentsto toggle the class of the concerned image segment. The classes areBARE, PLANT, WEED and DEFER, where the last class is applied whenthe image is considered unﬁt due to such effects as motion blur or par-tial shadow. The term“weed”refers to the usual deﬁnition in agronomy. Relative abundance of weeds was not considered in designating a sceneas WEED–presence of any recognizable amount of weed suf ﬁced. The results of visual classiﬁcation were then recorded to an ASCII de-cisionﬁle where each segment was identiﬁed with a unique name.2.4. Extraction of Gabor wavelet featuresFig. 3is a pictorial representation of the workﬂow for the feature ex- traction, and statistical classiﬁcation. Each derived (preprocessed)image wasﬁltered with a bank of Gabor waveletﬁlters computed with designated lower (U', 'l) and higher (U h) frequencies selected to be 0.1 and 0.5, respectively (Manjunath and Ma, 1996). Four levels of ori- entation, and ten levels of scale were chosen. The mean ( μ-features) and standard deviation (σ-features) of the magnitudes of each of theGabor transformed derived image segments were eventually computedto represent features for the given set of parameters in a similar fashionas inManjunath and Ma (1996),Daugman (1988),a n dDaugman (1985). Feature data were recorded in an ASCIIﬁle with each image seg- ment given a unique name.All computation required for feature extraction was carried out withcustom programs coded in theC/C', '++programming languages. How- ever, we would like to acknowledge the use of a modi ﬁed version of Manjunath and Ma (1996)’s code to design the Gabor waveletﬁlters. One major modiﬁcation was the creation of aﬁlter dictionary at the global scope and use its portion that relates to a particular combinationof scale and orientation as required –rather than re-creatingﬁlters for every image segment.2.5. Statistical analysisThe unique names provided in the two ASCII ﬁles mentioned above (one from visual classiﬁcation, the other from Gabor wavelet feature ex-traction) were used to match visual classes with computed features.Matched data from the twoﬁles, excluding those with a“DEFER”class, were then used for discriminant analysis.A step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) was carried out oneach of the groups of images collected from the ﬁelds. Wavelet feature selection was carried out using the stepclass() function of the klaR pack-age (Weihs et al., 2005) for R. The criteria for selection was accuracy,with a threshold of incremental improvement of 0.1%. The direction forselecting features was set to“both”(i.e., adding features to, or removingfeatures from the LDA model as feature selection proceeded), and cross-validation was based on a leave-one-out strategy. The same process wasrepeated for the pooled data set from allﬁelds.2.6. Overall and contextual accuracy of classi ﬁcationEvery individual scene that crossed over to another class accordingto the SLDA was automatically identiﬁed and counted. Overall accuracy,referred to as“accuracy”in short, was quoted as the percentage of cor-rectly classiﬁed scenes out of the total number of scenes. In addition, toput the signiﬁcance of accuracy of classiﬁcation in the context of practi- cal applications, two hypothetical agrochemical applications were con-sidered: herbicide and fertilizer. The Tanimoto Similarity Criterion(Ayalew et al., 2004), as adapted to take the form shown in Eqs. 5a n d 6, respectively, was used to measure the accuracy for a hypotheticalsite-speciﬁc application of herbicide and fertilizer. The criterion wouldassume values between 0.0% (complete failure), and 100% (completesuccess).', 'Fig. 3.Illustration of the Gabor wavelet based classi ﬁcation procedure.G. Ayalew, Q.U. Zaman, A.W.

These 36 features, despiteresulting in lower accuracy, would enable the design of a simpler systemfor a hypothetical sprayer or fertilizer spreader without the need to re-conﬁgure the system for a particularﬁeld.With regard to classiﬁcation accuracy, the highest value wasattained by Field 4, at 98.3%, and the least, by the set at 81.4%. Resultsachieved in this study were comparable with those attained with thecolour co-occurrence matrix based texture analysis technique reportedbyChang et al. (2012).In addition, as it can be seen fromFig. 4andTable 2, misclassiﬁcation between plant and weed samples was the most pronounced. As a result,bare patches were more accurately classiﬁed in comparison to plant and weed scenes. This may be explained in terms of the fact that both plantand weed groups are made up of live plants that share similar hues andare generally broad leaved. On the contrary, bare patches were mostlybrownish soil, or brown plant debris that may also occasionally includetwigs without leaves. This is evident from Fig. 4that greater separation existed between bare patches on one hand and weed and plant sceneson the other with respect to theﬁrst LDA coefﬁcients (LDA1). It was with respect to the second LDA coefﬁcients (LDA2) that separation existed between plants and weeds, albeit incompletely in some cases.As can be expected, the accuracy of SLDA classi ﬁcation for images was lower than that of any of the individualﬁelds.The contextual classiﬁcation accuracy for herbicide and fertilizer ap-plications are shown inTable 3. Due to an incidentally high weed priors,and low weed misclassiﬁcation rate, Field 4 exhibited the highest con-textual accuracy for herbicide application. On the contrary, this groupexhibited the lowest contextual accuracy for fertilizer, owing to 4 outof 11 missed plant scenes.With only one out of 67 plant priors misclassi ﬁed as bare patch, and 1 out of 30 weed misclassiﬁed as plant, Field 1 exhibited the highestcontextual accuracy with respect to fertilizer. Field 1 also exhibitedone of the highest contextual accuracy for herbicide, with only 1 outof 11 weed scene misclassiﬁed as plant.Field 5 also exhibited a large discrepancy between the two contex-tual accuracyﬁgures. Low herbicide contextual accuracy resulted dueto 48 out of 201 of weed misclassiﬁed to plant, 2 to bare patch, 1 frombare patch, and 21 from plant. On the other hand, contextual accuracywith respect to fertilizer was higher due to a proportionally lower mis-classiﬁcation of plant scenes in the form of 22 missed plants and 50 falseplants. Field 2 and Field 3 performed moderately with regard to contex-', 'tual accuracy.As with accuracy of classiﬁcation, the contextual accuracyﬁgures are higher for classiﬁcation based on individual scene SLDA, compared withthose based on pooled scene SLDA. It can, therefore, be argued that asimple system can be designed with the LDA parameters for the pooledTable 2Classiﬁcation performance.Fields Scenes Features Misclassi ﬁcationsAcc.(%) B→PB→WP→BP→WW→BW→P TotalField 1 108 27 98.1 0 0 1 0 0 1 2Field 2 999 53 89.8 7 5 5 24 3 58 102Field 3 1110 53 87.9 4 0 7 34 9 80 134Field 4 411 31 98.3 0 2 1 3 1 0 7Field 5 653 72 88.5 2 1 1 21 2 48 75Pooled', '∗3281 36 81.4 14 22 38 157 25 353 609Keys: Acc.(%) = accuracy in percent; B = BARE; P = PLANT; W = WEED;Misclassiﬁcations: X→Y≡visual scene X misclassiﬁed as scene Y according to SLDA;', '∗Pooled before SLDA and treated as a stand-alone ﬁeld data.', 'Table 3Classiﬁcation performance in terms of the Tanimoto SimilarityCriterion in the context of herbicide (T', 'CH) and fertilizer (T CF).Field T', 'CH(%) T CF(%)Field 1 96.7 97.1Field 2 67.5 86.9Field 3 70.6 81.9Field 4 98.5 63.6Field 5 67.7 83.5Pooled 61.1 73.1', 'Fig. 5.Plot of count of features against orientation grouped by ﬁeld, and sorted in descending order.G.

The effects of orientation and scaleFig. 5shows the number of features selected for each level of the ori-entation parameter, for eachﬁeld, and sorted in descending order. Ken-dall correlation test was carried out to test if there is any order ofpreference, hence rank correlation between ﬁelds with regard to the numbers of features for each orientation parameter. Fig. 7(a) shows the correlogram of Kendall-τvalues forﬁelds with respect to rank of selected orientations.Generally, the number of features grouped according to orientationshows a very weak, or nonexistent correlation between ﬁelds, asshown in the Figure. Only one of the correlations is found to be signi ﬁ- cant at the level of 0.05. This was the correlation between the set andField 3. Even in this case, it could be argued that it is attributed to thebias caused by the highest membership of Field 3 in the set.As the result of this weak correlation, and with the anecdotal knowl-edge of random orientation of leaves of wild blueberry and weed plants,it is concluded that the effect of orientation on the selection of featuresis of a statistically random nature.Like the case for orientation, a rank correlation was carried out be-tween theﬁelds in terms of the order of number of features selectedfor each scale (Fig. 6), to test if there was any order of preference inthe selection of scales.Fig. 7(b) depicts the associated Kendall- τ correlogram.ComparingFigs. 7(a) and7(b), it could be seen that there is more sig-niﬁcant correlation betweenﬁelds for scale than orientation.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 5 (2021) 72 –81', '78noted that scale is animportant factor in the derivation of features, hencethe fact that more correlations were signi ﬁcant is not surprising. How- ever, weak correlations existed even in the signi ﬁcant values of Kendall-τat the level of 0.05. The correlation between Field 3 and Field5 and between Field 3 and Field 4 are low and incoherent. Therefore, itcanbeconcluded that theselection of features wasnot determined or sig-niﬁcantly affected by the scale parameter and depended very much onthe individual scenes. The reason for this disparity may be explained interms of uneven height of plants and weeds, whereby actual sizes ofleaves appear disproportionately larger or smaller than other featuresin the scene–based on their location on the tall or short plant.3.3. The effects of preprocessing operationsFig. 8shows the breakdown of features according to preprocessingoperations of images that were used as input to the Gabor feature ex-traction routine. The count of features selected was plotted againstimage preprocessing procedure, grouped by ﬁeld and sorted in de- scending order. As shown in theﬁgure, the most frequently selected fea-tures were based on normalized difference indices(Eqs. 4d to 4f), ExG (Eq.4j), Saturation, Intensity and Hue. There were also a few featuresbased on difference ratios (Eqs.4g to 4i).It is also interesting to note that Field 4 and Field 1, being the ﬁelds that exhibited the top accuracy of classiﬁcation, did not use Hue based features. Even in theﬁelds for which Hue features were selected, itwas not among the top three preprocessing operations. This may be at-tributed to the ambiguity that could result between plants and weedwith respect to Hue. Another observation is that features based on sim-ple ratios of R, G and B (Eqs.4a–4c) were not selected for classiﬁcation indicating that indices based on color differences are more reliable thanthe basic colors alone.Similar to orientation and scale, rank correlations were computedbetweenﬁelds to test if there was a preferred order of selection.

With low correlation, and insigni ﬁcance of most Kendall-τvalues at the level of 0.05 (i.e., white background cells), it canbe said that there is no signiﬁcant correlation betweenﬁelds with re- spect to selection of preprocessing operations, perhaps due to the diver-sity of colors of both plants and weeds.3.4. General discussionGiven the diversity of hues and texture features existing in a givenﬁeld depending on the stage of growth of the plant, the season, typeof weed and its stage of growth, classiﬁcation will be more accurate if it was based on the context of agrochemical, namely fertilizer, herbicide,or pesticide. Further improvement could be achieved if classi ﬁcation was based on the speciﬁc herbicide or pesticide. This would incidentallyenable the decision to fall into one of two levels (i.e., “ON”or“OFF”), and hence result in a faster processing time. In addition, the use of both theﬁrst and the second linear discriminant functions simultaneously (asshown inFigs. 4) when applied to real-time control would improve ac-curacy, albeit with a higher computational cost.Reduction of wavelet transform artifacts could be achieved withincreased resolution of scene images. Although this could improve accu-racy of classiﬁcation, it reduces processing speed, for a given hardware.Therefore, with the selection of more powerful hardware, and a properbalance between the resolution and processing speed, it would be pos-sible to apply this method for a real-time application of agrochemicals.Consistency in classiﬁcation of scenes, and hence accuracy in auto-matic operation of a sprayer system operating on the basis of the currentmethod depends on the level of coherence of distances between plantsand the camera. Greater uniformity between distances from the camerawould enable greater accuracy in the selection of scales for the Gaborwaveletﬁlters, which would in turn enable greater accuracy in classi ﬁ- cation. Perhaps a future study would be the development of an auto-matic correction for the effects of variation in plant height, wherebyleaves are scaled according to their height from the ground, to offsetthe effect of height variations.4. ConclusionsThe potential of the Gabor wavelet based texture analysis to theidentiﬁcation of wild blueberry plants, weeds, and bare patches hasbeen demonstrated. It is shown that classi ﬁcation accuracy levels in ex- cess of 90% are possible for individualﬁelds.Results show that the scale parameter has a signi ﬁcant effect on the performance of the method, hence error or variations in scale of fea-tures, such as due to variations in plant height can cause deteriorationof accuracy of classiﬁcation. On the contrary, orientation of leaves andother image constituents has a random effect, suggesting that no needto differentiate features based on orientation as long as reasonably di-verse levels of orientation (four levels in this study) have been used.Features based on normalized difference indices, excess green, satu-ration, intensity, and hue were among the most frequently selected fea-tures, showing that preprocessing based on relative colors enhances theefﬁcacy of the Gabor wavelet texture analysis.The evaluation of a conceptual system for the application of fertilizer,herbicide or pesticide based on the results of the Gabor wavelet textureclassi', 'ﬁcation shows that it is feasible to build a reasonably precise “ON”/ “OFF”control system. Further improvement is also possible if the train-ing is tuned to the active ingredient suitable for a particular weed.Further study is necessary for the assessment of the ef ﬁcacy of this technique in real-time application of agrochemicals. An improvementin classiﬁcation accuracy can be attained with the development of amechanism to automatically control the distance between the plantcanopy and the camera.Credit Author StatementGashaw Ayalew: conceptualization, data curation, formal Analysis,investigation, methodology, software development, validation, visuali-zation, writing, and editing.Qamar Zaman: funding acquisition, project administration,supervision.Arnold Schumann: funding acquisition, methodology, review,supervision.David Percival: funding acquisition, methodology.Young Ki Chang: data curation, resources, validation.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂu- ence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Oxford Frozen Foods Limited, Canada; Agri-culture and Agri-food Canada under grant NS-Agri-Futures (ACAAF) un-der ACAAF-NS0153 (2007–2010) and Department of AgricultureTechnology Development Program for jointly funding the project par-tially; and Dr. Travis Esau, Dr. Aitazaz Farooque, Mr. Kelsey Laking andMr. Scott Read for their assistance during the collection of images.

Alarmingbiases are then detected in tweets in comparison with a neutral baseline.', '1. IntroductionOpinions play a key role in decision-making processes. When acustomer chooses a product or service, he is in ﬂuenced by the views of others. Traditionally, people relied on the experiences of family membersand peers in order to make better decisions. In today ’s era of social media, individuals and groups not only exchange content and engage indiscussions, but also offer their points of view on different products,services or people. Websites such as Facebook and Twitter offer acontinuous stream of personal opinions on the most varied range oftopics. This helps people to learn about experiences of individuals allover the world.In the present day where social media has become a powerful meansfor expressing opinions, what is feared is how it is slowly programmingusers’behaviors. News, among all other means, has grown to become oneof the most inﬂuential carriers of motivated propaganda.The burgeoning of fake news is an evident side effect of this phe-nomenon. The US presidential election campaign in 2016, notably, is oneof the numerous incidents which have been plagued with this menace inrecent times. According to The Telegraph, fake news is now seen as one ofthe greatest threats to democracy, free debate and the Western order.News reporting, which functions on the ideals of objectivity, needs to berestored to its principled and lucid past.[1] Wikipedia deﬁnesmedia biasas“the perceived bias of journalists and news producers within mass media in the selection of events andstories that are reported, and how they are covered. ” Media has the power to inﬂuence opinions of masses which in turnconditions and inﬂuences their day-to-day activities. In recent years, a lotof controversy has risen over the credibility of media outlets in reportingnews. This calls for a need to detect bias in everyday news and to developa platform so that people can receive balanced and safe news.This research relies on Twitter (one of the most prominent socialnetworking medium present today) for its analysis. Tweets by mediaoutlets are indicative of the type of news they report. This study targetssome popular media outlets and journalists in India, and analyzes theirtweets. It analyzes how biased opinions are channeled and propagatedvia social media into a network of people following/consuming it. Theresearch and the proposed model can, however, be extended to othersocial media and be analyzed for a bigger social network.The study is performed in three stages. In stage one, subjectivityversus objectivity in news is investigated. Ideally, media outlets shouldreport neutral and objective news to its consumers. However, in-vestigations reveal that a large fraction of the them report subjectivenews to its consumers, thereby injecting opiniated information into thenetwork. This subjective news can be referred to as biased opinion.In stage two, the short term impact such subjective news reporting has', '* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses:swati1178@gmail.com(S.

The proposed work aims to analyze howmedia outlets subtly condition news consumers in both positive andnegative overtones i.e. the news consumers may get conditioned to be inline with the media outlet’s view on a subject, or may get conditioned tohave a completely opposite view with respect to the media outlet ’s view. It is evident from the results obtained that large number of news con-sumers develop biases towards a particular issue, as guided and condi-tioned by media outlets.Finally, having justiﬁed the need for a platform to receive safe andhealthy objective news, a system is proposed to detect alarming mediabiases by measuring their short term impact on news consumers. Aunique‘bias short term impact score ’calculation method is proposed which leverages social media metrics as extracted from media outlets andtheir followers coupled with polarity scores as obtained from stage one.To detect alarming biases, a subsequent comparison of this score with aneutral baseline is performed and this forms the third stage of thisresearch.The paper presents a comprehensive description of these three tasksin sequential order.2. Literature surveyThe task of sentiment analysis is central to all the three stages of thiswork. It forms the basis to classify and quantify the polarity of tweets inthe dataset. Therefore, this task needs to be carried out in the mostefﬁcient manner.Traditional approaches to sentiment analysis rely either on lexicon-based approaches or implementations through machine learningalgorithms.Liu [2] along with Pang and Lee [3] provided a comprehensive review of the methods used in sentiment analysis. They discussed the usage ofunigram features like term frequency, POS tagging, syntax analysis,negation handling and domain considerations while using lexicon-basedmodels. They further discussed supervised approaches by feeding thesefeatures to Naïve Bayesian or SVM (Support Vector Machines) classi ﬁers. For unsupervised methods, PMI calculations, which measure the close-ness of two words, were also examined to determine the sentiment score.Following this, Hutto and Gilbert [ 4] constructed a gold-standard sentiment lexicon–VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntimentReasoner) which was speciﬁcally attuned to microblog-like contexts. Aspart of their work, they created a rule-based model to consider thegrammatical and syntactical conventions used by humans to emphasizesentiment intensity which could be implemented irrespective of the un-derlying lexicon/algorithmic implementation. VADER was trained on adataset consisting of tweets and outperformed human raters. It general-ized more favorably than any benchmark including other lexicons ormachine learning techniques.VADER, in its comparison to lexicons which provide a binary classi-ﬁcation of words like LIWC and GI, showed better performance in thesocial media domain due to better capturing of social media speci ﬁc lexical features and a tendency to account for the sentiment intensity ofwords rather than just their binary nature. It even outperformed lexiconsconsisting of a sentiment intensity value mapping like ANEW and Sen-tiWordNet, due to lexical feature capturing for the social media domain,and being less noisy due to its gold standard i.e. human curation.Its performance was comparable to machine learning approachesinvolving SVM’s and Naïve Bayes classiﬁers, however, it had an added advantage of not requiring a training dataset, not being overly reliant onthe training dataset validity for efﬁcient feature extraction and not requiring computationally expensive processes, something, which is ahuge positive while considering the real-time nature of social media.Due to all of the above reasons accompanied with its ease of usage,VADER was identiﬁed as an aptﬁt for the use case of this work. There-fore, this proposed work uses the VADER tool in all further tasks forcalculating the sentiment scores for tweets in the dataset.2.1. Investigating subjectivity vs objectivity for news', 'In the last decade, there has been substantial research analyzing therole of news coverage by media outlets.Garon [5] studied the functional subjectivity in media coverage,speciﬁcally focusing on The Gulf War case. Prime time news reports wereobtained from news channels like CNN, TV5, CBC and CBV for a period of28 days. This was followed by systematic content analysis on each newsstory with subjectivity assessment done by qualitative indices like thedegree of portrayal of censorship and presence/absence of actual sourcesto back up stories. Following probability statistics standards whichidentiﬁed subjectivity from closely related Chi-square values, the rela-tionship between subjectivity in television news reports and the media ’s inﬂuence strategies were determined.Similarly, White [6] investigated news subjectivity by referring to aSydney Morning Herald report on a violent attack after the Gulf War. Therhetoric potential of modern English language news items was studied byobserving that the presentation of news which seemed ‘objective’ac- cording to media’s ideals of‘neutrality’,‘balance’and‘reliability’, still conveyed social evaluations and interpretations based on the author ’s personal preferences. The media ’s claim for objectivity of text wassimultaneously addressed by analyzing different sections of the newsarticle and discussing the implications of an orbital model used forreporting‘hard news’.Lex and Jufﬁnger and Granitzer [7] assessed objectivity in online news media by analyzing articles from two British newspapers, ‘The Telegraph’and‘The Guardian’. Topic independent features were usedwith standard bag-of-word models to classify articles as objective orsubjective. It was observed that topic independent features resulted in again in accuracy for cross-domain experiments, however, forsingle-domain experiments, the standard bag-of-words model withoutstopword removal and stemming provided optimal performance.This proposed work uses a simple, computationally inexpensivemethod to identify subjectivity in news tweets. It is different from theaforementioned researches as it uses an unsupervised computingapproach. The computational efﬁciency of the proposed work is attrib-uted to the simplicity of unsupervised methods over the complex su-pervised approaches (which include annotating large datasets andcomputational expense of supervised algorithms). Also, since the analysisis to be performed on a single domain, topic independent features, likethe ones implemented by Lex [7]; are not required. The subjectivity ofnews is determined by checking whether the sentiment score (obtainedfrom VADER [4]) lies within pre-established limits.2.2. Impact of reporting on news consumersVarious researches have studied the impact of subjective newsreporting on its consumers.O', '’Connell [8]; for instance, studied the reasons for fear among thecitizens of Ireland of a ‘law and order crisis’, as visible from surveys, despite low crime rates and related the cause of this misconception to thedistorted image of crime in media. Articles on crime were collected fromfour leading newspapers for a period of two months. Parameters likedate, newspaper, page number, headline, number of words, area ofarticle and the type of offence reported in the article were recorded.These parameters were used to account for the ways in which the mediainduces bias.DellaVigna and Kaplan [9] analyzed the entry of Fox News in cablemarkets and its impact on voting. Using a dataset consisting of votingdata and Fox News viewership metrics in local cable channels, its effecton the vote share in Presidential elections of 1996 and 2000 was calcu-lated. It was observed that Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7% points in thetowns that broadcasted Fox News; concluding that Fox News convinced 3to 28% of its viewers to vote for Republicans. The vote share change wasattributed to the media slant induced by Fox News by mentioning resultsof 2 previous experiments which showed that ‘evaluators of informationS. Aggarwal et al. Array 6 (2020) 100025', '2do not take sufﬁciently into account the (known) incentives of the ad-visors and are thus persuaded by their advice ’and‘small investors follow the recommendations of afﬁliated analysts, despite the conﬂict of interest of the analysts.’The proposed work in this paper banks on a similarexplanation to show conditioning among the public when they consumesubjective news tweet made by a prominent media outlet.Gerber and Karlan and Bergan [10] explored the effects on political views and behavior of media bias by conducting a natural ﬁeld experi- ment. Individuals were randomly assigned to either receive a free sub-scription to the Washington Post, Washington Times, or to a controlgroup which did not receive any newspaper. Door-to-door polling modelswere used followed by probabilistic analysis. A public opinion survey wasconducted after the 2005 Virginia gubernatorial election to ﬁnd that irrespective of the media slant, people who received newspapers had agreater tendency to vote Democrat. Also, a long-term increase in thevoter turnout was observed in the 2006 election, possibly, due tore-subscription of these newspapers. Finally, it was inferred that not onlymedia slant, but even media exposure, can cause an evocation in publicopinions.Chiang and Knight [11] also investigated the inﬂuence of media on voting in the context of newspaper endorsements by developing a sta-tistical econometric model in which voters chose candidates by resolvingtheir uncertainty over the quality of candidates by relying on endorse-ments from newspapers. The degree of in ﬂuence was found to be dependent on the credibility of the endorsement. This observation led toan interesting side-effect of the inﬂuence phenomenon where voters werefound to be sophisticated enough toﬁlter out evident biases in media, while still retaining some orientation with endorsements published incredible newspapers.This proposed work introduces an approach to determine if newsconsumers have been conditioned, by comparing the current sentimentvalue of the consumer with its previous average sentiment value. Thisdifference is then compared against a threshold to determine the extentand nature of conditioning. If considerable change is noted, the newsconsumer is said to have been conditioned, either positively ornegatively.2.3. System to detect alarming media bias and measure its impactMany theories have been proposed to measure and quantify in-clinations and biases of media outlets.Groseclose and Milyo [12] provided an objective measure of the slantof news and a comparative measure against other political actors.Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) scores, which categorize usersentiment in the range 0 (strongly conservative) to 100 (strongly liberal)were estimated for all major media outlets in the US by counting thenumber of times a media outlet cited various think tanks. These citationpatterns were compared with the number of times the Congress cited thesame think tanks in their speeches on theﬂoor of the House and Senate. The estimation was also dependent on the pre-existing adjusted ADAscores of the parliamentarians making these speeches. Finally, ADAscores were calculated for each media outlet on 2 granularity levels:sentence level, and citation level.Lin and Bagrow and Lazer [13] proposed measures to quantify theextent and dynamics of blog and mainstream media bias by focusing onstories about the 111th US Congress. A networked data model wascreated using different node sets for mainstream media, blog media andlegislators. The observed coverage of the Members of Congress was thencompared against a null model of unbiased coverage and biases withrespect to political parties, popular front runners, regions of the country,gender and ideology were investigated. Media slant was also observed inthe content of the coverage by examining links used in the text along withsentiment analysis on the textual content.An et al. [14] proposed a model to map the news media sources alonga one-dimensional political spectrum using Twitter co-subscriptions re-lationships between them. The relative position of each media source wasdetermined on a one-dimensional space by considering its distances to', 'other media sources. The distance was calculated by observing thecommon subscriber patterns. Theﬁnal co-ordinate was calculated as anADA score on the basis of its distance to some landmark media outlets,whose coordinates were already known with a high degree of con ﬁdence as calculated by Groseclose and Milyo [ 12]; which was then plotted on the one-dimensional space.Dunham [15] examined the political bias in six large daily newspa-pers. More than 25,000 references made to 12 think tanks over 18 yearsand 10 ideological frames (such as liberal, conservative or libertarian)were examined. The rate of attachment of these ideological frames tothink thanks by the means of news articles in the dataset was theninvestigated to calculate the biasness of the media source. The mediaexamined were found to be more likely to associate ideological labelswith organizations or think tanks with a conservative orientation, thanwith those having a liberal orientation, thereby, suggesting a liberal bias.This proposed work introduces a novel system to detect media biasesand measure their short term impact on news consumers. The systemforms an integral part of the platform for news consumers to receive safeand healthy objective news. Various parameters like in ﬂuence, reach and persistence of a tweet are used to calculate the Bias Short term ImpactScore (BSIS) (using a formula further explained in Section 5.3.3) which measures the‘bias-ness’of tweet. The parameters are calculated byquantifying standard Twitter actions like retweets, likes, replies andmentions.3. Subjectivity vs Objectivity in newsIt is the responsibility of media outlets to report day to day events inan unbiased and neutral manner. However, bias in selecting what toreport and concomitantly choosing a slant on a particular report plaguesthe current system. This study speciﬁcally focuses on Indian media out- lets, relying on Twitter datasets to represent biased reporting and pro-poses an approach to detect it.As mentioned earlier in Section1, the investigation can be extended to media other than Twitter as well. The domain speci ﬁcity to Twitter has been chosen for simplicity.Journalists with a large following tend to be quite in ﬂuential, with their opinions getting propagated to the masses. They can strongly affectpublic opinions with their inﬂuence having a strong correlation with thesubjectivity of their tweets. This may lead to a precarious situation wheremass opinion is dependent on the whims and personal orientations of fewjournalists and can therefore alter the political state of the country. It istherefore imperative to identify such journalists to restore the concept offree will in society.The studyﬁrst validates the assumption that media outlets providethe news consumers with opinionated news. Instead of providing fair,neutral - objective news, it is shown how various media outlets andjournalists provide subjective news. To do so, the tweets by popularmedia outlets and journalists are analyzed and checked for newssubjectivity versus objectivity. It is found that a large fraction of thetweets are subjective instead of the ideal objective nature.3.1. Data descriptionTwitter is a popular social networking and microblogging service thatallows users to post real time messages, called tweets. Tweets are shortmessages, restricted to 140 characters in length at the time of the study).With the rise of social media in India, there has been an increase inthe number of people using Twitter. Almost all media outlets and jour-nalists have veriﬁed Twitter handles, which they use periodically totweet information about various day to day happenings and events in thecountry.One such event was the Demonetization move by the Government ofIndia (GoI). On November 8, 2016, the GoI announced the Demoneti-zation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes to curb the menace of blackS. Aggarwal et al. Array 6 (2020) 100025', '3money. This provoked wide-ranging reactions from people, with someappreciating the move for its noble objectives, and some criticizing itciting the massive inconvenience that followed the announcement.The Twitter API [16] is used to fetch real time tweets from the veri-ﬁed handles of 10 media outlets and 10 journalists. A total of 4475 tweetsare collected for the subject of “Demonetization”and subsequent analysis is done. (Tweets were extracted for the period Nov 8, 2016 –Feb 16, 2017).Note:As part of this research, data was extracted for two other majorevents in the Indian context. These were:1. Odd-Even Rule in Delhi 2017 (Private vehicles could be on the roadonly on certain days, depending on their license plate number, fromJanuary 1, 2016. The scheme aimed to reduce pollution and smog inDelhi)2. Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections-2017 (Election to the 17th UttarPradesh Legislative Assembly)Upon preliminary investigation following data pre-processing (asmentioned in Section3.1), these datasets were found to be unﬁt for evaluation. This was primarily because:1. Both of these events were not as signi ﬁcant on a national scale as compared to demonetization. Demonetization was a nation-wideevent which invoked wide-ranging reactions from media outlets aswell as citizens across the country.2. Due to the regional nature of the two events, it was found that thetweets were noisy due to presence of larger proportion of regionalmedia outlets as compared to the set of media outlets studied throughthe proposed work. Post cleaning, such tweets did not have enoughcontext for further research.3. The period over which these events invoked reactions led to a muchsmaller dataset as compared to the studied dataset. Both the eventsstudied did not have long-ranging life in the media.3.1.1. Pre-processingThe raw tweets fetched in Section3.1contain noise in form of lan- guage discrepancies, improper formatting, improper punctuation, use ofmedium (here Twitter) speciﬁc symbols and emoticons etc. This warrantssome pre-processing in order to clean the tweets and make them suitablefor further computation.The steps carried out for pre-processing are enlisted as:●All URLs are replaced with a tag “URL”●All targets (For e.g.“@narendramodi”) are replaced by the username and dropping the ‘@’at the start (e.g. gets changed to“narendramodi”).●All punctuation marks occurring in the text at the start or end of aword are separated from the word to enable easier tokenization andtherefore better performance (For e.g. said ’gets changed to said ‘).3.2. Polarity scoreSentiment scores for the tweets are determined by analyzing thetweets collected using VADER. NLTK- VADER is a popular tool forsentiment analysis of social media texts. It comprises of an underlyingimplementation of a rule-based model (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014). Writtenin Python, the library is one of the most commonly used tools fordetermining the polarity or sentiment score for given text in naturallanguage. The sentiment scores obtained by VADER are used for deter-mining the polarity of text.VADER provides a polarity score ( PS) ranging from/C01 (strongly negative) to', 'þ1 (strongly positive). This range is split into 3 regions,namely positive, negative and neutral. PSvalues ranging from/C01t o /C00.33 are classiﬁed as negativePSvalues whilePSvalues ranging from0.33 to 1 are classiﬁed as positivePSvalues.PSvalues lying between /C00.33 and 0.33 are referred to as neutral PSvalues. The visualization is shown in the number line plotted below in Fig. 1. The division of the polarity score space into three distinct sectionsensures that tweets which are signiﬁcantly polar are the only ones clas- siﬁed as positively or negatively biased. It is possible that genuine tweetson Demonetization, that are fairly neutral, have a non-zero PS value. A PSbetween/C00.33&0.33 is only slightly polar, and not necessarily biased.This reduces false positives while identifying biased tweets.The pseudocode for determining polarity of text is given as below inFig. 2.3.3. ObservationsContrary to the ideal objective news, a large fraction of tweets bymedia outlets/journalists are observed to be polar or subjective in nature.Table 1below shows the observations on the dataset. Fig. 3then shows these observations in graphical format.Thus, it is concluded that instead of providing neutral/objectivenews, the tweets by media outlets are largely subjective in nature.4. ConditioningAs shown by means of the aforementioned investigation, media out-lets and journalists present news consumers with polarized opinions. Thisguidance and conditioning through subjective news articles can beasserted as the cause for news consumers to become biased towards aparticular issue. This section of the study proves this assertion and ana-lyzes the conditioning of opinions by media outlets.4.1. TerminologyBefore describing the method to analyze conditioning of opinions, afew terms are introduced below.4.2. Data descriptionThe polar tweets, as extracted from the overall tweet dataset used inSection3, forms the basis for analyzing conditioning by media outlets.Along with the data as mentioned in Section 3.1, for each polar tweet, a list of user-ids of the users who ‘react’to the given tweet is also extracted. The behavior of ‘reactors’to polar tweets as obtained from Section 3is observed to study the conditioning of opinions by the media outlets.4.3. MethodologyThe conditioning of news consumers is analyzed by observing theiractivity prior to and post the event ( E). Of all the users who consume/ view the polar news/tweet, the study relies on the ‘reactors’of the given tweet as mentioned in Section4.1and their behavior is investigated asexplained before.Each user has prior opinions on the issues that are happening aroundhim.. The prior polarity (p), as deﬁned inTable 2, of a person is calculated by the exponential moving average ( EMA) of the polarity score (PS) of its previous tweets.Exponential Moving Average (EMA)for thePSseries is calculated recursively as:pðtÞ¼a*PSðtÞþ ð1/C0aÞ*pðt/C01Þ (1) The value ofais chosen as 0.3. This is done to provide fair weightageto both the last tweet and the series of previous tweets.However, a polar tweet/news report by a media outlet can affect theuser’s opinion on the issue. The polarity in the opinion of an user mightshow a massive swing (reversing one ’s opinion) or a minor one (a small strengthening of prior opinion). Various other external events/happen-ings can be a reason for this opinion change, but the time limit of ttoS. Aggarwal et al. Array 6 (2020) 100025', '4tþ24 h is taken to ensure that the swing in opinion can be attributedlargely to the polar news consumed by the user.The post-event polarity (p’), as deﬁned inTable 2, is obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of the polarity scores of its tweets post theevent for a period of 24 h. It is assumed that the impact of conditioning isdiluted and can not be attributed with suf ﬁcient conﬁdence to twitter data after 24 h.An eventEis said to have conditioned a consumer Cif the value ofp andp’are signiﬁcantly different. The two opinionspandp’are assumed to be signiﬁcantly different if the difference of pandp’is 20% more (1.2 times) than the standard deviation in the PSsofCprior to eventE. The factor of 20% is taken to ensure that the change in polarity is signi ﬁcant, and not just an impulse in the reactor ’sPS. Only a change large enough with respect to the standard deviation is considered to be associated withthe journalist’s tweet and, therefore,ﬁt to be labelled as an act of ‘conditioning’.Note that an inﬂuence can be both positive and negative. An event E which causes a consumerCto be induced with a polarity change in linewith that of the tweet inEis said to have had a positive inﬂuence onC. Similarly, an eventEwhich causes the consumersCto be induced with a polarity change opposite to that of the tweet in Eis said to have had a negative inﬂuence onC.The pseudocode for this process is shown in Fig. 4below. The entire process can be summed up and represented using aﬂow chart as shown inFig. 5. It shows the various activities that are carriedout to examine the conditioning of news consumers by the media outlets/journalists.4.4. ObservationsThe tweets of‘reactors’are analyzed to study their behavior beforeand after the media outlets’polar tweet event. In the proposed study,tweets made by the Top 25 ‘Retweet-ers’and‘Favourit-ers’of a speciﬁc polar tweet by a media outlet/journalist are analyzed. These Top 25 re-actors are extracted with the help of the Twitter API [ 16] and web scraping techniques.Table 3below shows the statistics regarding thesetweets:The tweets of theseAR’s,a sd eﬁned inTable 2, are analyzed to investigate if and how they are conditioned. This act of conditioning canbe positive or negative as mentioned previously in Section 4.3.

Among the active reactors, 41.23% reactors are found to be conditioned.Incidentally, in this case study the number of positively and negativelyconditioned reactors turn out to be almost equal, occurring in a 52 –48 ratio.4.4.1. Sample PCAR observationAn example of how an active reactor is classi ﬁed as a positively conditioned active reactor is shown below:Example 1:Journalist’s Tweet after pre-processing: ‘Day 9: Demon- etization Death Toll Rises To 55 by DilliDurAst URL ’.Step 1:', 'Sentiment score of journalist’s tweet (as obtained from VADER(Hutto and Gilbert, 2014)):0.5994Step 2:', 'Reactor’s tweet after pre-processing: ‘The savage impact Modi’s haphazard demonetization is having on the economy ….’ Step 3:', 'Sentiment score of reactor’s tweet (as obtained from VADER):0.4588Step 4:', 'Previous average sentiment score of the reactor: 0.296 Step 5:', 'Difference between average sentiment and current sentiment:0.1628Step 6:', 'Previous Standard Deviation of sentiment for reactor: 0.05Since the difference is more than 1.2 times the standard deviation,and the change in polarity is in line with the polarity of the actual tweet,it is inferred that the reactor is positively conditioned.4.4.2.

Graphical analysis/observationsThe analysis of some more test cases is shown in the form of thefollowing graphs inFig. 6.Fig. 6(a) shows the polarity score plot (red line) of a journalist withtime. The three points encircled in this plot correspond to the exampletweets for different types of conditioning. Fig. 6 (b), (c) and (d) zoom into the polarity score plot at these points, and show the details of condi-tioning due to the corresponding tweets. These include the 24-h averageof the polarity score (blue line), the exponential moving average ( EMA) of polarity score plot (green line), of a ‘reactor’who is conditioned/not conditioned by the journalist ’s tweet and the journalist’s polarity score plot (red line). The 24-h average is calculated as the average of the po-larity score of all tweets by the reactor in a 24-h period post a tweet. TheEMA is calculated using (1). The vertical line marks the tweet time in thegraph.If the difference between the 24-h average of the polarity score plot(blue line) and theEMAof polarity score plot (green line) at tweet time isgreater than threshold, we say that the reactor is conditioned.

In Fig. 6(c), the reactor’s graph again drops below the calculated threshold, however, this ﬂuctuation occurs following a positive tweet by the journalist. Hence, this reactor issaid to be negatively conditioned (NCAR). Finally, in Fig. 6(d), the re- actor’s graph remains within limits on both sides of the average polarityscore plot. Therefore, this reactor is not conditioned by the journalist ’s tweet.5. Bias short term impact assessmentThe study conducted so far shows that a large fraction of tweets bymedia outlets are polar instead of the ideally expected neutral naturewhich, on further evaluation, is found to have the power to affect newsconsumers. Theseﬁndings justify the need for a system which can detectalarming biases arising from news articles in order to provide the base forfuture corrective action.Next, a model is proposed to detect and measure these biases. Thebias short term impact assessment tool discussed in this section is anintegral component needed to build a platform for safe and objectivenews. It implements a unique bias score calculation mechanism consid-ering a diverse set of factors followed by comparison with a neutralbaseline.5.1. Data descriptionThe overall tweet dataset used previously in Section 3.1is extended by using the tweet permalinks and user pro ﬁle pages to extract other useful information about each tweet. This information includes thenumber of followers of the user, the number of times the media outlet ismentioned on Twitter, the number of likes, replies, retweets of the tweet,the activity time of tweet, user-details of the users replying to the tweetand text-content of the tweet. Theseﬁelds are used for determining the short term impact of bias as described below.5.2. Polarity and subject identiﬁcationAlong with the polarity score, the subject or feature for which thesentiment is attributed is also determined. This task is carried out byusing feature identiﬁcation strategies as suggested by Pang and Lee', '[4]. For experimentation, some major political subjects were identi ﬁed for the Indian context. This included the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) (Cur-rent Ruling Party at the Centre of the Indian Government), the IndianNational Congress (INC) (Leading Opposition Party at the Centre) and theAam Aadmi Party (AAP) (Current Ruling Party in the Delhi LegislativeAssembly) and their prominent leaders. The subjects/features were hand-annotated and grouped into discrete sets called target sets.Now for each tweet, along with the sentiment score, the target atwhich the sentiment is directed is also identi ﬁed. The target is one of the above-mentioned sets. Linguistic features like POS (Part of Speech) tags', 'Fig. 6.(continued).S. Aggarwal et al. Array 6 (2020) 100025', '8and NER (Name Entity Recognition) tags are used for subject identi ﬁ- cation in the tweet text.This is followed by rudimentary checks to identify the subject for eachtweet. It is observed that most tweets belong to just one target set. Thisimplies that complex methods like dependency graph representations toidentify the subject and target sets can be safely avoided. Presence ofunique target sets allow simpler methods to be implemented.The polarity score of the tweet is assumed to be an opinion on thesubject identiﬁed.5.2.1. IllustrationExample 3:A tweet with the text“PM asks BJP MPs&MLAs to give details of bank accounts from Nov 8 (date of demonetization) to Dec 31st. Huge Bold move. Partyfundsnext?”has a VADER (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014) polarity score of 0.765 indicating high positive sentiment.‘BJP’is identiﬁed as the subject by the proposed model and thesentiment score obtained from VADER is attributed towards the target set‘BJP’.Example 4:Similarly, a tweet with the text“The man who should speak on Demonetization Dr Manmohan Singh hasn ’t said a word. Guess there is too much noise elsewhere these days!”has a VADER polarity score of/C00.21 indicating a negative sentiment.‘Manmohan Singh’is identiﬁed as the subject by the proposed modeland the sentiment score obtained from VADER is attributed towards thetarget set (‘Indian National Congress’in this case) to which ‘Manmohan Singh’, an Indian politician, belongs.5.3. Bias and its short term impactAny news with a polarity score outside the neutral limit ( /C00.33 to þ0.33) is assumed to be subjective or biased as mentioned in Section 3.2. However, not every subjective news will have the same impact. Theimpact of subjective news reporting, depends on various other parame-ters like the number of people who view the news, number of people wholike/favor it, and the time for which the news is active in the usernewsfeed. Depending on these parameters, the Bias Short term ImpactScore (BSIS) is determined for each news report (using a formulaexplained further in Section5.3.3).ABSIStimeline is then constructed for each media outlet to analyzethe biased reporting and its associated short term impact factor. A bias ofhigh impact score is recorded as an alarming bias, as explained later inSection5.3.3.5.3.1. Factors affecting BSISThe proposed work models the solution speci ﬁcally for the Twitter domain. However, the factors listed below have generalized analogues in', 'other media as well, and hence, the model can be extended for mediaother than Twitter easily. The various factors affecting the Bias Shortterm Impact Score (BSIS) are listed below:1.Direct Followers (F): The number of users who follow the mediaoutlet represents the number of news consumers. It is an approxi-mation for the audience that will view the tweet. It is extracted withhelp of the Twitter API [16].2.Mentions: The number of times a media outlet is mentioned in tweetsby other people in the ‘Twittersphere’(the entire microblogging Twitter world is referred to as a Twittersphere) is indicative of howactively others look up to it. It abstractly measures the popularity ofthe media outlet. The total number of mentions of a media outlet inthe period of observation are determined and used as a measure oftheir popularity. This is called the number of ‘overall mentions’.In contrast to overall mentions, the term ‘immediate mentions’is used to capture the number of mentions of a media outlet in the time span 24 hprior to and 24 h post the tweet. This interval measures how actively themedia outlet was mentioned prior to the tweet (In the time span betweent/C024 tot, wheretis the time of tweet in hours) and post the tweet (Inthe time span betweenttotþ24, wheretis the time of tweet in hours). Whilst theﬁrst term captures the popularity of the media outlet, therebydetermining the audience of the tweet, the latter determines the shortterm impact of the tweet by measuring the mentions (which in turncaptures the audience reaction) post the tweet.Both varieties of ‘mentions’are extracted by using web scrapingtechniques.3.Tweet Reactions: The news consumers may choose to react to aparticular tweet using standard Twitter reactions. They are referred toas‘reactors’in Section4.1. The impact factor of their actions can bedeﬁned in detail as–a)Like:A user’s liking/favoring a tweet indicates their appreciation/approval for the tweet sentiment. The Top 25 ‘Favourit-ers’are extracted for each tweet by using standard web scrapingtechniques.b)Retweet:A retweet/share indicates even higher level (ascompared to a‘Like’) of appreciation/approval as the user choosesto share the tweet from its own handle indicating a strong align-ment with the media outlets’view. The Top 25 ‘Retweet-ers’are extracted for each tweet by using the Twitter API [ 16]. c)Replies:User replies may either agree or disagree with the mediaoutlet. The agreement/disagreement is determined by sentimentscore comparison of the tweet and reply. The subject identi ﬁcation methodology, as suggested in Section 5.2, is also used as a parameter for this decision. An agreement is de ﬁned as the case when polarity of the tweet and reply are the same (for the sametarget subject). Similarly, a disagreement is classi ﬁed as the case when polar nature of the tweet and reply con ﬂict with each other.The replies to a tweet along with the Twitter handle of the usermaking the reply are extracted for each tweet by using web scrapingtechniques.4.Tweet Activity Time: The time interval for which a tweet is active isa measure of its short term impact. If a tweet by a media outlet re-mains active for a long duration, it implies that the tweet elicited agood response from the target audience and hence the impact of thenews bias was sizeable. The tweet activity time is measured by ﬁnding the time difference between the time of tweet and the last reply on thetweet. The Twitter API [16] is used to obtain the timestamp of atweet.5.Indirect/Induced Followers: Along with the direct followers, theaudience of a tweet also includes a number of people who indirectlyview the tweet as a result of someone whom they follow. For example,if a userAretweets a userB, then the tweet by userBautomatically gain the followers ofAas its audience. Similarly, other tweet re-actions (like and replies) induce indirect followers as they cause thetweet/post to appear on the user ’s newsfeed. It is calculated bysumming the number of followers of all user-id ’s who react to a tweet.5.3.2. TerminologyBefore describing the formulae for calculating BSIS, some terms are introduced below.Note:Due to lack of labelled datasets and highly subjective nature ofbiases, supervised approaches cannot be applied for this use case. Theseformulations use a statistical approach where the value of constants(parameter weights) and operators used in the formulations are based ontheoretical investigations. The formulae may be improved in the futureby taking various other factors which might not have been includedpresently into account.It should be noted that this research focuses more about the terms andthe meaning they represent, leaving the improvement of mathematicalformulations as a future to-do task.S. Aggarwal et al. Array 6 (2020) 100025', '91.Polarity Score (PS) of a tweet:A sd eﬁned previously in Section3.2, it denotes the sentiment value of a tweet. The score ranges from ascale of/C01 (strongly negative) toþ1 (strongly positive). 2.Inﬂuence Factor (IF) of a media outlet:A measure of how inﬂu- ential a particular media outlet is. It is a function of the direct fol-lowers and number of mentions of the media outlet in theTwittersphere. LetFbe the number of followers andMbe the number of overall mentions of a media outlet. These two parameters togetherdetermine the popularity of the media outlet. The value of Fdirectly measures the audience viewing a tweet by the media outlet, and M measures how actively people engage the media outlet in their dis-cussions.IFis given by:IF¼M*F (2) Note that the operator * aggregates the values of MandFtogether and best captures the inﬂuence asIF.3.Reach (R) of a tweet:Measures the coverage or reach of a tweet as afunction of the following parameters:-(rt): Number of retweets (Refer 3(b), Section 5.3.1) -(fav): Number of favorites (Refer 3(a), Section 5.3.1) -(am): Number of users who replied in agreement with the tweet(Refer 3(c), Section5.3.1)-(dm): Number of users who replied with disagreement to the tweet(Refer 3(c), Section5.3.1)-(t): Tweet activity time (Refer 4, Section 5.3.1) Let r¼ðfavþ3*rtþ1:5', '*amþ0:6*dmÞ*t(3) Choice of weights.1.fav: A parameter weight of 1 is assigned to fav. This weight acts as a baseline for all other weights in the equation.2.rt: A retweet clearly depicts the strongest level of agreement with themedia outlets’sentiment. Therefore, due to a stronger level ofinduced inﬂuence than a favorite, it is assigned a weight 3 ( >1). 3.am:The agreements on a tweet also depict a higher level of in ﬂuence than a favorite. However, they are less inﬂuential than the strongest level of agreement i.e. retweets. Therefore, they are assigned a weightof 1.5.4.dm: Disagreements do not promote the bias shown by the tweet.However, they still increase the reach of the tweet. They are thereforeinferred to show inﬂuence, but lesser than the baseline i.e. favleading to a weight assignment of 0.6.Note: The choice of these weights is made in a best effort manner dueto the algorithm originating from an unsupervised approach. Proposingan automated technique to obtain these constants is left as futureexercise.The operator * is used to weigh the calculated value with the tweetactivity time (t). The tweet with a longer activity duration implies thatthe tweet elicited a good response from the target audience, henceincreasing the short term impact of the news bias.Now letmbe the immediate mentions andfbe the number of induced followers. The operator used (*) best captures the reach. Therefore,R¼ðrþmÞ*ðfþFÞ (4)4.Persistence (P) of a media outlet:Denotes the resolute of the mediaoutlet. It captures how consistent a media outlet is about its opinion.The persistence of a media outlet is measured by observing its pre-vious tweets and their polarity scores in relation to the latest tweetreleased by the media outlet, i.e.Pis a function of the polarity of pasttweets and the latest tweet of the media outlet.To measure the prior polarity of a media outlet, the exponentialmoving average of past polarity scores is calculated. The EMAfor thePS series is obtained recursively using Equation (1), where the value ofais chosen as 0.3. Thus,pðtÞ¼0:3*PSðtÞþ0:7*pðt/C01Þ (5) Choice of weights.The value of a is chosen to be 0.3 to provide fair weightage to both thelast tweet and the series of previously made tweets. It was observed thatchoosing values ofa>0:3 masked the effect of the historical tweets andampliﬁed the effect of the latest one. Similarly, values of a<0:3 undermined the latest tweet’s contribution to persistence.Note: The choice of this weight is made in a best effort manner due tothe algorithm originating from an unsupervised approach. Proposing anautomated technique to obtain this constant is left as future exercise.The persistence of a media outlet is measured in terms of the simi-larity ofPSandp(the exponential moving average of past PSs). PðtÞ¼1/C0absðpðt/C01Þ/C0PSðtÞÞ=ð1þabsðpðt/C01ÞÞ(6) The above formulation calculates the 1-D distance between pðt/C01Þ i.e. the value of sentiment so far and PS, the current polarity of the media outlet.The denominatorð1', 'þabsðpðt/C01ÞÞis used to measure the range in which the distance between the points is calculated. This is captured bymeasuring the maximum possible distances to the left ( /C01) or to the right (1) thatpcould have moved. For example, if p¼1 andPS¼/C01, the absolute difference between the two is 2, but this difference is over therange/C01 to 1 i.e. 2, thus a persistence of 1-1¼0. Also, for another example, ifp¼/C00:5 andPS¼/C01, the absolute difference between thetwo is 0.5, but this difference is over the range max ( /C00.5 to 1 or -1 to /C00.5) i.e. 1.5, thus a persistence of 1-1/3¼0.66. The pseudocode for determining the persistence is shown in Fig. 7 below:5.3.3. Bias short term impact scoreThe Bias Short term Impact Score ( BSIS) of a media outlet is deﬁned as:BSIS¼R*PS*ð1þPÞ (7)where,Ris the reach of the tweet,Pis the persistence of the media outlet', 'Fig. 7.Pseudocode for calculating persistence of media outlet after each tweet.S. Aggarwal et al. Array 6 (2020) 100025', '10andPSthe polarity score of the tweet. Note that the constant 1 is added toPin order to account for the value of P¼0 for zero persistence. A bias-short term impact timeline is constructed for each media outletby plotting the value of BIS for each tweet against time. Each mediaoutlets’BIS-time plot is plotted separately for its sentiment towardsdifferent subject sets like the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), the IndianNational Congress (INC) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).A BIS timeline is also constructed for a neutral media outlet, whichserves as a null model. This study chooses DD-News to serve as theneutral outlet. DD-News is a government-funded media outlet with areputation of providing the most objective news to viewers. This justi ﬁes its selection as the null model to calculate the threshold value forchecking bias.The maximum value of the absolute BSISvalues on the BSIS-time plot of the media outlet (DD in our case) as obtained from the graph is notedas Neutral Limit (NL). The neutral outlet is said to tweet within the po-larity threshold ofNL. It is used as a parameter for calculating the polaritythreshold value for a media outlet from its BSIS plot.The threshold value (T) for a speciﬁc media outlet and its BSIS timeline is obtained by–T¼NL*IF', 'media/C0outlet =IF DD (8) Equation(8)given above is used to normalize the value of NeutralLimitNLby accounting for theIFvalues of the media outlet under studyand the neutral outlet (DD in our case). This, in turn, normalizes the valueofTwhich makes itﬁt for comparison with theBSISfor a media outlet. For example: If a media outlet has a higher value of BSISdue to larger values ofF,m, it will still be comparable against a larger value ofthresholdTgenerated by Equation(8). Equation(8)will generate a comparatively higher value ofTfor the media outlet as the ratio of IF', 'media/C0outlet =IFDDwill be higher for the speciﬁc media outlet (due to IF', 'media/C0outlet being high).The threshold value plotted on the BSIStimeline is used to check for alarming biases.Any tweet withBSISvalue aboveTis labelled as‘alarmingly’biased. This bias is‘worrying’or‘disturbing’and triggers a report event. The alarming bias is then said to be identiﬁed.5.3.4. IllustrationExample 5:Consider the tweet“Live | Delhi: Tea stall owner in RK Puram accepts online payments to help customers. #Demonetization ”by a media outlet.Step 1:', 'Calculation of various parametersF¼1619292.M¼5046rt¼12fav¼40am¼1dm¼0t¼1.4f¼73879226m¼100.PS¼0.4939.Step 2:', 'Calculation of Inﬂuence Factor (IFÞFrom (2).IF¼8154754512.Step 3:', 'Calculation of Reach (R)From (3),r¼108.5.From (4).R¼15741441003.0.Step 4:Calculation of Persistence (P)From (5) and (6).P¼0.448841795403.Step 5:', 'Calculation of Bias Short term Impact Score ( BSISÞFrom (7).BIS¼11264306990.9.Step 6:', 'Calculation of ThresholdðTÞIF (for DD-news)¼7212972261.Threshold value (for DD-News)¼7285358616.66.IF (for media outlet)¼8154754512.From (8).Threshold (for media outlet)¼8170947431.99.It is evident that the BIS score obtained as 11264306990.9is greater than the threshold for the media outlet which is 8170947431.99. Therefore, a report event is triggered and alarming bias is detected.The same is illustrated using theBSIS-timeline as shown inFig. 8. The red (Fig. 8(a)), blue (Fig. 8(b)) and green (Fig. 8(c))lines respectively are used to draw theBISplots for a media outlet for biases for/against theBJP, INC and AAP. The black line represents the threshold limit. Themedia outlet can be noticed to be ‘alarmingly’biased towards BJP at several instances (the red line crosses the threshold line several times).The plot also shows that the outlet has a slight negative ‘alarming’bias towards AAP (the green line in the plot crosses the threshold sometimes).The plot for INC (blue line) stays reasonably within the threshold limitand the media outlets’bias is not labelled as ‘alarming’in the given time interval.5.4. Extending the proposed modelJust like Twitter, sites like Facebook and Reddit offer a continuousstream of personal opinions on the most varied range of topics. Theproposed model can be extended for these platforms.The observations made also reveal that most media outlets are farmore biased on live TV than in print and social media. Bias detection inTelevision media could therefore be an important extension to the model.A naive solution is to convert Live TV stream to Natural Language in textand then apply a similar model to detect biases. Also, media biases interms of panel representation, think-tank citations and selective newscoverage should be dealt with.6. ConclusionAs seen by means of a series of experiments, journalists and mediaoutlets are responsible for an opinionated mechanism of news reportingwhich has a deleterious impact on its consumers. More than 40% of thetweets analyzed were found out to be polar. Also, a fraction of as high as41% of reactors were conditioned through such ‘biased’polar tweets. This shows that an alarming number of people get conditioned by polar,subjective and biased news every day, something, which goes past thenaked eye of humans around the world.In today’s world where digitization has made people ’s life extremely easy, care must be taken to avoid misuse of the dependence on thismedium. Consumers should not blindly trust media sources and use theirrationale before developing an opinion on an issue. This research aims tohelp users detect bias in news media by proposing a model for alarmingbias detection. The study also shows how media conditions the opinionsS. Aggarwal et al.

This justiﬁes the need for a platform to providesafe and healthy balanced news to the news-consumers so that they arenot misguided and conditioned by biased media outlets.In parallel, work needs to be carried out to detect fake news outlets.Fake news is a biased report that is factually incorrect. It is a deliberateattempt to condition the news-consumers in making them believing afalsiﬁed report. Tech giants like Google and Facebook have recentlystarted working in this direction.

Maize is one of stable one food crops of Ethiopia and cul-tivated in three agroecological zones: highland, midland and lowlands. Despite these facts, maize yield is verylow due to a lack of knowledge and information gaps on land suitability. Physical land suitability for maize culti-vation is essential to minimize the problem of food security. The present study aims to identify the potential landsuitability for maize production in the Didessa watershed, Western Ethiopia using Multi-Criteria Evaluation(MCE) and geospatial technologies. Land use land cover (LULC) change, climate, topography, soil, and infrastruc-ture facilities were considered for maize land suitability assessment. The MCE based pairwise comparison matrixwas applied to estimate land suitability for maize crop cultivation. The results showed that, about 977.7 km', '2', '(14.1%) is highly suitable, 4794.9 km2(69.1%) is moderately suitable while 1118.8 km2(16.1%), and 51.5 km2', '(0.7%) of the study area were categorized under marginally and not suitable for maize production, respectively.This research provides crucial information for decision making organs and the farming community to utilizepotential areas for maize cultivation.© 2022 The Authors.

IntroductionAt global level about 1, 162 million tons of maize are produced in2020 (Solanki et al., 2020). Maize production in the world increasedfrom 313 million tonnes in 1971 to 1162 million tonnes in 2020,which indicates an increment by 3.07% per year ( Nyagumbo et al., 2016). Agriculture is the backbone and the major source of income inEthiopia (Berhanu and Poulton, 2014;Headey et al., 2014). Maize farm- ing is widely practiced in many regions of Ethiopia ( Kassie et al., 2015). It is widely cultivated for commercial bene ﬁt not only in Ethiopia, but also at global level (Linda et al., 2015;Habibie et al., 2019). Despite this, some people are unable to eat because of a lack of food ( Regassa and Stoecker, 2012;Mota et al., 2019). In poor nations such asEthiopia, the inability to exploit existing technologies for yield develop-ment results in low maize yield (Asfaw et al., 2012;Abate et al., 2019). Low yield harvesting is results in food shortage caused by a lack of tech-nological access have been reported in the country ( Bewket, 2007;Dijk et al., 2020).Around the late 17th century, maize crops were introduced inEthiopia (Huffnagel, 1961;Abate et al., 2015). In Ethiopia, maize is cul- tivated in highland, midland, and lowland agro-ecological zones ( Elias et al., 2013;Tessema and Simane, 2019;Dendir and Simane, 2019). Increasing agricultural output through the use of innovative croptypes and farm inputs in Ethiopia is gaining traction ( Tamene et al., 2017;Sime and Aune, 2018;Silva et al., 2021). Apart from using better varieties and agricultural inputs, determining the appropriateness of agiven parcel of land before investing in agriculture can help maximizethe use of existing land resources (Ahamed et al., 2016). Land suitability assessment is very crucial for land use planning ( Vasu et al., 2018; Habibie et al., 2019;Mehrjardi et al., 2020;Al-Taani et al., 2021). Despite its relevance, land suitability evaluation for maize production has re-ceived little attention in the country as a whole and in the study areaspeciﬁcally. In Ethiopia, some research has been conducted on the phys-ical suitability of land for maize production ( Girma et al., 2015;Alemu and Worku, 2017;Debesa et al., 2020).

Descriptions of the study areaThis study was conducted in Didessa watershed in western parts ofEthiopia. Geographically, Didessa watershed is located between 7', '°49′ 30″to 8', '°54′30”Na n d3 6°1′00″to 37°6′00″E(Fig. 1). The topography of the Didessa watershed ranges from 1354 m to 3154 m above meansea level. The watershed covers a total area of 6942.9 km', '2.2.1.1. ClimateThe study area received maximum amount rainfall during the sum-mer season (June to September). Study conducted by Wedajo et al. (2019)in Didessa River sub basin indicates that the average minimumand maximum temperature is 13 °C, and 26.5 °C, respectively. Otherstudy byGemeda et al. (2021)at Bedele station, which is located withinthe Didessa River sub-basin found that the mean minimum and maxi-mum temperature is about 11.9 °C, and 26.2 °C, respectively.2.1.2. Soil typesThe study area has a large variety of soil types. Among the existingsoil types, Haplic Alisols was the most dominat which covers an areaof 4235.7 km2(61.0%) and the least dominated soil type was RhodicNitisol with an area of 518.6 km', '2(7.5%).2.2. Data sources and descriptionsLandsat images of OLI/TIRS 2020 were downloaded from U.S. Geo-logical Survey (USGS) website (https://www.usgs.gov/) for Land use land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation. Climate data was obtained from Na-tional Meteorological Agencies (NMA) of Ethiopia while soil data wasobtained from Ministry of Water and Irrigation Engineering (MoWIE)and elevation data was extracted from ASTER DEM ( Table 1;Fig. 2).2.3. Data analysis2.3.1.

We interpolated the climatedata of four stations using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) tech-niques to obtain annual rainfall data for areas using stations in andaround the study area. This annual rainfall was interpolated with a 30m resolution and then extracted to the study area.2.3.2. Land surface temperatureIn the present study, the LST was retrieved from the thermal bandsof the Landsat OLI/TIRS of 2020 (Adeola et al., 2017). The mono window algorithm was applied to retrieve LST from the thermal bands of the OLI/TIRS images. Accordingly, LST was retrieved from Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS)with thermal bands of band 10 used by mono-window algorithm fol-lowing (Guo et al., 2020;Sekertekin and Bonafoni, 2020). Digital num- ber (DN) was converted to the spectral radiance of thermal bands ofLandsat TIRS (Dener and Alves, 2016;Ziaul and Pal, 2018).Consequently, LST was estimated using the brightness temperature ofthe two bands of thermal infrared, mean and difference in land surfaceemissivity (Cheng et al., 2015).Step 1: Conversion of digital numbers to top of atmosphere (TOA)spectral radianceThermal data in the Landsat sensor and deliver a manner of signify-ing pixels are stored in a digital number that has not yet been calibratedand converted into radiance units (Aik et al., 2020;Moisa et al., 2022) using (Eq.(1)).Lλ¼ML∗QCalðÞ þAL ð1ÞwhereLλ¼Top of Atmosphere TOAðÞspectral radiance Wm', '−2sr−1μm−1/C16/C17ML¼Band−specific multiplicative rescaling factor from the metadataðRadianne−multi−band x;where x is the band numberAL¼Band−specific additive rescaling factor from the meta dataðRadiance−add−band x;where x is the band numberTable 1Descriptions of data used for the study.Data Data types Resolution(m) SourcesClimate data Rainfall data 30 NMALandsat OLI/TIRS LST, LULC 30 USGSASTER DEM Altitude 30 USGSSoil data Soil types, drainage,depth, and texture30 MoWIE', 'Fig. 2.Methodologicalﬂowchart of the study.M.B.

From this organization we extract the topography of thestudy area, which very crucial to understand land suitability for maizeproduction. Maize crop cultivation was more favorable in lowlandareas and vice versa (Gorfu and Ahmed, 2011;Rashid et al., 2013).2.3.4. Soil dataSoil data of the study area was obtained from the Ministry of Waterand Irrigation Engineering and clipped to the study area. In addition, thesoil data were converted to raster format by 30 m spatial resolution andreclassiﬁed according to a previous studyDebesa et al. (2020)for over- lay analysis.2.3.5. Land use land cover typesMultispectral Landsat OLI/TIRS layer were stacked and extracted tothe Didessa watershed. The LULC of the study area was classi ﬁed using supervised classiﬁcation maximum likelihood algorithm. An imagewas classiﬁed into cultivated land, forest, grassland, dense and openwoodlands and urban areas using the ERDAS Imagine 2015 software.2.4. Pairwise comparison approach for criteria weight estimationBased on expert opinion weight values from comparison of thecriteria were processed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP)model (Saaty, 2004; Abine, 2021). This model was developed bySaaty (1980)to compare the relative importance of each criterion. Saaty (1980)provided the scale range to indicate the relative importance of', 'Fig. 4.Land surface temperature of the study area.M.B. Moisa, F.S. Tiye, I.N. Dejene et al. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Agriculture 6 (2022) 34 –46', '38each factor, which ranges between one and nine. Finally, the weights ofthe pairwise comparison matrix priorities were computed ( Table 2). The consistency ratio (CR) was calculated to check the consistency ofcomparisons (Yohannes and Soromessa, 2018). The CR was calculated using (Eq.(7)). The CR values ranges from 0 to 1 ( Saaty, 1980; Malczewski, 2000). A CR <0.1 is a reasonable level of consistency. Calcu-lating consistency index (CI) is very important for crop land suitabilityanalysis and calculated using Eq.(7).CI¼', 'λmax−nn−1 ð7Þwhereλmaxis the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise comparision matrixand n is the number of classes :Then, CR is obtained using Eq.(8)as suggested bySaaty (1980).CR¼', 'CIRI ð8Þwhere RI id the ratio index over average value of CI for random metricesusing the Saaty scale2.5.

Agro ecological zones of the study areaThe agro-ecological zones of the study area were extracted fromdigital elevation model. Previous research Hurni (1998),Gorfu and Ahmed's (2011)were used to create the Agro ecological zone (AEZ)Didessa watershed. Theﬁndings of this study revealed that low-lands dominated core parts of the study area, whereas midlandsdominated substantial portions (Fig. 5). Our results showed that a total of 1640.8 km\", '2(23.6%) of the research area was found to behighly favorable for maize crop cultivation ( Table 4).

The sandy clay loam dominates most of the studyregion, which covers 3826.7km', \"2(55.1%) and is moderately appropriatefor maize agriculture (Table 6;Fig. 7). The study'sﬁndings were more consistent with those of the prior study ( Hussien et al., 2019).3.6. Soil drainageSoil drainage map of the study area is presented ( Fig. 8). There are ﬁve categories of drainage in the study area including well, moderate,somewhat excessive, excessive and imperfect. Study by Al-Mashrekiet al. (2015)prove that well and moderate drainage were suitable formaize production. Results showed that 6143.1km2(88.5%) of the entire area of the Didessa watershed is highly suited for maize agriculture,whereas 372.7km\", '2(5.4%) is not suitable (Table 7).3.7. Soil depthThe most essential soil property for determining viable land formaize crop development is soil depth ( Kindu et al., 2009). Maize crop productivity beneﬁts greatly from deep soil depth. Based on soil depthwe can classify land suitability for certain crops. The soil depth class ofthe study area is presented (Fig. 9). The results revealed that 4209.4km', '2(60.6%) is highly favorable for maize production, while73.2km', '2(1.1%) is unsuitable (Table 8).3.8. Land suitability for maize productionFrom aggregated eight factors, land suitability for maize productionwas produced (Fig. 10).

ConclusionUnderstanding land suitability for crop production enhances yieldsand contributes towards the achievements of UN Sustainable Develop-ment Goals such as no poverty and zero hunger. Land suitability evalu-ation for maize production at watershed scale is crucial to enhance foodsecurity in agriculture-based economy like Ethiopia. Several factorssuch as: climate, LULC, LST, soil, topography, and infrastructure's datawere used to evaluate physical land suitability for maize production.In this study, geospatial techniques were employed to identify physicalland suitability for maize production in the study area. The results of thestudy showed that the area with low elevation and high LST are highlysuitable for maize production. Results revealed that about 977.7km2\", '(14.1%), and 4794.9km2(69.1%) were highly and moderately suitablefor maize production, respectively. About 1118.8 km', '2(16.1%), and 51.5 km', \"2(0.7%) were marginally and not suitable for maize production,respectively. Theﬁndings of this research can support decision makingorgans to promote intensive maize production in Didessa watershed.In order to enhance food security, the farming communities in thestudy area should cultivated the highly and moderately suitable areafor maize production.

This methodology  is useful for carrying  out 3D ', 'QSAR study when target information  is not available,  and it has been ', 'applied  on 30 publicly  available  molecular  datasets.  Two variants  L3D- ', 'MLP, L3D-PLS  models were built and compared  with the traditional  3D ', 'QSAR method,  CoMFA.  Our results show that L3D-PLS  model perform  ', 'best, while L3D-MLP  model perform  worse than CoMFA  method.  The ', 'poor performance  of the L3D-MLP  may be due to the fact that all the ', '30 datasets  are not big dataset,  so that deep learning  method  doesn’t ', 'demonstrate  it advantage.  Anyhow,  the L3D-PLS  model, which com- ', 'bines 3D-CNN  based feature extraction  and PLS based linear correlation  ', 'technology,  demonstrated  improved  results.  The interpretability  of L3D- ', 'PLS is limited by its convolution  mechanism.

Introduction  ', 'Neoplasms  are deﬁned  by abnormal  tissue growth  and can be classi- ', 'ﬁed as benign or malignant.  Benign (noncancerous)  neoplasms  are char- ', 'acterized  by slow and organized  spread,  the presence  of well-deﬁned  ', 'borders,  and the absence  of an invasive  character  at both the tissue and ', 'organ levels. Malignant  (cancerous)  neoplasms,  on the other hand, are ', 'characterized  by often rapid and disorganized  growth,  with poorly de- ', 'ﬁned borders  and possible  invasion  of adjacent  tissues and organs,  im- ', 'plying the possibility  of metastatic  cancer [ 1 , 2 ]. ', 'According  to the World Health Organization,  about 9.6 million  peo- ', 'ple died of cancer worldwide  in 2018, of which around 70% were in ', 'middle-  and low-income  countries  [3] . In Brazil, according  to the Na- ', 'tional Cancer Institute  (INCA) [4] , about 625,000  new cases were ex- ', 'pected in 2020, based on estimates  from before the SARS-coV-2  pan- ', 'demic, and were mainly distributed  among cancers  of the prostate,  fe- ', 'male breast, colon and rectum,  trachea,  bronchus  and lung, and stom- ', 'ach. As for the total number  of deaths,  according  to the Brazilian  Mor- ', 'tality Information  System data (SIM), 224,829  deaths were caused by ', 'malignant  neoplasms  in 2020, and the most frequent  were trachea,  ', 'bronchus,  and lung (28,516  deaths),  breast (18,032  deaths),  prostate  ', '(15,841  deaths),  stomach  (13,850  deaths),  and colon (12,422  deaths)  ', '[5] .

', 'We used 10-fold  cross-validation  to select the hyperparameters  in the ', 'training  set with Hyperopt  [14] , which applies a Bayesian  strategy  for ', 'optimization,  and RandomSearch.  In the case of high class imbalance  ', '(minority  class representing  under 25% of total outcomes),  we applied  ', 'the Synthetic  Minority  Oversampling  Technique  (SMOTE).  Also in the ', 'training  set, we applied  the BORUTA  [15] method  for variable  selection.  ', 'We then selected  the best performing  models from the training  set ', '(70% of the data) to evaluate  their performance  in the test set (30%). ', 'The complete  structure  of the datasets  is presented  in Fig. 1 . ', 'The predictive  performance  of the models was evaluated  on the test ', 'set using metrics  such as area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC),  area un- ', 'der the precision-recall  curve (AUC-PR),  precision,  recall, positive  pre- ', 'dicted value, negative  predicted  value, and F1-score.  We also evaluated  ', 'the performance  of the algorithms  in the 20% highest  risk patients  (20% ', 'k-tops),  with metrics  such as true positive,  false positive,  precision  and ', 'recall. Finally,  the interpretation  and evaluation  of the contribution  of ', 'each variable  to the outcome  was obtained  by calculating  the Shapley  ', 'values [ 16 , 17 , 18 ] for the test set.

A similar pattern  to the general  ', 'model was observed  for the top 5 causes of death model.

The hyperparameters  of each model are also available  in ', 'Supplementary  Appendix  B (Tables  B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, B10, B11, B12, ', 'B13). ', 'We also evaluated  the performance  of the algorithms  in the top 20% ', '(20% k-tops) of patients  with the highest  mortality  risk ( Table 4 ).

Model interpretation  ', 'In order to interpret  the decision-making  process  of the algorithms,  ', 'we calculated  the Shapley  values. In the general  model ( Fig. 3 ), the can- ', 'cer stage during the ﬁrst diagnosis  was the most important  predictor.  ', 'Stage I patients  were more likely to be classiﬁed  negatively  (non-death),  ', 'whereas  stage IV patients  were more signiﬁcant  for the positive  out- ', 'come (death).  The variable  on the category  of service provided  was also ', 'important  for the outcome.  Category  2 (public service)  increased  mor- ', 'tality prediction,  whereas  category  1 (private  service)  showed  a greater ', 'propensity  for patient survival.  The other main predictive  variables  refer ', 'to the topography  of cancer,  regional  net of healthcare  service (rrasof-  ', 'serv) and regional  net of healthcare  service (rras). The plots of Shapley  ', 'values for the other models can be found in Supplementary  Appendix  A ', '(Figures  A2, A4, A6, A8, A10, A12, A14, A16). ', 'We also randomly  selected  three patients  (high risk, medium  risk, ', 'and low risk) to highlight  the individual  interpretation  of results ( Fig. 4 ). ', 'The ﬁrst (a) was a true positive  (risk of 0.972) with the expected  Shap- ', 'ley value was 2.92. The variables  that contributed  for the prediction  ', 'of positive  outcome  were public care service (servicecat_2  = 1), cancer ', 'stage diﬀerent  from I (cancerstage_  I = 0), cancer topography  ICD C-34 ', '(malignant  neoplasm  of bronchus  and lung), regional  net of service 01 ', '(rrasofserv_RRAS01  = 1) and the qualiﬁcation  of the healthcare  institu- ', 'tion (code 12, UNACON  with Hematology  and Pediatric  Oncology  Ser- ', 'vices). A second patient (b) classiﬁed  as a false negative  was selected.  ', 'The total risk score was 0.4782,  which led the algorithm  to classify  the ', 'patient incorrectly  as alive during the period. We observed  that there ', 'was balance  in the aggregate  of the contribution  of the predictors,  high- ', 'lighting  the importance  of cancer stage IV to increase  Shapley  value ', 'and the non-public  health service to decrease  it.

General  vs speciﬁc models ', 'To understand  the best strategy  regarding  the types of models (gen- ', 'eral or speciﬁc  for each cancer),  we performed  a comparison  between  ', 'the performance  of the general  algorithm  for all cancers  versus the spe- ', 'ciﬁc algorithms  for bronchus  and lung, breast, stomach,  colon, rectum,  ', 'prostate,  bronchus  and lung, colon, and uterine  cervix ( Table 5 ). Based ', 'on the AUC-ROC,  the general  model performed  better in bronchus  and ', 'long, stomach  and colon. For breast, rectum,  prostate,  and cervix uteri ', 'the model performed  better for the speciﬁc  case. For bronchus  and lung ', 'cancer,  the area under the curve increased  from 0.899 (model speciﬁc)  ', 'to 0.927 (general  model) and the precision  from 0.893 to 0.907. For ', 'stomach  cancer,  there was an increase  in AUC-ROC  (0.866 to 0.926),  ', 'precision  (0.821 to 0.924).  This scenario  was repeated  for colon cancer ', '(AUC-ROC  0.753 to 0.848).  ', '3.6. Discussion  ', 'We found that all models achieved  an AUC-ROC  higher than 0.86 to ', 'predict cancer mortality  using only routinely-collected  data. Our results ', 'also indicated  that a general  algorithm,  that included  all cancer mortal-  ', 'ity, performed  in most cases better than cancer-speciﬁc  algorithms.  ', 'Information  about mortality  risk after cancer diagnosis  can be an ', 'important  input to support  clinical  decisions.  These algorithms  can ', 'be integrated  into mobile devices,  electronic  medical  records,  or on- ', 'line resources,  to help doctors  in making  more informed  decisions  ', 'about treatment  options  and to allocate  healthcare  resources  more ', 'eﬀectively.  ', 'We obtained  a high predictive  performance  without  the use of omics ', 'or image data, which is a promising  result in the ﬁeld of oncology  espe- ', 'cially in low-income  regions.  We were able to develop  an approach  to ', 'compare  the use of a general  model with a model for the main causes ', 'of death, and with models speciﬁc  to each type of cancer.  Most of the ', 'studies developed  in the literature  are speciﬁc  for a given type of cancer,  ', 'due to the selected  data sets, using either from image data or through  ', 'structured  data [ 20 , 21 ]. The use of data from a cancer registry  allowed  ', 'for achieving  consistent  results in all proposed  models,  while at the ', 'same time providing  a real-world  dataset,  with recent cases and dif- ', 'ferent types of cancer.  ', 'The study has a few limitations.  First, the algorithms  were developed  ', 'with data from São Paulo, Brazil, so there should be caution  in transfer-  ', 'ring its conclusions  to other contexts.  Second,  considering  the ﬁltered  ', 'sample,  we had 1391 follow-up  losses that could have disproportionally  ', 'altered the results.  Third, we excluded  patients  younger  than 20 years ', 'due to the presence  of diﬀerent  biological  mechanisms  that lead to can- ', 'cer deaths for this group, so the results refer only to adult patients.

Advanced manufacturing', 'AMT [7] has been studied since the 1960s, when there was a move', 'from mechanical technology to digital circuits and systems as a result', 'of the introduction of Programmable Logical Controllers (PLC) and', 'computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools on the shop', 'floor. This was the start of the Third Industrial Revolution. Indeed,', 'AMT has always significantly impacted the growing process of manu-', 'facturing paradigms ranging from craft production to mass production', 'to mass customization and personalization. Before the 1960s, with the', 'development and deployment of early factory automation technolo-', 'gies and related automated production equipment, manufacturing shop', 'floors were progressively changed from the original craft production', 'manual workshop into rigid automated production lines. It helped', 'manufacturing enterprises achieve mass production and lower costs', 'since increasing affluent customers and matching personalized requests', 'required mass production.

More recently, in the Industrie 4.0 era, networked devices enable', 'unprecedented data and information exchange by applying typical IoT', 'scenarios, Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), and CPS to industrial', 'contexts. This can be explained by the remarkable progress in the', 'technological capability of computational (embedded) devices and net-', 'works. These technologies were developed in parallel with the general', 'emergence of AMT, which helped deploy the personalization paradigm', '[9].', 'As a result, AMS represent non-traditional manufacturing technolo-', 'gies that enterprises may employ to preserve or increase their competi-', 'tiveness.

[57]. NSA rely on', 'theSelf/Nonself theory existing in the BIS. The main goal is for', '𝑇cells to detect foreign and potentially dangerous pathogens', 'and respond adequately, ignoring harmless substances and their', 'own body cells. This can be done by only enabling cells that', 'distinguish between self and non-self cells. Different variationsArray 15 (2022) 100238', '6R. Pinto and G. Gonçalves', 'of NSA have been proposed [5]. The algorithm generically con-', 'sists of 3 main steps: (a) Immature 𝑇cells with various antigen', 'receptors are produced in the bone marrow and migrate to the', 'thymus; (b) In the thymus, 𝑇cells that recognize self-antigens', 'undergo a programmed cell death process. On the other hand, 𝑇', 'cells that do not recognize any self-antigen are allowed to live;', '(c) Mature 𝑇cells that do not recognize self-antigens are now', 'used to recognize any non-self antigen invading the body, such', 'as virus and bacteria.', 'Artificial Immune Network Models (AIN) [58,59] Jerne [60] pro-', 'posed the immune network theory, also known as idiotypic', 'network theory, in 1974, which suggests that the immune sys-', 'tem maintains an idiotypic network of interconnected B cells for', 'antigen recognition and immunological memory. An idiotype is', 'a group of antibodies that share a common characteristic. This', 'algorithm investigates the interconnectivity of different immune', 'cells, i.e., cell populations linked over successive generations, to', 'stimulate or suppress immune responses. The Artificial Immune', 'Network algorithm (aiNet) [61] is a well-known approach in-', 'spired by the AIN. In this technique, antibodies stimulate and', 'suppress each other to stabilize the network and the memory.', 'An idiotype is stimulated when the antibodies from the group', 'bind to idiotopes of other groups of antibodies. This results in', 'the increase of the concentration of antibodies from the idiotype,', 'and the concentration of antibodies from the recognized group', 'decreases, leading to the stimulation or suppression of a given', 'immune response.', 'Clonal Selection Algorithms (CSA) [62] The clonal selection theory', 'tries to explain how B and 𝑇cells improve their response in', 'the presence of antigens based on the antigen–antibody affinity.', 'This affinity is based on the binding level between a B cell', 'and an antigen. When a B cell is activated by the presence of', 'an antigen, the B cell matures into plasma cells and secretes', 'antibodies. The created antibodies with higher affinities are', 'cloned, and a mutation process differentiates the clones. If the', 'new antibodies react to self cells, then they are eliminated. In', 'these situations, the concentration of B cells with an improved', 'affinity builds up. Some B cells are retained as memory cells to', 'make a more effective immune response to antigens encountered', 'previously. The created antibodies bind to antigens to tag and', 'inactivate them. A well know technique of CSA is the CLONal', 'selection ALGorithm (CLONALG) [62,63]. Other theories were', 'proposed, such as Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS)', '[64] and The B-Cell Algorithm (BCA) [65]. Haktanirlar Ulutas', 'et al. [66] summarizes the basic features of the CSA and its', 'variants and reviews the corresponding application areas.', 'Danger Theory (DT) [67] Matzinger [68] explains how an immune', 'response is initiated. She states that, contrary to the previous', 'theories, the ‘foreignness’ of a pathogen is not the important', 'feature that triggers a response, and ‘selfness’ is no guarantee of', 'tolerance. The immune response is initiated by a co-stimulatory', 'signal from specific Dendritic Cells (DCs). Injured cells, such', 'as those exposed to pathogens, emit danger/alarm signals that', 'activate DCs. These signals should not be emitted by healthy', 'cells or cells undergoing normal physiological death. Once acti-', 'vated, they provide a co-stimulatory signal to exhibit an immune', 'response in the danger zone around the injured cell. The most', 'notorious DT-based algorithm is the Dendritic Cell Algorithm', '(DCA) [69], which captures the function of DCs [70], first iden-', 'tified by Steinman and Cohn [71]. In the tissue, when antigens', 'stimulate DCs, they mature and differentiate accordingly to', 'the specific danger context collected. The level of maturation', 'of a DC is facilitated by the detection of signals within the', 'tissue, namely danger signals (caused by damage to tissue cells),', 'pathogenic associated molecular patterns (pre-defines bacterial', 'signatures), safe signals (caused by regulated cell deaths) andinflammatory signals (general tissue distress). After maturing,', 'DCs migrate to local lymphoid nodes, where they stimulate or', 'tolerate an immune response according to the danger context.', '2.3.3.
