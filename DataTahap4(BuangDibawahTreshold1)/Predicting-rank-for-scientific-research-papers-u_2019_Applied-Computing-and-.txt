The appropriate size of test data must respect certain condi- tions. First of all, it must not be too small because it will converge easily; this will have consequences on the accuracy of the predic- tion because, on the one hand, it has not given enough data to sup- port the reasons enough and, on the other hand, it must not be too big because it is not necessary to converge (see Figs. 4â€“6).

The Web of Science dataset also contains information that is not useful in our algorithm. We need to pre-process the dataset to extract only the information that we will use in our algorithm. In data pre-processing, after the extraction and preparation of data, the final database contains: the title of paper, its author(s), key- words, paper posted time, the conference of publication, the given research paper cites, the download rates, also the average publica- tion/keyword, article number and finally the order of paper.

On the other hand, we should compare MAP and GMAP for the four variants. We clearly see in the Fig. 9 in term of APD, ADC and PDC the values are slightly close to each other compared to APC which has superior values.
