The Hamiltonian approach and the variational approach are utilized to treat the relativistic harmonic oscillator for the amplitude-frequency relationship. The nice reliability is shown by the result comparison with that from open literature. The simplicity and efficiency of the methods are also disclosed for different range of the initial amplitude during looking for the amplitude-frequency relationship for the nonlinear relativistic harmonic oscillator.

where A is the initial amplitude. This is an example of a conservative nonlinear oscillatory system in which the restoring force has an irrational form. The relativistic oscillator is important in physics because it is usually used as the basis for analyzing more complicated motion.

Though Ï‰ in Eq. (13) and Eq. (15) is different in form, we know the approximation is good compared with the exact one after symbolic computation with distinct initial amplitude. Maybe because the methods are based on energy, the resulted approximation amplitude-frequency relationship is valid for different range of the initial amplitude, no matter the amplitude is large or small.
