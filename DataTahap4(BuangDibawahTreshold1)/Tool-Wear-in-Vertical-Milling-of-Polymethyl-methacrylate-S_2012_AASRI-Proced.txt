This research was investigated the tool wear experiment of HSS end milling cutter in vertical milling for Polymethyl- methacrylate sheet. It could be conclude that feed rate mainly affected to tool wear. Moreover, the wear was influenced by the interaction of feed rate and cutting speed too. Some concluding as following;
