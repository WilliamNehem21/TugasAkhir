Our country is rich of line galloping, there are many important galloping data failed to collect systematically and completely because there is no unified management platform. After the galloping occurrence in 2009- 2010’s winter the department of productive of the State Grid Corporation organized a lot of human to carry out the research of galloping information, this work is time-consuming and inefficient. The State Grid Corporation has used the production management system (PMS) which is a powerful and easy to use. With the help of the system we can create a galloping database which can save resources and storage the galloping data. To build and put it into application of database can provide technical support for line galloping prevention and galloping research work.

The production department of State Grid Corporation owns special production and management system (PMS) which can manage count information of the power transmission lines and equipments in the scope of the whole grid, and provincial company of each grid has established special network with the headquarter to carry out data transmission, each city-region team realizes mutual connection and mutual accessing with PMS of the provincial company. The headquarter can conveniently realize data transmission with each provincial company, and realizes information exchange and share. Whereas PMS system has strong count information management function of the power transmission lines and equipments, this paper develops the galloping database system in combination of the galloping condition of our domestic power transmission lines, the galloping database is completed by means of PI3000 platform on basis of the current production management system (PMS).

Parameters in the galloping historic data consist of filled in parameters and optional parameter. For the filled in parameters, the operation and maintenance person can save and exist only after corrected data are filled in, the optional parameters shall be filled in according to actual conditions. If data is easy to be collected, it is filled in. If data isn’t easy to be collected, it isn’t be filled in. Following figure 5 is design figures of galloping historic data interface.

Use the starting tower number and the termination tower number to fix one section according to format of the historic data. If there is several sections, input number of the section. Confirm whether differential treatment is necessary for each section, and then determine whether anti-galloping device shall be used, select type of the anti-galloping device in the down pull menu, and mark number. If several anti-galloping devices are used, they will be displayed in parallel in the treatment section after operation is complete. Evaluation of anti-galloping effect is carried out in every section. Refer to figure 6.

After newly built galloping data is complete, and it is correct after inspection of PMS system operation and maintenance person at side of the provincial corporation, this galloping data is transmitted to PMS system at headquarter site for inquiry of the headquarter. Following figure 7 is reporting schematic figure of the galloping data. The galloping data is firstly enveloped by the data exchange centre of the state grid, and then transmit to ODS system at headquarter side, PMS system at headquarter side is transmitted to the front desk of the system and shows through galloping data in ODS system.
