In this paper, three different approaches for implementing a quantum search algorithm by adiabatic evolution are shown. As expected, either one of them can provide a quadratic speed up as opposed to the classical search algorithm. This implies that adiabatic evolution based quantum computation gives more feasibilities than the quantum circuit model, although the equivalence between them has already been proven in the corresponding literature.

In this paper, we have shown different approaches for the adiabatic evolution of the problem studied in the context. At first glance, each of them can provide a quadratic speed up as compared to the global adiabatic evolution and classical search algorithms. However, this just implies that adiabatic evolution based quantum computation has more feasibilities than the traditional quantum circuit model in which such a speed up is usually not easy to achieve by different methods, although the equivalence between them can be found in related literature, such as [6].
