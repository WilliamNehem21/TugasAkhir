Paper includes sections with the following contents. Section II defines the two-dimensional complex argument error function (CAEF) of the terminal voltage phasor and a method of it measuring. Consider the definition of the normal CAEF (NCAEF) for steady state of the plant. Presented the calculation of the differential CAEF at terminal voltage phasor with use the Wirtinger calculus. In section III showed the excitation control of the synchronous machine that used CAEF at terminal voltage phasor. The example for study the small-signal stability with proposed excitation control is given in the section IV. The conclusions are summarized this paper.

If we use the terminal voltage phasor as the input for excitation control, we can react to changes in both the electromagnetic and electromechanical states of a synchronous machine, as take into account the increments of the magnitudes terminal voltage and the rotor angle in case of violation the steady state. Control of the various plants based on the real signals. Therefore, CAEF should be considered as a real function of the complex arguments - the output of the plant. It is known [6], that the nonconstant real-valued function of a complex variable is nonanalytic and therefore does not differentiate in the accepted sense for the complex variables (Cauchy-Riemann conditions). To calculate the stationary points and differential CAEF (3) in the whole domain of the terminal voltage phasor, we used the definition of a real differentiable [6, 7] for CAEF:
