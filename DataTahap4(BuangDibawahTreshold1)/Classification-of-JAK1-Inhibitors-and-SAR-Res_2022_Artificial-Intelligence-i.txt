Each MACCS key corresponds to a segment of SMARTS [126]. SMARTS was an abstract definition. It matches the corresponding struc- ture through specific rules. A segment of SMARTS may match multiple different substructures, the same structure may also correspond to dif- ferent SMARTS. Each letter in SMARTS has a different meaning. For example, ‘A’ represents any valid periodic table element symbol, ‘Q’ represents a hetero atom, then ‘QNQ’ means that there are two hetero atoms bond to the same nitrogen atom. Table 5 lists some examples of substructures corresponding to SMARTS.

We calculated a MACCS fingerprint with a length of 166 bits for each inhibitor. We deleted the bits with a variance less than the aver- age variance, finally used a MACCS fingerprint with a length of 80 bits to build models. The top 80 MACCS fingerprints are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary materials. In the analysis, we found that the combination of different important MACCS keys forms some important molecules with special scaffold features, which had an obvious activity possibility. The important MACCS keys were further divided into four classes which are summarized in Table 5.

tain MACCS155 and MACCS138. These inhibitors all contained six- membered aliphatic rings, but there were no heteroatoms in the aliphatic ring and no aliphatic chain structure. In addition, they contained three consecutive nitrogen atom structures, which made them all contain pyrrolotriazolopyrimidine. A total of 35 inhibitors meet the above characteristics, 33 of which were weakly active inhibitors.

In this study, we set the radius of the Morgan fingerprint to 4 and the length to 4096 bits, we screened the fingerprints to remove the bits whose variance was less than the average variance. Finally, 958 bits were reserved. According to the importance of the random forest model of all inhibitors, we listed the top 100 uniquely meaningful Morgan keys in Table S2 in the Supplementary materials.

Among these keys, the top ranking one contributes more to the model than the other ones in the behind. Subsequently, we analyzed some com- mon scaffold structures with obvious regularities. As shown in Table 6, Group 1 (354 inhibitors) included Morgan2895 and Morgan4078 keys, yet excluded Morgan1772 keys. Among them, 353 compounds were highly active inhibitors and only one was weakly active. These inhibitors were analogs of Itacitinib and had an obvious common scaffold struc- ture.

A total of 652 inhibitors in Group 3 contained Morgan1357 keys and did not contain Morgan1772, Morgan2895, and Morgan2772 keys. They were divided into seven subgroups. Among them, Subgroup 3A contained 104 highly active inhibitors and 31 weakly active inhibitors. Subgroup 3B(294 highly active inhibitors and 20 weakly active in- hibitors), Subgroup 3C(75 highly active inhibitors and 15 weakly active inhibitors) and Subgroup 3F(all of 37 inhibitors were highly active) had the same scaffold structure as Subgroup 2D, Subgroup 2B and Subgroup 3E in Group 2, but none of them contained a cyano structure. There were 30 inhibitors in Subgroup 3D, among them, 26 inhibitors were highly active and four inhibitors were weakly active. There were 16 inhibitors in Subgroup 3G, most of which were weakly active inhibitors. The high- weak activity ratios and corresponding sub-structures of all subgroups were shown in Table 6.

As shown in Table 6, Group 4 accommodated a total of 427 in- hibitors. The inhibitors contained Morgan1772 and Morgan3091 keys but did not contain Morgan2962 and Morgan2481 keys. Among them, 415 inhibitors were weakly active molecules, the unfavorable substruc- tures may reduce their activities.
