Abstract Tuberculosis is a social, re-emerging infectious disease with medical implications throughout the globe. Despite efforts, the coverage of tuberculosis disease (with HIV prevalence) in Nigeria rose from 2.2% in 1991 to 22% in 2013 and the orthodox diagnosis methods available for Tuberculosis diagnosis were been faced with a number of challenges which can, if measure not taken, increase the spread rate; hence, there is a need for aid in diagnosis of the disease. This study proposes a technique for intelligent diagnosis of TB using Genetic-Neuro-Fuzzy Inferential method to provide a decision support platform that can assist medical practitioners in administering accu- rate, timely, and cost effective diagnosis of Tuberculosis. Performance evaluation observed, using a case study of 10 patients from St. Francis Catholic Hospital Okpara-In-Land (Delta State, Nigeria), shows sensitivity and accuracy results of 60% and 70% respectively which are within the acceptable range of predefined by domain experts.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a social, re-emerging infectious disease that has medical implications throughout the globe [1]. The largest single cause of adult illness and death from the commu- nicable disease is caused by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis [2]. Nigeria has made great strides in increasing access to Directly Observed Therapy Short-course (DOTS) for TB yet, coverage, which was 45% in 1999, had reached 75% by 2005 while treat- ment success for 2005 cohort was 75% [3]. Although TB inci- dence in Nigeria is below the normal level for Sub-Saharan Africa, but it remains high at a rate of 311 cases per 100 grand

population members in 2006. The trends for both Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa, as depicted in Fig. 1, show a slight down- ward turn of TB incidence since 2003. Still with 250 grand new cases each year, a mortality rate of 81 deaths per 100,000 spells the disease as high burden on Nigeria [4].

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in 2006, that each year, more than 8 million new cases of TB occur and approximately 3 million persons die from the disease [4,5] and estimated that between 19% and 43% of the world’s popula- tion will be infected with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. Within the past decade it has become clear that the spread of HIV infection and the immigration of persons from areas of high incidence have resulted in increased numbers of TB cases. It has always occurred disproportionately among disadvantaged populations such as the homeless, malnourished, and over- crowded [6]. Today, several methods for the diagnosis of TB have been proposed. Tuberculin Test, Radiological Examina- tion, and Sputum Smear Microscopy are common conven- tional approaches however in the last 10 years, several molecular methods have been developed for direct detection, identification and susceptibility testing of mycobacteria [7].

Orthodox methods of diagnosing TB are primarily through physical examination and laboratory tests. The former involves asking patients certain questions for prognosis pur- poses while tests are carried out to affirm physical examina- tion. Diagnosis can be stopped if medical practitioner is totally convinced after physical examination however, this is not advised. This orthodox method is currently faced with a number of challenges such as lack of medical facilities in most medical centers and as a result, inhibiting the management of TB in developing countries.

The strength of IT in providing an effective and efficient solution to real life problems has been explored to aid scientific discoveries and advancement of different fields of medicine [8]. Hence, to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates in human as a result of TB, there is need to incorporate IT into its diag- nostic approach. This study, therefore, proposes a decision support model for intelligent diagnosis of TB using Genetic- Neuro-Fuzzy Inferential technique. The model is aimed at pro- viding a decision support platform that can aid medical prac- titioners in administering accurate, timely, and cost effective diagnosis of TB in developing countries.

AI is the intelligence deployed by machines to handle com- plex imprecise tasks that require intelligence if done by humans. The central problems of AI include reasoning, pro- gramming, artificial life, belief revision, knowledge representa- tion, machine learning, natural language understanding, and theory of computation [12,13,38]. It achieved greater feats in practical application despite, some setbacks, its success is being revived with the commercial success of ES [39]. Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms, are such tech- niques used in modeling intelligence.

The basic steps in ES development have been reported in [15]. Many AI systems have been developed for the purpose of enhancing healthcare delivery, providing better healthcare facilities, and reducing the cost associated with quality health- care services. Early studies in intelligent systems have been shown to outperform manual practices of medical diagnosis. Examples of such systems are as follows: INTERNIST, a rule-based expert system for the diagnosis of complex prob- lems in general internal medicine; MYCIN, a rule-based expert system to diagnose and recommend treatment for certain blood infections; CASNET, an expert system for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma, EXPERT, an extension general- ization of the CASNET formalism which was used in creating consultation systems in rheumatology and endocrinology [16].

ping of an input data set to a scalar output data set, basically it is aimed at providing approximate reasoning. This technique has attracted growing attention and interest in modern IT, pat- tern recognition, and decision making among others [18]. FL theory provides a mathematical strength to capture uncertain- ties associated with human cognitive processes, such as think- ing and reasoning. It is a suitable and applicable basis for developing knowledge-based systems in varying sectors of life such as health. It has been applied to interpret sets of medical findings; syndrome differentiation in eastern medicine and diagnosis of diseases in western medicine; and for real-time monitoring of patient data [19].

In fuzzy set theory, linguistic terms are used to illustrate the correlation of Membership Function (MF) which describes the membership of an element within the base of a fuzzy set. Each element has a unit value that characterizes the grade of mem- bership of a set and such element can simultaneously belong to another set, possibly, at varying degrees. Ref. [20] emphasize that a number of different types of MFs have been proposed for fuzzy control systems though [21] concluded triangular and trapezoidal MFs as the mostly used. Triangular MF is a particular case of MF that is specified by three parameters (a, b, c) and shows the degree of membership of each class of a linguistic term as possibility distribution [22]. Fig. 2a rep- resents a typical Triangular MF of input and output variables while Fig. 2b uses four parameters to describe the membership of an element in a fuzzy set using Trapezoidal MF.

In fuzzy set, an element can belong to both its set and its compliment set or to neither of them. This principle preserves the structure of the logic and avoids the contradiction of ele- ment. However, fuzzy logic is highly abstract and employs heuristic requiring human experts to discover rules about data relationship [19]. FL has been widely adopted in developing ESs for health management. For instance, [18] proposed model ES for typhoid fever, while [23] for malaria diagnosis, and lastly, [24] developed a diagnostic ES for cardiovascular dis- eases. In [19], the use of Fuzzy Cluster Means was applied to diagnose HIV/AIDS shortly after [25] proposed the use of fuzzy sets for diagnosing low back pain in computer users.

Neural Network (NN) is a group of interconnected artificial neurons that mimic the properties of biological neurons. It fol- lows analog and parallel computing system made up of simple processing elements that communicate through a rich set of interconnections with varying contributory weights. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), is synthetic nervous systems loosely inspired to simulate functions of human brain [26]. ANN attempts to abstract the complexity of biological nervous sys- tem so as to focus on what may hypothetically matter most from an information processing point of view.

Medicine has always benefited from forefront of technology as it has boosted medicine to extraordinary levels of achieve- ment. ANN has been successfully used in various areas of med- icine such as biomedical analysis, imaging systems, and drug development but extensively used in diagnosis to detect ail- ments such as cancer and heart problems in human [27]. The term network in ANN arises because of the function f(x) defined as a composition of other function gi(x) which are fur- ther used as composition of more functions.

The figure comprises of input units connected to hidden units which in turn is connected to a layer of ‘‘output” units. The activity of the input unit represented the raw information that is fed into the network; the activity of the hidden units is deter- mined by the activity of the input units and the weights between the hidden and output units. The hidden units are free to construct their own representation of the input; the weights between the input and hidden units determine when each hid- den unit is active and so by modifying the weights, a hidden unit can choose what it represents.

GAs have got a great measure of success in search and opti- mization problems. While the algorithm is relatively straight forward, it is an effective stochastic search method, proven as a robust problem solving technique that produces better than random results [29]. GAs are robust and powerful in dif- ficult situations where the space is usually large, discontinuous, complex and poorly understood [30], it has been applied in a wide range of problem areas, though it just guarantee finding an acceptable solution in a quick and not a global optimum solution to a problem.

[38] but over the years, it has migrated to an interactive system that assists users in taking quick appropriate decisions in any given context [31]. In a related study, Ref. [32] developed a fuzzy expert system as a platform for diagnostic support for hypertension management. The system is composed of four major components for fuzzy processes while Root Sum Square and Center of Gravity were employed as fuzzy inference and defuzzification methods respectively. A case study of 30 patients with tuberculosis was used to validate the ES. [33] combined NN, FL and Case Based Reasoning to model DSS for diagnosis of depression disorders. The NNs were con- structed to imitate intelligent human biological processes of learning while FL provides a means for dealing with impreci- sion, vagueness and uncertainties in the medical data and CBR entails the use of past situations to solve new occur- rences. Finally, this study proposes a Genetic-Neuro-Fuzzy inferential technique for diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Structured database presents quantitative data about facts and the established rules in the field of medicine focusing on diag- nosis of TB. The facts comprise of signs and symptoms of TB, while rules are patterns to draw deductions based on available information [18]. Unstructured database is heuristic in nature and hence gathered by experience, good practices, guesses, and judgments [34]. The database comprises of Patient-Bio- Data, Disease-Physical-Signs, Disease-Symptoms, Medical- History, Physical Examination, results of diagnostic tests and Patient Diagnosis.

3.1.2.4. Defuzzification of output values. Defuzzification of out- put values involves translating result from the inference engine into crisp values which are, mostly, required by medical experts for proper analysis and interpretation, this aids effi- cient diagnosis. This research employs Centroid of Area (CoA) technique for its defuzzification. This interface receives

Establishment of fuzzy rule base. The rule base for TB diagnosis is characterized by a set of IF–THEN rules in which the antecedents (IF parts) and consequents (THEN parts) involve linguistic variables. The rules can be formulated with assistance of experts in the management of TB, or on consul- tation to existing standard literature. A rule can only fire if any of its precedence parameters such as very mild, mild, mod- erate, severe, and very severe evaluates to TRUE, otherwise it does not fire.

Fuzzy inference engine. This component controls the decision making logic by applying suitable composition proce- dure from rule base to values of variable inputs received. The inference engine applies composition procedure on the inputs to produce desired output, and Root Sum Square (RSS), is applied to scale the functions at their respective magnitude and computes a composite area. RSS is a method used to com- bine the effects of fired rules in order to draw relevant infer- ence. It is computed with Eq. (4).

Neural Network has the capability of capturing domain knowledge from available indicators and can readily handle both continuous and discrete data. NN is used to train and test the designed fuzzy system to optimize the performance of the overall system. The NN component of Fig. 6 is made up of variables from Physical Examination (PE), Medical History (MH), Laboratory Investigation (LI), and Chest Radiology (CR) of patients. Each diagnosis variable has a weight Wi which shows its contribution in the diagnosis process.

increases computation cost. In this study, genetic optimization is performed to choose optimal values from a group of diag- nostic parameters which serve as input. Fig. 6 shows there are 24 diagnostic parameters in the NN but the task is to decide which parameters are taken as input in order to mini-

gene represents the connection weight of a diagnosis variable in a length of 1 bit. One feasible solution is to generate an ini- tial population holding a set of possible solutions from ran- dom chromosomes. A chromosome is represented as a vector C = (CA, ... , CX) of binary decision variables Ci=0,2,3; encoded in binary representation as string consisting {0, 1} genes. A gene Ci = 1 if the ith variable is included in a solution set of a diagnostic process otherwise 0. Fitness function is used to optimize each chromosome by evaluating the genes that constitute the chromosome using their fitness value.

As evolutionary algorithm continues through its cycle, fit- ness value of each chromosome keeps improving till it reaches an optimum value when it can no longer improve. Fig. 7 shows chromosomes of some candidates and their fitness values. A number of constraints have been considered in carrying out appropriate management of disease in medical diagnosis, therefore fitness evaluation of chromosome must be done with

which denote inputs to the system. The inputs are numeric val- ues representing how severe a patient feels the diagnosis vari- ables. The output of this layer is the linguistic labels corresponding to each input value. The second layer is made up of adaptive nodes that receive the output of preceding layer as input, and produce their corresponding membership grade determined as:

ponents of Fig. 4 to provide a self-learning and adaptive system for handling uncertain and imprecise data for diagnosis of tuberculosis. The inference system employs feed forward propagation learning technique made up of seven layers of neurons as shown in Fig. 8. Both hidden and output layers

The decision made by GENFIS is optimized by Decision Sup- port Engine (DSE) which takes the output of GENFIS as input and tunes to fit any diagnostic case at hand [37]. The sup- porting components of DSE are cognitive filter which objec- tively influences the result of GENFIS on conformance basis with knowledge extracted from medical personnel, holding assumptions and beliefs with heuristics in medical field and emotional filter that refers to subjective feelings of a medical personnel based on physical and psychological elicited from patient. Emotional filter provides information that helps med- ical personnel to decide whether a diagnostic result from GEN- FIS is as a result of the patient’s situation or environmental inhibiting factors.

Simulation of the proposed model was done with a case study of 10 patients from Saint Francis Catholic Hospital Okpara- In-Land, Delta State, Nigeria. The procedure was observed in Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) Version 7.9 environment, the result and evaluation of the simulations are reported in this section.

the records were retrieved and assessed by domain experts in human respiratory diseases. Assessment was based on intensity of the input variables and the expertise of the (human) expert. Intensity of each variable represents its contribution to TB infection, rating was thereafter done based on linguistic terms shown in Table 2.

Result obtained from fuzzification of variables serves as input to the neural network. Each node in the network is a three-layered feed forward architecture which interacts with each other as shown in Fig. 8. Back-propagation algorithm with sigmoid function is used to train the NN for hidden and output layer neurons’ transformation. The NN trained by the subsystem consists of 24 nodes at the input layer, each representing unique TB variables considered in this study. To determine an optimal number of variables needed for a diag- nosis, GA component of the proposed GENFIS takes all vari- ables as input and optimizes them into just N variables whose values have role to play in the diagnosis. Hence, the genotype is represented by a sequence of symptoms as described earlier. During simulation, binary-matrix vectors with length n were created. Each element of the vector corresponds to speci- fic diagnostic parameters in NN. The binary bit of a diagnostic

Hence, if the value of a parameter is equal to 1 then the variable will be selected otherwise not. In this simulation, the GA used selected values given in Table 3 to find optimal solu- tion and once a complete set of optimal value for the parame- ters is reached, the GA processes stops. High mutation probability used in the parameter settings is a brain behind bringing new individuals at each stage hence, to avoid a sce- nario whereby best combination will only be from initial indi- viduals who passed first selections.

Medical records of 10 patients from the Hospital of our case study were taken as testing data for the system. Result obtained from simulation indicates that GA component of the proposed model can extract a maximum of 13 out of 24 parameters as the best combination. As shown in Table 4, selected parameters show that the model is sensitive to radio- graphic variables. The variables were selected for all cases with diagnosis result above 50%. Diagnosis of records R04, R09, and R10 by the model shows that patients possessing such attributes have tuberculosis infection.

The use of soft computing techniques in medical diagnosis can- not be overemphasized as they have greatly imparted the pro- cesses in medical diagnosis and aided an increase in diagnosis accuracy. This novel study demonstrated how an aggregation of such technique can assist in the diagnosis of TB. In the approach, cognitive and emotional filters were adapted to take care of contextual factors that often affect medical expert during diagnosis of diseases in the traditional and conventional ways. This study shows that a combination of the soft computing methods can offer a more effective system of medical diagnosis with improved system accuracy. For instance, [32] validated a fuzzy-based expert system for tuberculosis diagnosis with 61% accuracy. Also, in [24], a neuro-fuzzy decision support model for therapy of heart failure was conducted and a sensitivity analysis conducted shows that diagnosis done by the model has a high concordance of 60.72% with physician’s diagnosis at an accuracy of 57.14%. Unlike the proposed model, existing systems does not have a thorough scope in terms of data set or diagnosis depth and on a general sense, the model exhibits a relatively higher performance when compared with existing

So well so good, this study demonstrates how triangular membership functions of fuzzy logic system can be employed to define linguistic labels and neural networks were introduced for self-tuning and adaptation in case of new situations. Also, for effective selection of optimal input parameters, Genetic Algorithm has been incorporated. Yet, the effectiveness of the model has only been validated using casual TB records because the rule base of the knowledge base was formulated. To further validate the results of this model, sufficient real- life records of TB patients can be obtained from medical clinics in order to generate rules and training data sets.
