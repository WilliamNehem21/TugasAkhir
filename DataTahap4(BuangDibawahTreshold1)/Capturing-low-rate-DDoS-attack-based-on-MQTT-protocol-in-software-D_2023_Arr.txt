Another solution for ensuring interoperability across devices in the IoT perception layer is to utilize the MQTT protocol to handle the het- erogeneous data produced by various smart objects. MQTT is a messaging protocol that allows devices to connect through a central server known as a broker, which is responsible for relaying data from machine to machine. MQTT is based on a publish/subscribe paradigm of operation. However, the widespread adoption of the MQTT protocol has also attracted the attention of cyber attackers who can launch different types of attacks, including LR-DDoS attacks [14]. The LR-DDoS attack is

LR-DDoS attacks are a major threat to IoT systems, particularly those relying on the MQTT protocol. These attacks can congest network traffic, overload devices, and exhaust system resources, leading to ser- vice interruptions and data breaches. LR-DDoS attacks are difficult to detect and mitigate, making them attractive to attackers. Traditional detection mechanisms have difficulty differentiating between normal and malicious traffic, which allows attackers to move undetected. In addition to being susceptible to LR-DDoS attacks, IoT devices are also often resource-constrained, which makes them more vulnerable. Due to their limited memory, processing power, and battery life, IoT devices are unable to support complex security mechanisms. They are susceptible to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in their communication protocols.

With the increasing number of interconnected IoT devices, LR-DDoS attacks pose a significant challenge to the security and resilience of IoT systems. Fig. 3 illustrates an LR-DDoS attack, including the attack period Ta, burst period Tb, attack burst rate Rb, and starting time S [15, 16]. The attack can be identified by analyzing the source, destination IP, port, and protocol. In low-rate TCP DoS attacks, burst packets are sent periodically with a burst rate exceeding the bottleneck capacity,

Researchers have proposed various detection and mitigation mech- anisms to address the challenge of LR-DDoS attacks on IoT systems. However, only some of these mechanisms could be more efficient or impractical due to the resource constraints of IoT devices [18]. There- fore, there is a need for an effective and efficient mechanism that can detect LR-DDoS attacks based on the MQTT protocol in software-defined IoT environments.

The remaining parts of this article are structured in the following manner: In Section 2, the literary works are presented and summarized. Section 3 provides the specifics of the proposed scheme, the methodol- ogy for evaluating its efficacy in detecting and preventing Low-Rate DDoS attacks, and details on experiments conducted. Section 4 ana- lyzes the obtained results, compares the implemented schemes, and benchmarks the optical scheme with other state-of-the-art models. Finally, Section 5 concludes the article and suggests potential future directions.

LR-DDoS attacks have been on the rise in IoT networks, leading to the development of various techniques to detect and mitigate them. The use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has gained significant attention in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks due to the increasing number of IoT devices and their susceptibility to cyber-attacks. The literature re- view has been divided into three categories: (1) LR-DDoS Attacks based on IoT networks, (2) DDoS attacks based on MQTT Protocol in IoT Environment, and (3) DDoS attacks in a Software-Defined IoT Environment.

[19] proposed a method named HMM-RF, which combines the Hidden Markov Model and random forest classifier to identify LR-DDoS attacks in cloud data centers. The Hidden Markov Model analyzes traffic flow features, while the random forest classifier differentiates between normal and attacked flow based on the predicted attack level. Renyi entropy is used to calculate attack probabilities.

A mechanism has been proposed by Singh et al. [20] for preventing and detecting IP spoofing, which is a common form of cyber-attack. The proposed mechanism utilizes a neural network as a classifier to prevent spoofed packets from entering the network. The neural network is optimized using an artificial neural network to improve performance. Several parameters have been considered to evaluate the mechanism’s

SlowITe is a new low-rate denial-of-service attack proposed by Vaccari et al. [27]. This attack targets MQTT and makes use of low-rate techniques. This study focuses on the vulnerabilities in IoT environ- ments using the MQTT protocol. The authors also explain how the client can modify the Keep-Alive parameter of the server, which gives the attacking node control over the connection closure timeouts on the server. The same authors, Vaccari et al. [28], also introduced SlowTT as an SL-DoS attack. To prevent legitimate clients from setting up MQTT sessions and sending or receiving messages owing to a lack of open connection sockets, the attack aims to consume and block as many of the broker’s open TCP connections as possible. Once the attacker has started

In IoT networks, the MQTT protocol is used for machine-to-machine communication, making it vulnerable to DDoS attacks. In the study by Haripriya and Kulothungan [33], they found that spoofing attacks can be used against MQTT. This means an attacker can send a malicious packet that looks like a legitimate message packet. This vulnerability happens because the MQTT broker can’t tell the difference between

In [36], Ghannadrad aimed to detect and classify DoS attacks for MQTT sensor networks by simulating a smart home scenario and col- lecting reliable data. Ghannadrad proposed a realistic MQTT-based dataset that includes legitimate and malicious flow-level traffic. On- line and offline machine learning (ML) solutions were presented for detecting and classifying DoS attacks. Through the evaluation of the study, the author successfully differentiated between malicious and legitimate traffic as a binary classification, and the classifiers were able to detect and classify different categories of DoS attacks in a multi-value classification. Ghannadrad simulated a smart house scenario and collected credible data to detect and classify MQTT sensor network DoS attacks [36]. Ghannadrad presented a realistic MQTT-based dataset, including valid and malicious flow-level communication. Online and offline machine learning (ML) systems detected and classified DoS as-

could detect and categorize multiple DoS attack categories as multi-value classifications. Aldhyani and AlKahtani [37] proposed an ML-based IDS for MQTT protocol in IoT networks using four algorithms, with the CNN-LSTM model having the highest precision of 98.94%. The proposed frameworks and solutions effectively detected attacks in blockchain IoT and MQTT networks.

SDN is becoming a popular way to manage and secure IoT networks due to its dynamic traffic management capabilities. Bhayo et al. [38] proposed a secure and fast Software-Defined Networking framework to prevent DDoS attacks in IoT systems (SDN). The framework improved detection accuracy and reduced false positive rates by assessing multiple metrics from a huge volume of SDN communication data. DDoS attacks in IoT systems can be managed securely and quickly using the proposed framework. SDN-based entropy-based DDoS detection and mitigation in IoT networks is proposed by Galeano-Brajones et al. [39]. OpenStack, an extension of Openflow, allows SDN switches to store information about previously processed flows, lowering controller load. The authors filter harmful traffic using entropy. The switch doesn’t respond to the

An entropy-based technique for identifying and thwarting DDoS as- saults in IoT networks utilizing SDN is proposed by Galeano-Brajones et al. [39]. The approach is based on the OpenState protocol, an addi- tion to the OpenFlow protocol that enables SDN switches to save details about previously handled flows, lessening the burden on the controller. The writers use entropy to spot malicious traffic and create filtering rules

to lessen the threat. The proposed technique rapidly identifies and mitigates the DDoS attack by removing the flow entry from the switch using monitoring data acquired from flows and state tables at the data plan. The drawback of this strategy is that the switch needs to inform the controller of the states when the window size is too large. Anbarsu et al.

et al. [41] developed a feed-forward neural network model to recognize DoS and DDoS attacks that use various activities. When the model was put through its paces using the BotIoT dataset, it effectively detected DDoS attacks using 8 or 10 features, attaining an accuracy rate of 99.99% overall. The Adam optimization technique and a hyperbolic tangent activation function are used for each neuron in the neural net-

The literature review highlights the knowledge gap in detecting LR- DDoS attacks based on MQTT protocol in SD-IoT environments using lightweight and efficient detection mechanisms. While previous studies proposed detection mechanisms, they require significant resources or could perform better on resource-constrained IoT devices. Additionally, few studies have explored the feasibility and effectiveness of ML-based detection mechanisms for LR-DDoS attacks based on the MQTT proto- col. Therefore, the article proposes an intelligent lightweight detection scheme that uses machine learning models and minimal features to achieve high detection accuracy with peak detection speed. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ML-based study to use only two features and achieve the best accuracy with maximum detection speed compared to previous works.

This section uses various learning and evaluation techniques to investigate the development and assessment approaches of the proposed low-rate DDoS attack detection model based on the MQTT protocol in the software-defined Internet of Things environment (SDN-IoT). Fig. 4 illustrates the overall workflow diagram for developing and evaluating the proposed LR-DDoS detection system.

repository, a global data warehouse for different applications and dis- ciplines. LR-DDoS-MQQT-2022 dataset [30] has been collected for the purpose of model evaluation in capturing LR-DDoS attacks based on MQQT  protocol  in  a  software-defined  IoT  environment. LR-DDoS-MQQT-2022 dataset is an up-to-date and balanced dataset that has been extracted using the OpenFlow software tool for generating real-time DDoS attacks in SD-IoT. It comprises 200,00 traffic samples distributed equally into two target classes: 100,00 samples for the normal traffic and 100,00 samples for the LR-DDoS traffic. Besides, its feature set comprises 21 input features (shown below in Fig. 5) and one label feature used to classify the traffic as normal or LR-DDoS.

After that, the accumulated dataset underwent a validation and preparation phase to ensure the readiness of the traffic samples for the training procedure using the machine learning modules. This includes the samples checking against missing records/values, duplicated sam- ples, errors in data entries, categorical data encoding or excluding samples randomization, and the dataset division into training and testing datasets. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the LR-DDoS-MQQT- 2022 dataset into training and testing datasets.

minimum number of essential features that enable the prediction at the highest accuracy and maximum prediction speed (i.e., lightweight). As a result, only two main features (CSUM and SRC_PORT) have been finally used to develop the proposed lightweight detection system to capture the LR-DDoS attack based on MQTT protocol in software defined-IoT ecosystems.

The next stage is the learning stage which comprises the training and testing phases for the system using the prescribed training and testing datasets. In this module, we have examined the performance ability of four machine-learning models in discovering anomalous traffic, viz. decision tree classifier (DTC), multilayer perceptron (MLP), artificial neural networks (ANN), and naïve Bayes classifier (NBC). At each experiment, we employed the Ten-fold cross-validation in order to ensure effective validation for the learning process using the LR-DDoS- MQQT-2022 dataset. Fig. 7 shows the validation policy used in this research. The dataset was divided into ten parts; nine were taken to train the model, and one was used to test the model. The mean value E of the ten-fold test results is calculated to approximate the model accuracy for the current Ten-fold cross-validation model, where Ei represents the cross-validation error of the ith group.

model, we have contrasted our model with several state-of-the-art models, including (a) Zhijun et al. model [21]: developed the LR-DDoS detection model using Factorization Machine (FM), convolu- tional neural network (CNN), and random forest classifier (RFC), (b) Mugunthan et al. model [19]: developed the LR-DDoS detection model using RFC Classifier, (c) Singh et al. model Singh et al. [20]: developed the LR-DDoS detection model using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) with artificial neural network (ANN), (d) Verma et al. model [22]: developed the LR-DDoS detection model using the mean absolute deviation (MAD) technique with an RFC (MAD-RF), (e) Xu et al. model [29]: developed the LR-DDoS detection model using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network and recurrent gated unit (1-CNN-RGU), (f) AlMasri et al. model [31]: developed the LR-DDoS detection model using a naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), and (g) P´erez et al. model [19]: developed the LR-DDoS detection model using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model and support vector machine (SVM) model [24].

This paper presents, discusses, and evaluates a new intelligent sys- tem to investigate the impact of LR-DDoS attacks based on the MQTT protocol in the SD-IoT ecosystem. Specifically, the proposed system employs several supervised learning schemes to distinguish LR-DDoS traffic from legitimate traffic. To evaluate the performance of the learning models, a new dataset, LRDDoS-MQTT-2022, extracted from real-time traffic of SD-IoT communication comprising both DDoS attacks and normal packets, has been used. The minimum number of input features has been used to train the learning models with a balanced number of samples per class (100,000 samples for normal traffic and 100,000 samples for LR-DDoS traffic) to obtain the swiftest traffic pre- diction rate. As a result, the detection-based DTC model has reported the highest accuracy proportion, with 99.5% at the lowest prediction lag- ging. In the future, we will seek to investigate other types of cyber- attacks based on the MQTT protocol in the SD-IoT ecosystem, such as brute force authentication (BFA) attacks. Another perceptible future work is the generation of a real-time or simulated dataset covering diverse IoT protocols and attacks. Furthermore, mitigation or prevention techniques can be investigated as an extension for the presented detection system to provide a completely autonomous security system. Finally, incorporating the analysis of 5G attacks and persistent threats using advanced learning techniques can investigate in a similar context to this research [44,45].
