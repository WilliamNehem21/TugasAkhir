In this paper, the centroid change of six-track rescue robot with four swinging arms has been analyzed by means of center of mass theory. The relationship between centroid curve and the angle of swing arm are been reasoned analysed. And then, the relationship is verified by the simulation software. At last, the main conclusions are as follows:
