With the current multimedia technology, the captured images and understanding these images through its contents have gained lots of attention from the computer vision community. Contents of an images and video help in clear understanding the information present within. A text is one of the images and video content which carries semantic information, and may help to provide the scene description of an image. Hence, the detection and extraction of either scene or graphics text has

The above stated studies revealed that the text detection approaches are either region or texture based methods. Though the concept of k-means clustering algorithm and a connected component analysis have used, the detection accu- racy of the text region can still be improved without missing text data and reducing most of the falsely detected blocks of an image. Detection of texts of south Indian language is still a challenging task. Words of such south Indian languages are framed with modifiers and compound bases. To detect such a texts in an images/video, we propose a method based

The Wavelet Transform is a method convolution of the wave- let function with the signal. The ability of the discrete wavelet transform to decompose a signal at different independent scales and to do it in a very flexible way [12]. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an implementation of the wavelet transform using a discrete set of the wavelet scales and trans- lations. In our research work wavelets are used as analytical tools for signal processing. A study has performed about the development of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), as a series expansion of signals in terms of wavelets and scaling functions which are associated with low pass and high pass

Clustering in [14] is a group of methods for finding and describing cohesive groups in data, such as compact clusters of entities in the feature space. To find and describe a cohesive groups in our data, we applied k-means clustering. The main objective of applying k-means is to minimize the total intra- cluster variance as well as to build a classification over empir- ical data. The procedure of k-means clustering begins with initiating k tentative centroids. Further, tasks such as collect- ing clusters around centroids and updating centroids with clus- ter means, until its convergence are repeatedly performed. k- means mainly depends on the initialization of the centroids. In this regard, we initialized k value as 2 and observed the detected true text region. When we initialize k value as 3, the obtained true text region was more accurate than when
