Short-circuit test of transformer is an important method for the study of transformer features. The simulation method for short-circuit test of transformer is useful to investigate the working principle and characteristic of transformers. And there are many kinds of software to finish the simulation, MALAB/Simulink is one of the most popular software in this field. Some application such as the model and simulate the dynamic behavior of ac-powered electromechanical contactors[1], the integration of Matlab and Excel to conceptualize the relationship between abstract mathematical models to practical situations[2], using specially designed exercises about substation lightning protection in teaching high voltage course in Matlab[3], modeling of power systems on the transient analysis[4], the surge modelling of a transformer[5], etc. in this
