Learning schools are classified broadly into three or four, the Behaviorist school, Cognitivist, Constructivist and Humanist. Behaviorists say that learning is a change in an observable student behavior through the stimulus it receives from the environment. Cognitivists ensure that learning requires the use of memory, motivation, thought and reflection that plays an important role in learning. Constructivists ensure students interpret information and the world according to their own reality, and learning by observation, processing and interpretation and then personalize the information within personal knowledge.

Behavioral strategies allow teach the facts and are used in the implementation of the course to show the formulations, algorithms or mathematical expressions of the methods discussed in the course. Cognitivist strategies will be used to teach the processes or procedures to be followed in the development and application of numerical methods included in the course. Constructivist strategies aim to develop a high level of thinking.

A good online educational theory allows us to observe basically 3 functions [8]. First, it helps us visualize new conceptual universes. A good theory helps us to do things, so it is expected that the theory considered in this work allows accessing an overview ("Big Picture") to help make sense of the methodological suggestions. A good theory can produce a work with honesty.

An online course is more flexible at least in time and space than education on campus (face to face). The Web provides more quality and quantity of access to all nearby users. It is understood that asynchronous interaction defines text-based environment. The theory of online education needs to educate teachers for making decisions about which technology options are best placed for application.
