Internet of things (IoTs) is a hot topic in recent years, and its various applications have been applied in several fields. The essence of IoTs is to connect all the things including the devices embedded RFID, sensors, etc. together, to help people utilizing the information from the things to improve their life. The things are always located at different places at different times, and the information of the thing may have different access right at different location during different time. Therefore, the access control mechanism in IoTs should consider location and temporary constraints in order to enhance the security of an application. In this paper, we propose a model that combines location and time with security level to control access to the information within the sensing layer of the IoTs. This model is called Location-Temporal Access Control Model(LTAC). The main principle of LTAC is its use of a lattice approach to decrease the size of policy bases. We show that how the different components in the model are related with location and how this location information can be used to determine whether a subject has access to a given object.

Internet of things (IoTs) is a hot topic in recent years, and its various applications have been applied in several fields[1] . The essence of IoTs is to connect all the things including the devices embedded RFID, sensors, etc. together, to help people utilizing the information from the things to improve their life. The things are always located at different places at different times, and the information of the thing may have different access right at different location during different time. Therefore, the access control mechanism[2] in IoTs should consider location and temporary constraints in order to enhance the security of an application.

The mainly existing access control schemes for the IoTs concentrate on authentication while ignoring more general models. To summarize, Benenson etc. provides a solution for defense against node capture through the collaboration of sensor nodes [3], while Shen proposes three access control schemes using the one-way key chain and the Merkle hash tree [4]. In [5], a solution to the problem of new node admissions is provided; however, the solution is not secure against replay attacks according to [6]. [7] lists influential works. These studies favor specialized schemes and show that few general access models are proposed for the IoTs.

In this paper, we propose a model that combines location and time with security level to control access to the information within the sensing layer of the IoTs. This model is called Location-Temporal Access Control Model(LTAC). The main principle of LTAC is its use of a lattice approach to decrease the size of policy bases. We show that how the different components in the model are related with location and how this location information can be used to determine whether a subject has access to a given object.

In order to describe operations that can only be executed within a given period, we first model time. Here, we use the notion of a calendar [8]. A calendar consists of a countable set of contiguous intervals. In a typical example, a calendar is set in years, months, and days. Since two calendars can have different granularities, a sub-calendar relationship can be established among them: given two calendars c1and c2 , c1is a sub-calendar of c2 (written as   ) iff there exists  with  , where N is a set of natural numbers. For example, days are a representative sub-calendar of months. Obviously,  is a partial order relation. A calendar base, written as CB, represents a set of calendars and will generally change with different contexts.

Let CT be a set of calendar times. Generally, any two calendar times are always comparable. That is, for any ctx and cty in CT, we have ctxcty, or ctyctx. In the IoTs, there exist different types of time constraints such as the earliest access time, the latest access time, the earliest finish time, and the latest finish time, etc. In this section, the earliest access time (eat) and the latest finish time (lft) are adopted. Now, we formally define time constraints.

Example 2. Let PERM={(Open,MicroWave), (SetParameter, MicroWave), (close, MicroWave)}, ACCBSE={ (lt1,lloc1 ),(lt2 ,lloc2 ),(lt3,lloc3 ),(lt4 ,lloc4 ) }. The access base for each permission is as follows: accbaseAssigned((close,	MicroWave))=	{	(lt1,lloc1 ),(lt2 ,lloc2 ),(lt3,lloc3 ),(lt4 ,lloc4 ) }, accbaseAssigned((SetParameter, MicroWave))={ (lt3,lloc3),(lt4,lloc4 ) } and accbaseAssigned((Open, MicroWave))={ (lt4,lloc4 ) }. From above, the cardinality of accbaseAssigned((Close, MicroWave)), accbaseAssigned((SetParameter, MicroWave)) and accbaseAssigned((Open, MicroWave)) is 4, 2, 1, respectively. Assuming that a lattice can be formed from these access bases as shown in Fig 2, then the access base for each permission could be changed as follows: accbaseAssigned((close, MicroWave))= { (lt1,lloc1)}, accbaseAssigned((SetParameter, MicroWave))={ (lt3,lloc3 ) } and accbaseAssigned((Open, MicroWave))={ (lt4,lloc4 )}. This means that the cardinality of all three bases is 1. Given an access request AccessRequest (id, Close, MicroWave) of node id locates at lloc3 and the current time satisfies lt3, then AllowRequest(id, Close, MicroWave) will be true since  . From this example, we are able to deduce that the size of policy bases can be decreased using an access lattice.

Traditional access control models do not take into account environmental factors before making access decisions. Such models may not be suitable for IoTs. Towards to this end, we have proposed a location- temporal access control model in this paper. In our model, the access to an object is determined by their location and time with reputation, to solve the problem of deciding when and where to authorize access requests, and who is able to access information, and utilize the notion of access lattice to decrease the size of policy base. In the future work, we will consider the situation that when a node moves into a location where communication is unstable, and the authorization information cannot be obtained in time.
