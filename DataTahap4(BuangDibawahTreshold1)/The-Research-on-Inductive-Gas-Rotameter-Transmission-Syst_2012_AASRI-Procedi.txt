full use of the function between float displacement and inductor, and the function between inductor and measured flow, measures inductor instead of flow rate, and fulfils the non-electrify electrometric. By converting the float displacement measurement for the inductor measurement after a series of circuit which is connected with the inductance sensor, and corresponding to the flow rate through the MSP430 processing, it finally accomplishes the functions of displaying the flow rate in scene and remote transmitting [1]. It also accomplishes the digital and intelligent measurement.

The rectifier circuit which makes full use of the rectifier components with unipolar conductivity rectifies the positive and negative alternating sine wave AC voltage to the pulse voltage in signal direction [5]. However, the unidirectional pulsating voltage tends to have great pulsating components, far from the ideal. The filter, composed of capacitors, inductances and other energy storage devices, can remove the pulse elements as much as possible, so that the output voltage can be relatively smooth.

In the design, we make use of the capacitance three-point oscillator circuit to achieve the conversion from the inductance to the voltage value and extract the voltage value by the AD conversion in the MSP430 MCU. We get the functional relationship between the voltage value and the gas flow by experiment and accomplish the function calculation by processing. As a conclusion, the method can achieve the remote transmission of the signal of the glass rotameter and improve the measurement accuracy by the correction function. The
