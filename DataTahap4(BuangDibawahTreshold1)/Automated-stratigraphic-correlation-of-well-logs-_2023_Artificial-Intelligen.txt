Establishing the stratigraphic framework is a crucial technology in geological interpretation (Cross and Lessenger, 1988), which is beneficial for reservoir estimation and geologic model building (Fang et al., 2021). Stratigraphic correlation is a widely used approach to provide information regarding stratigraphic and compartmentalization in a reservoir. For the traditional process of seismic interpretation, stratigraphic correlation is often obtained by geological interpreters, which is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the expertise of the interpreters (Tokpanov et al., 2020). To avoid the above problems, automatic stratigraphic correlation approaches have been proposed, employing computational algorithms and statistical methods to an- alyze stratigraphic data from different locations and determine the relative ages of rock layers or sedimentary deposits. Over the past decades, many automatic stratigraphic correlation approaches have been employed, such as the cross-correlation technique (Southam and Hay, 1978; Mann and Dowell, 1978), dynamic waveform matching technique (Smith and Waterman, 1980; Edwards et al., 2018), dynamic time warping (Wheeler and Hale, 2014; Behdad, 2019) and its improve- ments (Grant et al., 2018). These approaches mitigate the reliance on

key factor for the success of a CNN model. There are several excellent loss functions proposed for solving different tasks (Liu et al., 2022b,d; Yang et al., 2022), which have also been applied to address the accurate stratigraphic correlation (Tokpanov et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022a).

propagate while reducing the parameters. However, note that a dense block may generate a staggering amount of feature maps. To solve this problem, the Transition layer is introduced. The Transition layer is used to connect the Dense Block and reduce the channels of feature maps by

The second half of the ASDNet can be regarded as a decoder. It starts with four Conv Blocks to maintain the non-linear transformation while downscaling the channel size of the reduced feature maps generated by the encoder. Afterward, we apply two up-sampling layers followed by the OutConv and reshape operation, which are utilized to map the size of feature maps to the original well log length and get classifica- tion results. Based on the above operations, we can get the accurate stratigraphic correlation of corresponding well logs.

red and blue dots present the training and blind test wells, i.e., 88 wells and 88 wells, respectively. Here, the number of training wells is given by experiments. We select borehole diameter (CAL), spontaneous potential (SP), gamma ray (GR), acoustic (AC), and formation resistivity (RT) as the training data in this study. Note that there are several other commonly used well logs, such as density (DEN) and neutron

porosity (CNL). Due to the confidentiality agreement, we cannot obtain more kinds of well logs, therefore, we do not implement the ablation study about the sensitive well log selection in this work. It should be noticed that sensitivity analysis of well logs is important for automated stratigraphic correlation with the aid of deep learning.

Limitation: A deep learning model is suggested for implementing automated stratigraphic correlation of well logs. Note that the sug- gested ASDNet is actually a supervised model, indicating that we need a large number of labeled data as training data and training labels. These training labels are interpreted by experienced interpreters or calculated using traditional methods, which is time-consuming and laborious work. Moreover, the precision of training labels plays an im- portant role in the success of a deep learning model. In future work, we would like to introduce other state-of-the-art tools for determining the confidence intervals of the automated stratigraphic correlation results. Moreover, unsupervised models can also be utilized to solve automated well log correlation issues, such as Gaussian mixture model-based methods.

/uture work: As discussed above, the stratigraphic correlation of well logs is regarded as a segmentation task in this study. Therefore, we suggested a segmentation model, i.e., the Attention Based Dense Network (ASDNet), to enhance the performance of stratigraphic cor- relation. Certainly, the suggested ASDNet can be easily transferred to address other geological segmentation issues, such as horizon picking and fault interpretation.
