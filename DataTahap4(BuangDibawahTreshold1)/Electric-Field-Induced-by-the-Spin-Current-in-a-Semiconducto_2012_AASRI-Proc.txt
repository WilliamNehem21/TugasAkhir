Using a new spin current definition the spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a weak semiconductor Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling nanowire (quantum wire) have been investigated theoretically. It is found that two nonzero linear spin current density elements take on oscillation peaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be changed by the number of propagation modes and Dresselhaus constant, respectively. Moreover, the spin-current-induced electric field has been calculated and its strength is measurable with today’s technology which can be used to spin current detection. Our consequences also show that the strengths of spin current and spin-current-induced electric field for the Dresselhaus case are smaller than that for the Rashba case.

The intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect in semiconductors has attracted intensive attentions for its important role in semiconductor spintronics.[1, 2] There are two types of intrinsic SOC in semiconductor heterojunction two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), namely Rashba SOC (RSOC) and Dresselhaus SOC (DSOC).[3, 4] In the situation of SOC, a moving spin is under an equivalent magnetic field with its strength depending on momentum of the particle. Similar to a system with an external magnetic field, it is natural to ask whether a persistent current exists in a SOC system.

In the following, the numerical examples of nonzero linear spin current density elements and spin-current- induced electric field will be presented. The electron effective mass is taken as that for InGaAs quantum well m*=0.037me and the Dresselhaus constant β D=1.0×10-12 eVm, moreover, the Bohr magneton μ B=9.274× 10-24 A.m2 and the factor g=2. In the situation of hard-wall potential confining, it is assumed that the QW is elongated with a fixed area s=Ld and then the number of propagation modes (that is, the width of QW) will be decreased accordingly.[17] The initial length and width of QW are taken as L0=300 nm and d0=240 nm while the incident electron energies EĖ↓=Ef=5.9 meV. For one mode to four modes case the width d is taken as 80

Fig.4 (c) and (d) for the case of β D =2.0×10-12 eVm (dashed line), ET can reach ~10-5 V/m which is as much as that of mesoscopic semiconducting ring in Ref.10. Moreover, in Fig.4 (c) the electric potential difference between two points (60 nm, 200 nm, 2 nm) and (60 nm, 200 nm, 50 nm) forβ D =2.0×10-12 eVm can be calculated as about 0.289 nV which is also smaller than it for the RSOC case. However, this potential value is still measurable with today’s technology [20] indicating that the spin-current-induced electric field can be detected which provide a way of spin current detection for the DSOC instance.

In this paper, we have studied the spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a Dresselhaus nanowire (quantum wire). Using the electron wave-functions and definition of spin current, the linear and angular spin current densities and its induced electric fields have been calculated. It is found that two nonzero linear spin current density elements have peaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be changed by the number of propagation modes and Dresselhaus constant. Moreover, for the Dresselhaus QW instance the spin-current-induced electric field can also be detected which makes a way of spin current detection.
