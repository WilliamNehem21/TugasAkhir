Over the past decades, the stability of neural networks has been intensively investigated. In fact, except for stability property, boundedness is also one of the foundational concepts of dynamical neural networks, which plays an important role in investigation for the uniqueness of equilibrium point (periodic solutions), global asymptotic stability, global exponentially stable and its synchronization and so on [14, 15]. To the best of the authors knowledge, few authors have considered on the ultimate boundedness and attractor for CGNN with interval time-varying delays and distributed time-varying delays.

In this paper, the dynamics of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed delays is investigated. Novel multiple Lyapunov-Krasovkii functionals are designed to get new sufficient conditions guaranteeing the uniformly ultimate boundedness, the existence of an attractor and the globally exponential stability. The derived conditions are expressed in terms of LMIs, which are more relax than algebraic formulation and can be easily checked by the effective LMI toolbox in Matlab in practice.
