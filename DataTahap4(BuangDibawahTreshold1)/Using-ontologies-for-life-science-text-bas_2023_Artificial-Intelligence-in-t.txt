general characteristics and common knowledge regarding experimental studies, as well as to allow the communication among users, opening the opportunity to explore e-science concepts into the LS experimenta- tion domain. Potential future research directions would be to automate the process of creating the ontology. Beyond the creation of new on- tologies, another challenging area of work in the subject of ontologies is the evolution and mapping of current ontologies. Due to the cost of cre- ation, abstraction, and reusability, this is significant. Different types of ontologies can be derived from a core ontology to suit particular appli-
