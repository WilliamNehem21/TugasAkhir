A new decomposition method to calculate IMDCT is proposed in this paper. The decomposition algorithm can convert a pair of long transforms into 2 pairs of short transforms with half size of the long transforms. In addition, the decomposition algorithm can be utilized recursively to attain shorter transforms and reduce computational cycles. According to experimental results obtained previously, the number of computational cycles of 512-point IMDCT is estimated to be 9641, which is less than those in previous reports.

MDCT and IMDCT have been utilized to implement TDAC [1] in many standards. Because calculating MDCT/IMDCT requires much time, it is necessary to find efficient methods and simple structures for the task. To reduce area cost, the regressive methods and architectures were researched [2-6]. Allowing for VLSI implementation, the methods proposed in [2,3] are same efficient. But the architecture in [2] has a latch more. The method in [4] reduces about 7 eighths of computational time compared with ones in [2,3] by virtues of

A new decomposition method to calculate IMDCT is proposed in this paper. The work presented in this paper results from the method in [5]. Its aim is to further develop the algorithm in [5] and increase the computational efficiency for IMDCT computation. The core idea is to recursively decompose a pair of long transforms into 2 pairs of short transforms with half size of the long transforms. The detailed derivation of algorithm is proposed in section II. Conclusion is presented in Section III.

can be described as functions of X j in similar forms as ones in [5]. Equations (24)-(27), (36)-(39) have similar correspondences in [5] too. Therefore, there are similar computational cycles as [5] using equations (24)-(27), (36)-(39) to compute IMDCT. But the decomposition algorithm from two M/4-point transforms to four M/8-point transforms in part B, section II can be used recursively to get eight M/16-point transforms. After that, Equations (36)-(39) will become four pairs of M/16-point DCT-IV/DST-IV and computational cycles are reduced by 50%. Equations (40)-(43) will be in the form of eight items’ sum instead of four items’ sum and computational cycles are approximately doubled. Namely, the cycles to calculate 512-point IMDCT are approximately 9641 from the experimental results of [5]. Therefore, the presented decomposition algorithm can reduce computational cycles of IMDCT compared with 12153 in [5] and 9718 in [6].
