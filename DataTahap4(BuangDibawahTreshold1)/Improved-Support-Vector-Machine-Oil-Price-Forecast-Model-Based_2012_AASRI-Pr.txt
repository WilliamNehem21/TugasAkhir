difficult to accomplish the price data’s change. Therefore, we used GA to optimize the parameter selection methods of SVM in accordance with training data, and improved SVM forecast precision. To verify the validity of the model, we selected and analyzed the Brent oil stock price data from 2001/12/27 to 2011/10/30. Data for 2009/07/30 to 2011/07/22 were designated as training data set, and those for 2011/08/08 to 2011/08/17 were employed for testing. Results show that the forecast efficiency of GA-SVM was better than that of traditional SVM.

diplomacy and other factors. The frequent change of these factors makes oil price show uncertainty, mutagenicity, randomness. Therefore, the accurate prediction of oil price has become a hotspot topic studied all over the world. Some researchers put forward to predicting oil price with hierarchy SVM model[1], and present a forecasting model of oil price based on wavelet neural network and makes a simulation research [2]. Prediction methods based on intelligent algorithm have also been widely applied in recent years, such as the prediction of coal price based on BP neural network[3], a short-term electricity price forecasting model combined with wavelet transform, econometrics model and RBF neural network[4], a time series forecasting model with variable structure based on RBF neural network[5]. Good results have been obtained in the study above, but neural network, support vector machine model and some other models are inclined to fall into local extremum and overfiting. Therefore, it is a better solution to combine them with heuristic algorithm. From this viewpoint, this paper presents a SVM forecasting model of oil price selected by a genetic optimization (for short, GA) of the parameters.

affects the generalizability of the learning machine. Parameter C determines the penalty to large fitting deviation: An excessively large value may cause overlearning, but one too small easily results in less learning. The optimization of these parameters is therefore important in improving SVM performance.

In genetic algorithm, the problem’s solution is presented as the chromosome’s survival of the fittest process. Through the operations of duplication, crossover and mutation etc. complete the chromosome group unceasing evolution, restrains finally in most adapts the environment individual, thus obtains the problem’s optimal solution or the satisfactory solution.

This paper collected Brent oil stock price data from 2001/12/27 to 2011/10/30. The data between 2009/07/30 and 2011/07/22 were designated as training data set. On the basis of optimal SVM parameters by the training’s, we constructed the SVM forecast model. This model was used to forecast the oil price of 2011/08/08~2011/08/17. To obtain better convergence results, we normalized the training data, while data testing and forecasting were carried out at a distribution between [0, 1]. The process was coded by Matlab and the LibSVM[9] toolbox.

Predict results are shown in table 1, including original oil price data, GA-SVM-predicted data, traditional SVM–predicted data, and each predicted data set error and root mean squared error (RMSE). Errors and RMSE are important evaluation indicators of forecast results. The smaller the values obtained, the more accurate the model forecast.

For traditional SVM, parameter selection algorithm always lead to some problems such as overlearning and underlearning, and diminish algorithm performance and affect forecast precision. Using the GA optimization choice, SVM penalty factor, and kernel function parameter yielded good results. Through original data confirmation and validating, the GA-SVM forecast model enables good forecast results.
