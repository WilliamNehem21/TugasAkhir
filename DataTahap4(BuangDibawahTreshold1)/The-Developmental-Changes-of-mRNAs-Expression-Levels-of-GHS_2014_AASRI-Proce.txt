Different age group of Male Kazak sheep and Xinjiang fine wool sheep were used in the current study to investigate the developmental changes of GHSR mRNA expression. After measurement of body weight, hypothalamus and pituitary were sampled to extract total RNA for determining the abundance of GHSR mRNA by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. The results indicated that: (1) For both breeds, body weight among different ages was significantly different (P<0.05), and from day 30 to 90, the Kazak’s was notable higher than the Xinjiang’s (P<0.01); (2) Hypothalamus GHSR mRNAs expression level increased firstly and then declined with growing in both breeds. From day 60 to 90, the mRNAs expression level of the Kazak was extremely higher than that of the Xinjiang (P<0.01); (3) Pituitary GHSR mRNAs expression level increased with growing in both breeds, and was highly positively correlated with the cumulative growth curves. From day 2 to 90, the pituitary GHSR expression level of the Kazak was extremely higher than that of the Xinjiang (P<0.01). The results predicated that it may be pituitary GHSR but not hypothalamus GHSR through which ghrelin influenced sheep growing.

GHSR was a protein firstly identified from human and porcine hypothalamus and pituitary , which mainly acts as promotion factor of GH secretion. Howard et al. (1996) cloned GHSR cDNA and proved that GHSR was a G protein-coupled receptor, being a seven transmembrane Į helix protein receptor . There are two subtypes of GHSR , GHSR Ia and Ib .

The expression of GHSR mRNA is researched by in situ hybridization or an RNase protection assay mainly in ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and in the pituitary (Guan, X.M. et al . 1997). The main function of GHSR is to promote GH secretion and release in conjunction with GHS, which is closely correlative with animal growth.

Twenty-four male Kazak sheep and thirty male Xinjiang fine wool sheep, six for each different age group (days 2, 30, 60, 90, and 120), were selected from the Ziniquan Sheep Pasture in Shihezi City of Xinjiang Autonomous Region for the present study; however, there was no 120-day-old Kazak sheep. After measurement of body weight, animals were slaughtered for sampling hypothalamus and pituitary. The removed samples were stored at 70°C for total RNA analysis later.

RT products (0.5 μL) were amplified in a 10 μL PCR reaction containing 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Inc. Dalian, China), 1 ȝL of 10×PCR buffer (100 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 500 mmol/L KCl), 0.25 mmol/L each of dNTP, 1.25 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.5 ȝmol/L each of gene-specific primers.

PCR products were excised after being confirmed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and purified by V-gene DNA Purification Kit (V-gene Biotechnology, Ltd. Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s manual and then cloned into pMD18-T simple vector. Subsequently, the ligation products were transformed into JM109 cells. Positive clones based on blue-white selection were picked out for plasmid extraction by V-gene Kit (V-gene Biotechnology, Ltd. Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation and then identified by PCR using gene-specific primers. Plasmids containing inserts of the right size were sequenced by Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

The abundance of GHSR mRNA was estimated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with a fluorescence temperature cycler (DNA Engine Opticon Real-time PCR Systems, MJ Research, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The final reaction volume was 20 ȝL containing 1 ȝL of the RT products, 1 U EX Taq HS DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Inc. Dalian, China), 4 ȝL of 5×PCR buffer, 0.3 mmol/L each of dNTP, 3.75 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5 ȝmol/L each of primers, and 1 ȝL of 20×SYBR green. PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle of 1 min at 95ºC; 45 PCR cycles of 10 s at 95ºC, 10 s at the annealing temperature of the primers, 15 s at 72ºC, plate-reading; this was followed by an extension of 10 min at 72ºC; plate-reading every other 0.2ºC from 65ºC to 94ºC for drawing melting curves; and then the reaction was stopped with an extension of 5 min at 72ºC.

Significant difference is denoted with letters (the capital for the Xinjiang and the small for the Kazak) and means without a common superscript indicate significant differences (P<0.05) between ages in the same breed. Double stars ** indicate extreme differences (P<0.05) between breeds at the same age.

The amplified GHSR and GAPDH cDNA fragments were then cloned into pMD18-T simple vector. After ligation,the plasmids containing inserts of the right size being sequenced were used to identify the products by PCR using gene-specific primers (Fig. 3). The sequences of the amplified fragments were aligned by DNAstar software with the corresponding reported sequences according to which the gene-specific primers were designed. The results showed that (1) There was 98.85% sequence identity for the GHSR gene; (2) There was 100% sequence identity for the GAPDH gene. These results indicated that the amplified cDNA fragments of the two genes were gene-specific products.

Real-time PCR was used to quantify GHSR mRNA levels in hypothalamus of Kazak and Xinjiang fine wool sheep at different ages. Results showed that the hypothalamus GHSR mRNAs expression level increased firstly and then declined with growing in both breeds. From day 2 to 60, mRNAs expression level increased continuously in both breeds and showed significantly different (P<0.05) between ages except between day 30 and day 60 in Kazak sheep (P>0.05). After day 60 mRNAs expression level descended rapidly and also showed significantly different (P<0.05) between ages in both breeds. From day 60 to 90, the hypothalamus GHSR expression level of Kazak sheep was extremely lower than that of Xinjiang fine wool sheep (P<0.01) (Fig. 4).

The difference is denoted with letters and means without a common superscript (the capital for the Xinjiang and the small for the HSK) indicate significant differences (P<0.05) between ages; Double-star ** indicates extreme differences (P<0.01) between breeds at the same age.

sensitivity of ARC GHSR expression to modulation by GH suggests that GHS-Rs may be involved in feedback regulation of GH (Bennett et al., 1997). According to research of Shuto et al (2002) ,they creat transgenic (Tg) rats expressing an antisense GHSR mRNA. Tg rats had lower body weight and less adipose tissue than did control rats. The stimulatory effect of GHS treatment on feeding was abolished and daily food intake was reduced in Tg rats. The GHSR gene lies on human chromosome 3q26 within multiple phenotypes linked to a quantitative trait locus strongly related to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Baessler et al. (2005) found that common SNPs and haplotypes within the GHSR gene region were involved in the pathogenesis of human obesity . The above results suggested that GHSR was involved in the monitorship of GH secretion, adiposity, and food intake, so studying the developmental changes of sheep GHSR mRNA expression was useful to explore sheep growth and development and the regulatory mechanisms.

The present research showed that the hypothalamus GHSR mRNAs expression level in both breeds increased firstly and then declined with growing, and that in Kazak sheep was extremely lower than that of Xinjiang fine wool sheep from day 60 to 90. From day 2 to 90, the pituitary GHSR expression level of Kazak sheep was extremely higher than that of Xinjiang fine wool sheep, which was similar to the difference of body weight between the two sheep breeds in the early growth period. The mRNAs expression level of pituitary GHSR increased with growing in both breeds, and was highly positively correlated with the cumulative growth curves, which predicated that GHSR played some role in sheep growing.

A endogenous ligand of GHSR, ghrelin, was get in rat stomach tissue (Kojima et al., 1999). Ghrelin was able to stimulate the release of growth hormone (GH) after binding to GHSR. Moreover, it was soon established that ghrelin had function in weight regulation as its administration increased food intake and caused fat and weight gain in rodents. HUANG Zhi Guo et al. (2006) studied the hypothalamus and pituitary distribution and developmental changes of ghrelin mRNA expression in sheep and found ghrelin mRNA mostly existed in abomasum and was increased steadily in the early growth period. The present research found sheep pituitary GHSR mRNAs expression level was was highly positively correlated with abomasum ghrelin mRNAs expression level (the data about ghrelin mRNAs expression level see in HUANG Zhi Guo et al., 2006).The results predicated that it may be pituitary GHSR but not hypothalamus GHSR through which ghrelin influenced sheep growing.
