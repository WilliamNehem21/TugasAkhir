The ternary system boron carbide nitride (B-C-N) nanotubes have attracted extraordinary attention in past ten years in virtue of potentially interesting properties. The tubes synthesized by CVD experiment were found to be of semiconductor conductivity[1]. Photoluminescence studies revealed that aligned B-C-N nanotubes were also semiconductors exhibiting a band gap of 1.0eV[2]. Additionally, BC2N nanotubes might act as blue and violet light emitting materials such as an efficient field emitter[3â€“4].

As shown in figure 1, the (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes have serrated tubular structures as the pristine (2,2) carbon nanotube(CNT)[8]. It was found that there were two different kinds of chemical bond, which were the perpendicular (circumferential) bond lengths L1(the subscript 1 denotes the bond being perpendicular to the tube axis) and the oblique(axial) bond L2(the subscript 2 denotes the bond being oblique with respect to the tube axis), respectively. For most of (2,2) B-C-N models, L1were larger than that of the pristine (2,2) CNT where L1=0.1373 nm but L2 were smaller than that of the (2,2) CNT where L2=0.1512 nm[8].

The cross sections of (2,2) B-C-N tubes were distorted. Tube larger diameter (DL) or smaller diameter (DS) of tube models denoted the largest or shortest distance of two atoms in a same cross section. The slightly distorted models were with the values of DL/DS being 1.070 for the models BC6N(II) but larger values of DL/DS being 1.212 for the models B4C2N2(II).

in which, Ed, Ed,BxCyNz-NT and ECNT denoted the energies of the unit cell model of the respective the (2,2) B- C-N nanotube and the pristine CNT; EC atom, EN atom and EC atom denoted the energies of the single atom B, N and C; natom(i.e., natom =x+y+z =8 for (2,2) tube) was the number of the total atoms in a unit model. The doping energies Ed for the (2,2) B-C-N nanotube models obtained by Eq.(1) were detailed in Table 2.

It was obvious that the model (I) where the C atom ratio being 3/4 (i.e., BC6N(I) and BC6N(II)) were the more stable conformation due to the lower doping energies Ed. For the same atom ratio models, Ed of (I) was lower than (II) and (III), representing that the model (I) was the most stable conformation.

The default k point of wave vector was adopted in this work.  point was the centre of the first Brillouin zone and  point to X point was a half of Brillouin zone. It was found the models of B2C4N2(I), B4C2N2, B3C2N3(I) and B3C2N3 (III) have direct band gaps where the maximum of valence bands (occupied bands described by solids curves) and the minimum of conduction bands (unoccupied bands described by dashed curves) being in a same k point. For the rest models, the band gaps show indirect gaps where the maximum of valence band and the minimum of conduction band being in different k point. The maximum of direct band gaps for the most of models were at X point besides of the models of B2C4N2 and C2B3N3(II).

The solid curves are for the four highest occupied bands and the dashed ones are for the four lowest unoccupied bands. The location indicated by an arrow is the minimum of the LUCO or the maximum of the HOCO band.

We have found (2,2) carbon nanotube[8] showing semiconductor whereas BN-NTs[10] being isolator. It was interesting that the energy gap values of (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes were within 0.062 to 3.874 eV showing metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity. However, the band structure values or types depending on both the atom ratios and the types of atom arrangement. It was found the B4C2N2 showed the strongest metallic with the structure having two adjacent B atoms. The models [BC6N(I), B2C4N2(I) and B3C2N3(I)] containing the alternant straight -C-C-C-C and -B-N-B-N- strain were typical semiconductor conductivity whereas BC6N(II), B2C4N2(II) and B3C2N3 (II) had larger gap.

The ultra long model of single walled armchair (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes with different ratios of B, C and N atoms were studied with density functional theory of B3LYP/3-21G*. The (2,2) B-C-N nanotubes have serrated tubular structures. The band gaps of tubes were within 0.062 to 3.874 eV showing metal, semiconductor or insulator conductivity, which depend on both the atom ratios and the types of atoms arrangement.
