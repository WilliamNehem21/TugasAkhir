The DEA method takes an economic system or a production process as an activity. It puts a certain number of factors of production and the output of the "product" as entities (units). Each entity (unit) is known as a decision-making unit (DMU). Many DMUs constitute to be respective evaluation groups. The DMU's input or output indicators and ratio for the variable should been evaluated operation. It determine the effective production frontier, and according to the distance of each DMU efficient production frontier situation [10]. It also determines whether each DMU effective projection method can also be used at the same time and pointed out the direction. In this method, the extension of non-DEA effective or weak DEA effective DMU and should be improved. [11]
