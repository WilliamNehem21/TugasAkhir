Duck Virus Enteritis(DVE), also called Duck Plague(DP), is a serious, contagious viral disease, and highly lethal in all ages of Anseriformes. The mortality and reduction in egg production in commercial caused significant economic losses[1-2]. Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, but it has not been divided into any genus according to the Eighth International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [3]. Previous researches focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, the structure and morphogenesis of DEV[4-7],but now, more about the DEV gene expression, protein purification, protein function, detective studies have reported with molecular biology technology[8-10].

Different herpesvirus have similar structure. The herpes simplex virion has four components: core, capsid, tegument and the envelope. The tegument which links the capsid and the envelope, composed of a multitude of about 20 proteins, including VP1/2 (UL36), VP11/12(UL46), VP13/14 (UL47), VP16 (UL48), VP22 (UL49), ICP0, ICP4, US2, US3, US10, US11, UL11, UL13, UL14, UL16, UL17, UL21, UL37, UL41, UL51 and UL56[11].

The HSV-1 UL21 gene product, a capsid-associated tegument protein, promotes the outgrowth of long cellular processes when it is over-expressed in non-neural cells. It is presumed that UL21 protein physically associates with microtubules[13]. The early reports showed that both HSV and PRV UL21 gene products are not essential for viral replication in cultured cells and its deletion resulted in only marginally reduced titers but clearly decreased plaque sizes[14-15]. The PrV UL21 gene is a major determinant of PrV virulence, and its point mutations affecting the UL21 gene of live vaccine strain Bartha contribute to its attenuated phenotype[16]. In addition, PRV UL21 mutants which lacks UL21 gene has apparently reduced virulence for mice[17-18]. In short, the PRV UL21 protein associates with virulence. But as far, studies about DEV UL21 gene product are limited.

The DEV CHv strain genome was identified and sequenced in our laboratory. In this paper, the product encoded by DEV-UL21 gene, which is presumed as a capsid-associated tegument protein, is analyzed by means of bioinformatics methods. These works may provide some information for further studies on DEV UL21gene.

The DEV CHv strain, which is a highly virulent field strain, was obtained from the Key Laboratory of Animal Disease and Human Health of Sichuan Province. The DEV UL21 gene (GenBank Accession No. EU 195090) corresponding amino acid is deduced on line http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/data/jobs/transeq.

Amino acid sequence comparison between the putative proteins encoded by DEV UL21 and other DEV strains( DEV UL21-like strain and DEV VAC strain) were aligned with the DNAStar 7.1 software in order to investigate differences in different DEV strains. Meanwhile, multiple sequences alignment of UL21 protein sequence of DEV, GaHV-2, GaHV-3, MeHV-1, HSV-1, EHV-1 and SuHV-1 were performed to validate the conservatism of herpesvirion UL21 product.

A phylogenetic tree was performed according to the amino acid sequences of the UL21 product in DEV and 25 Reference herpesviruses by using the MegAlign of DNAStar 7.1. The 25 reference herpesviruses UL21 protein sequences were employed from the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database (shown in Table 2).

The open reading frame (ORF) of the DEV UL21 gene is expected to encode a protein with formula being C2723H4313N765O841S24 containing 561 amino acids with a molecular mass of 61993.2 and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.49. The total number of negatively charged residues (Asp + Glu) is 70, and the positively charged residues (Arg + Lys) is 57. The instability index (II) is computed to be 36.98, indicating that this classifies the protein as stable.

500 (shown in Fig.1b); NetNGlyc1.0 analysis shows DEV UL21 protein contains 3 potential N-linked glycosylation sites at aa residues 2, 172, 522 when the threshold of prediction score is above 0.5 (shown in Fig.1c); Epitope analysis by Bepipred 1.0 server shows that DEV UL21 protein epitope was centred in aa residue 36-49, 100-121, 178-183, 217-224, 244-263, 273-281, 303-310, 338-346, 405-416, 452-462 and 475-

480; the futhur analysis by using Protean program of DNAStar 7.1 (showed in Fig.1d); the analysis of the UL21 protein subcellular localization indicates that it locates in cytoplasmic with 65.2%, nuclear with 17.4 % , mitochondrial with 8.7%, vacuolar with 4.3% and vesicles of secretory system with 4.3%.

The prediction for DEV UL21 protein secondary structure is shown in Fig.2 and Fig3, the results suggest that of DEV UL21 protein consists of 44.56% Alpha helix (h), 13.55% extended strand (e) and 41.89% random coil (c) respectively. The Alpha helix of DEV UL21 protein is mainly located at aa 65-77, 119-143, 184-214, 341-353, 371-380, 422-451, 458-509, 521-534 and 544-556, Extended strand is mainly at aa 2-9, 14-

A phylogenetic tree wsa established based on UL21 protein sequence of DEV and those of 25 reference herpesviruses (display in Fig.6). The result shows there are 4 mainly branches: Varicellovirus, Mardivirus and DEV in a large branches; Simplexvirus, and Iltovirus in a same branches; Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae in other two branches respectively. The DEV are with MeHV-1, GaHV-2 and GaHV-3 in a monophyletic clade. Protein sequence comparison(showed in Fig.7) by Clustal multiple revealed that DEV UL21 protein shares 26.4%, 27.3%, 26.2% similarity with GaHV-2, GaHV-3 , MeHV-1 and 33.0%,

Previous reports about UL21 protein are mainly focused on the PRV and HSV-1.The UL21 protein is a tegument protein, and weakly associated with the capsid [13]. The deletion mutants which lacked the whole or partly UL21 gene sequences, were proved that UL21 protein is dispensable for growth both in cultured cells or in vivo[14-15,19]. There is a complex interaction between the UL16 and UL21 tegument proteins in PRV and HSV-1[15,20-23]. In addition, the PRV UL21 gene product associates with virulence, and package pUL46, pUL49, and pUS3 efficiently[24]; the HSV-1 UL21 gene product associates with microtubules, indicating that the UL21 protein may have function of transport. All above revealed UL21 product of HSV and PRV is a regulateing protein. The UL21gene is conserved among herpes virions[25], and we presumed the product of DEV UL21 gene may have similar function.

There are few reports about UL21 protein of DEV, so we study the DEV UL21 protein predicted information base on bioinformatics software and online tools. DEV UL21 protein doesnâ€™t contain the signal peptide and the transembrance region, suggesting the protein is not secreted protein or membrane glycoprotein. Protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine(Ser/Thr/Tyr) is generally considered the major regulatory posttranslational modification functional in prokaryotes[26]. There are 27 potential phosphorylation sites were found in DEV UL21 protein, which may associates wich regulateing function ,and the apparent molecular mass may be more than predicted value 61993.2. The analysis of the UL21 protein subcellular localization indicates that the UL21 gene product of DEV could both local in cytoplasmic and nuclear, which is similar with PRV and HSV-1 protein[13-14,17].

The secondary structure is related with protein function. The alpha helix of the protein have higher chemical bonding energy, can firmly maintain proteinic higher structure. The alpha helix of the protein plays a important role in DNA binding motifs, but it seldom become B cell epitopes because it is difficult to gomphosis antibody better, and usually locates at protein interior. Extended strand and random coil are more noncohesive flexibility structures and always include B cell dominant epitopes, because they are more loosen texture, which are easy to generate retortion and stretch out of the proteinic surface and gomphosis antibody[27-29]. DEV UL21 protein consists of 44.56% Alpha helix (h), 13.55% extended strand (e) and 41.89% random coil (c) respectively, indicating more extended strand and random coil structure may contain certain B cell epitopes. Previous results suggest that herpes simplex tegument proteins are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines[30], about 20 main antigenic determinants in epitope analysis further suggests that UL21 protein is possible candidate compounds for DEV vaccines to the prevention and diagnosis of the duck virus enteritis.

Amino acid sequence comparison among different DEV strain shows that there may be light difference of UL21 protein among different DEV strains. We presumed the difference of identical gene may cause virulence diversity. The result of multiple sequences alignment of UL21 protein sequence of DEV, GaHV-2, GaHV-3, MeHV-1, HSV-1, EHV-1 and SuHV-1 supports that UL21 gene is conserved among Alphaherpesvirinae at least.

From Fig.6, the established phylogenetic tree based on DEV CHv UL21 protein with its 25 reference herpesviruses and cluster analysis results show DEV has a close evolutionary relationship with GaHV-2, GaHV-3, MeHV-1, which belong to Mardivirus, but protein sequence comparison showed in Fig.7 revealed similarity between DEV UL21 protein and Varicellovirus (including EHV-1, EHV-4, EHV-9 and FeHV-1) is higher than those between Mardivirus. It has reported DEV dUTPase gene product, gI, UL15, UL27, UL35 and UL55 proteins also have a close relationship with Mardivirus[10,31-35], we presumed DEV may be one
