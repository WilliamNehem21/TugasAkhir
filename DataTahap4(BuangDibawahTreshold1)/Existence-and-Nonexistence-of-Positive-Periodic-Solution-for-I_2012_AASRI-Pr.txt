In this paper, impulsive Nicholson's blowflies model is studied. By using Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem , we obtain some sufficient conditions for the existence of positive periodic solution. In addition, the nonexistence of positive periodic solution is also investigated. Our results extend and improve the previous literatures.

As we know, population dynamics have received great attention from many authors. In the natural ecological systems, there exist a lot of discontinuous, impulsive phenomena, for instance, people release or harvest a species at fixed time, many species are given birth instantaneously and seasonally, and so on. Introducing the impulsive effect to ecology model can describe the species and the ecological systems more truly and reasonablly. Impulsive differential equation has become a hot and important study topic[1-3,5,11- 14].

In [7][8],the oscillation and global attractivity of Nicholson's blowflies model were studied. The purpose of this paper is to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of positive periodic solutions of system (1.1) by using Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem. Furthermore, we also investigate the nonexistence of positive periodic solutions of system (1.1).

Lemma 1 .[4] (Leray-Schauder)  Let  be a closed convex subset of Banach space X , 0  , Let T    be a completely continuous operator.Then , either the set {x   x  λTx 0  λ  1} is unbounded or the operator T has at least one fixed point in  .

implies || x || Q So {x   x  λTx 0  λ  1} is bounded. By lemma 1 ,we know operator T has at least one fixed point in  ,which implies equation (1.1) has at least one positive ω -periodic solution. The proof of Theorem 1 is complete.
