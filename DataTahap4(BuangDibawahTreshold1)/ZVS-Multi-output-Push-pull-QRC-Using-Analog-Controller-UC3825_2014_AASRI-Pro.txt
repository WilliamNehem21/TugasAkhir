The analysis, design and implementation of a zero voltage switched multi output push-pull topology is presented in this paper. To double the secondary output a voltage doubler circuit is introduced in each secondary winding of the multi output transformer. The voltage doubler introduced also helps in obtaining ZVS in the passive switches at the secondary of the transformer. To further add on the advantage of increased power packing density UC3825 an analog controller is deployed in the hardware prototype to regulate the output voltage against supply and load disturbances

Specifications of the converter are : Switching frequency (fs) :- 50 kHz, Output power (P0) :- 3.5 W, Input voltage (Vs) :- 15±15%, Output voltage 1 (V01) : - 5 V, Output current 1 (I01) :- 0.5 A, Output voltage 2 (V02) :- 3.3 V, Output current 2 (I02) :-0.33 A.

Stability of the system can be improved using a PWM controller along with type 3-error amplifier. The PWM controller IC UC 3825 is selected, for obtaining complementary outputs of same frequency and duty cycle. By adding compensation to the error amplifier, stability can be achieved for the converter. The phase margins of 450 to 600 are considered secure value for a stable system. An error amplifier value is designed in such a way that total gain cross over frequency crosses at -1 slope at a preferred value. Hence type 3 error amplifiers are selected, which consist of 3 pole and 2 zeros, including one pole at origin. Desired duty cycle and frequency can be obtained by selecting proper resistance (Rt) and capacitor(Ct). The Rt and Ct values are calculated as given below.

The output voltages corresponding to variation in supply voltage are shown in Fig 4(a). Change in output voltages from 5V to 4.95V and 3.6V to 3.4V are observed for a supply voltage decrease from 15V to 13V in fig.4 (a). For increase in supply voltage from 15V to 17V, it is observed that the voltage1 settles at 5.05V from 5V and correspondingly voltage2 settles at 4V from 3.6V respectively.

Closed loop implementation response of the proposed multi-output push-pull converter for load transients are presented and discussed in this section. Figure 4(b) shows both the output voltage waveforms for decrease in load resistor2 from 10Ω to 7Ω. For load resistor1 variations also similar waveforms were noted as shown in fig 4(c). By decreasing the load1 from 10Ω to 7Ω, the variations in load voltage1 observed was very small and are also within the specifications considered (i.e) a regulated output voltage is obtained. The output voltages were observed to vary when the load resistance was decreased/increases in the case of open loop implementation, but for closed loop, the outputs are almost constant for load variation as shown in figure 4(b) and (c). From the results it is observed that the output 1 is regulated for all the load changes applied because of the feedback loop provided through the analog controller IC UC3825. A slight variation in second output voltages is observed for its own load changes. Figure 4(d) depicts the hardware prototype developed.

Design, simulation, analysis and closed loop implementation of a 3.5W primary ZVS multi output pushpull converter for high frequency application with secondary voltage doubler is discussed in this this paper. The following are the list of selection parameters along with their advantages listed: High frequency operation - Reduction in the size of magnetic components used like inductors, transformers and capacitors leading to compactness, Multiple secondary winding – Isolated multi output of different rating, Analog controller UC3825 – Regulated output for load and line variations, Voltage doubler circuit – Doubles the secondary voltages, ZVS in primary circuit – Reduces the switching losses in the primary switches, ZCS in secondary circuit – Reduces oscillation and voltage spike in diodes, which reduces the stress across the diodes.
