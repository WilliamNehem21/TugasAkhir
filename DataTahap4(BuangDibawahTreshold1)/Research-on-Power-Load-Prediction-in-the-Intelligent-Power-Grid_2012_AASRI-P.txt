Along with China's construction of high voltage grid and the deepening of the reform in the power system, intelligent power grid will become a strategic direction for China's power grid development. In the intelligent power grid system, the power load has new change features due to the energy using change and the impact of the difference in price. This paper comparing the gray model, the trend fitting model and MV method, MV method is more accurate in forecasting than other methods, and can help to improve the power load forecasting management level in intelligent power grid construction.

Power load forecasting is to make the demand prediction for electricity in the future based on the known requirement, considering the political, economic, climate, energy alternative factors, etc. The power system load forecasting is more complicated due to changes in energy used in the intelligent power grid environment. Therefore it needs to choose a better precision prediction method to complete the work.

Then, the trend fitting was performed based on the trend of the cave in Fig.1 and the statistics from 1995 to 2007. A quadratic function was used to perform the fitting test based on the result that was got through many modal of fitting and the principle that the closer the R2 to 1, the better the result is. The result of prediction through trend fitting was shown as follow:

The range of R2 was from 0 to 1, it represented the fitting degree between prediction and reality. When R2 was very close to or equal to 1, its reliability was high, and it was called the coefficient of determination. In this case, R2=0.990, which meant that the fitting degree was good. Finally, the prediction of data from 2008 to 2010 was given in Table 1.
