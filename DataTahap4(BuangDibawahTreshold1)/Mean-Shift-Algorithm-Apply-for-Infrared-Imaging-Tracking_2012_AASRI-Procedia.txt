An improved algorithm based on the modified histogram & mean shift is proposed in order to deal with difficulties in tracking small target of infrared imaging under complex background. The new algorithm is based on a lower dimension combining characteristic weighted histogram, the analogical degree measurement is determined by the Bhattacharyya coefficient, and the target is located through the mean shift. In order to improve the precision and robustness of the modified mean shift algorithm, particle filtering is used to obtain the optimal position estimate. Test results show that, the tracking point fluctuation could be reduced to no more than 2 pixels with the modified algorithm, for the test case.

Small infrared target tracking under complex background is the key technology of precision-guided and early warning system. Compared with visible images, infrared images generally have the problems of low Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) and poor imaging contrast. The poor visibility of small target, the negative impact of illumination and Image noise, and the lack of homogeneity of the brightness in background area, would make tracking become more difficult. Mean Shift algorithm, which utilizes probability density function of pixels within the target region as the feature and transforms tracking to an optimization problem of a similarity function [1], is widely used in target tracking because of the characteristics of simple, robust, and real-time performance. However, because of the disability of characteristic information extraction from small target by using weighted histogram, the algorithm is not so desirable for tracking small
