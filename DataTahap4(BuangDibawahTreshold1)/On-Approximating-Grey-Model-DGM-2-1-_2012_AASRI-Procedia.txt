The grey system theory which founded by professor J.L. Deng is a kind of theory which analyze the system on uncertainty in less data, incomplete information and devoid of experience[1]. As the elementary model, GM(1,1) model has applied extensively in the past twenty seven years, and obtain some satisfactory effect. But in the process of application, many scholars also discover the defects of GM(1,1) model. In order to make up the defect of GM(1,1) model, let grey model has more extensive application., scholars have done a lot of jobs. These jobs can be divided into two sorts generally, one sort is to optimize GM(1,1) model straightly by changing background value, grey derivative, the accumulation method of parameters, the optimized GM(1,1) model can be applied extensive[4,5,6,7]. Another sort is to construct some new grey models, such as GM(2,1)
