The root bark of tree peonies has been used as medicine for more than 2000 years in China. It has been included in over 1000 Chinese prescriptions as one of the main raw materials. The effective chemical components have been used extensively in cosmetics and healthy food. There is a growing demand for high quality root bark of tree peonies in the market [1-4].

Medicinal tree peony cultivars have been described in detail by Li (1999) [2] and Xiao and Yang (2001) [1] in morphology, biogeography, cultivation and utilization. Shen (2001) revised a documentation of medicinal plants in P. sect. Moutan [10]. Isoenzyme analysis indicated that there exist genetic differentiations between P. ostii (Tongling Peony) and P. ‘Taiping Hong’ (Dianjiang Peony) [11].

The Chinese medicinal tree peony cultivars which were bred through long-term artificial selections are planted on large scale in the production areas. In China, there are four important areas (Anhui, Hunan and Shandong provinces, and Chongqing manicipality) producing tree peony root bark. There are particular medicinal cultivars of tree peonies in each production area.

As a matter of fact, there exist morphological differences among the medicinal cultivars although the products have the same commercial name of “Danpi” (i.e., root bark of tree peony in Chinese) in the market [2]. However, no comparative study has been reported on the medicinal cultivars at DNA level. Meanwhile, affected by the traditional modes of thought that the root bark of wild tree peonies has a better medicinal efficacy, digging for root bark by local people is severely destroying the wild resources of tree peonies [1-4].

As shown in Table 1 and Map 1, samples 1, 3, 4 were collected in Yutian Tree Peony Nursery, Heze, Shandong Province where they were introduced from the production areas (Enshi and Jianshi) of Hubei Province, China (Map 1). Sample 2 was collected in Chongqing Institute of Medicinal Plants Cultivation, Nanchuan, Chongqing, China. Sample 5 was collected in General Station for Extension of Forestry Science and Technology, Gansu Forestry Department, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, it was originally introduced from Tongling, Anhhui Province, China. Sample 6 was collected at Shaoyang, Hunan Province, China. Sample 7 was collected in Peace Tree Peony Garden, Lanzhou, Gensu Province, China.

ATGGGAAAGCGAGAGGAAGAA—3’) were newly designed as sequencing primers to overcome the poly (T)13-17 structure located in the mid-part (ranging from positions 254 to 272) of the trnT-trnF region. The trnS- trnG intergenic spacer region was amplified using primers trnS and trnG reported by Zhao et al. (2008) [7] and Zhang et al. (2009) [16]. The atpH-atpI intergenic spacer region was amplified using newly designed primers atpH-atpI-83F (5’—GGCTGTCTCGCAATACCTTCTA—3’) and atpH-atpI-1340R (5’— CGTGGCTCAAGATAATCTACTTAGG—3’). The accD-psaI intergenic spacer region was amplified using newly designed primers accD-psaI-21F (5’—AACATTGAATAAGACAGTACCTGAG—3’) and accD-psaI- 747R (5’—GTAAGTTAAGAGTTGTCATAGGATGG—3’). The psbE-petL intergenic spacer region was amplified using newly designed primers psbE-petL-356F (5’—CCTTCTTCTGACACAGCAATG—3’) and psbE-petL-1219R (5’—TTACCATTATAGACAGCACTAACAA—3’).

Nucleotide sequences were edited and manually corrected by eye using Sequencher (v. 4.6). Alignment was conducted using Clustalx [17]. The poly (T)13-17 structure was deleted from the mid-part (ranging from positions 254 to 272) of the trnT-trnF region before computation. The final dataset included 35 sequences from five cpDNA regions of the seven accessions in an alignment of 3343bp. Neighbor-joining tree was created with PAUP 4.0b10 [18] using nucleotide evolutionary model of Jukes-Cantor model.

The maternal inheritance of the five cpDNA regions was confirmed by sequencing of the four artificial crosses of tree peonies. Three or more individual plants were sampled and sequenced per cultivar/species, and identical results were obtained among individual plants within each cultivar/species. Therefore, one sample of each cultivar/species was included in the dataset for formal computation.

In total, seven parsimony-informative characters were obtained in the cpDNA sequence alignment of the six medicinal cultivars. In the Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree (Fig. 2), four lineages were recognized among the Chinese medicinal tree peony cultivars with high bootstrap support values (82%).

P. ‘Xiang Dan’, P. ostii and P. ‘Hu Lan’ belong to three different lineages (lineage I, II and III), respectively. P. ‘Jinpao Hong’, ‘Jianhi Fen’ and ‘Taiping Hong’, with sympatric distribution in Hubei Province and Chongqing municipality, together formed a single lineage (IV). The largest differentiation occurred between lineage II (P. ostii) and lineage IV. In general, lineages I and II are quite diverged from the other medicinal lineages (Table 2 and Fig. 2).

Petal purplish red and suffused with slight blue, with a red blotch at the base of the upper surface of the petal and a white streak on the lower surface of the petal. Disc deep purplish red, stigma purplish red. Filament purple. Single flower form.	P. ‘Xiang Dan’

Note: The nucleotide molecular formula, e.g., chloroplast psbE-petL_728bp_T3T249C301G416G712, was used to indicate the lineage of Chinese medicinal tree peony cultivars, where “chloroplast psbE-petL_region” refers to the name of the chloroplast psbE-petL intergenic spacer region used, “aln_728bp” refers to the length of the sequence alignment (728 base pairs), “T3T249C301G416G712” refers to the nucleotide molecular formula containing five SNP sites extracted from the aligned sequence of the cpDNA region, the figure following the nucleotide character (T, C, G or A) indicates the position of the corresponding SNP site from the 5’ end of the sequence alignment. The nucleotide molecular formulas are used to first divide the six medicinal tree peony cultivars into four lineages, and then morphological characters are used within the lineages to make classification to cultivars.

Bozhou and Tongling of Anhui Province have the highest production of “Danpi” of China by the cultivated P. ostii (about 1.5 x 106 kg per year). Because of the damp and hot tolerance as well as resistance to disease and insect pest, P. ostii has been playing an important role as parental plants in breeding of Chinese ornamental cultivars of tree peonies [2-4, 19].
