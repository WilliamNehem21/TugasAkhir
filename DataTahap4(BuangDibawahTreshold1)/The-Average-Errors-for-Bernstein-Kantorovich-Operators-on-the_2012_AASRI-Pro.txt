Many mathematicians have investigated the approximation behavior of Bernstein-Kantorovich operators on Lp [0,1],1  p   . Recently Xu Guiqiao [3] studied the simultaneous approximation average errors for Bernstein operators on the r-fold integrated Wiener space. Motivated by [3], we consider the average errors of function weighted approximation by the Bernstein-Kantorovich operators on the r-fold integrated Wiener space. We obtain the following:
