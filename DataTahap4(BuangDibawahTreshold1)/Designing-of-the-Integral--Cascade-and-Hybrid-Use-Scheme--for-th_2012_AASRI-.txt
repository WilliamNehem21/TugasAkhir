huge economical loses. Among different processes of the cascade, will be released CO2 and H2S, which will be used for food products (conservation) and medical purposes. The hybrid system, combing of the middle enthalpy geothermal waters, with the solar panels, based on the fact that the Albanian climate allow such a thing (there are more than 280 sunny days on the area), will improve the economic efficiency of the project.

It was thought by the group of authors, that the best and more efficient way to use the geothermal waters of Kozani-8 well is the constructions of a multicenter. The center will include the SPA, massage and fitness center, open and closed pools (with different sizes and temperatures), greenhouse, aquaculture cultivation pools, conference rooms etc. The center will be heated through the geothermal direct use (through the installation of the heat exchangers) Ingersoll et al., 1950, while for the cooling will be installed a geothermal heat pump, Harlow & Klapper, 1952. The roof will be covered will solar panels, whose will provide the
