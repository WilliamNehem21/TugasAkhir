zhao et al.[16,22] developed the local binary pattern on three orthogonal planes(lbp-top). delightedly, lbp-top had been applied for dynamic texture description and recognition successfully and had obtained good results on facial expression analysis. the proposed algorithm extracted the lbp the other hand, the spatial temporal co-occurrence information were encoded in xt and yt planes. shao et al. proposed to extend the computation of lbp and computed histogramming lbp named extended lbp-top and extended cslbptop, respectively. the presented methods could extract more dynamic information inside the spatio-temporal cuboids and be applied on the gradient cuboids.



the rest of the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we introduce the reason for using sub-actions and illustrate the framework of our approach. section 3 and section 4 describe the segmentation and classification approach respectively. in section 5, we conduct experiments on ut-interaction and rochester datasets and compare our approach with other bows based approaches. finally, conclusions are drawn in section 6.



to segment actions efficiently, we should achieve two goals. first, ensure the sub-actions in the same sub-section of the same action class are of the same type, ignoring the speed differences between actors. second, all sub-actions should capture enough motion information for classification. the two-stage segmentation can reach the above goals nicely, which is detailed below.



here we use point density to chop clips for further segmentation instead of using number of frames to ensure there is enough motion information in all clips. generally, dense feature points infer strenuous action. the intensity of the action may be changed over the entire action process. some of the action primitives maybe moderate, so there could be few interesting points in these frames and result in insufficient information. moreover, it also balances the speed difference between different actors or actions. we compute a histogram of spatial-temporal word occurrence for each video clip, the kth clip is described as:(shake hands), the shaking parts of the action are more salient. but to the fourth column(point), the whole process is quite different from other actions, so its salience is evenly distributed. although the environment of the two scenes is different, their salience maps are quite similar. the salience ranges from 0 to 1, and the average difference between them is 0.1777. except the red grid on the right top of(c) caused by overact in scene-2, most difference is less than 0.2. this means our segmentation and salience calculation approach is robust to the inner-class variation and environmental change.



datasets, the cuboid size is w= h= 1 pixels, t= 2 frames, and descriptors can also be used to acquire features. for both using 3d-sift, w= h= 2 pixels, t= 3 frames, the threshold threshold is 0.0002 when using gradient descriptor. when is 0.0001. after extracting features from videos, k-means



descriptor shows better results on ut-interaction scene-2 and rochester than 3d-sift because it extracts more feature points to describe the sub-actions more sufficiently. on utinteraction scene-1, our result is comparable to[11,17]; but manifest a faster computational speed. noting that focuses on the spatial structure between visual words, hence it can be combined with our approach. approach in aims at action prediction, and it conducts a iterate segment matching between classes and is inefficient to action classification. on both ut-interaction scene-2 and rochester datasets, our approach shows the best performance.
