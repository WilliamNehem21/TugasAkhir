notation. the paper resorts to standard mathematical notation typically used in model-oriented specification methods, like vdm, z or b. we adopt, however, a pointfree specification style(as in, e.g.,) which leads to more concise descriptions and increased calculation power. the underlying mathematical universe is the category of sets and set-theoretic functions whose composition and



central to our approach is the presence of a particular coordination connector, called the orchestrator, whose role is to manage the interactions among all other elements in the architectural network. in a sense, the orchestrator corresponds to an intermediary layer between components and ordinary connectors, i.e., it acts as a bridge among components and connectors.
