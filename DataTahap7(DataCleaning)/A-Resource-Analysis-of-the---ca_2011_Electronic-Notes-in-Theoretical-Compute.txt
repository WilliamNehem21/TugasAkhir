allocation is always permitted, but is not possible if the channel is already allocated. allocated channels are initially private. sending a channel publicizes it, but the communication is only possible if performed over an already public channel, and only permitted over an allocated channel. a locally-unknown channel received from the environment is known to the environment, and hence public; a locally-known channel received from the environment cannot possibly have been private.
