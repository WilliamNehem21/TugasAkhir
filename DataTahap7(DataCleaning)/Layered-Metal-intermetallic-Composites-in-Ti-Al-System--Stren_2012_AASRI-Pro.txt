metal intermetallic laminated (mil) composites are fabricated upon reaction sintering of titanium and aluminum foils of various thicknesses. the intermetallic phase of al3ti forming during the above processing gives high hardness and stiffness to the composite, while unreacted titanium provides the necessary high strength and ductility. some results of studies of microstructure and some mechanical properties of layered composites are presented on the example of ti-al system. static and dynamic tests results are discussed for the case when the intermetallic reaction was interrupted in the course of intermetallic sintering and also for the case when it was completed.



electron microscopic studies were performed at the electron microscopy center of collaborative access, ural branch, russian academy of sciences. measurement of the mechanical properties were performed at the center of collaborative access "testing center of advanced materials and nanotechnology", ural branch, russian academy of sciences. measurement of the impact toughness were performed at the center of collaborative access "plastometriya", institute of engineering science, ural branch, russian academy of sciences.
