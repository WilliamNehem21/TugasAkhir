another method, found in literature, is to use raw data directly and apply ml algorithms to identify gestures. this method has been discussed in using the deep learning technique on more than 30000 features and in using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm(knn), decision trees, and support vector machines(svm). the advantage of using raw data is that it is faster than the conventional algorithms used for image detection and with large enough data the efficiency could be improved greatly. however, not all features extracted from the sensor are useful and it is hard to go through each feature and find those that give the best results. in this regard, using feature selection techniques can narrow down the data set to the specific features which give the best results.



over the last few decades, metaheuristic algorithms have emerged as promising approaches for addressing complex optimization problems. these algorithms provide effective solutions by leveraging intelligent search strategies and adaptive techniques, enabling them to navigate intricate search spaces and tackle non-linear objective functions. their widespread application has shown great potential in solving diverse real-world problems and advancing optimization methodologies.



metaheuristic algorithm for dimensionality reduction. then the results are compared with conventional algorithms and it is empirically shown that the selected algorithm performs better than its conventional counterparts. the reduced dataset is then passed through a deep neural network(dnn)which is further trained by employing the same hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for the gesture classification purpose. at this stage, neural networks are trained for both reduced and complete

metaheuristics have been the center for research in computing and optimization problems for the past few decades. gwo, abc, pso, and woa are among some of the most widely used nature-inspired algorithms for solving complex real-world problems. pso is a populationbased algorithm derived from the collective movement of a flock of birds or a school of fish. it employs a swarm of particles to search for the best solution by adjusting their speed and position relative to recall, and f-measure metrics. in, the authors presented a hgr system using lmc and dnn. the system reconstructed the palm model and extracted the feature data from lmc. the system trains the dnn model with the normalized data to achieve good gesture recognition accuracy. for the dataset, 30 features were captured from the lmc mainly focusing on the spatial positioning of the palm and bones. the



about the position and rotational features of hands, fingers, and bones. this data is pre-processed and transformed into a set of features that represent the gesture. using a standard deviation depended algorithm features with less information are removed. data is normalized during the pre-processing phase as this can improve model performance, prevent data biases, and increase its convergence speed.



for this experiment the lmc was mounted on a jig to keep the position static. the data was collected under controlled lighting conditions throughout the experiment as ir sensors are sensitive to light. during the course of the experiment, data was collected with varying distances ranging from 100 mm to 300 mm to add variation in scale. the lmc was integrated with the system using leapsdk v2.0 and python 2.7 on a hp core i3-10th generation intel micro-processor and no gpu. the data set was collected and stored as.csv file. this data was then imported to python 3 and pre-processed using a variance-based method for initial scrutiny of the feature set. after the first pre-processing the data was normalized and passed through the feature selection and classification algorithms.



the scientific community is growing keen on feature selection significantly, the best traits from a preliminary dataset are selected to enhance the quality of features in numerous ml tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and time-series activity prediction[50,51]. dimensionality reduction techniques are a key area of research in data mining and machine learning. they are intended to select the best subset of relevant features from an original dataset using specific evaluation criteria, which results in better learning performance, better model interpretability, lower computational costs, and greater learning accuracy. the objective function is typically defined in terms of the accuracy, efficiency, or other performance measures of a machine learning model that is trained on the selected features.

a three-layer dnn model is employed in this study which consists of an input layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer. the entire dnn is densely connected and the output of each neuron in the hidden layers is calculated using the weighted sum of the inputs from the previous layer, followed by the application of a non-linear activation function. the output of the final layer is the predicted output of the model.



effective training of the weights and biases is essential for achieving optimal performance of the neural network. if the weights and biases are not properly trained, the network may suffer from over-fitting or under-fitting, which can lead to poor performance on unseen data. overfitting happens when a neural network is overly complex and perfectly fits the training data, resulting in poor performance on new data. under-fitting, on the other hand, occurs when the network is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.



metaheuristic algorithms have been used in recent years for the training of weights and biases in neural networks. compared to traditional optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent, metaheuristic algorithms offer several advantages. firstly, they are less sensitive to initialization and are able to escape local optima more easily, allowing them to explore a larger search space. secondly, they can handle non-convex and non-smooth optimization problems, which



results for this paper are recorded for both feature selection and classification algorithms. the feature selection method is compared with conventional metaheuristic algorithms over multiple iterations and different metrics are recorded for each algorithm. section 6.1 discusses the results of feature selection. in addition, the selected features are then passed through a dnn trained with different metaheuristic algorithms, and the results of the dnn classification are discussed in 6.2.



in this research paper, we presented the development and evaluation of a novel technique for feature selection using a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called ssc(spotted hyena-based chimp optimization algorithm). our algorithm aimed to address the challenges of dimensional reduction in gesture recognition using the leap motion controller(lmc) device. through extensive experimentation and comparison with existing algorithms, we have demonstrated the superior performance of ssc across multiple metrics.



the results obtained from our experiments clearly indicate that ssc outperforms other algorithms, namely gwo, pso, and sca in terms of accuracy, precision, f1-score, time to select features, and the number of features. this significant improvement in performance showcases the effectiveness of ssc as a robust solution for dimensional reduction in gesture recognition tasks. the proposed algorithm not only achieved superior results but also exhibited consistency and stability across various datasets.



furthermore, we extended our research by applying the ssc algorithm to train a dnn for gesture classification. the results of our experiments with the dnn trained using ssc surpassed those obtained with other algorithms, achieving an impressive 98.7% accuracy rate. this outstanding performance further reinforces the effectiveness of the ssc algorithm for optimizing the training process of complex machine-learning models.
