multigraphs may be of two types: undirected multigraphs and directed multigraphs. in an undirected multigraph the edge(i, j) and the edge(j, i), if exist, are obviously identical unlike in the case of directed multigraph. for a latest algebraic study on the theory of multigraphs, the work and also[4, 11, 13] may be seen.



for a given node u, if iu and at least one member of iu is non-null at a given time, then the node u is called a communicable node for that instant of time. if u does not have any neighbor node then iu=, and in that case it is trivial that further communication is never possible. however, if iu and all the members of iu are null vectors at a point of time, then it signifies that further communication is not possible temporarily.
