as artificial intelligence(ai) continues to grow and become advanced, more businesses are exploring ways to integrate technologies led by ai into their operations. one such technology that has gained significant traction from businesses around the world is chatbots. chatbots are automated systems that use natural language processing(nlp) algorithms capable of simulating conversations with humans, providing customers with instant support and assistance. chat-generative pre-trained(chatgpt) is a popular chatbot that is a large language model trained by openai with the potential of providing several benefits to businesses. chatgpt is based on a large-scale transformer-based language model called generative pre-trained transformer(gpt), which was first introduced by openai in the year 2018. it was trained on a large corpus of text data to learn the patterns and structures of natural language using unsupervised learning methods. this enabled chatgpt to learn from raw data without any explicit supervision. after the success of gpt, openai created chatgpt, which is particularly meant to replicate human-like user dialogues. chatgpt was trained using a vast dataset of online interactions from social media, forums, and other sources. the training data was carefully selected to ensure that the model learned the intricacies of human language and could generate high-quality responses to a variety of questions.



enhanced customer experience(ece), and greater human-computer collaboration(ghc). however, there seems to be a need for more clarity and detail regarding the methodology used, especially in comparison to related works. the paper proposes the use of psi and copras approaches to prioritize the potential benefits and use cases of chatgpt in business operations. the paper would benefit from providing a more detailed explanation of these approaches. this would help readers understand how these methods work, how they are applied to the context of chatgpt, and how they contribute to the analysis.in this revised manuscript, we have explained the psi and copras, which were chosen as the analytical tools for prioritization. what specific advantages do these approaches offer in evaluating the potential benefits and use cases of chatgpt compared to other methods? highlighting the strengths of these approaches would enhance the rationale behind their selection.



the remainder of the paper presents a detailed literature review and research methodology in section 2 and section 3 respectively. section 4 presents a data analysis and results followed by the discussion and findings in section 5 with the implications of this study. finally, section 6 outlines the conclusions with limitations and the future scope of this study.



developed by zavadskas and kaklauskas in 1996. it was used to determine which alternative was superior to others and made it possible to compare them. when more than one parameter needs to be considered in an evaluation, this method can be used to increase or decrease the number of criteria. the copras method ranks and evaluates choices in descending order according to their importance and utility. the following steps are part of the copras method:



where emax is the relative significance measure with the maximum value. the utility value of an option increases or decreases proportionally to its relative significance value. the more valuable vj is, the higher the priority of the alternative. depending on the utility ratings of the alternatives, a comprehensive ranking of the competing options can be created.



providing quick, informative, and more natural responses(ece1) under the category of enhanced customer experience(ece) is ranked first in the important features of chatgpt that help boost business operations by accentuating customer satisfaction, improving customer retention, and ultimately, increasing revenue. chatgpt may help organizations meet customer demands more efficiently and effectively by offering timely and informed responses to client inquiries or concerns, which can lead to improved levels of customer satisfaction. furthermore, the usage of natural language processing(nlp) technology may assist to make customer interactions feel more customized, which can aid in the development of better connections and increased customer loyalty. customers who feel satisfied and well-cared for are more inclined to do business with a firm again and may even suggest it to others. this can assist to boost client retention and attract new consumers, resulting in greater revenue and profitability for the company. some examples of the aforementioned can be when customers need an instant response related to the day of the delivery of their feel heard and valued by the companies they do business with. by establishing personalized interactions with their customers and providing tailored responses based on preferences, organizations can instill confidence and trust in customers which will lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. this will result in repeat purchases and positive word-of-mouth publicity and referrals thereby boosting business operations. when customers realize that they are being valued and respected they continue to do business with the companies. this leads to increased sales and revenue, as well as a larger customer base. personalized interactions with customers can help businesses to improve their marketing efforts by providing deeper insights into consumer behavior and preferences. by understanding what customers need, companies can design more effective and targeted marketing campaigns leading to better conversion rates and higher returns on investment for



the study emphasizes the potential benefits of incorporating chatgpt, a popular chatbot built on a large-scale transformer-based language model, within companies. these advantages encompass enhanced customer service, multitasking capability for handling client inquiries, and operational cost savings. the study underscores the need for thorough analysis before integrating chatgpt into enterprises. factors such as domain-specific training data and potential errors in outcomes are highlighted as key considerations for successful deployment. the research draws from existing literature on chatgpt, massive language models, and artificial intelligence to identify potential deployment areas. the utilization of psi and copras methodologies to evaluate benefits provides a structured approach for assessment. by elucidating current industry trends and potential advantages, the study



there are several limitations to this study which are mentioned below. the research makes no mention of any possible difficulties that may emerge during the implementation of chatgpt in business processes. for example, problems concerning data protection, technical complexities, or client confidence may present difficulties. the research does not provide a complete cost-benefit analysis of chatgpt implementation. the expense of implementing and maintaining the technology may be significant, and companies must balance the costs against the possible benefits. the study does not look into the possible risks of using chatgpt to automate customer support. for example, if the chatbot is unable to correctly answer customer questions or duplicate a human-like exchange, it may create a negative customer experience.
