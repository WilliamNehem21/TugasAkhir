deformability of red blood cells are the main factors that make blood behave like a newtonian fluid. experimental observations show that blood behaves as a newtonian fluid when the shear rate is high. blood viscosity can be considered very small to be neglected with respect to its nonlinear term. due to these observations, it can be assumed that blood can be treated as incompressible inviscid fluid.
