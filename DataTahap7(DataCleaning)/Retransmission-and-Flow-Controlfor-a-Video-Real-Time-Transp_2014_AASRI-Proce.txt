and flow control could be addressed. retransmission ensures that an entire frame can be appropriately decoded. users do not see the broken image, and do not waste bandwidth. flow control addresses the rate of data transmission that is adjusted dependent on the available network bandwidth. frames per second are reduced by low bandwidth, but an image can still be viewed appropriately, without a black screen or freeze-frame occurring.



a user datagram protocol(udp). udps exhibit packet loss and congestion problems, but the rtp does not include standards of retransmission and flow control. moreover, most rtp applications do not implement a retransmission mechanism; therefore the effect on voice streaming is slight, but that on video streaming is severe.



this paper presents a retransmission and flow control method. retransmission can reduce the effect of packet loss on video streaming by using a small number of retransmission packets. flow control controls the sending rate based on the number of packets lost, so that the sending rate adheres to the available bandwidth. retransmission and flow-control improves the performance of video streaming, and users can clearly appreciate the difference when viewing images.
