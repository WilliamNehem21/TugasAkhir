specification language of the model checker used in our experiments. through a two-step process, lep specifications are translated into the language of a model checker and the result is translated back to lep. a formal communication model is used in the translation process in order to allow the use of different model checkers. currently the prototype of the architecture uses the model checkers spin and smv.



one of the main advantages advocated by the formal methods community is the correctness of the software developed in this way. the general argument is that from a(correct) specification one derives(automatically) correct running code. we will not follow this line of argumentation. instead, we argue that the main advantage of using formal methods is that, in general, they are based on a language or languages with precise semantics and most of the times this semantics is well-suited to the specific domain.



well as strongly related to sat solvers(np complexity class). thus, feasibility of general schemas for compositional validation of systems seems to be as hard as to solve the main conjectures about the classes np, conp and pspace. of course, it seems that, from the intractability of the temporal logics one could conclude that it is probably an unfeasible task, since the class exptime is independent of the main conjectures already mentioned. thus, our architecture aims a better using of mc technique in a broader way, by allowing several tools at the backend, which is of course a feasible task.



lep is a process-based language such as ccs for the specification of mobile protocols and distributed algorithms. it combines the concepts of guarded commands from ccs, overload of names from pi-calculus and pronouns(adapted from oo concerns). pronouns can be seen as a general means of referencing a set of elements, making the specification shorter, more legible and precise. for example, in a ordinary specification language, if we want to send a message to several processes, we have to iterate through the set of elements. using lep, we simply broadcast communication happens through the flooding 4 of messages. if this pronoun is used for receiving a message(everyone?x), it behaves like a synchronization point that will receive the message x from every element of the network. since we may have disconnections, processes that execute this command may wait indefinitely. in order to alleviate it we can use the pronoun any(k) in the receive clause that waits for messages from k hops.



attributes that are used to define pronouns. the grammar defines the topology adopted by a specification and the strings generated by the grammar are instances of the topology in the initial state of the validation. pronouns are initialised through synthesized and inherited attributes, which are calculated during the generation of a network i.e., the application of the production rules of an attribute graph grammar. inserting new attributes into an attribute graph grammar is a way of creating userdefined pronouns.



similarly to the section 2.5, we present here the translation of the communication model to smv. the translation is not so straightforward as the translation to promela, since smv does not have primitives for communication via channels in its basic implementation.



in this section we describe informally the behaviour of the protocol dsr. in addition we describe how we model this protocol, the assumptions and how it was specified in lep. for a not valid property over this model, we show the counter-example returned by spin and how it is converted to another one at the abstract level of lep.



when a node wishes to send a package to another node, it searches for a route to this destiny in its local cache. if this search succeeds, the package is sent to the first node of the route. this is repeated at every node until the package reaches its destination. if the search fails, the sub-protocol for finding routes is activated. in the cases when a routing error occurs, a route error packet is sent and the nodes which receive it update their cache. this is only the basic version of dsr, and many other optimizations have been proposed.



(ii) nodes do not suffer from interference(e.g. a host receives two distinct messages at the same time, which could cause the loss of the messages);(iii) nodes within the ad hoc network may move at any time without notice;(iv) nodes are distinguishable.



in the translation to promela made by the architecture, the dynamic movement of nodes is simulated through non-deterministic changes to a matrix of connections among nodes. this is possible since movements reflect changes in reachability rather than physical position. because of these changes, the property[](none!packet error) is false. the property([](none!unicast(p) u p!comm)) is clearly a mistake in the order of formulae.



considering the manual specifications of the mobile protocols in spin, the whole specification of dsr is about five times greater than the specification in lep. the specification in smv is even bigger due to limitations in its input language. it affects readability, maintainability and mainly trustfulness in the specification and in the counter-examples obtained. nevertheless, since our architecture still do not optimize the generated code, our approach does not attack the state explosion problem.



about dsr and other protocols analysed, due to smart state exploration of most model checking techniques, it was possible to verify properties without having to instantiate so many objects as found in real life. the specification raised the question about how we can find a minimal model(regarding the number of instances) that is enough to represent the system in the context of the properties to be verified. it would become useless the number of instances given in the topology declaration of the specification in lep. this is beyond the scope of this paper and will be part of our future work.
