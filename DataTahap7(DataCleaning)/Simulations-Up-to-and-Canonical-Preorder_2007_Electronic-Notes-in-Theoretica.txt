all the preorders defining the semantics in the ltbt spectrum that are coarser than the ready simulation satisfy the hypothesis of this lemma, since all of them are action factorised. we have also considered the other alternative proviso in order to get a more general result. besides, it is interesting to note that the converse of the previous result is not true in general. in order to have it we need to impose an additional condition.



up-to with mutual simulations up-to. in fact, for large families of semantics, including those in the ltbt spectrum coarser than ready simulation, the results for bisimulations up-to arose as a corollary for the corresponding ones for simulations up-to(see corollaries 3.7 and 3.15).
