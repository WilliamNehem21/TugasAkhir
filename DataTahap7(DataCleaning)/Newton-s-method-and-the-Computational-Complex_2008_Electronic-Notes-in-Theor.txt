this was used in a(intuitionistic) proof by weyl to exhibit a subdivision scheme which yields all roots with a specified accuracy after a finite number of steps. the scheme runs as follows: the circle of radius r containing all roots is inscribed in a square of side length 2r. this first square is suspect, i.e. it contains roots. in each level(of increasing precision) the suspect squares are subdivided into four(whence later researchers named this procedure quadtree construction). using a numerical evaluation of the integral f'/f, the connected sets of squares containing roots are marked as suspect.



this nice analytic proof depends heavily on the notion of continuity, but it may also be turned into an effective computational scheme as h. kneser showed in 1940. h. kneser gave his proof in the framework of intuitionism via an auxillary result which enabled a descent in modulus as matching bounds(see(6) below) for the perturbed polynomials. replacing the minimum root-separation by its best known lower bound due to mahler we obtain, all in all, an exponential estimate for the number of newton steps(see, e.g. the analysis in).



explicit determination of v could be done via minimum root-separation estimates(after appropriate re-scaling each intermediate polynomial to integer coefficients). an arithmetic complexity estimate for path-following in this fashion would contain at least a term o(sn). it is probably instructive to compare this to the(nonconstructive) minimum number of steps estimated by shub/smale.
