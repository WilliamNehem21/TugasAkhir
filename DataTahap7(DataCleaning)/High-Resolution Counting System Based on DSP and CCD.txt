the tms320vc5509 gets the commands from the hmi(human machine interface), and it not only provides the timing signal to the adc and fifo, but also sets the counting mode of the system. in the meantime, the timing generator provide timing signal for ccd sensor. the dsp continually reads out the image data from the fifo by the half-full flag of fifo until all of the data from detection channel sent to the synchronous dynamic random access memory(sdram) by itself. after a series of data processing, the dsp send the processing results to the hmi. the touch screen (human machine interface) show the results and save the results to sd card automatically.
