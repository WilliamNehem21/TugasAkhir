in the finite graphs topic, r. fagin proved that the existential fragment of mso is strictly less expressive than mso. the famous problem of directed graphs connectivity is one of the problems(queries in databases terminology) that separates these classes, see[13,5].



in the rest of this section, we define the enhanced monadic second-order logics we study in the next sections. we suppose the reader familiar with monadic second-order logic and its existential fragment, see[5,13,21] for detailed definitions. we after recall some descriptive complexity results that we need in the separation results.
