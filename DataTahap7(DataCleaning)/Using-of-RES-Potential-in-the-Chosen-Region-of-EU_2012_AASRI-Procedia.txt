from the view of national economies renewable energy sources (res) are domestic sources that can replace or fully decrease consumption of the fossil fuels in the future. they are considered as an important tool for protection of national economy that is necessary to develop with aim economy could avoid stress from the future increase of imported fuels prices and costs that will be necessary for liquidation of environmental damages. technologies that use res do not have almost no or only very negligible influence to the living environment and in majority they are without waste, they do not create radioactive waste and there is no risk during big disasters. there is possible to base sustainable development of the society on them in area of energetic and by this way to provide better perspective for future generations [2,3].



every country has different potential for res using, therefore it is necessary to determine, which source is most effective for the given country. some res types have better using in one country and in other country they have worse using. it is caused mainly due to the geographical conditions of the state [5].



in slovakia water power plants will have in 2020 highest installed performance. then wind power plants on continent will follow, next photovoltaic power plants, biomass and finally geothermal energy. in czech republic photovoltaic will have highest installed performance in 2020, then water energy, wind energy, biomass and geothermal energy. precedency in highest installed performance in 2020 will belong germany in area of photovoltaic, next wind energy, biomass, water energy and geothermal energy. in great britain water energy will have lowest installed performance in 2020, highest installed performance will belong to wind energy, then biomass and photovoltaic.
