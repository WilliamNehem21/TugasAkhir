gorithms include breed, flux[20,21], brood and etc. there is no doubt that these approaches have been useful for mining pharmacologically relevant regions through analyzing the crucial and privileged substructures(known as fragments) from known bioactive compounds. nonetheless, the generated compounds are usually confined to a small chemical space by attaching various chemical moieties or side chains to a limited number of compound scaffolds. beside, they largely rely on exhaustive search or stochastic search algorithms[11,24,25]. thus, new fragment-based methods with the capacity to rapidly design large amount of compounds with high structural novelty and target specific characteristics are needed.



tool named delinker to connect two fragments in a three-dimensional manner. our group constructed a transformer model named syntalinker to link terminal fragment pairs extracted from chembl database. several recent reports showed that deep generative models can even been tailored to specific targets upon transfer learning[41,42] with focused subsets of bioactive compounds[28,43]. following this idea, we introduced a syntalinker-based workflow, namely syntalinker-hybrid, for target specific molecular generation by carrying out transfer learning and fragment hybridization.



syntalinker is a deep generative model that can generate a linker fragment to assemble two terminal fragments into a molecule. the model is built on a transformer architecture with multiple encoderdecoder stacks. each stack is further composed by a multi-head selfattention sub-layer and a position-wise feedforward network(ffn) sublayer. to prepare model training, each compound in the training set is 1osv and 4bkx, respectively. in the former three structures, highly active compounds are co-crystallized. for hdac1, the crystal structure is in complex with its substrate peptide as a ligand at the active site. at the beginning, the protein structures were prepared with the protein prepa-



were generated by the ligprep module, in which all tautomers and isomers were enumerated. the epik algorithm was employed to determine the ionized states at ph 7.0. the docking site was defined by a box centered on the crystal ligand using the receptor grid generation module. then, docking at the glide-sp precision was carried out with



chemical space can be characterized by a variety of descriptors, such as structural and physicochemical properties. in this study, the maccs fingerprint was used as the structural descriptor to represent chemical space. it is formed by a 166-dimensional binary vector, and each dimension corresponds to a predefined seed structure. then, principle component analysis(pca) was performed on the molecular fingerprint 10 docking poses saved for each compound, and glidescore was used as the scoring function. the rocs method in the openeye software(version 2020) was applied to measure shape similarity between different binding poses. kernel density estimation(kde) analysis was implemented to calculate the statistical probability distribution of docking scores and shape similarity.



amount of fragment pairs through exhaustive enumeration. the number of 1% fragment pairs is as high as tens of thousands. considering computational cost, we randomly selected 10,000 fragment pairs for model sampling, and ten molecules were generated for each pair. in such a situation, the percentage of valid molecules among the generated molecules is comparable to that obtained by previous model evaluation, in which terminal fragments in a pair came from the same compound. the validity for fxr even increases although its percentage is still lower than other targets. interestingly, the uniqueness values are improved for all targets, which is probably attributed to the fact that most hybrid fragment pairs did not exist in the training set of transfer learning models. in particular, most targets have over 40% unique valid molecules containing the input terminal fragments(we named them matched molecules).
