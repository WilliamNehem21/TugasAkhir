a weaker version of this scenario has been already presented in. however the last lifting part was obscured in details of direct calculations. what is novel in this paper is to work in prof, the bicategory of profunctors. in fact, it is one theme of this paper to demonstrate use of calculations in prof.



fact, this 2-cell is a strength in an internal sense. therefore an arrow(with its full set of operators, arr,>>> and first) is a strong monad in prof. this observation pleasantly parallels the informal view of arrows as generalization of strong monads.



arguments of f is opposed in(4). taking this functor(4) as f in def. 2.1, we define an end x[f(x, x), g(x, x)]. such an end does exist when c is a small category, because set has small limits(hence small ends).



right. a problem now is that(horizontal) composition of 1-cells(i.e. profunctors) is not strictly associative: due to def. 2.7 of composition by coends and products, associativity can be only ensured up-to coherent isomorphisms. the same goes for unitality; therefore profunctors form a bicategory(see) instead of a 2-category.



prop. 3.3 offers a novel mathematical understanding of the notion of arrow. its axiomatization seems to have stronger justifications than the original one(def. 3.1) does. it also seems simpler than the treatment of first in freyd categories which involves technicalities like premonoidal categories and central morphisms. it is this simplicity that is exploited in the rest of the paper.
