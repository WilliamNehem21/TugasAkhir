model driven development(mdd) turned out to be most useful for the development of standard business applications. many existing mdd solutions and tools support this domain. however, the handling of the non-functional aspects like quality of service, adaptability, assurance and security are mostly not sufficiently covered. in standard business applications, this is good enough; the existing mdd non-functional aspects.section 4 explains the structure of the model-based tool chain we have built to support development of secure applications in a platform independent way. section 5 describes an example on how we apply the presented approach in the air traffic management domain. section 6 concludes the paper.



although in model-based development environment the specific properties of the target platform become less important, a reliable and efficient execution environment is still crucial for successful system development. the corba component model(ccm) defines a platform which is a good choice for developing large scale distributed systems. it is based on the corba middleware and adds some more advanced concepts, e.g automated deployment. it also simplifies the usage of some corba services. the securemiddleware platform we use for realizing systems consists of an implementation of the corba component model called qedo, an extended security framework called openpmf[4,9] and both are based on top of mico, a corba orb with enhanced security functionality.



in the securemiddleware we used the qos enablers to enforce access control policies. to make this possible on each relevant node a corresponding qos enabler is instantiated in the ccm run-time environment. the management of the security policies is accomplished by a policy management framework called openpmf. qos enablers are in contact with openpmf at run-time to get updates on the security policies that have to be enforced.



similar to uml, the euml supports user-defined uml profiles. we can extend the euml metamodel by using profiles to customize the language for particular domain like security. for modeling our security policies we have defined a small security profile for euml called eumlsec. by using this profile it is possible to model the security aspect of a system additionally to the system design, for example role based access control(rbac) 1. a role is a job or function within a system. the role comprises all operations on a set of targets that can be executed from the user(person or system component).to reflect this concept of a role, the profile definition includes a stereotype<<security role>> that extends the euml metaclass class. in the section 5 we will give an example of the secure-aware system design.



(pim) into securemiddleware models(psm). since the securemiddleware platform is an implementation of the ccm and openpmf, we have extended the ccm metamodel, which is already defined and standardised by the omg. we have added security concepts like roledef and permittedoperation. we call this extended metamodel ccmsec:



the next step in the tool chain is to transform designed model into the platform specific model, in our example the securemiddleware platform. as already mentioned in this paper, securitymiddleware is an extended ccm implementation provided by qedo with security support provided by openpmf. thus, we have two additional repositories for further transformation steps: the ccmsec repository for the management of platform specific information, and the policy repository for management of policies defined in the platform. these repositories are synchronized with qedo and openpmf and are parts of the tool chain architecture.



ccmsec models can be modified or completed(e.g. by adding deployment information or other non-functional aspects like qos) by using the qedo modeller tool implemented as an eclipse plug-in. the qedo modeller handles the connection to the ccmsec repository to propagate models into the repository and also load models from the repository and display them graphically.



the controller role includes all( all) operations from the interface command, the role gives a permission to execute operations of the command interface. the same principle is for the role administrator that includes all operations of the interface administrate, and the role datacomm enables data signal based communication. it is of course also possible to select certain operations on a set of targets.



the presented tool chain is successfully used for the development of a secure prototypical air traffic control visualization application as part of the european ad4 project. the tool chain and the securemiddleware platform currently supports two very commonly used security models, role base access control for the invocation of operations and mandatory access control for controlling information flow, but can be easily extended to other security models as well. in addition to the generation of the rules for the component interaction, our tool chain is also able to automatically generate the complex rule sets for the underlying infrastructure daemons.
