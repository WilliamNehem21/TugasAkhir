semantics interpret conditional atomic actions await b then a as atomic. the coarse-grained trace semantics, which we will denote tcoarse, also assumes that assignments and boolean expression evaluations are atomic. the finegrained semantics, denoted tfine, assumes only that reads and writes to simple variables are atomic. in the rest of this paper, when stating a result which holds for both fineand coarse-grained semantics, we may use t to stand for either version of the trace semantic function.



appear free in non-atomic sub-expressions of c. it is vital here, as suggested by the terminology, to keep track of how many references the program makes, to each identifier. we need only be concerned with non-atomic subphrases, since these are the only ones whose execution may be affected by concurrent activity.



we are now ready to define the read multiset of an expression. again we include only a few representative cases. note that we will use the additive form of multiset union for an expression of form e1+ e2(and also, in general, for expressions built with binary operators), because we want to count the number of times an identifier needs to be read during the evaluation of an expression.
