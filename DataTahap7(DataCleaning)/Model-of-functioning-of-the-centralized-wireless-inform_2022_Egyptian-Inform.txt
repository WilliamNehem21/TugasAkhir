in developed countries, the creation and implementation of technological and managerial innovations occupy an important place in virtually all economic and social activity areas. rapidly introduced technologies are becoming increasingly important with growing risks caused by adverse atmospheric, environmental, and biological origin factors. the covid-19 coronavirus outbreak poses many challenges to the innovation ecosystem and highlights the interconnectedness of both the global and national communities. thanks to the widespread use of innovation, national economies are finding new ways to support economic growth and ensure a high standard of living. these trends are facilitated by the availability of effective innovation methods, including through technology transfer.



method, looks more promising. the advantage of this method is that it is not necessary to memorize the matrix(9). it is enough to calculate its coefficients at each iteration of the algorithm. we adapt the mentioned algorithm for our case.



analysis of the real ecosystem with the help of the created mathematical apparatus has shown that the function of selfrestraint is a means of controlling the efficiency of use of the resource of the communication channel. this circumstance allows us to consider promising to direct further research toward setting and solving the task of finding the optimal type and values of controlled variables of this function. we also note that the scientific and applied results presented in the article were tested in the 4g ecosystem. at the same time, the authors suggest that the theoretical results obtained can be adapted to describe the competing interaction of enhanced mobile broadband(embb) and massive machine-type communication(mmtc) services in the 5g ecosystem. the authors are going to confirm or refute this thesis in further studies.
