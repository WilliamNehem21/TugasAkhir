p. the idea is to allow for reduction of a let term when a partial value is known within precision p. we call this reduction strategy call-by-partial-value. the corresponding denotational semantics employs several ideas familiar to domain theorists, including measurement as defined by martin in and a monadic treatment of the distinction between value and computation as in moggi. furthermore, because we are interested in relations, say, on product types, we also extend the language to have explicit products of ground types.
