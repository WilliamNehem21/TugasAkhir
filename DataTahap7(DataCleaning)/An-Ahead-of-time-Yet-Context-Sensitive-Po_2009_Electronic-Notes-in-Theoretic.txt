concurrent behaviors. due to the lack of control flow structure and the explicit stack-based design, program analysis on bytecode is not an easy matter. we implemented the analysis in the framework of soot compiler, and utilized the weighted pds library as the back-end analysis engine. the analysis works on jimple, a typed three-address intermediate representation of bytecode supported by soot. the results of the analysis can be encoded into the class file as attributes for the further analysis or verification on bytecode.



points-to analysis for java is to detect the set of heap objects, i.e., instances of classes or arrays, possibly referred to by reference variables at run-time. many applications such as program understanding, program verification, and static analysis depend on points-to analysis to reason the underlying control/data flow of java programs. due to dynamic object-oriented features like dynamic dispatch 4, points-to analysis is mutually dependent to call graph construction. thus we have choices of constructing call graph either on-the-fly as the points-to sets of call site receivers are computed, or ahead-of-time based on syntactical information of the program such as cha and rta(rapid type analysis). the former essentially enjoys a higher precision and is the choice of most of points-to analysis algorithms.



due to the lack of control flow structure and explicit operand stack-based design, static analysis on bytecode is not an easy matter. we thus design and implement the analysis as a sub-phase of the compilation procedure in the soot framework. soot is an open-source compilation/optimization framework for java, which has been originally designed to simplify the process of developing new optimizations for java bytecode and supports three kinds of intermediate representations of bytecode.



the remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 briefly introduces weighted pushdown model checking. section 3 formalizes our abstraction and modelling on heap operations. section 4 presents our ahead-of-time points-to analysis as all-in-one weighted pushdown model checking. the skeleton of holding soundness property is given, and the prototype implementation is shown. section 5 compares related work and section 6 concludes this paper with a discussion on future work.



recall the usual encoding of programs as finite model checking, program states, i.e., the product of global variables, local variables and program execution points, are encoded as states of finite automata. for pushdown model checking, the pushdown stack can simulate the runtime stack of program execution. for instance, the pushdown stack can be encoded to store calling contexts for procedure calls, just like the program execution on stack machine. in this paper, we will follow the convention defined in definition 2.6.



that the dynamic dispatch of a call edge demands the runtime type of the heap object pointed to by s to be compatible with the type t w.r.t. the method m. this judgement on types should exactly obey to(such as definition 3.5) or soundly approximates the java semantics for dynamic dispatch.
