first we examine how the different measures are related to each other. given two dimension functions g and h a comparison of hh and hg can be achieved by simply comparing the behaviour of the functions g and h close to zero. the following lemma gives a relation between the behaviour of the dimension functions g and h and the corresponding measures hh and hg.
