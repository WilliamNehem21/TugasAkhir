based on the numerical simulation model of icing, the impact on icing of the current was further investigated. the critical current value with the meteorological conditions of foreign objects, as well as the physical parameters of the aerial cable itself change the law. the calculation results showed that the critical current value depends on the external weather conditions and the aerial cable itself, the physical parameters, and the critical current and the ambient temperature, wind speed, relatively good linear relationship.



the phenomenon that water accumulated on surface of the object becomes ice (frost) because of freezing is one nature phenomenon which is extensively distributed. icing on the power transmission line is one phase transformation nature random process which is related with meteorology, thermodynamics, heat transfer, hydrodynamics etc and is controlled by local meteorology (micrometeorology), topography (micro- topography) and surface condition of power transmission line etc. when serious ice disaster continuously comes, icing on the power transmission line isn't avoided. the researchers have developed several de-icing technology [1-], a part of technology gets into practice phase, there is still some difficulty when some technologies are applied in the grid system, such as electric pulse de-icing method, it is difficult to remove icing on line with sufficient length because applicable excitation source can't be found. basic ideas on de-icing in the grid system consists of three categories [1-5]:



de-icing technology that electric energy is converted into thermal energy shall calculate de-icing current and action time for the icing conductor, there is mature de-icing calculation mathematic model of icing conductor on this aspect [6-7]. value simulation method of icing process and mechanism of the power transmission line starts from 1980s, foreign experts start to study various factors affecting icing of the power transmission line through establishing mathematic model for icing increment in power transmission line, such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, height and geometrical size of power transmission line etc, the established engineering model has strong theoretical meanings and engineering applicable value [8]. the author of this paper forwards one two dimensions value simulation method [10] for soft rime icing process on surface of the power transmission line based on lagrangian method in document [9].this paper will fatherly observes influence of current on icing on basis of soft rime icing value method of the power transmission line. give out change rules of critical current following change of external meteorological condition and change of physical parameters of the conductor. which provides instruction for icing of the cable.



research and observation show icing on the conductor in same channel is different under same climate condition, the general condition is that icing on heavy load line is light or no icing, and icing on no load line is heavy; icing on the arrestor line is heavy and icing on the conductor is relatively light. it is obvious that this phenomenon is related with joule heat, joule heat makes temperature at surface of the conductor different to ambient temperature, which causes change of the icing condition on surface of the conductor, and this change is controlled by heat transfer loop during icing process of the conductor. minimum current which flows without icing on the conductor is called as critical current for anti-icing of the conductor. factors affecting critical current include: wind speed, air temperature, air pressure, geometrical size and resistance of conductor, black degree etc. the method that critical current is applied to prevent icing on the conductor mainly depends on science coordination, it can change tidal current distribution of grid on section liable to be iced in advance, increase load of the light load line or make power generation of the peak regulation power plant in advance and make current passed in line reach value above critical value through analysis and forecast of micrometeorology and micro-topography.



this subject team fatherly investigates influence of current on icing on basis of the value simulation model of icing. this paper gives out change rule of critical current following external meteorological conditions (air temperature, wind speed, liquid water content in air, air pressure, humidity) and change of physical parameters of the conductor (diameter and layout etc). give calculation sample with icing on the conductor when current is less than critical current.



learn from above two icing conditions, more is diameter of the conductor, greater is critical current. learn from ,when temperature rising doesn't play as dominant factor in surface heat balance influence of the cable, in particular when change of collision rate of water droplet isn't great, square of critical current is in direct proportion to diameter of the conductor. because change of the conductor diameter is key factor affecting collision rate of water droplet, square of critical current isn't completely in direct proportion with diameter of the conductor, it is found in the result that this rule is linear and not in direct proportion relationship (fit curve is a straight line not passing the origin point).
