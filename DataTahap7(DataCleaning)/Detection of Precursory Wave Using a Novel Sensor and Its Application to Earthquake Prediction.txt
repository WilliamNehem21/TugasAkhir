true positive(tp) stands for the first category, fake positive(fp) stands for the second category, true negative(tn) stands for the third category, and fake negative(fn) stands for the fourth category. obviously, in our study, tp = 25, tn = 179, fp = 40, fn = 39. therefore, the values of the three indexes are: accuracy 72.08%, sensitivity 39.06%, and specificity 81.73%.



under the support of earthquake monitoring center of shaanxi earthquake bureau, earthquake precursor wave recording devices based on liquid-suspension principle were placed at ziwu, qianling, louguan respectively and continuous signal recording had been implemented for over a year. comparing with the propagation speed of the precursor waves, the three data collection stations are too close to each other, which has a certain impact on locating the epicenter. accordingly, recording devices were relocated in gansu, henan, sichuan and shaanxi, which are relatively far away from each other. the new data recording process has started from july 21, 2011.
