the digital core of the soc is designed based on dw8051 ip core which is higher performance than traditional 8051 microcontroller. [8] the dw8051 ip core executes per instruction in a 4-clock bus cycle, as opposed to the 12-clock bus cycle in the traditional 8051. and this microcontroller manages the mac, spi interface, adc interface and other digital blocks by reading/writing special function registers (sfrs).



this soc integrates a 4kb sram and a 256b sram. the size of the sram is determined by recognition task, while the size of the sram is determined by the size of program. because the size of software is less than 4kb, we utilize a 4kb sram to storage the software. once the system is powered up, it initializes. the boot-loader is executed to download the software from the eeprom chip to the 4kb sram of the soc.



fifo memory is a key component of the soc, which is commonly used for buffer and flow control. a classical asynchronous fifo is implemented. [9] asynchronous fifos are used to safely pass data from one clock domain to another clock domain. the fifo design in this paper uses 6-bit pointers with 32 write-able locations to handle full condition, and uses 4-bit pointers with 8 read-able locations to help handle empty



the soc designed for pressure balance measurement applications in total knee arthroplasty is fabricated in umc18 cmos process with a die size of 3mm*3mm. the soc integrates all building blocks---including rf transmitter, adc, dw8051, adc interface, mac, mac controller, boot-loader, spi interface for eerom, mux, ldos and bandgap. we can use this chip to measure the pressure applications in total knee arthroplasty. and it is high level of integration.
