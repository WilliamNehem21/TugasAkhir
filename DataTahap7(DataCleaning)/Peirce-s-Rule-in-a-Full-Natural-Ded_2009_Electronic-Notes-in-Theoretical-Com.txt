natural deduction(nd) for first order classical logic is obtainable from the intuitionist system by the addition of peirce rule. in a previous paper, it was presented a normalization strategy for the implicational fragment with pierce rule. the end normal form is divided in two parts: an intuitionist subdeduction followed by a series of peirce rule applications, maybe empty. here, we extend this normalization process to



it is well-known that strong normalization(sn) holds for classical as well intuitionistic natural deduction. prawitz and gandy proved sn. gandy provided a more direct one. of course, the implicational fragment has sn. this section shows a counter-example to sn wheb peirces rule is added to the implicational fragment. therefor, np-imp is not sn. in fact, if derivations are not prepared for the application of red4, the reduction procedure becomes infinitely long.
