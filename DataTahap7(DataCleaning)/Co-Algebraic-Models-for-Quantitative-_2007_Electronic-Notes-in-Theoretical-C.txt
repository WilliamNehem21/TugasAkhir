recently, some approaches have addressed the definition on non-syntactical models of spatial logics. in and, for example, spatial logics have been interpreted over particular kinds of graph rewriting systems, rather than on the term language of a specific process calculus. in, a non-syntactical interpretation of parallel decomposition is given, by adding spatial information to the semantics of the language: a coalgebraic model, called spatial transition systems(sts), has been developed and tested as a semantic model for a ccs-like process calculus. it has been shown that the sts semantics is fully concurrent(for example, the processes a.b+b.a and a|b have different meanings). in sts, the semantics of process calculi is given by reaction rules, making behavioral observations about isolated subsystems impossible.



this definition, differently from the one in, allows us to observe the parallel decomposition of a process only if the involved subprocesses are reactive, i.e. they can synchronize with other processes at some point(similarly to the location semantics of ccs). the obtained slts bisimulation obviously contains ordinary ccs bisimulation, and it is coarser than structural congruence: consider the prothis formula measures the minimum available quantity of a certain kind of resource(modeled by a process that can do a), after the occurrence of event b. this kind of formula can be compared, in the setting of multi-valued logics, to the issues dealt with when considering history dependent access control policies. in our case, the measure of resource usage policies depends on the past history of execution, as it is the case for the validity of policies in history dependent access control.
