the universal remote control is unicast in nature. it delivers a message to a single specific node/device connected in the network. it utilizes star network architecture. the devices are all connected to the central remote, but are independent of each other.



the features of the present model of the remote can be further used to develop an android application that can be supported on the phone. this will allow our smartphone to act like a universal remote control. also the remote can be made fully touch screen to give a better look to it. given the current trends, this can be incorporated in the coming years.
