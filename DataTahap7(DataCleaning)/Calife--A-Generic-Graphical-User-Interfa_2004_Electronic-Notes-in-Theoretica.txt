in this paper, we present a platform that can be used to interface tools working on automata. the calife platform works on several automata models(transition systems, timed automata, counter automata,...) and allows to define new models and interface new tools. several tools are currently interfaced with the platform(uppaal, hytech, kronos, cmc, coq,...) and a unique timed-automata system modelled under the calife system editor can be exported to all these tools.
