at present, domestic sludge aerobic composting treatment project is not much. at the end of 2002.10, beijing city in the southern suburbs of daxing district pang gezhuang sludge disposal field the formal completion, gaobeidian sewage treatment plant of 160000t/d sludge. it is understood, can start on sludge the loss of nitrogen during the composting process, reduce the composting process of the environmental pollution, improve the composting of final product quality. composting process of organic matter degradation humus substances can chelae heavy metal, reduce the bioavailability of heavy metals in the sludge itself, however, the nature of the composting process on immobilization of heavy metals in a very limited role, especially in the heavy metal content of the sludge is relatively high, the efficiency is low compared to detoxification. in addition, although during the composting process, present in the sludge in organic pollutants will be a large number of degradation, but as a result of composting time and process conditions, still have a lot of refractory organic pollutants residue in the composting products. therefore, in the use of composting technology of sludge in the process, the need to further strengthen the nitrogen protecting measures, reducing nitrogen loss, improve the immobilization of heavy metals and organic pollutants degradation rate effect.
