compilation or translation is not only an issue at the level of program but also at the level of specification. this talk considers the design of real-time software for programmable logic controllers(plcs) and discusses questions of correctness and optimization for translations between different semantic models. the need for such translations arises in order to bridge the gap between conceptually clear models on the one hand and computationally feasible models on the other hand.
