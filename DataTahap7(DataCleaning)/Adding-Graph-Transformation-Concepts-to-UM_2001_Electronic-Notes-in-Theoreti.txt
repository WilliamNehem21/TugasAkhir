the object constraint language ocl is an integral part of the unified modeling language standard uml for the logic-based definition of class invariants or preand postconditions of operations. in its current form ocl suffers from the same problems as many parts of the uml standard: it neither possesses a precise static semantics nor a precise dynamic semantics definition. these are the reasons, why groups of researchers are now active to refine and redesign parts of ocl in order to influence the uml 2.0 definition process[3,13].



the following section 2 starts with the introduction of a running example adopted from. it uses a radically simplified meta model of uml class diagrams and collaboration diagrams(snapshots) to demonstrate typical difficulties of ocl with the definition of appropriate invariants. section 3 shows how some additional operators taken from progres simplify the construction of the ocl constraints of section 2 considerably. furthermore, this section introduces the concept of functional abstraction for ocl expressions and discusses some problems concerning the semantics of recursively defined ocl expressions.



section 4 addresses the second main topic of this paper, the development of a visual constraint definition sublanguage. it starts with a short survey of ocl-related visual constraint definition languages published in and in. based on the graph transformation related work presented in and the related graphical constraint definition sublanguage of progres we discuss the collaboration-diagram-based visual definition of constraints as well as different possibilities to define the semantics of graphical negation constructs. finally, section 5 summarizes the presented proposal and sketches future activities in this area.



ferent meta associations. next, we decided that binary links are not instances of roles, but instances of binary assoc(iations). finally, we added the import relationship import between packages as well as the meta associations conformsto and visible as examples for the recursive definition of derived relationships.



a precise definition of these restrictions using ocl version 1.3 as defined is not possible for the following reasons: the currently valid ocl standard neither offers functional abstraction nor a transitive closure operator needed for the definition of the two derived relationships visible and conformsto. it is, therefore, current practice to assume the existence of functional abstraction and to use recursively defined functions(cf. related assertions of the uml standard meta model in).



is the result set of the whole expression. the second version permits a boolean subexpression p2. it iterates the application of the subexpression p1 for all objects which do not fulfill condition p2. it returns all visited objects which fulfill condition p2, including the start object in the general case. the third version of the loop-operator is just a short-hand for the often needed case that p1 and p2 are the same expressions. the expression loop p endloop returns all objects visited by the transitive closure of p for which the application of p returns the empty set. applied to an object on a p-cycle loop p endloop computes therefore the empty set of objects.



the agg semantics for the right-hand side subdiagram of function visible excludes the case that the regarded package contains an element with the required name and that it renames an imported element with the proper name at the same time. this is not the condition we had in mind. what we want to express is the fact that an element with name= n from a package q is visible in a package p if p imports q and neither p contains already an element with the same name nor renames the imported element to a different name.



concerning the proposed addition of a visual constraint language we have to emphasize that our proposal adopts the syntax proposed in, but suggests a different interpretation of negation and adds the concept of functional abstraction for visually defined constraints, too. nevertheless, we have to admit that it is a matter of debate whether the textual versions of the ocl constraints or their visual counterparts presented here are easier to produce and to understand. but a more substantial discussion of this subject is useless as long as there are no tools for editing, analyzing, and executing visually defined constraints. to a certain extent all collaboration diagram editors of uml case tools can be used for editing the new visual constraints, but the appropriate support for analyzing and executing the constraint defining collaboration diagrams is still missing. even worse, until now no commercial uml case tool, we are aware of, is able to analyze and execute standard ocl expressions.
