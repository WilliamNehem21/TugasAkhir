the posture error in navigation system refers to the mal-alignment angle (or misalignment angle) between platform coordinate system and navigation coordinate system. in a sins, quaternion describes the transformational relation between carrier coordinate system (system b) and navigation coordinate system (system n). thus, the calculation error of quaternion can be used to decide the mal-alignment angle of the carrier.
