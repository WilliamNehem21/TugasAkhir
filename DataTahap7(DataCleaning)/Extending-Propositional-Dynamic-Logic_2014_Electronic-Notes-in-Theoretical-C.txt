in this work we present an extension of petri-pdl to deal with stochastic petri nets, the ds3 logic. this system is an alternative to model performance evaluation in a compositional and structural approach. we discuss about its soundness, decidability and completeness regarding our semantics and present a proof of exptime-completeness of its sat problem. a usage example is presented.



in section 2 we present the theoretical and conceptual background motivating our proposal and briefly compare it with other approaches. section 3 presents the technical petri net background; section 4 presents the ds3 logic and discuss its soundness, decidability and completeness with respect to our semantics and section 5 presents the two-person corridor tiling game reduction. a usage example is presented in section 6 and the conclusions and further work are in section 7.
