the conventional approach for independent control of active and reactive powers handled by the machine is stator flux oriented vector control with rotor position sensors. the performance of the system in this case depends on the accuracy of computation of the stator flux and the accuracy of the rotor position information derived from the position encoder. alignment of the position sensor is moreover, difficult in a doubly-fed wound rotor machine.



the direct power control of the doubly fed induction generator is capable of controlling the active and reactive powers of a wound rotor induction generator without rotor position sensors. decoupled control of stator active and reactive power can be obtained and the system has good dynamic response as shown in the simulation results. since it depends only on voltage and current measurements on the stator side, it is insensitive to the parameters of the machine. direct power control is more advantageous than vector control since the settling time and peak overshoot in case of vector control scheme are higher than that of direct power control scheme. the direct power control of the generator has been embedded in an optimal power controller for maximum energy capture in a wind energy application. pitch angle control of wind turbine is also implemented to limit the generator speed to maximum speed at higher wind speeds so that the system can work satisfactorily for higher wind speeds also.
