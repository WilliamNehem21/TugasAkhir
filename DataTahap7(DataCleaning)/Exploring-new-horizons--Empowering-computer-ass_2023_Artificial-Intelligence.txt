the field of computer-assisted drug design (cadd) has seen remarkable progress and is constantly evolving [1]. cadd techniques can be broadly classified as structure-based drug design (sbdd) [2] and ligand-based drug design (lbdd) [3], based on the information and availability of protein/target and ligand structures, respectively. the term artificial intelligence was introduced by john mccarthy in 1956, who defined it as the field dedicated to the creation of intelligent ma- chines [4]. essentially, ai encompasses the capacity of machines to carry



these algorithms can be employed using various approaches to address the challenges posed by limited data. in this review, we show the application of fsl in the field of drug discovery, providing examples using qsar and other methodologies. by highlighting these examples, we hope that researchers will be encouraged to explore and utilize fsl for modeling datasets with scarce resources.



few-shot learning (fsl) can be employed in various types of data for supervised learning problems. these include: (i) classification: this type of fsl approach, known as n-way-k-shot, involves considering n from the number of classes, and k is the number of examples. alternatively, one-shot learning (osl) is employed when only one example is avail- able, while zero-shot learning (zsl) is applied when zero examples are provided [33,34]; (ii) regression: fsl can also be applied to regression tasks, where the goal is to estimate a function based on only a few input-output example pairs sampled from that function. in this scenario, the output represents the observed value of the dependent variable, while the input records the observed value of the independent variable [25,35]. furthermore, fsl can be used in semi- or unsupervised learning, using the reinforcement learning to weight orient the prior knowledge and prediction between the tasks [36,37].



the three methodologies differ in terms of the type of data utilized in the training set. in the case of augmenting data using the sample of the training set, additional samples are generated by applying variations to the existing data. when augmenting data using weakly or unlabeled data sets, the augmentation process involves incorporating weakly or unla- beled samples from large data sets. lastly, for augmenting samples using similar data sets, aggregation techniques are employed to combine similar samples from large data sets, which are commonly utilized in generative neural networks, in this approach, the large data should be labeled, different from weakly or unlabeled data [25].



extracted motif vocabulary serves as external memory. in meta-training tasks, support/query samples retrieve relevant motifs from the vocab- ulary. using convex combinations, the approach creates prototype clusters to represent each class. then, the authors evaluated the effec- tiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets for molecular property prediction. the results demonstrated that incorporating motif-based task augmentation significantly improves the performance of fsl models compared to conventional approaches [81]. furthermore, the technique exhibits robustness across different molecular property prediction tasks, highlighting its potential for practical applications in drug discovery and other molecular-related domains.



the paper described by gao and co-workers [63] can be classified as a framework to transform samples from similar datasets, when is aggregated or adapting data from similar and large data set. the authors compose a two-step approach where the low dimensional deep learning model captures the overall atomic properties, while the fragment-based gcn focuses on the local environment of atoms. in the first step, the low dimensional deep learning model is trained to predict atomic properties based on simplified atomic descriptors. this model provides an initial estimation of the atomic properties in a fast and efficient manner. in the second step, a fragment-based gcn is applied to refine the predictions by considering the interactions between atoms and their local environ- ments [63]. finally, the authors evaluated the performance of their method based on various datasets for atomic and inter-atomic property prediction. the results demonstrated that this combined approach ach- ieved high accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to traditional methods [63].



one popular approach in representation learning is to use deep neural networks (dnns), such as graph convolutional neural networks (gcns), to learn the representations. these networks are trained on large-scale datasets to capture the inherent structure and patterns in the data. the learned representation can then be used for fsl tasks by leveraging the similarity or distance between samples in the embedding space [41,44].



zhang and colleagues [84] introduced a novel technique for few-shot drug synergy prediction using a prior-guided hypernetwork architec- ture. this approach addresses the challenges in discovering effective drug combinations and advancing precision medicine. the hypernet- work learns prior knowledge about drug synergy from the training data and generates task-specific weights for the main network, allowing the model to adapt to different combinations. the fsl approach trains the model on limited drug combination examples to handle scenarios with scarce data. by incorporating additional prior information, such as



liu and co-workers [58] proposed a new methodology to identify potential drug candidates that can target multiple proteins associated with the sars-cov-2 virus. the researchers proposed a novel gcn ar- chitecture that effectively captures the structural and functional infor- mation of both drugs and proteins. the gcn model learns to encode the molecular structures and interactions into a low-dimensional embed- ding space, enabling efficient similarity calculations and predictions. this approach provides a valuable tool for identify multi-targeted drug candidates [58].



the paper described by sanchez-fernandez and co-workers [71] is another task-invariant example, which introduces cloome, a novel technique that utilizes contrastive learning to facilitate the querying of bioimaging databases using chemical structures. while bioimaging data provides valuable insights for drug discovery and biological processes, the lack of direct searchability based on chemical structure information poses a challenge. cloome addresses this issue by employing contras- tive learning, a self-supervised learning approach, to establish associa- tions between chemical structures and corresponding bioimages. the neural network is trained to maximize similarity between paired in- stances of the same chemical structure and bioimage while minimizing similarity between different pairs. this enables cloome to learn a joint embedding space where chemical structures and bioimages are seman- tically linked. by integrating chemical structure information with bio- imaging data, cloome offers new opportunities for efficient and targeted analysis, allowing researchers to leverage large-scale bio- imaging databases for drug discovery and biological research [71].



and collaborators (2023) [80], which utilizes a meta-learning frame- work to predict few-shot modifications of histone modifying enzyme inhibitors (hmeis). hmeis play a crucial role in epigenetic regulation and have potential therapeutic applications. however, predicting effective modifications of hmeis with few data is challenging. meta- hmei addresses this challenge by leveraging meta-learning, which en- ables the model to learn from a diverse set of related tasks and generalize to new tasks with few labeled examples. the proposed model combines a siamese network with a memory-augmented neural network, allowing it to capture similarities and differences between hmeis and effectively predict modifications. the results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that metahmei outperforms baseline methods in predicting few-shot modifications of hmeis. the findings suggested that meta-learning can enhance the prediction accuracy and generalization capability in the context of modifying enzyme inhibitors, facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic regulation [80].



wang, yao and dou [61] presented an innovative approach to enhance fsl for molecular property prediction. the technique employs property-aware relation networks to effectively capture and model the intricate relationships between different molecular properties. by focusing on specific properties of interest, the model demonstrates the ability to generalize and make accurate predictions even when con- fronted with restricted labeled data. the approach combines a gcn architecture with a property-aware relation module, enabling the model to capture and exploit property-specific interactions among molecules. experimental evaluations validate the superior performance of this method compared to existing approaches in various few-shot molecular property prediction tasks. this advancement has significant implications for drug discovery, as it facilitates accurate predictions of molecular properties using limited data, ultimately reducing the time and



in the domain of drug discovery, although there are already pub- lished papers exploring the concept of fine-tuning parameters within the learning with external memory approach, the exploration of refining representations remains relatively unexplored in the existing literature. seidl and co-workers [60] introduced a technique called modern hop- field networks (mhopnets) to improve the prediction of reaction tem- plates in fsl and zsl scenarios. reaction templates are essential for synthesizing new chemical compounds, but obtaining labeled data for all possible reactions is impractical. mhopnets leverage the power of neural networks and memory mechanisms to address this challenge. the approach involves training a mhopnets to store and retrieve reaction templates. by using an attention mechanism, the network learns to attend to relevant parts of the input and produce accurate predictions. the results demonstrated that mhopnets outperform existing methods in both fsl and zsl settings, effectively predicting reaction templates even with limited labeled data. this technique has the potential to advance the field of chemical synthesis by enabling the discovery of novel reactions and facilitating the design of new compounds [60].



chen and co-workers [85] presented a novel technique called met- arf, which combines attention mechanisms with random forest models for predicting reaction yields with limited data. accurate prediction of reaction yields is crucial for guiding chemical synthesis processes, but obtaining sufficient labeled data for training can be challenging. metarf addresses this problem by leveraging the power of attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant features in the input data. the approach involves training an attention-based random forest model that learns to assign importance weights to different features based on their relevance to the prediction task. the results demonstrated that metarf out- performs traditional random forest models and other state-of-the-art methods in predicting reaction yields with only a few trial data points. the technique shows promise in enabling more accurate and efficient reaction yield prediction, leading to improved chemical synthesis pro- cesses and accelerated drug discovery efforts [85].



of two main components: pattern mining and pattern matching. in the pattern mining phase, the meta pattern representation is used to capture the underlying structure of knowledge graphs. these meta patterns are learned from the existing graph data and aim to provide a compact yet informative way to represent graph patterns. the pattern mining em- ploys meta-learning techniques, where the model is trained on multiple "meta-tasks." each meta-task involves a small support set of known facts and a query set with missing facts. during the testing phase (pattern matching), metap is given a new, unseen knowledge graph completion task with only a few observed facts. using the learned meta patterns, the model generalizes and predicts the missing facts for the given task. metap can utilize external information, such as embeddings or linguistic features, to enhance its knowledge graph completion performance. to evaluate the effectiveness of metap, the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets. the results demonstrated that metap out- performs existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and ef- ficiency, even with very limited labeled data [53].



an example of generative modeling is shown by dong and co- workers [82], who introduced a novel approach to address the chal- lenge of limited data in drug discovery using reinforcement learning and one-shot learning techniques to enable effective molecular design in low-data situations. the reinforcement learning agent explores a chemical space and iteratively generates molecules, maximizing a reward signal associated with the desired properties (specific tasks). additionally, one-shot learning allows the model to make accurate predictions using minimal training examples, leveraging knowledge from labeled molecules to optimize properties of unseen molecules. the technique is evaluated in drug design tasks, demonstrating its effec- tiveness in generating high-quality molecules even with low data [82]. this approach represents a promising advancement in drug discovery, addressing the challenges of low-data situations and enabling efficient molecular design for improved drug candidates.



(generative pre-trained transformer). these language models have undergone extensive training on large volumes of text data, enabling them to capture rich contextual information and semantic understand- ing. through the process of fine-tuning the gpt model using a labeled dataset comprising drug pairs and their corresponding synergy scores, cancergpt adeptly captures the complex interplay between drugs and their synergistic effects. recognizing the limitations posed by scarce labeled data, the research paper introduces a fsl framework, empow- ering cancergpt to generalize its understanding and make precise predictions for previously unseen drug combinations. moreover, experimental evaluations on various cancer cell line datasets demon- strated that cancergpt surpasses existing methods in predicting drug pair synergy with fsl [74]. the approach showcases remarkable accu- racy and generalization capabilities, facilitating the identification of synergistic drug combinations even with limited labeled examples. these results underscore the potential of large pre-trained language models, such as gpt, in the domain of drug synergy prediction. by leveraging language models and fsl, cancergpt offers a promising avenue for guiding cancer treatment decisions and expediting the dis- covery of effective personalized medicine combinations.



gull and minhas [64] proposed a technique for the accurate pre- diction of antimicrobial peptides (amps) in different species using zero and fsl. amps are important components of the innate immune system and exhibit potential therapeutic properties. however, the diversity of amps across various species poses a challenge for accurate prediction. the technique, called amp0, leverages a deep learning framework that combines zsl and fsl approaches. in the zsl phase, the model is trained on a large dataset containing labeled amps from one species and learns to generalize to unseen species using semantic embeddings. in the fsl phase, the model fine-tunes its parameters using a small set of labeled examples from the target species, enabling species-specific prediction. the model effectively captures the inter-species similarities and



meta-ddie is an approach proposed by den and co-workers [66] that addresses the challenging task of predicting drug-drug interaction events using fsl. drug-drug interactions play a crucial role in drug safety and efficacy, and accurately predicting these interactions is essential for patient well-being. the proposed technique leverages a meta-learning framework combined with graph convolutional networks to enable effective learning from limited labeled examples. by training on a large dataset of drug-drug interaction networks, meta-ddie learns to generalize from a few labeled drug pairs and make accurate pre- dictions for unseen drug interactions. this approach incorporates a graph-based representation of drugs, capturing their structural and functional properties, and employs attention mechanisms to focus on informative parts of the drug interaction networks. experimental eval- uation demonstrated that meta-ddie outperforms existing methods in predicting drug-drug interaction events, even with limited labeled data. the results highlight the potential of fsl and gcn in the domain of drug-drug interaction prediction, offering valuable insights for drug safety assessment and facilitating informed decision-making in healthcare.



seidl and collaborators [75] integrated natural language processing (nlp) with activity prediction models to improve drug discovery pro- cess. traditional activity prediction models rely solely on molecular features and structural information, often lacking the ability to interpret and utilize the wealth of information present in scientific literature. this paper introduced a novel framework that incorporates nlp techniques to extract relevant knowledge from textual sources, such as scientific papers and databases. by training the model to understand human lan- guage and extract key information, it can effectively augment the pre- diction models with additional context and insights. the proposed approach demonstrated significant improvements in activity prediction accuracy, outperforming conventional models that solely rely on mo- lecular features [75]. the integration of nlp with activity prediction models opens new avenues for leveraging the vast amount of informa- tion available in scientific literature, enabling more informed decision-making in drug discovery and accelerating the identification of potential drug candidates.



ma and collaborators [59] developed predictive models for drug response that demonstrate a remarkable ability to translate from high-throughput screens to individual patients. this technique effec- tively tackles the challenge of limited labeled data by leveraging knowledge from a small set of examples and generalizing it to predict drug response in novel contexts. the researchers trained the fsl model on the combined dataset of high-throughput screens and individual patient profiles. the model learned to extract essential features from the data and to generalize drug response patterns across different biological contexts. a critical aspect of the study was to determine if the predictive models developed from high-throughput screens could be effectively transferred to predict drug responses for individual patients. the both high-throughput screens and individual patients. understanding these underlying mechanisms is essential for advancing precision med- icine and drug development. these findings underscore the immense potential of fsl in the area of personalized medicine, facilitating the development of predictive models that can guide informed drug selec- tion and significantly improve patient outcomes.



properties. extensive experimental evaluations conducted on multiple drug discovery tasks convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in low-data scenarios, surpassing the performance of tradi- tional machine learning methods. these findings underscore the tremendous potential of meta learning with graph attention networks in accelerating the drug discovery process and facilitating the identifica- tion of potential candidates even with limited labeled data.



81]. the papers listed above focus on few-shot molecular property prediction and adopt various techniques to address this challenging task. notably, the best metrics were achieved by meng and collaborators for tox21, muv, sider, and toxcast [81], followed by ju et al. [78] and wang and colleagues [61]. interestingly, meng et al., adopted the ar- chitecture from wang et al. [61], as a benchmark and applied augmented the data to them, resulting in noticeable improvements, especially for the challenging muv dataset (auc-roc rose from 60.66%



to enhance their performance [28,50,72,75,80,83,51,52,56,58,59,62, 64,67]. this diversity underscores the need for a standardized approach that can be employed in research endeavors seeking to leverage fsl methodologies. the work described by stanley et al. [28] contributes significantly to this field by providing an accessible dataset, the fs-mol, that facilitates the refinement and application of fsl techniques to biological activity prediction. however, only a limited number of studies, like schimunek et al. [72], have utilized the fs-mol dataset to enhance existing methodologies, demonstrating improved efficacy and accuracy in their predictions.



the quality of available data can vary widely, and bias can be introduced during data collection or curation. biased or noisy data can lead to suboptimal model performance and potentially biased drug discovery outcomes. as well as data that span a wide range of molecular structures, targets, and properties. ensuring that the -fsl model is exposed to diverse chemical and biological spaces is challenging. limited diversity in the training data can lead to poor generalization. to exemplify this, stanley and collaborators [28] used the chembl data only with ic50 and/or ec50 and compounds with high molecular weight, is worth mention even with their encouraging results, chembl data has different levels of confidence, which is crucial for any methodology of qsar.



as fsl become more influential in drug discovery, ethical concerns related to their use may arise. there could be questions about the fair- ness and transparency of these models, especially when they impact patient treatments and outcomes. moreover, convincing regulatory agencies (such as fda, epa and others) to accept and validate the use of fsl models in drug discovery and toxicity research is a significant challenge. there may be a need to develop new regulatory frameworks and guidelines.



fsl models can use different levels of complexity such as augmenting data and learn an algorithm or augmenting data with representation learning. due to the new subject of fsl for biological activity prediction, the use of different levels and types of data become difficult to compare the complexity between the models, with exception of manuscripts using the fs-mol dataset [28,72]. on the other side, for molecular property prediction is possible to compare the approaches published by meng et al. [81], ju et al. [78], and wang et al. [61] that used the same data (muv, sider, tox21, and toxcast). this comparison revealed that the complexity of models can to be used to achieve a better performance for complex data.



as shown in this review, there are many successes cases emphasizing the significance of fsl in cadd, particularly when supported by compelling experimental results. molecular property-related studies often rely on established datasets for model generation, facilitating effective comparisons with existing literature. in contrast, biological activity-focused manuscripts employ diverse datasets, such as chembl, bindingdb, zinc, fda-approved drugs, ellinger, and others, which hinders the establishment of a universal benchmark for model evalua- tion. one promising approach to kickstart this process involves utilizing the fs-mol dataset, made available by stanley et al. [28], enabling the exploration of novel models and advancing interpretability in ai-driven exhibit strong predictive capabilities even without resorting to complex models [58]. these observations prompt the need for further investi- gation into the significance of meta-learning models and deep learning in fsl. while some molecular property datasets indicate improved metrics with more model complexity [61], the question remains less resolved for biological activity datasets, warranting more research to identify simple and explainable fsl models capable of surpassing the predictive performance of traditional machine and deep learning models.



latest research papers in the field, focusing on the growing significance of representation learning approaches in accomplishing remarkable re- sults for fsl tasks. the appeal of this approach lies in its straightforward calculation of similarities between embeddings, as opposed to the uti- lization of intricate meta-learning architectures, making it particularly intriguing. nevertheless, delving deeper into the field of fsl with meta- learning models in the context of drug discovery, even with the demand for substantial computational resources, offers promising opportunities to tackle diverse challenging endpoints like adme/tox, as well as neglected, tropical, and rare diseases that may suffer from limited re- sources. while the introduction of new methodologies is undoubtedly valuable, there still exists untapped potential for exploring these methodologies in crucial areas such as scaffold generalization, explainable machine learning, and the chemical space encompassed by these models. finally, bridging the gap between computational science and medicinal chemistry is crucial to develop models that not only perform well but also possess the capability to accurately and cost- effectively predict new drugs, solve protein structure-related prob- lems, assess drug synergy probabilities, and evaluate drug toxicity and adme properties. such advancements may ultimately lead to a reduc- tion in investments allocated to unreliable drugs.
