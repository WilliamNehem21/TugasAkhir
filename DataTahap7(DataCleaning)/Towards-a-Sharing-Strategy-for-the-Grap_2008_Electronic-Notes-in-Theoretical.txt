we propose in this paper a reduction strategy for the graph rewriting calculus which aims at maintaining the sharing information as long as possible in the terms. the corresponding reduction relation is shown to be confluent and complete w.r.t. the small-step semantics of the graph rewriting calculus.



the idea underlying the proposed strategy is to constrain substitution rules to be applied only if they are needed for generating new redexes for the basic or matching rules. note that, in particular, substitutions which do not contribute to generating new basic or matching redexes will never be applied. hence the strategy will enlarge the class of terms which are in normal form.



this derivation is a valid derivation using the strategy sharingstrat. indeed, there exists a cyclic substitution step which transforms the pre-redex x a into a basic redex(y b) a. hence, the first(external sub) rule step can be performed following definition 3.1(ii) c). the second(external sub) rule step is needed to create the basic redex(y b) a, thus it is permitted by definition 3.1(ii) b).



ctx[] is an application. in this case ctx[]= ctx'[] g' or ctx[]= g' ctx'[]. if ctx'[x] is not a free(constrained) variable, then we conclude by inductive hypothesis. hence, either ctx[]= g' or ctx[]= g'.
