this article is organized as follows. in section ii, we provide a description of cryogenic device characterization and the developed 4 k cmos model for circuit design. section iii elaborates on the clock generator architecture and cryogenic circuit design considerations. the measurement results of the clock generator at 300 k and 4 k are presented in section iv, and finally, we conclude this article in section v.



quantum transport42, source-to-drain tunneling43-44, etc.) have not been taken into account. besides, the monte-carlo parameters, parasitic capacitors, self-heating effect45, mismatch parameters33, and small-signal model46 of cryo-mosfets also need further study and modeling. these works will be carried out in our next stage of cryo-cmos modeling research.
