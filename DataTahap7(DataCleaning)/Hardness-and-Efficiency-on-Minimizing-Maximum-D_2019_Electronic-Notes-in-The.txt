note that the decision problem was treated just for a few values of k and l. in spite of that, the problem of determining whether a graph is t-admissible was considered for(0, 2) and for(1, 1)-graphs, which are 3-admissible(cf.). table 2 presents our contribution for msst(k, l)-graphs. although we set most of them as np-complete problems(sec. 3.1), we present subclasses for which msst is admissible, cf., and, in this work we characterize 2-admissible(0, 2)-graphs. let h= g[vh], where vh is the set of vertices incident to each transversal edge of g, i.e., edges with one extreme in k1 and the other in k2.



graph does not have cycles, so, a chordal graph is a(2, 0)-graph if, and only if, it is a forest. thus, a(2, 1)-chordal graph is partitioned into a forest f and a clique k. given a(f, k)-partition of an arbitrary graph g, edges with an extreme in f and the other in k are called transversal edges. two transversal edges incident to a same tree in f create a cycle in g. if the two edges are incident to the same vertex of k, then we have a type 1 cycle, otherwise, a type 2 cycle. in particular, if g is chordal, in a type 1 cycle the vertex in k must be adjacent to each other vertex of the cycle. in a type 2 cycle we have 2 possibilities: at least one of the k-vertices are completely adjacent to the cycle vertices; or their neighborhoods cover the cycle with some intersection as described in. in this work we consider that vertices v



a bi-star b is obtained by identifying one leaf of a star with the center of another star. a v, w-centered bi-star is a bi-star with centers v, w. we denote the leaf sets of v and w in b by l(v) and l(w), respectively.
