it follows from theorem 3.4 and corollary 3.5 that the final ls-comodel is given by the set s of states with its canonical lookup and update structure. corollary 3.5 enriches routinely, assuming one uses the evident definition of enriched(loc,v)array.



in this section, we calculate the tensor for two other examples: global state and monoid actions. as in the case of read-only state we are interested in combinations with other theories, by tensor, and with exceptions, by sum. our calculations again enrich without fuss.



in previous sections, we have considered comodels of three main theories: ls, lr and lm. but one may have more than one of these acting at once, for instance employing triples(s, t, m) consisting of a state s, a time t and a term m. so in this section, we consider a tensorial combination of comodels and its interaction with the tensor with models.
