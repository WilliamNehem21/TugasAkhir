video-oculography(vog) is one of eye movement measurement methods. a key problem of vog is to accurately estimate the pupil center. then a pupil location method based on morphology and canny algorithm was proposed for a wifi-based vog system which was developed our latest work. moreover, a healthy volunteer was introduced to do sinusoidal tracking test to evaluate the pupil location method. experimental results showed that the method could well trace eye movement and meet the anticipated results with stimulation.



vog is one of the most popular methods and becoming more and more attractive, due to high accuracy, insignificant artifacts, non-invasiveness, and freedom of head movement. vog analysis is based on eye movement tracing. a key problem of vog is to accurately estimate the pupil center. therefore, the purpose of this study is(i) to present an analysis system based on wifi for nystagmus which we have developed, and(ii) a pupil location method based on morphology and canny algorithm was proposed, and then(iii) experiment was done to evaluate the method.



opening is erosion followed by dilation and closing is dilation followed by erosion. opening can smooth the contour of the binarization image and break narrow gaps. as opposed to opening, closing tends to fuse narrow breaks, eliminates small holes, and fills gaps in the contours.



authors presented a wifi-based video-oculography system. then a pupil location method based on morphology and canny algorithm was proposed and used for the system. a healthy volunteer was introduced to do sinusoidal tracking test to verify the pupil location method for wifi-based vog system. the results show that this method can well meet the anticipated results.
