considering the previous research works, this paper introduces a high-order optimal do(hoodo) for estimating aerodynamic torque which, in turn, helps to estimate the wind speed. this paper also utilizes an linear quadratic regulator(lqr), for the speed tracking problem of the generator. the efficiency of the presented optimal composite control scheme is justified by computer simulation in matlab/simulink. the main contribution of this work are: 1) the proposed hoodo relaxes the assumption that disturbance is slowly changed. by doing this, it creates a theoretical base for estimation of fast-varying disturbances such as aerodynamic torque of wecss precisely; 2) moreover, to systematically select the gains of the proposed hoodo, an optimal algorithm is utilized. via tuning the diagonal of weighting matrices, the gains are easily selected for satisfied performance. note that the gain tuning rule is



a big issue in most of the existing observers; 3) four different orders of the hoodo, i. e. first, second, third, and fourth order, are compared, analysed and investigated in detail; 4) a straightforward gain tuning rule is implemented for the lqr, which is practical to implement in real hardware; 5) detailed analysis on stability of the closed-loop hoodo-based lqr is presented explicitly using the lyapunov approach.



(15) and(16), it is seen that ku has dependency on the weight matrices q and r. increase of q positively affects to reference tracking efficiency with more control efforts applied. increase of r leads to a small control value and poor reference tracking performance. it is recommended to take into account the indicated influence of q and r on ku, and to come to a compromise between control efficiency and energy consumption. the weighting matrices are typically chosen as a diagonal ones with non-negative elements on the main diagonal. in this case, however, the presence of some



we note that the estimation performance of the observer depends on the value of k1. its value can be selected by changing q 0 and r0. hence, by referring to, the observer can guarantee definitive boundedness and uniform stability of a small ball with the center at~x 0.



error in estimating the aerodynamic torque of four values of r for the hoo-based lqr control scheme are(et)max= 1.5688%, 1.3932% and 1.3932%, 1.3932% for r= 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. for the wind speed estimation error(x~)max= 19.0570%, 2.6650% and 2.6650%, 2.6650% for r 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. while



this work introduced the high-order optimal disturbance observer(hoodo)-based lqr for pmsg-based wecss. the presented hoodo is able to estimate an aerodynamic torque considered as a disturbance and, hence, a speed of the wind with fast varying dynamics. detailed analysis on the stability of the hoodo-based composite controller is carried out via the lyapunov approach. the simulations show that the hoodo-based lqr has better accuracy than hoo-based lqr method. the presented controller with hoodo can guarantee smaller error and faster response time than previous observer-based control schemes reported so far. in addition, its parameter insensitivity property is significantly better than that of the hoo-based lqr. the work performed confirms the effectiveness of the proposed hoodo and its superiority compared to other types of high-order observers. future work might focus on: 1) building an experimental setup and verify the performance of the proposed methods exper-
