coalgebras for an endofunctor provide a uniform framework for the study of reactive systems. in this article, we will study coalgebras for functors on the category meas of measurables spaces and maps. the subprobability functor s will play a role similar to the powerset functor in that it allows us to treat stochastic aspects instead of non-deterministic ones.



we will introduce two technical conditions on sets of predicate liftings: separability and admissibility. our notion of separable predicate liftings is a specialization of the one used in coalgebraic logic over set, cf.. it was first introduced in for sets of unary predicate liftings.
