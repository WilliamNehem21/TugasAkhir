in pantograph-catenary system, the electric locomotive obtains electricity power by a carbon strip rubbing against copper contact wire. therefore the anti-wear of the contact pairs has a direct influence on the service life of pantograph strip and copper contact line materials[1-4]. in order to study the anti-wear of contact couple material, a series of experimental tests were carried on the friction and wear tester under electric current. a large number of investigations were performed to study the tribology performance of carbon strip/copper contact wire under different sliding speed and electric current. in this paper, the friction and wear performance of electrical contact material is investigated. the surface morphology was analyzed by sem and eds. the wear mechanism of contact couple is proposed in the electrical sliding process.



the testing machine has been introduced in detail in previous studies[2, 4, 6]. in the test, the normal force fn is set to 80, 160 n. the electric current intensity i of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 a are chosen. the sliding speed v is set to 50 km/h and the duration t of each test is set to 1 hour.



the coefficient of friction with electric current is smaller than that without electric current. and the variations of the friction coefficient and the electric current with time have the same trend in the process of carbon strip rubbing against copper. the wear rate of carbon strip increases with increasing electric current. the thermal wear, arc erosion and abrasive wear are the dominant wear mechanism occurring in electrical sliding frictional process, and accompanying with material transferring.
