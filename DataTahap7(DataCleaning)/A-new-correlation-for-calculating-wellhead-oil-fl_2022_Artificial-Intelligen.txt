around 210 wells in iraq. the data include gas-liquid ratio, upstream/- downstream pressures, chock size, production rates and api oil gravity. the author performed a sensitivity analysis to select the best correlation for rate estimation. the results show that the gilbert's correlation yielded a relative accurate prediction of the wellhead rates while achong's cor- relation underestimated the production rates. economides et al. (2011) mentioned that the theory of multi-phase fluid flow through choke is not clearly described. ghareeb and shedid (2007) proposed a study to



zhong-bao et al., (2011) proposed a neural network model that based on the back propagation learning algorithm to predict surface oil rates. the neural network consists of one hidden layer and 10 neurons. the input neurons include the wells number, the coordinates of the wells, the cumulative production, the derivative of cumulative production, the shut-in time, the average distance to surrounding wells, average cumu-



elmabrouk et al. (2010) established a neural network model to pre- dict the reservoir average pressure without shut the wells. elshafiei et al. (2011) presented a neural network model to predict the crude oil pro- duction rates from multi stage oil separators. the model is based on in- puts that include initial, final temperature for each stage and oil composition.
