we define a new logic programming semantics in terms of abducible atoms. we use it to characterize the stage extensions of an argumentation framework af by means of an associated normal program paf. we also define the stage semantics for a special type of normal programs and present a similar characterization.



in this section, we review some theory about logic programming semantics and argumentation semantics. as it has been done before[4,8], we establish the relation between a specific argumentation semantics of an argumentation framework and a semantics defined on the normal logic program associated to the argumentation framework. we start with the basic definitions and facts we need about logic programming semantics and argumentation semantics.



{d(a), d(c)}. moreover, we can verify that m={d(a), d(c)} is the only stage model of paf since m\ facts((paf)m) is minimal with respect to set inclusion. hence, according to theorem 2.10,{b, d} is the only stage extension of af, which coincides with the result showed in example 2.6.
