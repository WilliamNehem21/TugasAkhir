validation of the obtained results through step responses of the higher- order and obtained reduced-order systems is in section 6 along with the computed errors. the limitation found during the findings of the outcome from this article is discussed in section 7. finally, the key dif- ference between the two methods is offered in section 8 as conclusions with a possible future scope.



with time span and easy access of digital signals and systems, discrete-time systems gained their consideration over analogue systems for control and analysis. since, the study and analysis of such systems of higher order in their raw form is uneasy; they also demand their order reduction for easy access. order reduction techniques available in literature showcase the advancement of fewer order reduction tech- niques in continuous-time domain directly to the discrete-time domain, both for non-interval and interval systems. such type of algorithms in- cludes pade approximation, balanced truncation, direct truncation, ag- gregation. apart from these, an algorithm like routh approximation in the continuous-time domain is not applicable to discrete-time domain directly. a vast range of algorithms based on routh approximation is consisted in ref. [12]. this call for an appropriate discretization tech- nique of the discrete-time systems to continuous-time and vice-versa with an ease of computation. precisely, the transformation modifies the discrete-time system to continuous-time system; order reduction methodology applied, and finally, an appropriate inverse transformation results in the desired reduced model in discrete-time domain.
