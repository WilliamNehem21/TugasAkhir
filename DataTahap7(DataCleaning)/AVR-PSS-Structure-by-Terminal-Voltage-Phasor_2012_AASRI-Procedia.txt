paper includes sections with the following contents. section ii defines the two-dimensional complex argument error function (caef) of the terminal voltage phasor and a method of it measuring. consider the definition of the normal caef (ncaef) for steady state of the plant. presented the calculation of the differential caef at terminal voltage phasor with use the wirtinger calculus. in section iii showed the excitation control of the synchronous machine that used caef at terminal voltage phasor. the example for study the small-signal stability with proposed excitation control is given in the section iv. the conclusions are summarized this paper.
