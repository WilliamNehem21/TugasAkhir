assuming that the device had the proper certificates installed, this code in lst. 1 would be operational. the urlconnection api takes care of hostname verification and certificate management. besides the urlconnection api, other libraries and middleware have been developed for application designers which manage these components. more customization is available in the java secure socket extension(jsse) which comes packaged with java. other common libraries include openssl and gnutls: c-based frameworks for ssl/tls implementation. higher-level wrapper implementations of these ssl/tls libraries include curl



as seen in listing 2, messages are hidden from users and the application continues as though it has a secure connection[24,8]. again, overriding errors thrown by the system defeats its purpose and mimics the insecure manner in which users click through ssl errors in the browser. however, unlike in desktop browsers, this case comes with the repercussion of never presenting the user with options for their own security.



order to solve errors. one such website is stack overflow. typically, errors solved are caused when the developer who has posed the question has incorrectly written a chunk of code. in these situations, stack overflow operates in an important, positive way. however, in



oper works on a psychological level is not a feasible solution and remains out of the purview of this paper. those seeking to make developers more astute at securing their ssl implementations must focus on support tools and resources. in this section, using ideas from other platforms and contexts, we will discuss a few of the ideas and subject areas which have seen solutions proposed.



tendulkar et al. also suggest removing the ability for developers to override sslerrorhandler. this prevents developers from hiding ssl error messages from the end user, forcing them to fix their code rather than obfuscate incorrect implementations. coupled with disabling of ssl checks when the debuggable flag is triggered, half of ssl vulnerabilities could be prevented. this does, however, restrict the programmatic capability of developers and would make debugging much more challenging. instead, warnings or errors could better announce the danger of leaving certificate checking out of the application.



in order to secure ssl implementations on every platform, ssl libraries and middleware with flaws in their validation and revocation checks mentioned in the previous section need to be patched. design refactoring of current libraries should focus on hiding low-level code. a system similar to https everywhere should be used in android communication apis[63,24]. as libraries are more and more utilized, their code needs to be scrutinized and brought into a state of security that is both forward-looking and all-encompassing. large companies which handle critical data should be contributing efforts toward the improvement of open-source ssl libraries and protocols. changes to libraries may roll out slowly across the ssl/ tls ecosystem, but they would become the cornerstone of safe android web development.



which use it. the main limitation remains what direction would be the most sustainable solution moving forward, garnering both industry and academic support. while these increases in strictness will make the line drawn between secure and insecure architectures clear, it may pose an issue to developers and users who are looking for performance and availability over security. suggestions for a warning escalation system may alleviate the pressure on developers and system administrators, much innovation and discussion remains before a proper certificate architecture that solves for both security and usability can be put in place.



studied on such a scale. another area of ssl ecosystem research which is not clear is the effect of implementing hsts and obcs on a modern cellular or wireless network. finally, there is little research in the field of an android implementation of the dane protocol and similar tools. determining the effectiveness of these tools on the android platform or as an extension in an android browser is an important tool in deciding how to better secure https on android and make it the standard protocol of the platform.



the development of a sustainable internet-scanning service for security researchers would allow for further research into the shortcomings that still exist within the https protocol in its current form. this tool would be available to researchers, commercial entities, and security organizations in order to find holes to patch. the outcome would be much like the work of durumeric et al. following heartbleed, extensive notification of vulnerable entities with the hopes that these systems would be patched quickly. further solutions will certainly arise for the android platform as research into new protocols, languages, and programming paradigms continues.
