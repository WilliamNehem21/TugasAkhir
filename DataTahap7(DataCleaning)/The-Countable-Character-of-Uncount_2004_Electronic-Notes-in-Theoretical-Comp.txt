it is interesting to note that the results in this paper have no pendant in the finite case. in fact, in the finite case, the following is still a conjecture(see devos, johnson and seymour) even if, in the infinite case(i.e., the case where a and b are infinite), it is a weakening of proposition 4.8.



cardinality is odd(resp. even). a bond is non-empty cut which is minimal with respect to inclusion. observe that a cut[a, a]g of a connected graph g is a bond if and only if both a and a are connected.
