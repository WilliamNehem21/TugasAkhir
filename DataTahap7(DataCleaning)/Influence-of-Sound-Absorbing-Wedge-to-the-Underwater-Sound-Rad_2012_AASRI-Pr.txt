the self-noise level of sonar platform area is highly related to the performance of sonar. reducing the selfnoise level can not only improve the detection signal capacity of sonar, but increase working distance as well. the prediction of self-noise can estimate its level quantitatively, in addition, the prediction of different noise resources effects on self-noise can help to determine the measures to control self-noise and its quantitative technical indicators.
