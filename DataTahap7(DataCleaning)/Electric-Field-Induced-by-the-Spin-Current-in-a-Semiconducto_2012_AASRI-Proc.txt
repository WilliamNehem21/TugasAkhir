in this paper, we have studied the spin current and spin-current-induced electric field in a dresselhaus nanowire (quantum wire). using the electron wave-functions and definition of spin current, the linear and angular spin current densities and its induced electric fields have been calculated. it is found that two nonzero linear spin current density elements have peaks at the center of nanowire and their strengths can be changed by the number of propagation modes and dresselhaus constant. moreover, for the dresselhaus qw instance the spin-current-induced electric field can also be detected which makes a way of spin current detection.
