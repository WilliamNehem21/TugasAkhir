in addressing several other environmental artefacts like poor-con- trast and noisy images resulting from foggy, distortion and dusty con- ditions, al-shemarry et al. [12] improved the accuracy of vlp detection using a binary descriptor with contrast enhancement, leaving their proposed system limited to real-time application with poor frame-rate and higher computational cost. to tackle the motion artefacts (i.e., blurry input images), zou et al. [10] recently proposed a bi-lstm model with robust blur-kernel estimation that offered a reasonably lower accuracy of 79.55%. another recent development with object bounding-box detection for alpr system is yolov4 model [13], which is a deep convolutional network that can localize vlps with immense frame rate and high accuracy.



trained using the curvelet coefficients of an original image and its morphologically changed copies. the overall recognition accuracy of 96.8% was reported while trained for twenty popular bengali fonts and tested for different font sizes. later, hasnat et al. [19] attempted to introduce bengali script in tesseract ocr. tesseract can learn new languages or alphabets with training, along with existing languages for character recognition.



recently, rabby et al. [20] presented a new 13-layer cnn model called bornonet for bengali character recognition. the model was designed with two sub-layers optimized using the adam optimizer despite having relatively higher accuracy in the models for bengali character recognition, their applications to an alpr system is not yet studied. in addressing the potential gap of having a promising alpr system for bengali vlp, we, therefore, develop and present a real-time end-to-end dnn based model that we call blpnet.



are fed to the vlp detection model along with the coordinates of the bounding-box. later, the second phase detects and extracts the vlp contour, followed by the character localization and recognition in the final phase. consideration of intensity-inhomogeneity resilient seg- mentation and effective deployment of these cascaded modules would reduce the computational cost and false-positive predictions, improving the accuracy and reliability of the system for a real-time application. these phases are defined in the algorithm 1 and discussed below, with necessary mathematical modeling and more technical details.



an average pooling layer is thus added, followed by a group of fully connected dense layers and dropout layers. finally, the output layers identify the object and generate the bounding box coordinates. thus, our model was pre-trained with over fourteen million images from the imagenet dataset, which is now capable of categorizing images into over 1000 different classes with transfer learning ability. as a result, it has accumulated a library of rich feature sets for a wide variety of classes.



we have used an annotated dataset of 1500 training and 300 validation images to train our model. from real-world video footage taken on roadways in dhaka, bangladesh, with varying road conditions, includ- ing high traffic congestion, the vlp were detected with reasonably higher accuracy (see section 4). the training began with some itera- tions set at 6000. the average loss did not diminish significantly after 2000 iterations, and after every 1000 cycles, the training was capable of taking the weight back up. to reduce training duration, we thus used early stopping.



this step recognized characters in the extracted vlp from the previous step. similar to [27], we considered the character-recognition as an object-recognition problem. by treating characters as objects, the character segmentation and recognition steps are integrated and consist of a total of 5 convolutional 2d layers with 16, 32, 64, 128 and 512 nodes. each of them includes a preceding max-pooling layer with a pool size of 2 and a dropout layer with a drop rate of 20%. the dropout layers were used to prevent the model from over-fitting. the kernel size of 2 is considered with necessary padding. relu activation function is used for all the backbone layers. finally, a global-average pooling layer is included before the output layer, followed by two dense layers. two important considerations of this model are the conditional use of de- blurring filter and intensity inhomogeneity invariant segmentation of the character.
