the mass nutritional elements in soil mainly include carbon(c), nitrogen(n), phosphorus(p), potassium(k), silicon(si), sulfur(s), calcium(ca), magnesium(mg), and so on. to a large extent, those elements can reflect the soil fertility, and they are also considered as the basic elements for guaranteeing the plants growth and maintaining normal physiological activities(de carvalho et al., 2014).



glumac et al.(2010) analyzed 6 dried and pelletized soil samples containing from 0.5% to 3% of organic c(oc) by libs. a strategy based on the optimized combination of high dispersion and appropriate time gating parameters was developed to minimize the interference of atomic and ionic fe i and fe ii lines adjacent to the c i line at



erler et al.(2020) used a commercially available handheld libs spectrometer for a spatially resolve determination of nutrients and various soil parameters in two agricultural fields. most measurements were conducted in the laboratory. three different multivariate regression methods(plsr, lasso, gpr) were characterized and compared for measuring soil parameters. lasso and gpr yielded better regression results than plsr. several nutrients, such as ca, mg, k and fe, could be determined with good accuracy. other nutrients, such as mn and p, could only be determined qualitatively with the handheld instrument.



he et al.(2018) compared the detection ability of single-pulse(sp) and collinear double-pulse(dp) laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy(libs) for soil nutrient elements. 63 soil samples were collected for sp and collinear dp signal acquisition, respectively. macro-nutrients(k, ca, mg) and micro-nutrients(fe, mn, na) were analyzed. the results indicated that the dp-libs technique coupled with plsr could be an accurate and reliable method in the quantitative determination of soil nutrient elements.



nicolodelli et al.(2014) developed a method for separating the al interference from the c emission line in libs measurements. 43 samples from two typical forest brazilian soils rich in al were collected and analyzed using a low-resolution libs apparatus to measure the intensities of c lines. as a result, two c lines at 193.03 and



martin et al.(2010) discussed that how libs spectra collected on different types of soil varied according to laser wavelength(532 and 1064 nm) and excitation energy(45, 90, and 135 mj), and then multivariate approaches were used to explore whether calibration models could be developed for libs that were independent of the soil chemical and physical properties. finally, a set of operational parameters and statistical analysis techniques were located, which would produce a robust calibration model or models for predicting the c concentration in soils by libs.



additionally, martin et al.(2013) used libs combined with multivariate analysis to differentiate between the total carbon(c), inorganic c, and organic c in a set of 58 different soils from 5 soil orders. the results were compared to the laboratory standard technique(e.g. combustion on a leco-cn analyzer) to determine the true values for total c, inorganic c, and organic c concentrations.



knadel et al.(2017) used libs technology to determine the content of organic carbon, clay, silt and sand in danish agricultural soil, and compared it with vis nirs method. the results showed that libs model was similar to vis nirs model in all soil properties, but the difference was not significant(p n 0.05), except for the prediction ability of sand(p= 0.0305). therefore, using libs can get lower prediction error of soil properties.



izaurralde et al.(2013) employed three advanced technologies to measure soil carbon(c) density and the results compared against those obtained by the dry combustion(dc) method. the advanced methods are laser induced breakdown spectroscopy(libs), diffuse reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(drifts), and inelastic neutron scattering(ins).



ding et al.(2019) proposed libs technique combined with interval partial least squares(ipls) to determine cu, zn, cr and ni in oily soil samples. the full spectrum was divided into 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 subintervals for ipls model optimization. compared to the pls model using the full spectrum, the ipls model with the 30th subinterval from the 80-interval case as the input variable has higher r2 and lower rmse for cu, zn, cr, and ni. the r2 improved from 0.96 to 0.99, and the rmse reduced from 0.03 to 0.01. the calculation speed increased about 5 times.

fu et al.(2018) developed a new method for the determination of cadmium in soils using libs. the heavy metals were enriched by the cation exchange resins. and then, the libs signal levels were further enhanced by a sample container with spatial confinement. during this process, the soil only needs to be treated with water to achieve slurry status, rather than any complex pre-treatments. the detection limit for cadmium in soils is 0.132 mg/ kg by using this method.
