several recent works focus on the use of finite automata based models to address web services composition problems. in[18,17], the authors propose a model where web services compositions expressed in bpel are formally defined by state transition systems with communicating and internal(unobservable) actions. in, this model was enriched using a knowledge base, and in using a theory. these approaches were applied to practical applications in[24,12,11]. in[1,21], web services are defined by pwl-s documents and modelled by guarded finite automata. a similar approach is investigated in where web services are defined in bpel. in, the authors model by input/output automata web services interfaces described in bpel, owls and wsdl.
