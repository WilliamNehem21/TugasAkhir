can be categorized into two types: anti-spam techniques based on ek (expert knowledge) and anti-spam techniques based on ml (machine learning). anti-spam techniques based on ek contain rule-based filtering, such as whitelists, blacklists, challenge-response, enhanced protocol, etc. there have been many spam filters based on ek, such as sender policy framework (spf) [1], sender-id [2], and domain keys identified mail (dkim) [3], etc. anti-spam techniques based on ml contain probability-based filtering, linear classifiers, rocchio method, nearest neighbor method, logic-based method, data compression model, etc.



fingerprint and fingerprint recognition are concepts originated from the area of biometric authenticate identity. after applying them in the area of information retrieval, fingerprint is defined as short tag for large object. fingerprinting technique has the advantage that it can identify the same or similar duplicated documents with small partial variations by calculating and matching their hash values.
