other methods and give us more new exact solutions than the other existing methods. a variety of distinct physical structures such as soliton solution, singular soliton solution, cuspon, kink type solution, singular kink solution, periodic solution, bell type solitary wave solution and solitary wave solutions are formally derived. the various types of exact travelling wave solutions provide the mathematical foundation in physics and engineering. therefore, it is examined that the novel(g'/g)-expansion method would be a vital mathematical tool for solving not only a single nlees but also the coupled nlees.
