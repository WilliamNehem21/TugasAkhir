we give an explicit combinatorial construction of final coalgebras for a modest generalization of polynomial functors on set. type signatures are modeled as directed multigraphs instead of endofunctors. the final coalgebra for a type signature f involves the notion of brzozowski derivative on sets of paths in f.



a type signature is a directed multigraph f along with a designation of each node of f as either existential or universal. the existential and universal nodes correspond respectively to coproduct and product constructors. the directed edges of the graph represent the corresponding destructors.
