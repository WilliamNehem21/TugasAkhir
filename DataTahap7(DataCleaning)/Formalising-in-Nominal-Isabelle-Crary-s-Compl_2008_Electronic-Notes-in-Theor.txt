we can generally remark that having a formalised proof allows one to quickly test changes whether they affect the whole proof. this proved convenient for testing if lemmas or definitions need to be strengthened or can be weakened. having the formal proof at our disposal also made it easy to compile this paper, as isabelle has an extensive infrastructure for using formal definitions in papers and providing sanity checks. this is especially useful to keep formalisations and papers synchronised. the inductive rules and the statements of the lemmas and theorems presented in this paper have been generated from the formal definitions.
