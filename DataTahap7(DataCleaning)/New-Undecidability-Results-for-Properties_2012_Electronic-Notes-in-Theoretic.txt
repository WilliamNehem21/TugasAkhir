this paper is on several basic properties of term rewrite systems: reachability, joinability, uniqueness of normal forms, unique normalization, confluence, and existence of normal forms, for subclasses of rewrite systems defined by syntactic restrictions on variables. all these properties are known to be undecidable for the general class and decidable for ground(variable-free) systems. recently, there has been impressive progress on efficient algorithms or decidability results for many of these properties. the aim of this paper is to present new results and organize existing ones to clarify further the boundary between decidability and undecidability for these properties. another goal is to spur research towards a complete classification of these properties for subclasses defined by syntactic restrictions on variables. the proofs of the presented results may be intrinsically interesting as well due to their economy, which is partly based on improved reductions between some of the properties.



and normalization is shown to be decidable(from which decidability of existence of normal forms also follows we show here) for shallow right-linear and linear right-shallow systems. reachability and joinability are also decidable for left-linear, growing systems. progress has also been made on the termination problem but it is not studied here.



note that in all three reductions above if we start with a flat system, then the depth of the left-hand sides increases by one and the right-hand sides remain flat after reduction. therefore, by theorem 1 and lemmas 2.5 and 2.6 we get:



the corollary is interesting for two reasons. first, the systems constructed in are collapsing systems. hence the status of all three problems in corollary is not settled by their results. second, it can be used to prove undecidability results for other properties as well, which are not known to be undecidable for right-flat systems.



proof. the idea is to associate a rewrite system r(m) with a given deterministic, two-counter machine m. without loss of generality, we may assume that: the two-counter machine has only one final state f, it empties the two counters before accepting, and there are no transitions from the final state.



the right-hand side of these rules are obtained from the right-hand sides of the ptransitions by finding the transitions that apply to the four cases: both counters are initially zero; the first counter is initially zero, the second is not; the first is not zero, the second is; and both counters are non-zero initially. the constant q is determined by the state component of the second triple of the corresponding transition. a1(also b1, a2, b3) is z if m ignores the counter and b(z) if it increments it(it cannot decrement any counter in this case since the counter is zero). b2(a3, a4) is x if m decrements the corresponding counter, and b(x) if it ignores or increments the corresponding counter. b4 is y if m decrements the corresponding counter and b(y) if it ignores or increments it.



remark 1. the above reduction does not preserve groundness, but it does preserve left-linearity, right-linearity, linearity, and noncollapsing property. it also preserves left-flatness and the right-hand sides of the new rules introduced are of depth at most two(for this s and t must be flattened firstusing the procedure of for exampleand their new names must be used in the new rules).
