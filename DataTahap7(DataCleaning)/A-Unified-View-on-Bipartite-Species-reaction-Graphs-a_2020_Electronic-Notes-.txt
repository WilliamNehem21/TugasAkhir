in contrast to the determinant expansion from gi, the sum-of-products representation of labels of g yields a direct correspondence of species-line-graphs and expansion terms. terms have the same partial derivatives if their species-line-graphs have identical substrate-reaction edges. this observation motivates to identify compatible line-graphs in g and determine their overall contribution to the expansion from their stoichiometric labels.



as an example, l1 and l2 in example 6.3 are the only non-trivially compatible species-line-graphs. the notion of compatibility suggests a strategy to determine if det(j) vanishes by summing over each individual compatibility class of l(g). if all classes are either non-negative or non-positive, the sign of the determinant is independent of the state x.



by lc leads to a new compatible species-line-graph with positive contribution that compensates the negative. however, there might be a second species-line-graph in the same class, also with negative contribution that contains another negative cycle that leads to the same compensating species-line-graph. thus, the compensating species-line-graph needs to dominate the sum of all these contributions. next, we give conditions when such situation arises and provide a simple sufficient condition that excludes it.
