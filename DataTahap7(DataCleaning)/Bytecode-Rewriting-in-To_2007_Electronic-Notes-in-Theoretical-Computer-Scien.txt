in this paper, we present a term rewriting based library for manipulating java bytecode. we define a mapping from bytecode programs to algebraic terms, and we use tom, an extension of java that adds pattern-matching facilities, to describe transformations. an originality of tom is that it provides a powerful strategy language to express traversals over trees and to control how transformation rules are applied. to be even more expressive, we use ctl formulae as conditions and we show how their satisfiability can be ensured using the strategy formalism. through small examples, we show how bytecode analysis and transformations can be defined in an elegant way. in particular, we outline the implementation of a classloader parameterized by a security policy that restricts file access.



there exist several libraries for manipulating java bytecode, among them serp, bcel and asm are the most well-known. although they are powerful, a deep knowledge of the api may be needed to use them effectively. in this paper we propose to introduce an abstraction level, based on terms and rewriting, to make the definition of high-level transformations and analysis easier. using the of concerns between rules and strategies introduces well founded constructs and allows us to reason about transformations. this improves reusability, expressiveness, and thus helps to avoid introducing programming errors when implementing a complex transformation. these two features are particularly well-suited to describe transformations of structured entities like, for example trees, terms, or programs.



in our setting, the notion of term is essential because this is the only datastructure that can be handled by a rewriting rule. for this reason, we developed gom, a generator of typed tree structures. given an algebraic signature, it generates a java implementation that is efficient in time and space.



in order to represent bytecode programs, we have defined an algebraic signature that allows us to represent any bytecode program by a typed term. given a java class, we use asm to read the content and build an algebraic representation of the complete java class. this approach is similar to bcel. this permits multi-pass



the real signature contains more than 250 different constructors. due to lack of space we cannot list them in detail. the given signature shows that a class is represented by a constructor class, which contains information such as name, packages, and imports. it also contains a list of fields and a list of methods. the latter is encoded using an associative operator methodlist whose arity is not fixed. as illustrated below, it is used to model lists and will be useful to describe the search of one or several elements in the list. similarly, a list of instructions is represented by the associative operator instructionlist. a method contains an info part and a code part. the code part is mainly composed by local variables and a list of instructions. each bytecode instruction is represented by an algebraic constructor: nop, iload, etc.



perative languages such as c and java. pattern matching is usually found in functional and logic languages, where it is used to analyse the composition of aggregated data, and express transformations of those structured data. the main originality of the tom system is its language and data-structure independence. from an implementation point of view, it is a compiler which accepts different host languages and whose compilation process consists in translating the matching constructs into the underlying native language. since gom generates java implementations of terms, in the following, we consider java as the host language.



for example, invariants in the code are represented by the ctl formula ag(p) where p is the predicate we want to be always verified. fatality properties can be defined using the combination of a and f. for a method, we can for example verify that it always returns a result if it is not a void method. that means that if the predicate isreturn verifies that an instruction is of type return, the corresponding ctl formula is af(isreturn).



the classical strategy operators can be combined in an interesting way to obtain temporal strategy aliases. the main idea is to represent a predicate p as a basic strategy s(defined by a%strategy) and the ctl operators by strategy aliases. instead of using a model-checker like spin to verify a temporal formula on the method code, a specific strategy is applied to the list of instructions. if the visit fails, the formula is false. otherwise, it is considered as true.



up to now, we have just defined traversals on the list of instructions without considering the control flow. obviously, the use of strategies as temporal formulae is only interesting in a control flow context. a first idea is to construct explicitly the control flow graph from the list of instructions but the memory cost in case of complex methods cannot be disregarded. our suggestion is to use strategies in order to simulate the control flow during the traversal of the list of instructions. in this way, a memory representation of the control flow graph is not necessary. in a list of instructions, the control transits from an instruction to the following in the list and we do not care of goto instructions or possible exceptions that can disturb the control flow.



this strategy is parameterized by a map that associates to every label the sublist of instructions that starts with the labelled instruction. to simplify, we do not consider in the definition of the all the case for exception handling, but it is resolved in a similar way. it can be interesting in the future to use this formalism to associate to every bytecode instruction the corresponding frame with the meaning of the current state.



in this section, we present an application of bytecode rewriting for secure class loading by redirecting method invocations to new targets. in particular, we will enforce the use of a safe api for file accesses. the use of defensive class loading instead of defensive virtual machine is argued in.



access method can be loaded, but instead will be transformed at load time to use the safe wrapper class. for simplicity sake, we have only presented the search of the new filereader(namefile).read() pattern. analysing the control flow graph is necessary to find the creation of a filereader followed by a call to the method read().



we have presented a library that enables bytecode transformations by strategic rewriting. this library allows us to view a java class as an algebraic term, formed by the tree representation of the bytecode. transformations can then be described as rewriting rules, using strategies to control their application and explore bytecode expressions.



moreover, we have demonstrated how those strategies can be used to examine the control flow graph of a method. a particularity of this technique is that it is not necessary to build the control flow graph in memory in order to traverse it. we then show that it is possible to encode the verification of temporal logic conditions over this control flow graph using strategy operators.



finally, we illustrate the use of this library in the context of defensive execution of classes. we define a specific class loader that redirects classic i/o functions to a safe api to access files. the class loader uses bytecode rewriting to ensure only secured classes are loaded in the jvm. this transformation is defined in an abstract and concise way, thus leading to improve the confidence we can place in the code, by reducing the gap between the transformation to describe and the actual code.
