in this paper, we extend this formalism to treat continuous systems. to do this, the continuous variables with their firstand second-order derivatives will be introduced. using these variables, we can analyze and verify programs that control discretely certain continuously physical or other external systems.



section 2 shows the formal system and the semantics of ta, the original version of which can be found in. a vehicle control system is then introduced and analyzed in section 3. in this example, we consider the situation of a car merging with traffic at a t junction. we formulate this problem, then formally analyze and verify the conditions under which the merging car does not crash into others.
