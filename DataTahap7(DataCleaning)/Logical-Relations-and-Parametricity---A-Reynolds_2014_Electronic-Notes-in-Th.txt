even before we look at parametricity, it is worth taking an abstract view of the structure underlying logical relations. we need a treatment similar to the definition of categories, retaining identities but dropping composition. the resulting structure is called a reflexive graph[32,35,44], improving on the previous work on scones.



for logical relations. the problem is that, in the first place, the function type constructor does not preserve the composition of relations, and, secondly, composition brings back the variance issues of functors, which logical relations are meant to avoid. note that homomorphisms preand post-compose with logical relations, although the resulting bimodule structures remains to be explored. it would also be interesting to consider composite logical relations of higher arities. on the other hand, the structure of relations under composition leads to the consideration of bicategories of relations, which might also be appropriate in some contexts. the categorical analysis of relational modalities carried out in considers this direction. the lifting of endofunctors in this context, with applications to coalgebraic bisimulation in the spirit of sec. 2 is addressed in and the references therein.
