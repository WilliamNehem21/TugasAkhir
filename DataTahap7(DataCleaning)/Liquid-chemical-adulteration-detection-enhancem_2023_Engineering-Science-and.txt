these days, fuel and oil are the most ubiquitous forms of energy sources around the globe. most fuels, including petrol, diesel, oil, and natural gas, are derived from the natural world, either dug up from the ground or manufactured through crude oil processing. there is no doubt that fuel plays a critical role in the global economy. however, some businessmen are capitalizing on this by adding substances to the fuel supply. particularly concerning is the rise of tainting pure fuel with lowpetrol station sector, with the intention of adulteration. to enhance fuel quality, certain industries and gas stations engage in the practice of blending kerosene with petrol or diesel. adding kerosene poses the greatest risk because it drastically decreases fuel lubricity. this has repercussions for a wide range of sectors, including the automotive, chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries, among many others. machinery using contaminated fuels suffers damage. furthermore, if natural items involve mixing, it could have harmful effects on a wide range of organisms and ecosystems.



dielectric sensor for the purpose of determining the concentration of ethanol and pentano. however, the sensitivity is relatively low, and the q-factor has not been computed. this article presents a microwave sensor for liquid characterization that utilizes a compact and highly sensitive mu-negative metamaterial. the primary focus of the study is on achieving miniaturization and enhancing sensitivity. to identify kero-



boundary condition is predicated on the assumption that the conductor in question is an ideal conductor possessing negligible electrical resistance, thereby facilitating the complete reflection of incident electromagnetic waves. on the other hand, the z-axis was designated as an open boundary. this means there is no constraint or reflection in the z-direction, allowing the electromagnetic waves to propagate freely in that direction.



the measured results and simulated outcomes are in concurrence. discrepancies between simulated and measured data may arise due to the mutual coupling effect of the waveguide port, manufacturing tolerances, and measurement error. furthermore, the mutual resonance between the transmitting and receiving terminals of two waveguide ports will invariably influence the measurements, which leads to a slight discrepancy in both data sets.
