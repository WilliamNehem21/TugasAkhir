similarly, there is also a single axiom defining the static or non-deterministic component of the semantics. in this case the number of choices for constraints is larger so that we obtain several semantics under the same simulation part. the unifying framework arises because two basic axioms parametrized conveniently suffice to define all the classic semantics in the spectrum, as well as many others.



for reducing non-determinism. as already achieved in our first part of the study devoted to the observational semantics, the classification into branching and linear semantics has been clarified. more importantly, the similarities between all the semantics have been unearthed, allowing a generic study without the need to resort to case analysis proofs.
