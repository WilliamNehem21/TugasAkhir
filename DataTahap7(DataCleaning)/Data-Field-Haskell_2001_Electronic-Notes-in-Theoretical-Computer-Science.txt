data fields provide a flexible and highly general model for indexed collections of data. data field haskell is a haskell dialect that provides an instance of data fields. it can be used for very generic collection-oriented programming, with a special emphasis on multidimensional structures. we give a brief description of the data field model and its underlying theory. we then describe data field haskell, and an implementation.
