it is important to stress that the statement of theorem 2.2 above refers to any natural isomorphism and not necessarily to the canonical natural transformation defined from the limit. the theorem establishes that if there exists such a natural isomorphism then the canonical natural transformation is indeed a natural isomorphism as well.



hence, by theorem 4.9, the composition of profunctors jf preserves colimits regarded as a functor in f(and similarly as a functor in j). this result is important in work modelling nondeterministic processes as presheaves(which are essentially profunctors from 1 the one object, one arrow category). the result ensures that horizontal composition of 2-cells in the bicategory of profunctors preserves open maps and open-map bisimulation. a central theorem



thanks are due to martin hyland. inspiration for this work came from his cambridge part iii lectures on category theory in the michaelmas term 1995, emphasising ends and coends. the results here have the aura of folklore about them, though we have not been able to find them stated in the literature. at the very least, we hope that our paper makes these results and their usefulness more widely known. the authors acknowledge their indebtedness to brics, aarhus where this work was started.
