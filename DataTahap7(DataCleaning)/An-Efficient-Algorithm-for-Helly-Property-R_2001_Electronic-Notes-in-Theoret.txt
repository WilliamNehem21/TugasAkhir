the helly property has developed into a very broad field since its introduction by c. berge. it is one of the most important concepts in hypergraph theory. it has been the focus of intense study for several years[14,17,20]. it provides a common property in several classes of these set systems, such as: balanced hypergraphs, unimodular hypergraphs, normal hypergraphs, arboreal hypergraphs...



more recently this property has proved its importance in image analysis[7,8]. helly property is a term that has arisen for the study of geometric properties of digital image. it generalizes the geometric notion of visibility. hence, in image processing this property can be interpreted as a local uniformity notion. in this article we are going to give some results about this property. we will deduce a polynomial algorithm to recognize if a linear hypergraph has(or not) the helly property.



one of the most widely known theorem of this type is due to edward helly. it is easy to verify that a particular case of the helly type theorem is the helly property. actually this property occurs in numerous mathematical fields. in arithmetics, the chinese remainder theorem amounts to say that arithmetical progressions have the helly property. another example of helly family are families of intervals in a lattice. a computational aspect of this property has been highlighted in discrete geometry and computational geometry. the helly property is a basic concept in hypergraph theory, because a lot of classes of hypergraph have this property.
