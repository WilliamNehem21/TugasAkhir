similarly to, our aim here is to use the duality of algebras and coalgebras to prove a dual of this theorem for coalgebras. as it turns out, the concept dual to implication is that of a modal rule. theorem 4.1 establishes that a class of coalgebras is rule-definable iff it is closed under images of morphisms and disjoint unions. theorem 5.2 applies this result to kripke frames: a class of kripke frames is definable by rules of infinitary modal logic iff it is closed under images of p-morphisms and disjoint unions.
