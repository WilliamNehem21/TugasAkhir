example 3.7 it is quite straightforward to check that the comonads uz= fzgz(induced by the adjunction fz e gz) and uz= fzgz(induced by the adjunction fz e gz) are kz-comonads, following the respective definitions of the functors and the co-multiplications explicitly given earlier in example 2.8(2) and(3).
