the main goal of the present work consists in providing a logical analysis of mixed assessments of probability and possibility, i.e. assessments of both measures over the same set of events. when can we say that a mixed assessment is coherent? in order to give an answer to this question, we will introduce the notion of internal and external coherence for mixed assessments. we will say that a mixed assessment is coherent iff it satisfies both the internal and the external coherence properties. roughly speaking, a mixed assessment is coherent iff each assessment is coherent per se(internal coherence) and moreover the assessments satisfy the law saying that if an event is probable, then it is possible too(external coherence).



in our future work we aim at extending this preliminary results so as to treat measures of conditional probability and possibility as well. indeed it is not difficult define a logic for conditional measures, and to prove a result similar to theorem 3.4. unfortunately we have not been able, so far, to prove that, also in that case, the test for mixed assessments is np-complete. on the other hand we know that testing assessments of conditional probability(see) and conditional possibility(see) is np-complete, still it seems quite problematic to prove a nice characterization for external coherence.
