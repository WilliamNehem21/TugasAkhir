in this paper, we completely answer this question by showing that there are five such classes and no others. each class corresponds to either a subgroup of a4, the alternating group on four letters, or to a subgroup of s3, the symmetric group on three letters. let us briefly explain why we find this to be a very surprising result. if we take the stance that classical and quantum channels are very different, then we would expect them to have only trivial structure in common. but the



similarly,(ei, b)= 0 for all i. so b= 0 and any affine homeomorphism of the unit ball onto itself will have to take the center to the center. however, this means any such qubit channel must be unital, and as shown by elementary means in, m must then be an orthogonal matrix with determinant+1, i.e., it must belong to so(3).
