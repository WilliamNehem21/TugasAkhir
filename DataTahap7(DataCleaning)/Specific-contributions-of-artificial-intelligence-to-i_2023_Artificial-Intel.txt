or active learning[27,28] can be applied that are capable of predicting molecular properties or new compounds on the basis of sparse data. transfer learning makes it possible to use data from related prediction tasks(targets) for modeling; active learning derives predictive models from minimal sets of informative training instances. in medicinal chemistry, these approaches are particularly relevant for addressing novel targets with interesting disease biology for which only limited compound information is available. all in all, there is much room for further computational developments with practical utility for medicinal chemistry.
