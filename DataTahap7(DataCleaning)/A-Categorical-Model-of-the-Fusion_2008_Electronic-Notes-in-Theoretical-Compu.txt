the characterization of bf-bisimulations provided by proposition 4.6 allows us to compare bf-bisimulations with the original notions of fusion bisimulation and hyperbisimulation of definition 2.2. the clauses in definition 2.2 about communication actions are covered by clauses(i),(ii) in proposition 4.6; the condition about bound actions in definition 2.2 is represented in clause(ii) by the fact that, after a bound transition, the resulting processes are bisimilar via a different relation, on a set of names where the fresh name has been allocated.
