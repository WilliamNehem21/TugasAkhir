ethiopia, the inability to exploit existing technologies for yield development results in low maize yield(asfaw et al., 2012; abate et al., 2019). low yield harvesting is results in food shortage caused by a lack of technological access have been reported in the country(bewket, 2007; dijk et al., 2020).



around the late 17th century, maize crops were introduced in ethiopia(huffnagel, 1961; abate et al., 2015). in ethiopia, maize is cultivated in highland, midland, and lowland agro-ecological zones(elias et al., 2013; tessema and simane, 2019; dendir and simane, 2019).



climate(rainfall and temperature), soil, land use, and elevation were included in prior studies. however, the land surface temperature(lst) was not considered in physical land suitability assessment in the previous research. thus, this research intended to incorporate the lst as a physical land suitability determining criterion.



the study area has a large variety of soil types. among the existing soil types, haplic alisols was the most dominat which covers an area of 4235.7 km2(61.0%) and the least dominated soil type was rhodic nitisol with an area of 518.6 km2(7.5%).



ethiopian national meteorological agency. we interpolated the climate data of four stations using inverse distance weighting(idw) techniques to obtain annual rainfall data for areas using stations in and around the study area. this annual rainfall was interpolated with a 30 m resolution and then extracted to the study area.



in the present study, the lst was retrieved from the thermal bands of the landsat oli/tirs of 2020(adeola et al., 2017). the mono window algorithm was applied to retrieve lst from the thermal bands of the oli/ tirs images. accordingly, lst was retrieved from landsat 8(oli/tirs) with thermal bands of band 10 used by mono-window algorithm following(guo et al., 2020; sekertekin and bonafoni, 2020). digital number(dn) was converted to the spectral radiance of thermal bands of landsat tirs(dener and alves, 2016; ziaul and pal, 2018).





soil data of the study area was obtained from the ministry of water and irrigation engineering and clipped to the study area. in addition, the soil data were converted to raster format by 30 m spatial resolution and reclassified according to a previous study debesa et al.(2020) for overlay analysis.
