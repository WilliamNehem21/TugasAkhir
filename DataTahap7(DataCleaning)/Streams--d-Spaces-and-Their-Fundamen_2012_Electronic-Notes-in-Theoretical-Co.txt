the notion of fundamental category arises from an adaptation of the usual notion of fundamental groupoid[3,15,23]. actually we can define the fundamental category of a(locally) partially ordered space[8,20], d-space or stream. in each case the construction follows the same pattern and leads to a van kampen like theorem[10,8]. we briefly recall their construction following a general setting inspired from. from this framework we give a common proof for the van kampen theorem



proof. the underlying hausdorff space of y as well as the continuous map q are given by the lemma 3.9 and the relation on y is the least closed reflexive relation on y that turns q into a morphism of w.



we conclude the section showing the notion pospace is rather rigid in regard of the fundamental category invariant. indeed there is a unique(up to isomorphism) pospace whose fundamental category is the standard poset 11[0, 1]. in opposition, there is at least two non isomorphic d-spaces whose fundamental category is the standard poset[0, 1], the topology and the collection of directed paths of a d-space being too loosely bound.



provides a counter-example. it is worth to notice this situation is not pathological since it is actually the kind of model obtained when a linear process(i.e. containing neither loop nor fork) spawns a new process which is reduced to a loop. in this case we should also have a directed segment whose end is glue to the vortex. the vortex thus corresponds to the state where the new process is created.
