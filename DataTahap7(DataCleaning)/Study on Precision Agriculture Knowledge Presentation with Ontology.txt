agriculture is a complex system science and the knowledge of it is consisting of much concepts and relationships. in order to find out the important domain knowledge from complex agriculture knowledge system, we need to concept modelling effectively, so as to better supporting distributed information retrieval, analogy inference and data mining based on knowledge system. as a kind of classical knowledge theory of the ontology, it can be used to solve the knowledge presentation problem.



attribute of ao is used to describe the concept of agriculture ontology; it has a function of limiting concept and examples. attribute of ao can be summarized from different knowledge as follows: first of all, the crop belong to plant, it inherits related properties of plant, such as genetic property class, shape and structure property class, distribution property class and so on; besides, the crop have their own property class, for example, the growth environment property class including weather and other growing conditions. each properties class including several properties, so they can form a full property description of the crop in a sense. in order to manage ontology expediently and reflect the hierarchy relationship among the properties, we describe the property and relationship as an ontology system and called it the crop property ontology. the



after building the agriculture ontology and the agriculture knowledge-base, there is a very important work we need to do, that is checking and reasoning on the knowledge. but it will be fantastic based on the existing ontology. so we should construct a consistency of axiom base.
