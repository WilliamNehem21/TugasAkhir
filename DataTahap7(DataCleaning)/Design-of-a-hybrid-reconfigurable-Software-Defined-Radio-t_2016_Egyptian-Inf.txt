the polymorphic instance uses pulse shaping samples per symbol which specifies the number of desired samples per symbol for the pulse-shaping filter. if the pulse-shaping filter is used for demodulation, this parameter value must match the samples per symbol element of the system parameters cluster passed to the demodulation vi. specify an even number greater than 2. matched samples per symbol, specify the number of desired samples per symbol for the demodulation matched filter. this parameter value must match the samples per symbol element of the system parameters cluster passed to the digital demodulation vi. specify an even number greater than 2. pulse shaping filter coefficients return an ordered array of filter coefficients corresponding to the desired filter response to the pulse-shaping filter used in modulation. the calculated filter coefficients are used during modulation to reduce the bandwidth of the transmitted signal and during demodulation to reduce inter symbol interference. the pulseshaping filter can be used either in transmission or for demodulation of fsk modulated signals. the matched filter is only used for demodulation. the vi calculates the impulse response of the filter using the following formulas:



with the help of labview an interactive software defined radio system has been built in a shorter time as compared to other text-based programming languages. with the help of this design we are able to see and prove that data errors can be minimized using coding techniques, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio(snr). also we can say by looking at the results that turbo coding gives a much improved and better minimization of the data errors than the convolution coding. in the end, we can say that the signal can be recovered with very less probability of error in turbo coding than in convolution coding with the increase in the m(number of levels) at the destination.
