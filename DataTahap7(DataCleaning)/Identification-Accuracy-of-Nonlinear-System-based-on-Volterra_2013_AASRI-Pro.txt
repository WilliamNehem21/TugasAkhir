new values of test signals amplitudes were defined and model were validated using the test object. excellent accuracy level for received model is achieved as in liner model so in nonlinear ones. given values are greatly raising the accuracy of identification compared to amplitudes and coefficients written in [12]. the accuracy of identification of nonlinear part of the test object growth almost 10 times and the standard deviation in best cases is no more than 5%.
