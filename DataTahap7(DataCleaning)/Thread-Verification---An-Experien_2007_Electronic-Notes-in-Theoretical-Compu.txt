even before the spin model for rwlock was completed, it was obvious that there were problems with the implementation. just the act of performing a verification review can be instructive! in the case of rdlock, a reader must wait(writer preference) if a writer is queued. at this point, the readers-queued count is incremented. however, it is never decremented!! this bug was acknowledged by red hat and fixed in the next release.
