several methods have been proposed to synchronize codeword frames without using syncwords. for example, a previous study proposed a method that is a variation of the brute-force approach. this method buffers two frame lengths of symbols and attempts decoding at each possible offset until an offset is determined for which decoding is successful. however, this method is computationally more complex and does not perform as well as frame synchronizers that utilize syncwords.



this study proposed to use as a syncword a permutation where the minimum hamming distance to all its circular shifts was the maximum. furthermore, a correlation processing of data fragments received from the communication channel was introduced to recognize a syncword. interleaving accumulated fragments accelerated the synchronization convergence. to evaluate the permutation-based frame synchronization method, a python software model was constructed.



occurrences. here, false synchronization probability increases with a higher probability p0 and with a lower accumulation factor l. in this case, the frame synchronization procedure should ensure that the probability of establishing false synchronism cannot exceed a given threshold for any arbitrarily high probability of a bit error.



rk. here, if synchronization is not established in this step, the receiver also accepts new fragments and writes them to a general buffer. then, the synchronization system again distributes the fragments randomly between the k sets of fragments. this approach to fragment processing is referred to as interleaving because the specified random distribution of fragments between k sets can be achieved by interleaving fragments in a common array in the buffer.



the paper has presented a permutation-based frame synchronization method for data communications with short packets. in this method, the binary representation of permutation used as a syncword must satisfy the a single condition, i.e., the minimum hamming distance to all its circular shifts is the maximum.
