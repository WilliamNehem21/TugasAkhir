we already mentioned related work above. the paper is organized as follows. after the preliminaries(section 2) we show in section 3 the results on htl with at least two variables and in section 4 the results on htl1. we conclude in section 5. due to lack of space we do not present all proofs in full detail. in particular, some correctness proofs for translations of formulas are missing. however, we always tried to design the translated formulas so that the correctness can be verified easily by the reader.
