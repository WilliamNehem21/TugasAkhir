differing from the conventional fatigue specimen with two tips gripped, one tip of the ultrasonic specimen is fixed with the amplifying horn and the other is free. the ultrasonic fatigue specimen must meet the condition of resonance with the experimental system.assuming the specimen axis is x axis, u(x, t) is the longitudinal displacement of the section of the specimen at the t time, we can derive the resonant length of an ultrasonic fatigue specimen as follows.



as the development of industrial technology, the design fatigue life of a lot of metal components is increasingly high. therefore, the high cycle fatigue behavior of metallic materials has become a research focus. utilizing ultrasonic fatigue testing technology, it became possible for the research of the high cycle fatigue behavior of metallic materials. there exist some problems to be solved in the high cycle fatigue tests. in despite of this, with these problems solved step by step and the establishment of very high cycle fatigue test standard in the near future, the ultrasonic fatigue testing technology will have broad application prospects.
