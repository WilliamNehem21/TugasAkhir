we think that these two problems are related to a substitution problem. in fact, when one conceives or maintains an application, needs appear. and to describe them, the designer or the maintainer can imagine ideal components. these are virtual components representing the best ones satisfying these specific needs. then the problem is to find the concrete components which are the closest to the ideal ones. in other words, trying to compose or maintain components means trying to substitute ideal components by concrete ones.



the remain of this paper will be organized as follows: in the next section we discuss about substitution in development and evolution processes. in section 3, we describe the generic component and quality models used in all our definitions. then, we define a component-oriented substitution model, including substitutability rules for every functional and non-functional element of our model(section 4). in section 5, we illustrate the possibilities of such a model by using a short application example. before concluding, we describe related work(section 6).



our goal is not to give yet another definition of what a component is, or what nonfunctional properties are. it is to define a component-oriented substitution that we can apply on many existing component and quality models. that is why we prefer to give generic models, on which we can apply our substitution concepts.



beside the component model, we define a generic quality model. its elements are quality characteristics(such as those from iso 9126), and metrics. we use existing metrics to evaluate and compare non-functional properties(see for a survey). but why metrics? in the literature, several methods for defining and evaluating non-functional properties already exist(see for a survey). but such methods usually focus on one specific property, or family of properties, for example quality of service, which is only a part of the whole software quality. metrics may be applied to many families of properties, and allow comparisons. this is why we think that in our case, metrics represent the best method for comparing different non-functional properties.



a component artifact is linked to a quality element using a non-functional properties(noted nfp). an artifact may be related to several quality elements, so several different nfps can belong to a same artifact. an nfp describes the effect of a quality characteristic on the artifact it belongs to, and uses the metric applied to the latter. several nfps of a same component artifact may share the same metric, but not the same characteristic.



for each ideal component, there is a maximal discrepancy for substitution, fixed by its designer. let us consider a component c1, a candidate for the substitution of another component c0. if the substitution discrepancy between c1 and c0 is bigger than the maximal discrepancy associated to c0, then c1 will be rejected.
