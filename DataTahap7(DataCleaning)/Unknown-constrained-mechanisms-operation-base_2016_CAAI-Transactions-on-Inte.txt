the application field of the assistive robot is getting increasingly wide, and the interactions between assistive robot manipulators and the environment, such as opening the door, pulling a drawer, serving the tea, is becoming more and more closely[1e3]. there are various constrained mechanisms in the interactive environment. in the situations where task descriptions of each constrained mechanism are not necessary, manipulators need a way to operate the unknown constrained mechanisms.



the operation of unknown constrained mechanisms is very complicated. for instance, opening the door, which involves a series of problems such as positioning, trajectory planning, and tracking, is a typical problem of the unknown constrained mechanism operation. most of the traditional opening-door operation needs to model the door first to plan a trajectory, which does not provide the universal solution because different tasks need different task descriptions. for example, nagatani modeled the door and presented a detailed analysis of the path planning to open the door[4,5]; peterson used the smallestmodel analysis to predict the parameters but the success rate of opening the door is 90%; pujas proposed a force-position hybrid control method, but the inaccurate task description model might result in positioning errors; petrovskaya adopted the laser-scanning modeling based particle filter method which also suffered from the defects of inaccuracy. there are also model-free methods. schmid installed multipoint haptic sensors on the hand claw and force/torque sensors on the wrist to open the door operation, but this kind of method increased the complexity of the controller; lutscher proposed to operate the unknown constrained mechanisms based on that online chooses traction axis and estimates constraint coordinate system. besides, the operating space is not limited by the two-dimensional plane. however, because the threshold of the traction axis selection is fixed, this method cannot manipulate constrained mechanisms with different resistance.



five experiments have been conducted in this paper. a traditional impedance control method is adopted in experiment i. experiment ii, iii, iv and v are based on the dynamic interactive control method proposed in this paper. a dynamic velocity method is involved in experiment iii, iv and



assume the motion speed of the arm during door opening is not big. the effects of m and d in the impedance control are ignored and only k item is considered, whose diagonal elements are set to 4.0 n/mm. the effects of mrot in attitude impedance control is also negligible. the attitude of the doorknob need by followed by the end-effector of the arm real-time, krot is set to zero. only the item drot is left, all the diagonal elements are set as 1.9 nms/rad.
