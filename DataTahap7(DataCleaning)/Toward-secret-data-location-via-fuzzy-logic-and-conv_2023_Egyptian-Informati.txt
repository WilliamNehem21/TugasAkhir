steganography is a subdomain of the information security domain which mainly works on ensuring the covert transmission of secret messages using multimedia content as carriers. generally, a steganographic technique adopts data-hiding methods to conceal the confidential data in the spatial content of an original digital medium, such as an image referred to as a cover to result in a transformed image, also referred to as a stego[2,7,8,30]. the recent two decades marked a significant advancement of steganography in digital images where various schemes have been proposed for content-adaptive paradigms[3,11,19]. the adaptive steganographic models mainly consider confidential data as a fidelity constraint for the source coding practice rather than considering the carrier media. a reverse scheme to steganography has also been



based on the high imperceptibility of a stego image, which is a challenge to detect its nature, it is impossible to distinguish with a human eye between the cover and stego image; hence the main task of a steganalyst is to identify a cover from a stego image. steganalysis is mainly classified into three categories based on the output of the process. a steganalysis process that outputs image classification(as cover or stego) is known as detective steganalysis or binary classification; a steganalysis scheme that targets to provide the locations of the hidden data is known as locative steganalysis; a steganalysis scheme that aims to predict the payload size is also known as quantitative steganalysis; and a steganalysis process that aims to extract the secret bits of the confidential message is called forensic steganalysis. in the existing works on steganalysis, several researchers focused on the binary classification of inquiry images into cover or stego[6,33,47], and some others focused on locative steganalysis but mainly working with lsb replacement and lsb matching[36,42] due to the possibility of discovering the impurities with these types of steganography. based on the use of rich models(rm), and ensemble classifiers(ec), most of the state-of-the-art[39,44,45] showed a significant performance in classifying images into cover and stego and relying on the deep learning paradigm, the steganalysis of digital images knew a gradual widespread[6,35,47].

liu et al.(2015) introduced a steganalysis scheme to locate concealed information using steganography in the spatial domain. the method involves the retrieval of most cover pixels through recompression, then analyzing the differences in pixel distribution between the cover and stego images. this scheme finally employs the hypothesis testing theory to prove the correctness of locating the embedding positions. inspired by liu et al.(2015), hu et al.



the introduction of fuzzy logic, a machine learning and mathematical model, have been significant enlightenment to several computer science applications such as metaheuristic algorithms[15,25,37]; self-controlling application[1,9,12], autonomous solutions generation[28,10,34]. benefiting from fuzzy reasoning, liu et al. departed from to propose a new method to locate flipped bits resulting from modern adaptive steganography in the spatial domain. this method computes the modification maps between the cover and stego images and extends them to identify the locations of steganographically modified pixels. the proposed method showed better performance with an average of 90% accuracy in determining the location of the modern adaptive steganography but needs to locate the non-adaptive steganography. failure to accurately change the pixels in non-adaptive steganography because the pixels modification is generally spread randomly to all the inquiry image pixels differs from the pixel modification in adaptive steganography, which targets the same locations.



sive data embedments, checking whether a re-embedding selects the same pixels again. we depart from a property that the cost matrix does not change between the first and second stego images. the following stages define our stages to obtain the modified maps.



in most payload location cnn, two challenges can happen. the first is that with a large convolutional kernel size, information may be redundant because of connecting many pixels, including some irrelevant pixels. the second is that a small kernel may also lose some vital information.



our algorithm is designed to locate the pixels that likely hold the secret data added by adaptive steganography in the spatial domain. we have drawn inspiration from prior algorithms, and our algorithm performs best when the stego is confirmed. our algorithm is designed for two scenarios.



proposed by liu et al., to quantitatively estimate the steganographic payload. to show the performance of our model in locating unknown steganographic payload, we present the receiver operating characteristic curve(roc curve) of our model, which is a graphical illustration of the performance of our strategy to show the location of the steganographic payload. in our method, the roc curve shows a graph of the true positive rate over the false positive rate for various decision thresholds. our roc curve plots the true positive rate(tpr) on the y-axis over the false positive rate(fpr) on the x-axis, with the classification threshold variation along the graph.

in this study, the proposed steganalysis scheme involves using image modification maps generated by an adaptive steganographic method to create fuzzy correlation maps that can be used to locate modified pixels in an image. the study uses stc to generate modification maps by re-embedding a random message, and those maps are crucial features to obtain the best fuzzy correlation maps of an image. the experimental results show outperformance over the recently proposed algorithms for two considered scenarios(payload location with known payload and payload location with unknown payload). our strategy has proved effective for detecting hidden bits produced by adaptive steganography in the spatial domain. the implications of this study are that it offers a potential solution for detecting adaptive steganography, which can be particularly challenging due to its difficult ability to modify image pixels. this method can help improve the accuracy of steganalysis by using modification maps and fuzzy correlation maps to locate the modified pixels. however, the dependency of the effectiveness on the quality of the modification map generated by the steganographic method may be a limitation to our strategy because the performance can be affected by the types of accuracy in modification map generation.
