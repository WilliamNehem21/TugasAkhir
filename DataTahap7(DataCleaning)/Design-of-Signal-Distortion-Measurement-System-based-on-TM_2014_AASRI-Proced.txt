compared to calculate the real fft directly, rfft optimization algorithms reduce nearly half amount of the computation, while saving memory space. obviously, rfft optimization algorithm is a method of saving computation, speed nearly doubled. it is the core algorithms of our design.



it is 12 bit that the adc integrated inside dsp, but the actual sampling number is less than 10,the sampling precision is very low. to obtain a higher sampling precision, we need to separate the digital power design and analog power design. to avoid the digital signal line we connected the adcinxx pin, and we use external reference.



use the method of signal distortion measurement which proposed in this paper, design and develop the signal distortion measurement system with optimized fft algorithm, the results show that by field test, this method is a feasible one for measuring. to some extent, it is achieved remarkable results on the inhibition of the spectrum leakage phenomenon, and improved the accuracy of measurement. at the same time, the signal distortion measuring instrument which use the proposed method has the advantages like easy to make, low cost and easy to carry, solve the inconvenience status of field test in engineering applications. this method has a good practical application prospects.
