in which procedures can be stored in state variables and passed as arguments, and he showed that extensions for adjoint simulations exist for this language. but, because procedures are allowed to have global variables as well as parameters, the connection with exponents is somewhat indirect, and categorical aspects are suppressed in the cited work. only later was the connection with lambda calculus presented explicitly.
