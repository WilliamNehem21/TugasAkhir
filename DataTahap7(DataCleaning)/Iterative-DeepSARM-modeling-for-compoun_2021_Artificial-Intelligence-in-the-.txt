to our knowledge, there currently is only one method available that combines the systematic assessment of structural relationships between active compounds with sar visualization and prospective compound design, i.e., the sar matrix (sarm) approach [11]. sarm analysis sug- gests new analogues by systematically comparing core structures and substituents in related analogue series (ass) and identifying unexplored core-substituent combinations across these series. the compound design component of sarm has been extended through deep generative mod- eling, leading to deepsarm [12], which utilizes additional information from selected targets and associated compound data sets to further ex- pand the design space.



herein, we report the extension of deepsarm for iterative compound optimization. in the following, we first introduce the sarm/deepsarm framework and then detail the iterative deepsarm (ideepsarm) approach. an exemplary compound design application is presented to illustrate methodological characteristics of ideepsarm and its design capabilities.



deepsarm was based on the idea to further expand analogue design by taking information from compounds with activity against different targets into account that are related to the primary target of interest [12]. for example, a deepsarm model can initially be trained with compounds active against the target family to which the target of inter- est belongs, followed by fine-tuning of the model for the primary target. this procedure increases the close-in analogue design capacity of the sarm approach. sarms resulting from original two-step fragmentation can then be further expanded with novel key and value fragments and additional sarms entirely consisting of novel fragments and compounds can be obtained.



2 (i.e., the key 2 generator) is trained using input key 2 / output key 2 pairs, the model for value 2 using key 2 / value 2 pairs, and the model for value 1 using key 1 / value 1 pairs. compounds with newly generated key fragments are added to an original sarm containing structurally analogous keys (meeting the step-2 fragmentation criterion) and hence further expand the sarm.

each scaffold represents an mms. value 1 and value 2 fragments serve as r-groups for two different substitution sites. newly generated value 1 and 2 fragments are filtered for structural alerts (smarts of in-house collections of chemically undesired substructures) and accepted frag- ments are used to construct a sarm variant with pre-defined dimen- sionality for each key 2. this sarm variant consists of value 1 / value 2 combinations from which corresponding compounds (key 2 / value 1 value 1 and 2 fragments obtained during iterative fine-tuning. results are shown for five iterations (i = 1, 2, 3, 6, 10) color-coded by compound activity.
