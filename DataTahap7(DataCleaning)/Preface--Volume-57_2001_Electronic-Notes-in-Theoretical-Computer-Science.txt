the motivation to organize this forum stems from the fact that reduction strategies in rewriting and programming have attracted an increasing attention within the last years. new types of reduction strategies have been invented and investigated, and new results on rewriting/computation under particular strategies have been obtained. research in this field ranges from primarily theoretical questions about reduction strategies to very practical application and implementation issues. the need for a deeper understanding of reduction strategies in rewriting and programming, both in theory and practice, is obvious, since they bridge the gap between unrestricted general rewriting(computation) and(more deterministic) rewriting with particular strategies(programming). moreover, reduction strategies provide a natural way to go from operational principles(e.g., graph and term rewriting, narrowing, lambda-calculus)and semantics(e.g., normalization, computation of values, infinitary normalization, head-normalization) to implementations of programming languages.
