balbiani et al. then explored arbitrary public announcement logic, an extension of public announcement logic which provides an operator for quantifying over arbitrary public announcements. van ditmarsch and french later proved that arbitrary public announcement logic was undecidable in the multi-agent setting, and so similar logics for action models may also be undecidable.
