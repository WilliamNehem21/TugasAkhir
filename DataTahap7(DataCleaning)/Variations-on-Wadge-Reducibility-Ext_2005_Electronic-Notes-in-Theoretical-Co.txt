we will try to understand which properties(or their weaker versions) of the classical wadge reducibility hold true in the other spaces. e.g., we discuss when some substructures of the wadge ordering are almost well ordered, which sets have a supremum(or a weak version of supremum) under wadge reducibility, and consider relationship of the wadge reducibility to hierarchies from(see also earlier relevant papers[18,19,11,12]).



another possible topic is the study of effective versions of the wadge reducibility. in fact, this direction started already in the papers[9,10] which contain effective versions of some results of this paper. in a general realizability framework for the(joint) investigation of effective and non-effective topology was suggested. this framework might turn to be of use also in the developement of our topic.
