the internet of things(iot) is widely used owing to the development of the internet and computer technology[1,2]. this technology provides a variety of services that modern people have never experienced before. the iot is a technology in which all objects connected to the internet communicate and provide various services to users. these technologies have availed various services in special environments, such as on roads where vehicles are rare. in other words, existing schemes that focus on a single attack, such as vecure or cusum, can detect a single attack perfectly, but have problems detecting a complex attack. if these attacks are not detected, autonomous vehicle normal destination arrival times can be delayed because the vehicles create and drive incorrect driving plans, resulting in lost time.



the name set of the subcomponents, and{md} is the set of subcomponents. eic, eoc, and ic refer to the set of external input couplings, external output couplings, and internal couplings, respectively. select is a tie-breaking function that describes which model to select when a plurality of the constituent models have an internal state transition scheduled at the same time.



the iov provides convenience to drivers; however, because it uses wireless communication, a malicious attacker can break into the vehicle network and attempt an attack that causes a traffic accident. to cause a traffic accident, the attacker manipulates the traffic information or attempts an attack that prevents data from being transmitted to the vehicle. to detect these attacks, security schemes such as vecure, cusum and secure and efficient ad hoc distance vectors(sead) have been proposed. however, because these schemes specialize in detecting a single attack, it is impossible to detect complex attacks that occur simultaneously. autonomous vehicles must detect attacks because accidents can occur if complex attacks are not detected.



center without processing. the transmitted information includes the trajectory for vehicle driving or rsu access records. the control center classifies and stores the data received from the rsu by domain. in the proposed scheme, the collected trajectory information is used as an important factor in detecting complex attacks. complex attacks can occur in various forms and are difficult to detect because they occur simultaneously and interfere with the attack-detection process. for example, attackers can compromise



attackers compromise autonomous vehicles and rsus before attempting complex attacks. because the rsu is installed outside, it can easily be compromised by an attacker[40,41]. thereafter, the attacker attempts a sybil attack using a compromised autonomous vehicle to create a traffic jam. these attacks can be



the proposed scheme is largely composed of a road model and a cloud computing model. the road model consists of driving-related models, including autonomous vehicles. the cloud computing model collects all road situation information based on the control center and instructs the autonomous vehicle to take appropriate actions when an attack is attempted.



the broker model classifies the collected information and delivers it to the model, and the monitoring system model stores the autonomous vehicle trajectory information and the road infrastructure classified in the broker model. finally, the security system model analyzes the attack situation when an autonomous vehicle behaves abnormally and detects an attack using an existing scheme or history trajectory. algorithm 1 shows the process of storing real-time traffic information in the history trajectory.



the proposed scheme was modeled using the devs-objc program, based on devs formalism, and simulated using a model that reflects the real world. in an experimental environment to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the road distance for vehicles to travel was 6 km, and rsus were deployed every 2 km and communicated with autonomous vehicles. in addition, four vehicles were designed, and the vehicles departed consecutively at 0 km intervals. attacks in the experimental environment were attempted through the rsu_b model, and the type of attack, whether blackhole, flooding, replay, spoofing, fdi, or sybil, was determined through the gner model. a complex attack was simulated by simultaneously generating two attacks. in the experiment, only complex attacks that combined sybil and fdi or replay and blackhole attacks occurred. the pedestrian model randomly changed its location, and the tl model was changed in the order of green, yellow, and red at a 6:1:3 time ratio. a speed limit sign was placed between 1500 m and 2500 m, and the speed was constrained below 60 km in this section. the existing detection scheme focusing on a single attack for performance evaluation comparison with the proposed scheme modeled the cusum detection algorithm to detect attacks attempted in v2x communication, and modeled the detection algorithm of vecure to detect attacks attempted in the can bus.



the main purpose of the proposed scheme is to prevent accidents by detecting complex attacks that occur in the iov. it also reduces the network overhead by detecting and responding to attacks. the proposed scheme utilizes a history trajectory to detect complex attacks that existing schemes have not detected, thereby improving security. in addition, by reducing network overhead, packet drops due to network overload can be minimized, and traffic information can be collected in real-time. in addition, the complex attack detection scheme using the history trajectory in the iov is expected to detect complex attacks that are more complex than the attack situation presented in this paper, if a significant amount of security knowledge is accumulated.



the iov collects information in real-time to plan an optimal route and communicate with road infrastructure or other autonomous vehicles to prevent accidents due to situations of which drivers are unaware, such as blind spots. most attacks that occur in the iov are detected through existing security schemes, but these schemes do not consider complex attacks. if damage from an attack accumulates, autonomous vehicles cannot drive normally, which can lead to traffic accidents. to reduce such damage, the proposed scheme uses history trajectories to detect complex attacks that cannot be detected by existing schemes. the proposed scheme can use trajectory analysis of objects to identify a damage situation in which normal packets cannot be delivered to the control center and thus detect a complex attack. the proposed scheme prevents traffic accidents by detecting complex attacks and allows realtime traffic information to be collected by reducing network overhead. however, the proposed scheme has difficulty managing a large amount of security knowledge, and as security knowledge increases, the detection time is delayed because various situations need to be identified.



to solve these problems, future research will study a temporal logic, rule-based security system that is applicable to the iov. because bm-devs expresses security knowledge using temporal logic rules, it can easily express knowledge, and can cope with various attack situations by easily adjusting security knowledge. in addition, because the proposed scheme focuses on detecting complex attacks, it is necessary to take appropriate measures after the attack has been detected. future research plans include additional investigations to prevent further incidents by using rg-devs to detect attacks and respond effectively.
