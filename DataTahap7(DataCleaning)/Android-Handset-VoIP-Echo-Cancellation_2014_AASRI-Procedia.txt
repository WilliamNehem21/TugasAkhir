in this study, attempts were made to use a traditional 2g/3g circuit switch (cs) session. the echo was not present and the voice quality was excellent. hence, whether the echo canceller was implemented in the hardware or the chip had to be determined by reading the android source code and retrieving the segment of code for the cs session. the segment of code was then used to simulate the echo function in the hardware.



this indi ates that a remote user is speaking. a person who is speaking they does not hear the voice of the listener. this is a real situation in human communication. one speaks while the other listens. based on this characteristic, the echo suppressor is enabled in this situation.
