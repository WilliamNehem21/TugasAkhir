thus our main contribution(in sec. 3) is to give an axiomatic account of stationary behaviour and convergence to it, one which extends and simplifies the classical notion. not only is our notion of generalised convergence applicable to all markov processes(rather than only to some special cases) but it completes the theory linking stationary behaviour to average long-term behaviour. the details are set out in sec. 5.
