to the high speed. note that this relation indicates the possibility of reaching a high speed if the corresponding classes have been marked in the m-ct(necessary condition). the question of whether the high speed is actually reached, depends on the dynamic aspect of the test scenario, i.e. the initial test step and the duration of the test step or test steps running with the above values(sufficient condition).
