we see at once that the identity functions are r-continuous(r-monotone) and the composition of r-continuous(r-monotone) functions is an rcontinuous(r-monotone) function. the category crpos has r-complete r-posets as objects and r-continuous functions as morphisms. the category crposr has r-complete r-posets that r-limits preserve pre-orders in r as objects and r-continuous functions as morphisms.
