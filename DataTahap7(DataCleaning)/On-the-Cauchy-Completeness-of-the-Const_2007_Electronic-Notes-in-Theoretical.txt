regarding the methodology, counter-examples are constructed in each case. these examples could be presented as either topological or kripke models. while certain relations among topological and kripke models are known, it is not clear to the author that the natural models in the cases before us are really the same. while the family resemblance is unmistakable(compare the definition of jmax, there is an open k containing sup j0 such that r is bounded by sup k. as r is bounded below by sup j0, r(again, rng(r\q0)) is contained within k. as(q0, k) h f(n)= m, r|= f(n)= m.
