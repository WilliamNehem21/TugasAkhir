this research paper is carried out as an extension to the previous studies to analyze the petrophysical characteristics of hawaz formation in h oil field, but here it will be focusing mainly on the quick look analysis of log curves and plotting crossplots between the petrophysical parameters and then compare the results with core data. the following data have been taken to achieve the objectives of this research: the geological data are represented by composite logs. the well logging data comprise resistivity, sonic, neutron, density, spontaneous potential, caliper, gamma ray and natural gamma ray spectrometry logs. these data have been taken from repsol oil



the petroleum system is represented in h field by structural hawaz paleo-high created during the post-hawaz erosional event. the main regional seal is the silurian tanezzuft shale formation. the basal tanezzuft hot shale member acts also as the main source rock in the area of study. the hawaz formation of middle ordovician age represents the main reservoir. this formation is informally subdivided into 8 horizons, named h1 to h8. some units have been subdivided into sub-units. each horizon is characterized by its own petrophysical parameters.
