an efficient vehicle detection method is a necessity for the intelligent transportation system under the complicated traffic environment at present. to solve the problems of large computation and the poor real-time in traditional vehicle detecting methods, this article proposes a real-time vehicle detecting algorithm integrated compressive sensing (cs) theories and background subtraction method. in addition, this paper undertakes the reconstruction of foreground image of vehicle based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (omp) algorithm. proved by the experimental result, the proposed vehicle detection algorithm could produce higher precision detection, smaller calculation and higher-quality reconstructed image compared to the traditional ones.



applying the background subtraction method based on cs, in this paper, the measurements of the video is firstly obtained through the compressive sample operated on the input video images. and then, the measurements of the background image will be achieved from the estimation of the former measurements. besides, the background image needs real-time update considered about the changes in external environment. when conducting the background subtraction, the differential threshold operation should be undertaken on the measurements of background model and measurements of the real-time video frame image to determine whether there existed moving vehicle in the frame image. if there is no existence, drop the image. otherwise, reconstruct the target vehicle image through the omp image reconstruction algorithm in ref. [14].
