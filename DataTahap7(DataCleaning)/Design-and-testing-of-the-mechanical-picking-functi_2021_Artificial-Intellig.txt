the gear train is installed on the support frame, and the transmission ratio is 1:2. one end of the manipulator reciprocating mechanism is connected to the manipulator, and the other end is connected to the gear train and the output shaft of the transmission case. when the manipulator picks up the plug seedlings, the transmission case drives the crank to rotate, so that the manipulator picks up and discharges the plug seedlings back and forth.



transplanting. each time 128 plants were transplanted in a single row, the first 8 plants were removed, and the next 120 were continuously tested. the number of missed, replanted, lodging, exposed, buried, and injured seedlings were then counted, and the main performance indices were calculated, such as the coefficient of variation(cv) of the plant spacing, missing transplanting rate, qualified rate of planting perpendicularity, and qualified rate of planting.
