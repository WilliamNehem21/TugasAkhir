the concrete semantics of a program yields possibly infinite computations, hence answering any non trivial questions may be infeasible. a simpler, yet not fully precise, model can be employed to reason about program properties. abstract interpretation is a widely used technique that simplifies the process of computation so that its vital properties can be captured within finite resources(time, space etc.) of a computing machine. this technique has been successfully applied in various fields, including program verification, error discovery and debugging, specification



section 2 describes the representation of elements of the abstract domain and defines the join and meet operators and introduces a lattice structure using these operators. section 3 presents an algorithm for checking satisfiability and computing a normal form of a given element of our domain. in section 4 we provide a widening operator. the transfer function for the domain is discussed in section 5. we conclude in section 6.
