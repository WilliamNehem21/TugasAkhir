sobriety is between t0 and t2 in topological spaces, and being t1 and being sober are incomparable properties. sober spaces have wonderful properties and play important roles in domain theory(see, e.g.,[1,3,6,8,9,10,11]). for instance, a sober space is a directed complete poset(dcpo, for short) with respect to its specialization order, two sober spaces are homeomorphic iff their lattices of open subsets are order isomorphic, and the celebrated hofmann-mislove theorem shows that there is an order isomorphism between the poset of compact saturated subsets and the poset of scott open filters of open subsets in a sober space. there are many generalizations of sober spaces. in, the authors introduced the weaker notion of sobriety, which is called bounded sobriety, and proved that the subcategory of bounded sober spaces is reflective in the category of t0 spaces. d. zhao and w. k. ho generalized



note that countably irreducible closed sets are irreducible closed, sober spaces are countably sober spaces. if a space x has only finite closed subsets(especially, x is finite), then irreducible closed sets are countably irreducibly irreducible. then x is sober if x is countably sober.
