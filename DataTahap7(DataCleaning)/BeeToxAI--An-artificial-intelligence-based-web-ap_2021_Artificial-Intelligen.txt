provides both a short and long-term strategy to assess the risks posed against honey bees by pesticides. these animals can be exposed to pesticide residues by indirect contact on plant surfaces, via oral intake with contaminated water or food, or by direct contact during their application in standard farming practice. if the proposed use pattern of a pesticide indicates a possible exposure of honey bees, acute contact and oral toxicity studies are necessary for pesticide registration.





classificatory qsar models:(i) if duplicates presented discordance in toxicological outcomes(e.g., toxic vs nontoxic), both entries would be excluded; and(ii) if the reported outcomes of the duplicates were the same, one entry would be retained in the dataset and the other excluded. after duplicate removal, the contact exposure dataset had 382 compounds(toxic: 112, nontoxic: 269), while the oral exposure dataset had 169 compounds(toxic: 71, nontoxic: 98).



qsar models were developed using the support vector machine(svm) and random forest(rf) algorithms implemented in scikit-learn v.0.24.2. since the performance of ml is closely related to its hyperparameters, the models were optimized using a bayesian approach implemented in scikit-optimize v.0.7.4. details of hyperparameters explored in this work are available in the supporting information. the bayesian optimization may be defined as follows: sualize the fragments and atoms contributing to acute contact and oral toxicities. here, the"weight" of an atom was considered as a predictedprobability difference(classification models) or pld50 difference(regression models) obtained when the bits in the fingerprint corresponding to the atom are removed. then, the normalized weights were used to color the atoms in a topography-like map in which green indicating negative contribution for toxicity(i.e., predicted probability or pld50 increases when the bits are removed), and red indicating a positive contribution for toxicity(i.e., predicted probability or pld50 decreases when the bits are removed).



on the other hand, for the datasets to develop regression models, after data curation and duplicate removal, the contact exposure dataset had 218 compounds while the oral exposure dataset had 142 compounds. after splitting the datasets into modeling(80%) and external(20%) sets, 174 compounds of the contact dataset were used for the model development and 44 compounds were used to validate the models. in the same manner, 114 compounds of the oral dataset were used for model development and 28 compounds were used to validate the models.



mcc= 0.78) showed higher performance compared with those generated by como et al.(acc= 0.84, mcc= 0.67), venko et al.(acc= 0.77, mcc= 0.48), wang et al.(acc= 0.83, mcc= 0.59) parisons should not be interpreted rigorously, as different compositions and sizes of the training and test sets were used to build models. in addition, carnesecchi et al.. developed externally predictive qsar models to assess the acute contact toxicity of mixtures to honey bees



also showed predicted probability values, which are useful for estimating the confidence of classification outcomes. when a compound is classified as toxic by acute contact or oral toxicity classification model, then the prediction by the respective regression model is activated and the predicted ld50 is displayed on the screen. all predictions are followed by the ad estimates and mechanistic interpretation using colorcoded maps of fragment contribution[72,73]. for the maps, atoms or fragments promoting positive toxicity contributions are highlighted in red, while structural moieties decreasing the toxicity are highlighted in green. also, the predicted pld50 is shown on the respective contribution map.
