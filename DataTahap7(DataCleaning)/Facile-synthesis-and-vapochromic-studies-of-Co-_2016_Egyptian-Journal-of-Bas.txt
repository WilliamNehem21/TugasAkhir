isonicotinic acid(0.246 g, 2 mmol) and cobalt acetate tetrahydrate(0.332 g, 1 mmol) were weighed into an agate mortar and ground together continuously for 15 minutes. the light pink powder obtained was washed with methanol to remove any starting material, dried at room temperature and 37.21. quantitative estimation of xrpd patterns of 1 and malonic acid revealed appearance of new peaks in 1 that are absent in the malonic acid ligand indicating formation of a new phase. this suggests a complexation of malonic and cobalt acetate. similarly, xrpd patterns of 2 were different from the diffraction patterns of the isonicotinic acid ligand. the peaks observed for the isonicotinic acid ligand are situated at
