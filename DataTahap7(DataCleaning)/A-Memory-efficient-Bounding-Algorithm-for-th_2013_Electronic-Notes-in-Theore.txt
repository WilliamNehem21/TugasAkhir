the terminal-pair reliability problem has been extensively studied since the 1960s. it determines the reliability of a binary-state system whose redundancy structure is modelled by a combinatorial graph. the edges correspond to the system components and can be in either of two states: failed or working, whereas the nodes are assumed to be perfect interconnection points. though all components fail statistically independent, the problem was shown to be np-complete. many algorithms have been developed over time. they can be categorized into the following classes:



in this part we describe the whole modified algorithm which generates an output file fnext by taking an input file fprev at each recursion level. after initializing the input graph, the files and all appropriate maps in procedure 1, procedure 2 is invoked for processing the initial graph. there we first check the connectivity of the graph. if the graph is connected, we look for possible reductions in line 12. the changed probabilities due to reductions are updated in epm at line 13. additionally, the performed graph manipulations caused by reductions are captured in a string as described above and again this string is contributed to line(line 14). furthermore, line is enriched with the respective subproblems according to the shortest path sp. finally, line is written to fnext.
