in the rest of this paper, we first provide the formal definition of an untyped version of the calculus(section 2), followed by some examples showing its expressive power(section 3). we then define a typed version of the calculus(section 4), for which we state a soundness result. we show typing examples in section 5, and finally in the conclusion we discuss related and future work.



// all instances of checkedmixin will have sqrt as prototype chk_sqrt= new checkedmixin(" sqrt"," check_arg"," checked_sqrt") chk_sqrt. sqrt(-4)// evaluates to nan chk_sqrt. checked_sqrt(4)// evaluates to 2 chk_sqrt. checked_sqrt(-4)// throws" illegal argument"
