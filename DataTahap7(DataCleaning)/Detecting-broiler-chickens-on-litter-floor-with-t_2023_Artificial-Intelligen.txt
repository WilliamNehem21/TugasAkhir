poultry provides a valuable source of proteins but face a number of challenges worldwide. among the many challenges is the welfare concerns of the birds under intensive management systems. due to the large number of chickens reared at any given time in a house, accurate and efficient monitoring of birds can improve their health and welfare status. currently, most broiler houses are monitored manually, however, this approach could be both laborious and erroneous. automatic broiler monitoring system could collect individual bird data within a flock and provide critical information to aid digital management.



deep learning technology has powerful feature representation capabilities, fast processing speed, and can resolve problems associated with external interferences. thus, deep learning algorithms are appropriate models for developing an automatic, efficient and intelligent tool for animal farming. deep learning technologies have been applied to the study of large animals(pigs, sheep, cattle), such as object



in the current study, we incorporated a convolutional block attention module(cbam) into yolov5 to enhance the algorithm's ability to extract image features. to do this, we used a complex dataset of broiler images(e.g., birds at different ages, fresh and reused litter and multiple pens) to train and test the model. the proposed yolov5cbam improved the acquisition ability of small object features and the accuracy of small target detection.



jocher et al.(2020) developed the yolov5 algorithm and demonstrated that it was more accurate and faster compared to the previous yolo model. the yolov5s network consists of three parts: backbone, neck, and prediction. broiler chicken images were used as input for the backbone to obtain image features, the neck part was used to integrate the extracted feature information and generate feature maps, and the prediction part was used to generate bounding boxes and predict categories for the generated feature maps. the detailed process is provided as a supplementary material.



in the target detection task of broiler chickens at different growth stages and in different scenes, occlusion or small targets occupy fewer pixels, and their feature information is easily lost in the deep network, which leads to missed and false detection of targets. the cbam module can effectively increase the weight of the occlusion or small targets in the entire feature map through channel and spatial attention modules, making the information easier to be learned by the network. the broiler image features extracted from the c3 module were denoted as f, and the channel attention map was generated by where, tp, fp and fn are the numbers of true positive samples, false positive samples and false negative samples, respectively. the map is the mean of all classified ap(average precision). n represents the number of object categories(n= 1). fps refers to the number of images identified within 1 s.



yolov5-cbam-broiler model. the proposed approach integrates cbam into yolov5 and improved the overall detection performance, especially in the case of small targets or occlusions. in addition, the results show that yolov5-cbam could detect broilers of different ages effectively and provides the basis for real-time target detection for intelligent poultry management.
