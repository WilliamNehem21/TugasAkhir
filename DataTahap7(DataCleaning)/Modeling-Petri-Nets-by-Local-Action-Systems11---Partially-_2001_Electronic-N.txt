with this encoding two productions can be applied concurrently only if they do not rewrite the same node, i.e. only if the places of the transitions they model do not overlap. hence the places of the marked net can be seen as resources that can be accessed only by one transition at a time. this situation also occurs with elementary nets and hence contact-free elementary nets can be modeled in this way.
