the first problem arises from the notion of applicative bisimulation, introduced in in the untyped setting and later studied in the typed setting. applicative bisimilarity was shown to be a congruence by an ingenious method. this method works in both the deterministic and the erratically nondeterministic setting, but as explained in, it does not work in the presence of amb. so it has remained open whether applicative bisimilarity, in the presence of amb, is a congruence.
