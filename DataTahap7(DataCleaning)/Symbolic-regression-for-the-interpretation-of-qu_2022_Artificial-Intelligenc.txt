symbolic regression(sr) searches for the mathematical expressions that explain a training dataset. roughly speaking, an sr expression consists of a combination of arithmetic operators or mathematical functions and terminals(variables and numerical constants). sr expressions do not rely on a fixed functional form, unlike the engineered features of mlr(multiplication/division). thus, sr has the potential to represent nonlinear qsars/qsprs as explicit expressions without any prior knowledge regarding the functional form of the expression. because the search space of expressions is generally vast, and expressions can be nat-



this expression contains two arccos functions and two arctan functions. the number of aliphatic heterocycles(nalihc) appears in several terms. even the simplest expression is hard to interpret through a visual inspection, notwithstanding that it completely fails to explain the training data. for the most complex expression, the r2 value for the training data set was 0.98, suggesting a good fit to the training data.
