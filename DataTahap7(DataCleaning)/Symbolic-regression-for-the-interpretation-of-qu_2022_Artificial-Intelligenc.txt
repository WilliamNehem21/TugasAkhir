symbolic regression (sr) searches for the mathematical expressions that explain a training dataset. roughly speaking, an sr expression con- sists of a combination of arithmetic operators or mathematical func- tions and terminals (variables and numerical constants). sr expressions do not rely on a fixed functional form, unlike the engineered features of mlr (multiplication/division). thus, sr has the potential to repre- sent nonlinear qsars/qsprs as explicit expressions without any prior knowledge regarding the functional form of the expression. because the search space of expressions is generally vast, and expressions can be nat-



this expression contains two arccos functions and two arctan func- tions. the number of aliphatic heterocycles (nalihc) appears in several terms. even the simplest expression is hard to interpret through a vi- sual inspection, notwithstanding that it completely fails to explain the training data. for the most complex expression, the r2 value for the training data set was 0.98, suggesting a good fit to the training data.
