the tietze-urysohn theorem states that every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subspace of a normal space can be extended to a continuous function on the whole space. we prove an effective version of this theorem in the type two model of effectivity(tte). moreover, for qcb-spaces we introduce a slightly weaker notion of normality than the classical one and show that this property still admits an extension theorem for continuous functions.



in this paper we introduce a weaker notion of normality called quasi-normality. this notion may be considered as a substitute for normality in the class of qcbspaces(cf. section 3). we show that quasi-normal qcb-spaces admits extendability of continuous functions defined on functionally closed subspaces(cf. section 4). the category of quasi-normal qcb-spaces forms a cartesian closed subcategory of qcb and contains all separable metrisable spaces.



it is well-known that the subspace operator on topological spaces has the following transitivity property: any functionally open subset of a functionally open subspace is functionally open in the original space, whereas the analogous statement for functionally closed sets is false in general(cf.[2, 2.1.b]).



it follows from[2, 2.1.j] that the reverse implication is true as well. so we will prove at first that quasi-normal qcb-spaces have the property that any zero-set of any functionally closed subspace is also a zero-set of the original space.



this effectivisation of proposition 4.6 can be proved by showing effective versions of the lemmas in section 4 on which proposition 4.6 is based. their proofs can be obtained by effectivising the proofs of their topological counterparts using lemma 5.1.
