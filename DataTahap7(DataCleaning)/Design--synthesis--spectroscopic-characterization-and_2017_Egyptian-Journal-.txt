the purpose of the study is to design, synthesise and assess the antipsychotic activity of a set of the novel(5-(10-(3-n, n-dimethylamino) propyl)-10h-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazo-2-yl) azodye/schiff base/chalcone derivatives. the newly synthesised compound structure was characterised by ft-ir, 1h nmr, mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis. each compound has been shown an excellent antipsychotic activity in a haloperidol-induced catalepsy metallic bar test. the results found are firmly similar to docking study. among the synthesised derivatives, compound 2-amino-6-(3-hydroxy-4-methyl phenyl) pyrimidine-4-yl)(7-chloro-10-(3-(n, n-dimethylamino) propyl)-10h-phenothiazine-3-yl) methanone(gc8) exhibiting high potency of catalepsy induction. therefore, the derivative of gc8 has been considered that a potent anti-psychotic agent among the synthesised compounds.



4-chlorobenzene amine(0.01 mol, 1.27 g), p-chloroacetophenone(0.01 mol, 1.54 g), potassium carbonate(0.01 mol, 1.38 g) and 0.63 g of copper wire were dissolved in 30 ml of dmf contained round bottom flask of about 250 ml capacity. the mixture



to a solution of 1-(4-(4(chlorobenzeneamino) phenyl) ethanone(0.01 mol, 2.45 g) in rectified spirit, sulphur(0.01 mol, 0.3 g) and iodine(0.01 mol, 1.26 g) were placed in a two-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser. the mixture was subjected to reflux on a water bath around 3 h with occasional shaking. the separated 1-(7-chloro-10h-phenothiazine-3-yl) ethanone was filtered, washed with distilled water, dried and crystallized from acetone.



animal ethics committee at giet school of pharmacy, rajahmundry, india(gsp/py/04/2015). each group maintained six animals under standard lab conditions. haloperidol was administered 1 mg/kg, ip route to induce catalepsy in standard group of animals. synthesised compounds(7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) were also given simultaneously to test group of animals. the animal front paws had been placed on a metallic bar, which elevated at 10 cm above the base of the cage. if the animal maintained abnormal posture more than 30 s called as catalepsy. the response observed at the various intervals like 0, 30, 60, 120,



dimethylamino) propyl)-10h-phenothiazin-3-yl) methanone(gc8) induced the highest catalepsy period at the various time intervals such as 60, 120, 180 and 240 min. compound gc8(7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) significantly reduces the level of normal dopamine and generated catalepsy as similar to that of haloperidol treated animals with the percentage of 17.3%,41.6%,37.0%,35.8% and 39.5%, 57.1%, 54.0%, 51.8% respectively at various time interval



performing an interaction between 5-(10-(3-(n,n-dimethylamino) propyl-10h-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-amine, sodium nitrite, con. hcl and the different coupling reagents. the schiff base derivatives were prepared by condensation of 5-(10-(3-(n,n-dimethylamino) propyl-10h-phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-th iadiazole-2-amine and different aromatic aldehydes. the derivatives of chalcone were prepared from claisen-schmidt condensation reaction between 1-(7-chloro-10-(3-(n,n-dimethylamino)10h-phenothiazine-3-yl) ethanone, different aldehyde and quanidine. the ft-ir and 1h nmr spectrum of synthetic analogues were shown peaks due to different groups present in the analogues. in ft-ir spectrum, strong bands at the region of 704, 735, 623, 612,
