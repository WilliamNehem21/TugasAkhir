in[7,8] the authors showed that the multiparty and open(arbitrary number of participants) nature of cna poses interesting problems for the point of view of verification. in particular, while the number of possible successor states from a ccs process is quadratic on the number of its outermost prefixes, it is exponential in the case of a cna process. moreover, it is possible to specify a graph of agents as a cna process p(some examples in section 4.2) and we can check that there is a hamiltonian path in the graph iff there is exactly one immediate successor of p. we explored in[7,8] symbolic techniques aiming to tame the inherent complexity of the cna transition system.



the synchronization mechanism(rule com) works by merging two vccs. when doing that, note that the link chains can be enlarged(definition 3.10) and hence, the links of one chain can be placed in an admissible position of the other chain. note that the decision about the length of the resulting chain is postponed until the use of the rule com. this is a different approach from the one considered in canonical problem of the dinning philosophers. in this case, by adding constraints, we are able to specify a deadlock free and fair solution for the problem. the second example models a network transportation system where constraints may represent costs or temporal restrictions. in our last example, constraints are used to model service level agreements in a negotiation protocol.



by using a multiparty synchronization calculus, the dp problem has a simple and very natural deadlock free specification(see[7,8] for a solution using cna and for a solution using multi-ccs). in that case, in an atomic(or multiparty) interaction, a philosopher takes at the same time both forks, thus avoiding the deadlock situation described above. however, the solutions in multi-ccs and cna may exhibit unfair computations where, e.g., a given philosopher eats or thinks all the time(and the others cannot progress).



here we focus on a fair solution for the dp problem: due to deadlock-freeness, every computation is infinite and, by fairness, in every computation each philosopher eats infinitely many times. for that, we use constraints to neatly implement a sort of ticket service, thus guaranteeing that philosophers must alternate the use of the forks. from now on, we fix the clm to be the structure kn.



below we describe our first attempt to solve the problem. unfortunately, the specification is deadlock-free but it is not fair. we shall use dp(n) to denote the instance of the dp problem with n philosophers and i+ to denote(i+ 1)mod n.



the transition system generated by the process dp(that can be computed with our tool, see section 5) is indeed deadlock free. moreover, once pi has used the forks n times, he has to wait until his neighbors eat also n times to be able to eat again. this means that pi cannot take control of the forks forever and, at some point, he has to wait for the others. in other words, there are no computations where, e.g., pi eats infinitely many times and pj can never grab the forks.



the fair system can be obtained by controlling also the thinking action. similar to the solution in, we can enforce that philosophers must eat after thinking, thus alternating between thinking and eating states. this is the purpose of moving to the state philj after exhibiting the think action in the model below.



in the next example, we show that values and constraints can be useful to specify, declaratively, the internal state of processes. for that, we consider the case where philosophers may decide to remain thinking for a while and then, they decide to eat. in this scenario, it is important for the system that philosophers moving to the thinking state do not block the activities of the others. we thus assume in the beginning of this section. as pointed out in, the solution for the problem in multi-ccs(as well as ours in ccna) is fully distributed in an abstract level: there is no a central shared memory. however, it is not possible to have a truly distributed deterministic implementation of this kind of multiparty synchronization mechanisms.
