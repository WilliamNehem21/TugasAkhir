as and when a mobile node would like to join a dedicated multicast group creates a route query packet and broadcasts it to its adjacent nodes. if mobile nodes know the route to the multicast group may refrain from preparing and broadcasting the route query packet. let us presume that the mobile node may not be aware of the multicast group and path to the group. it is essential to prepare the route query packet in such a scenario by setting the join flag to 1 and the multicast group address before disseminating it to its neighboring nodes. multicast aodv protocol offers a quicker adapting to complex network con- straints, limited processing, and minimal network utilization. multicast aodv protocol produces duplex direction distributed multicast trees that enable us to connect multicast sender and receivers. there are four messages in the multicast aodv routing protocol as follows.
