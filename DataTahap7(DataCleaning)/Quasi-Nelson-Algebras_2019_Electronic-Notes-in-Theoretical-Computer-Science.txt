we would like to point out that our indirect proof strategy is not only unavoidable, for the time being(we do not yet have a direct proof of, e.g., proposition 2.7), but also insightful, because our representation of quasi-nelson residuated lattices as twist-structures affords an easy way of constructing concrete examples of such algebras. lastly, let us stress that, although in this paper we work exclusively with algebras, it is important for the logically-minded reader to keep in mind that we think of algebras as the algebraic counterpart of logics; this strategy is justified because we are dealing with algebraizable logics, so we can transfer our results back and forth from algebra to logic in a straightforward way.
