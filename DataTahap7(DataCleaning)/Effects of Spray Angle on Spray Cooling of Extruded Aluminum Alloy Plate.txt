in the past few years, studies[6-8] on the spray angle are focused on the spray angle itself and the coefficients of discharge and the spray cone angle, fruitful results were obtained by both experimental and numerical research. however, progress in the research of effects of spray angle on spray cooling has been very slow, especially in the field of metal press quenching. the analysis of the effects of spray angle on heat transfer is much more difficult and the direct numerical simulation is the best choice for theoretical study.



this paper attempts to make some numerical investigations on the effects of spray angle on spray cooling of extruded aluminum alloy plate to look for an optimal range of spray angle value that can improve the cooling performance. a commercial fvm code, fluent, will be employed to calculate the temperature distribution within the cooled aluminum plate. the corresponding stress distribution is obtained with the help of msc.marc software.



the aluminum plate is assumed of uniform temperature distribution when it is extruded from the extruding machine. therefore, the initial temperature distribution of the plate is set uniform, the temperature value is set 793 k. the material property is 6061 aluminum alloy.
