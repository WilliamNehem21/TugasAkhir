proof. friedberg uses in his construction of c.e. sets without repetition the notion of one c.e. set following another, so that in the end the constructed set will be the followed set. we use the same term terminology here except in the context of one tree following another.



pairwise distinct at level 2i. also, at stage i, initially some of the si will have the status of being marked(ki= m) in which case si will continue to follow t(si,m) forever. if not, then si is not marked(ki= n) and we determine for each i, if si should be marked. if an si needs to be marked then we determine a tree t(si,m) that it shall hereafter follow. otherwise each si continues to follow t(si,n) and the stage is complete.
