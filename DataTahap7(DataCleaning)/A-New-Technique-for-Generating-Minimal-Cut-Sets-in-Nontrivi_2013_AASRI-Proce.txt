network reliability analysis problem is the center of many scientific productions. it consists of evaluating the all-terminal reliability of networks. two classes have emerged; exact and approximate methods. the aim of this paper is to present an efficient exact method for enumerating minimal cuts (mcs) of r-networks. the algorithm proceeds by determining minimal paths set (mps) and from which minimal cuts are generated by managing binary decision diagrams. the manipulation process consists of a series of transformations, reductions and filtering operations. the approach succeeds in the reduction of computation time and memory space and was applied for evaluating the reliability of a national radio communication network.



generally, reliability engineers model the physical connectivity of system components using a network. mathematically, a network is a graph g(u , e) in which the edges e represent the components (e.g. devices, computers, routers, etc.) and the nodes u represent the interconnections.



the paper is structured as follows. section 2 presents some related preliminaries. section 3 details the principle of bdd manipulations. section 4 and section 5 give respectively the algorithm for generating mcs from robdd and its computational efficiency illustrated using some benchmark networks. in section 6, a



obdd can be reduced to a robdd by repeatedly eliminating, any instances of duplicate and redundant nodes using a bottom-up graph traversing procedure. if two nodes are duplicates, one of them is removed and all of its incoming pointers are redirected to its duplicate. if a node is redundant, it is removed and all incoming pointers are redirected to its just one child.
