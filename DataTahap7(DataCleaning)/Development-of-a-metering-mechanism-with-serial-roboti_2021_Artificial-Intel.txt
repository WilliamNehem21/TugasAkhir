shamshiri et al.(2018a) described the achievements of the latest robotics technology in agriculture such as the importance of incorporating advanced sensing systems, machine vision system(joseph et al., 2019, syed et al., 2019a, 2019b) multi-robot collaboration and the latest software tools. these advanced techniques could help in the efficient



electronic circuit for the control of feeding conveyor. a dc motor was used to power the slat type feeding conveyor. the electronic circuit used for actuating the dc motor by continuously monitoring the output of the led-ldr sensing unit of the feeding conveyor. the led was connected to a dc power source(+12 v) through a current limiting resistor(100 k) whichproducedapointedlightsource. the ldrwaspositionedin suchawaythatthepointedlightsourcefrom ledfellonthe ldr'ssensing surface. thestraight-linelightbeambetweenthe ledand ldrformedthe loa of the robotic arm. the resistance of ldr decreased when the light beam fell on the ldr's sensing surface. a comparator(lm741) ic continuously compared the voltage across the ldr and a reference voltage between two resistors(r3 and r4). the output voltage of the comparator produced a driving current whenever the voltage difference was high.



forward kinematic analysis. the forward kinematic analysis was carried out using the trigonometric concept to obtain both the position and orientation of the end-effector for the given set of input joint angles and link lengths. px, py and pz are the coordinates(x, y, z) of the end effector c.



mm, 220 mm, 210 mm, 220 mm and 180 mm, respectively. positions p1 and p5 belonged to the first row. p2, p3 and p4 belonged to the second row of the feeding conveyor. the three columns in the middle of the first row were kept empty as these positions were not covered in the workspace of the robotic arm as it had to move in an arc.



four servo motors were selected for the robotic arm out of which three servo motors for the shoulder joint, elbow joint and gripper(hitec hs-422, 6 v) and one for the base joint(dynamixel ax-12, 12 v). a microcontroller(arduino uno) was used to compute the algorithm and generate a(pwm) pulse width modulation signal. a buffer ic 74ls24 was incorporated for a unit gain amplifier in an integrated circuit for controlling dynamixel motor to provide pass signals or data packets. the voltage converter circuit was designed using lm317t and various components for getting output voltage in the range of 3 v to 12 v. this circuit was used for supplying current with 6 v to the three servo motors and microcontroller. two current sensors(acs712) were used as an overload protection device for the robotic arm. whenever a high current was detected, a relay switch was activated to disconnect the circuit from the main power supply.
