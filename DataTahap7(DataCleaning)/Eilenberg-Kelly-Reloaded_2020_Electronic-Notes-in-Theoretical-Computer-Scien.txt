example 3.5 given a left-skew closed category(c, i,() and a monad t on c that is lax closed. this is the same as t being left-strong and right-strong with the the left-strength cst and the right-strength cstr making a bi-strength and commuting. let b(t c= b( t c as in example 2.8. because t is left-strong, we have that(kl(t), i,(t) is left-skew closed. now, if(c, i,() happens to be left-normal,



example 4.7 in example 3.5, we assumed a closed category(c, i,() with a lax closed monad(t, c) and tried to establish that the left-skew closed category(kl(t), i,(t) where b(t c= b( t c was normal. this did not work out.
