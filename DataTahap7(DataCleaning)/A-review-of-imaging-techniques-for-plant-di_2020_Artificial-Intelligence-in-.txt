agricultural products are used to cater the dietary needs of animals as well as human beings. agriculture has been a part of everyone's life directly or indirectly. it is the way of crop production which results in providing food, the building block of every human being. whether a human resides in a metro city or lives in a village everyone survives on this crop production one or the other way. with the advent of civili- zation humans have started cultivating crops like wheat, cotton and others. with the development in every area of life there has been some vast development in the domain of agriculture also. along with the variation in the types of crops being grown other activities were also started such as farming, raising cattle etc.



crop production involves taking care of all the activities for the better yield across all the seasons. it involves complete analysis of the soil being used, the type of seeds used, the major nutrient re- quirement of the particular crop and many others. yields obtained from the crops, and other sources are being used to meet the daily needs of not only the farmers, but for others also. but as every field suffers from some form of issues agriculture or crop production also faces major challenge in the form of crop diseases. with the huge demand of food around the world, it becomes necessary to focus on the crop production. it is aimed to protect the overall yield from any type of loss before reaching to the market. besides ca- lamities caused by nature such as draught, earthquakes, diseases also accounts to major crop yield losses.



in context of quality or in the context of quality, yields are re- duced due to various types of plant diseases. plant disease can be de- scribed as some form of modification that hampers the normal processes in it. crop production can be majorly affected by these dis- eases which may reduce the quality and quantity of the overall pro- duced yield. management of large amount of crop yield involves various timely activities such as keeping a watch for diseases, which reduces it to undesirable stuff. it also involves finding imme- diate cure for various challenges faced. disease can affect the overall functional capacity of the plant. it may result in reduced growth, less fruit production, more leaf falls and many other ailments also. some- times the disease may spread from crop to crop or may be spread by some pathogen or other means. sometimes they may be caused by some fungi or some bacteria. sometimes even viruses get transferred with seeds from one place to another.



from a long time, identifying the crop disease is done by the experts through their naked eyes based on their knowledge and experience. find an expert and contact them is not only a tedious and time consum- ing task but also a very long and expensive method. therefore, the com- plete process sometimes takes so much time which become time taking for the disease to be eradicated and also very tedious in case of large areas (liu et al., 2020), (mishra et al. (2020)).



modern techniques available, for plant disease detection, like pro- cessing, similarity identification and deep learning based classification techniques better in respect of time saving than the old methods used (nagaraju and chawla, 2020), (nagasubramanian et al., 2019), (kulkarni and ashwin patil, 2012), (jasim and tuwaijari, 2020), (sun et al., 2020). they help farmers to improve the quality of crops, also bringing a reduction of disease occurrence by early detection and timely curing them (sinha and shekhawat, 2020).



in the process of detection of disease, number of imaging techniques is being used. one of the imaging techniques being used id photo acous- tic imaging, which makes the use of light absorption in case of tissues. it makes the use of property of light's absorption by tissues and its conver- sion into heat further resulting in the generation of photo acoustic sig- nals. here the pressure distribution radiated by tissues further being mapped and used for imaging purposes. considering various imaging techniques one of the important techniques is magnetic resonance im- aging. it can be described as imaging technique that gives detailed im- ages that are mostly used for knowing different types of diseases. in this method strong magnets are being deployed generating strong mag- netic field resulting in proper alignment of the protons. later application of electric field makes the movement in these protons. finally turning off of the rf filed sensors help in the detection of energy being released from movement.



among the various spectroscopies one of the recent methods is of fluorescence spectroscopy. it makes the use of fluorescence measure- ment, being released after the excitation of light with area of interest. mostly for vegetative studies or plant disease detection laser induced fluorescence are often used on a large scale. these are mostly needed for identification of various physiological states of different plants. ma- jorly the green leaves are being tested for chlorophyll fluorescence or blue green fluorescence. these help in early identification of any type of impairment resulting from major nutrients deficiencies. (sankaran et al., 2010).



among the recent techniques being used one of the effective imag- ing methodology is using hyper spectral imaging. in this technique elec- tromagnetic spectrum of an image's pixel is being used for the detection of plant disease present. in this technique wide spectrum of light is being used for the analysis of each image's pixel. it helps in the detection of various diseases in more reasonable manner among the variety of plants being considered. hyper spectral imaging is further extended when used with microscopy for higher resolution clear images. it helps in microscopic studies at the genotypic level of varied plant leaves. (rumf et al., 2010).



digital image analysis has evolved over many years. it firstly began with the era of 2d image analysis came. secondly, knowledge based ap- proaches using mri and ct changed the developmental procedures. lastly, analysis of fully 3d images was brought to the light. digital



for identification of different plant disease, sensors for imaging sys- tem are deployed to accumulate the data for study of leaves from differ- ent aspect. various useful imaging techniques include thermal imaging, multispectral imaging, fluorescence imaging, hyper spectral imaging, visible imaging, mrt. also 3d imaging methods are also tested along various other methods. in next sections we present a state of survey on these techniques along with their applications in different ways.



photo acoustic imaging is a technique that has been derived using hybrid biomedical imaging that is originated around the photo acoustic effect. it involves the amalgamation of different benefits such as optical absorption contrast along ultrasonic spatial resolution involved in deep imaging of diffusive and other regime. the studies bring the fact that photo acoustic imaging can be used for various purposes such as tumor analyzing, mapping of the level of blood oxygen, imaging of the brain activity, and other disease detection, etc.



one of the most common applications of it is breast imaging. usually one of the three approaches are being used commonly, the tele- ther- mography, the dynamic angio-thermography and the contact thermog- raphy type. the imaging thermographic digital methods involve the advantage of the principle derived from metabolic activity. also vascular circulation with the area surrounding a developing breast cancer is studied to detect the higher value.

(li et al., 2017) (rumf et al., 2010).
