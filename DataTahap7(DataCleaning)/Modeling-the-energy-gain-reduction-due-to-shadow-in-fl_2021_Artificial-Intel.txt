flat-plate solar collectors typically have one or two layers of trans- parent glass on the absorber plate to reduce losses due to convective air flow (duffie and beckman, 2013). this transparent glass is located at a distance from the absorbent plate. increasing this distance reduces convective losses. but, it creates shadows on the absorbent plate and re- duces the absorption radiation of the sun and ultimately decreases the performance (farhadi and taki, 2020). this distance is suggested in some researches between 4 and 5 cm (nahar and garg, 1980). the best distance can be calculated by shadow estimation, which has been done in previous research by farhadi and taki (2020). in this study, the authors decided to introduce a fast and accurate method for calcu- lating the energy gain reduction in flat-plate solar collectors due to shadow by using artificial intelligence (ai).



wheat yield for the next cultivation. in another study, ghritlahre and prasad (2018), developed mlp and multiple linear regression (mlr) models to predict the heat transfer of two different types of roughened solar air heaters. the results showed that ann models with 5-10-1 to- pology can predict the heat transfer characteristics with high accuracy (r2 = 0.9953) than mlr. in another study, ann-mlp model was used to predict the performance of solar chimney filled with phase change materials (fadaei et al., 2018). the results showed that the correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted data was more than 0.99 and also the relative error is less than 3%.
