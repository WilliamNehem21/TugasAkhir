the question whether every separable banach space has a basis was posed by banach in 1932; forty years later, it was answered in the negative by enflo. enflo in fact constructed a banach space that lacks the approximation property(ap). a banach space is said to have ap if the identity operator can be approximated uniformly on every compact subset by finite-rank operators(see[8, definition 3.4.26, theorem 3.4.32]). a banach space with a basis necessarily has ap(see[8, theorem 4.1.33]).
