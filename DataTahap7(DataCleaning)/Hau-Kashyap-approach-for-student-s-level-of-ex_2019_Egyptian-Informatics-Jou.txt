the indication to be measured to achieve the learning expertise can be viewed from cultural identity in learning, learning styles with cognitive basis, learning preferences, and creativity skills where this might be entirely enhanced to give insights on any subject matter[1,2]. being completely undertaken along with the indication mentioned earlier, it becomes pivotal to recognise the way in determining the expertise concern. along with the work on carrying out determining the learning expertise, some can be viewed using wide range of approach including clinical experiment, technology cognition, psychometric statistical tests, and decision theory. since all these works have been elucidated with the lack of robustness once conflicting evidence combined highly with providing the framework in underlying the learning interpretations depending on the way of interpreting the rule itself to yield the procedure of rules associative belief propagation. it indicated to have channel in connecting the interpretation of procedure concisely enhanced with the corresponding chaining syllogism where the belief propagation procedure is derived in the sense which might apply throughout the proposed inference procedures. this can also be enlarged with employing the latticestructured inference network. the fundamental distinction between the dempster-shafer combination rule and the haukashyap combination rule is that with the use of hau-kashyap rule the combination conflict is put into the union.
