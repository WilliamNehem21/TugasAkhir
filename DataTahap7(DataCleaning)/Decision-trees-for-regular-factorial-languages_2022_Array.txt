per [2], a classification of arbitrary regular languages depending on the smoothed minimum depth of decision trees solving the problem of recognition nondeterministically was announced without proofs. in the present paper, we consider simpler classification for regular factorial languages with full proof. results related to the decision trees solving the membership problem are new.



and 6. for both languages, the counting function grows linearly. for the first language, the minimum depth of decision trees solving the problem of recognition deterministically grows as a logarithm, but for the second language, the minimum depth of decision trees solving the problem of recognition deterministically grows linearly.



it is well known that each regular language can be represented by a deterministic finite automaton (dfa) [8]. as in [8], we will consider not only complete dfa with total transition function but also partial dfa with partial transition function. such dfa can be represented by its transition diagram (diagram for short) [9].
