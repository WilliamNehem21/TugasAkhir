1 b.c. is supported by epsrc advanced research fellowship ep/d072786/1 the structure of quantum information and its ramifications for it and epsrc grant ep/c500032/1 high-level methods in quantum computation and quantum information. the motivation for this work arose partly from interaction with yannick delbecque, dan gottesman and jon yard at the quantum information, computation and logic workshop at the perimeter institute in july 2005, and benefited from my collaboration with keye martin on domain theory. peter selinger provided useful feedback on an earlier version of this paper.



we intend to systematically analyse these important quantitative notions of quantum information theory in this qualitative manner, and cast them within a uniform theory. we expect that new canonical and unifying notions will emerge. this work is still in progress, and hence is not fully represented here, but we do expect a compositional theory on quantum informatic resources to emerge, which substantially extends the recent proposals by devetak, harrow and winter in.
