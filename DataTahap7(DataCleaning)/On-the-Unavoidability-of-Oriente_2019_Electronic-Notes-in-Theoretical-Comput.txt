a bi-arborescence is a rooted tree a that is the union of an in-arborescence and an out-arborescence that are disjoint except in their common root, which is also the root of a. observe that in the proof of theorem 3.1, the root of the outarborescence is embedded in the first vertex of the median order. by directional duality, the root of an in-arborescence is embedded in the last vertex of the median order. hence one can easily derive the following corollary.



the interest of this procedure is that it considers the nodes of the tree in a different order. the main property we are going to use is that the images of all of the sons of a given node a are fixed at the same time, and we do not need to fix the order oa before the set of those images is known. it means that we can choose the order oa after we know which vertices are the images of the sons of a. thus we can effectively choose which son of a is embedded to which vertex with the knowledge of the set of the images of the sons of a.



let a be a tree which is not a path. a branch-node of a is a node with with degree at least 3 and a flat node is a node with degree 2. a segment in a is a subpath whose origin is a branch-node, whose terminus is either a branch-node or a leaf, and whose internal nodes are flat nodes. if its terminus is a branch-vertex, then the segment is an inner segment; otherwise it is an outer segment. the opposite of an inner segment s, denoted by s is the inner segment with origin the terminus of s and terminus the origin of s.
