in contrast to its wealth of applications in mathematics, the kantorovich metric started to be noticed in computer science only in recent years. we give a brief survey of its applications in probabilistic concurrency, image retrieval, data mining, and bioinformatics. this paper highlights the usefulness of the kantorovich metric as a general mathematical tool for solving various kinds of problems in rather unrelated domains.



the kantorovich metric has been used by van breugel et al. for defining behavioural pseudometrics on fully probabilistic systems[30,33,29] and reactive probabilistic systems[31,32,27,28]; and by desharnais et al. for labelled markov chains[8,10] and labelled concurrent markov chains; and later on by ferns et al. for markov decision processes[11,12]; and by deng et al. for action-labelled quantitative transition systems. given a pseudometric m on a finite set of states, a typical problem to measure similarities of the behaviour of probabilistic processes is how to lift m to be



we have briefly surveyed some recent applications of the kantorovich metric in computer science. in general, production planning problems spread over a large variety of research areas, but lead to the same mathematical problem, namely the transportation problem. therefore, the kantorovich metric will probably find many more applications in the future. for example, this can be envisaged in relevant areas such as knowledge representation, statistical clustering, data mining, information retrieval, bioinformatics etc., all of which demand appropriate ways of computing similarity/dissimilarity between objects.
