predicted using theoretical relationships for a large set of predefined candidate directions [8]. seidel et al. performed a similar study on a human iliotibial tract sample [9]. they performed 35 scans constrained to two planes and computed the fibre directions by analysing the maxima of the intensity vectors versus simulated fibre directions.



the acquired volume images were first pre-aligned using rigid body registration based on fiducial markers, followed by soft registration which also allowed for any geometric distortions. the pre-alignment stage relies on 3 fiducial markers attached to the specimen, represented by 10 mm diameter water filled spheres (.43 caliber clear paintballs 8000, rap4 uk). following the methodology of de oliveira et al.
