while the one-way model[4,5,6] has been recognised since its inception as an important theoretical quantum computing model, it is only recently that some of its measurement patterns have been realised in the lab. there are a number of different questions to be addressed before such implementations on physical substrates can be carried out on larger examples. one of these, which is the one we are particularly interested in in this note, is the efficient implementation of the feedforward mechanism by which the measurements angles are allowed to depend on the outcomes of past measurements. we show that a variant of the original one-way model, incorporating only pauli measurements is approximately universal. thus, when executing a particular pattern, the feedforward mechanism only has to deal with a choice of two



we see that the first condition simply ensures that by the time a correction has to be done, one can actually compute its exponent from the extant outcomes. the second condition ensures that qubits are not reused. while reusing is legitimate to spare on the number of physical qubits, it disrupts the standardisation property(because, obviously if qubits are reused, then they also have to be re-entangled, and therefore the whole entanglement can no longer be done first), and is best left as an optional optimisation not taken into account in our pattern language. this condition also ensures that there is at most one measurement done on any given qubit, and therefore the notation si, standing for the outcome of the measurement done at qubit i is sensible. finally, the third condition ensures that by the time all measurements have been done, the output qubits are no longer entangled with the rest, so that they can effectively be read out of the computation space.
