for 50 years, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic have been an area of active research(cf.). fuzzy automata, fuzzy markov processes, fuzzy petri nets[25,16], fuzzy reactive frames and fuzzy discrete event systems are some of the formalisms that have been considering to model computational systems that deal with uncertainty and fuzzy sets. in this work, we will focus on fuzzy transition systems or fuzzy labelled transition systems, which are a generalisation of transition



kripke semantics for modal logic consist of graphs labelled with propositional symbols on each edge. hence, they can be used to model many situations, such as network science, graph theory, epistemic logic and also for reasoning about time, beliefs, computational systems, etc. however, there are situations where we cannot say that a transition exists(edges in graphs) or not; the best we can do is to assign a degree of certainty to its existence. this leads to fuzzy state transitions.
