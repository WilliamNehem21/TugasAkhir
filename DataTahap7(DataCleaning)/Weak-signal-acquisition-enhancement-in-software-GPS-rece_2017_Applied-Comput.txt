achieved with larger m. however, too large values of m lead to an undesirable decomposition which in turn yields mixing of residual components. sometimes small transitions in m reduce the mixing and lead a better separation, hence ssa analysis was repeated several times using different values of m [17].



subspace (xr) and noise subspace (xn). the svd is performed with another window size (m2) on noise subspace where it is decomposed into (x1r) and (x n). this is continued up to sev- eral window sizes and finally all the signal subspace compo- nents (xr)+ (x1r) + ... (xr) are added. this yields good separation of signals from noise. by repetitive trials, the value
