inductive types can be introduced as usual, i.e. by enumeration of their constructors, but they can be parameterised in objects of other types. because of the latter it is said that type theory features families of types(indexed by a base type) or dependent types.



because of the preceding feature, type theory can be interpreted as a constructive logic. specifically, this is achieved by representing propositions as inductive types whose constructors are the introduction rules, i.e. methods of direct proof, of the propositions in question.
