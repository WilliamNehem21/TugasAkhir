the rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, the background and the related work are presented. in section 3, a detailed discussion of the twedistance operator is given. in section 4, three approaches which are regression, interpolation and curve barcoding and how they are utilized to evaluate the similarity are discussed. then, the experiments, and the output results are shown in section 6. finally, section 7 concludes the paper, and sets ideas for future research work.



in this experiment, the accuracy of the four approaches is evaluated based on the spatial similarity and how it is affected by different sampling rates. trains dataset is filtered by picking up 9 trains one from each line then resampling these trains to ten different samples coming up with 90 trajectories. same for trucks dataset, they are filtered into 205 trajectory and each trajectory was resampled to 6 samples yielding 1230 trajectories. these final tratrajectories including original trajectories and sampled versions from them. the sampling rates differs based on the transportation mode as some sampling rates causes number of observations to be less that what is needed(i.e. in cubic interpolation at least four observations are needed).



the datasets based on spatial, direction and speed similarity. after evaluating the accuracy per each experiment, we evaluated the average accuracy and the results show that interpolation yields the highest accuracy results against the other approaches with an average accuracy up to 90%. for a future work, there is a need for an auto feature prediction generic continuous similarity operator that predicts what features to be used as a similarity criteria based on the input data.
