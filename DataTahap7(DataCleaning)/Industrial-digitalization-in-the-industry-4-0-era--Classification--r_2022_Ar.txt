dts are becoming increasingly prominent in the manufacturing industry. dts are capable of optimizing processes and products prior to their execution thanks to their ability of high-fidelity forecasting. in manufacturing industries, dts can be virtual representations of different systems, e.g., machinery, production lines, products, or any other operation or service related to the manufacturing process. therefore, dts can be introduced at any time in the manufacturing process, hence their usefulness is not limited to pre-production planning and design, where prediction and optimization of the product or production lines apply, but they can also be used for maintenance, market analysis, etc..



in order to provide a digital integrated platform, both software and hardware components need to be considered. however, one of the core technologies of the digitbrain project is the device-agnostic softwarebased verification mechanism by the implementation of a lightweight cryptographic library. this paper strictly focuses on models, as a separate and reusable asset in digitbrain.



time-consuming process. each dt is typically constructed individually, without reusing previous results and existing building blocks. the work described in this paper is the first step to overcome this obstacle by categorizing and describing models with a rich set of metadata to enable their reusability when building dts.



the sub-systems and components are created by model developers and exported as co-simulation units. in order to perform cosimulation of a complete system, these co-simulation units need a standard way of interacting with each other. since manufacturing systems are typically produced by a combination of heterogeneous components, these components are usually supplied by several legal entities; hence protection of the intellectual property for the underlying model is needed.



from a lca point of view, an output of a specific process(i.e., a system) can be formalized as an input to another process. since a process is considered the fundamental unit for the lca evaluation, a complex system might be represented by a production machine(as



in addition to lci data, lca methodology is also based on life cycle impact assessment(lcia) information on the impacts related to the inventory, i.e., the computed environmental indicators. lcia data, for the analysis of a specific system, can be calculated from the lci data via characterization factors, i.e., factors meant to translate the inventory into environmental impacts. on the basis of the approach explained before, the lca assessment of a sos can be obtained as a composition of lca assessments of each system.



another type of sos models supported by digitbrain is integrated 3d and discrete event simulation(des) models. des models are behavioral model which describe the evolution of a system during a given time, in which the simulated time is advanced at discrete intervals only when a change in the system occurs, updating the state of the system. in digitbrain, des is supported through the dddsimulator simulation engine, a des tool with integrated 3d virtual environment. simulation models are composed by reusable elements called prototypes, each one representing a component of the simulated system(machine, transporters, logic module); prototype instances communicate among each other with ports that are used to exchange data between different modules. the models realized can be used to simulate the system for a period of time and obtain statistics that give information on the performance of the system in the simulated conditions. a graphical integrated development environment(ide) called ddd model editor supports the visual editing of both prototypes and models.



the key to efficiently create dts lies in the reuse of existing artifacts. the reuse of software artifacts is a well-established concept in software engineering. the digitbrain ecosystem enables reuse by decomposing dts into their constituting parts, i.e., data, models, and algorithms. metadata describing these assets and their physical locations in external repositories are stored in the platform, enabling users to create dts by composing the parts into a data-model-algorithm(dma) tuple.



the major challenge tackled by digitbrain is to present the characterization in such a way that the model user can conveniently find the right model for efficient reuse. the core service responsible for enabling reuse is the digitbrain asset metadata registry that stores a rich set of metadata about all digitbrain assets, including models. the actual models are only referenced from this registry and stored in external model repositories(the project set up a sample model repository for demonstration purposes). the access service relies on the metadata descriptions to provide filtering, search functionality and to assure that the selected model is fed into the chosen algorithm at execution time.



within the reference architectures, the domain experts(data scientists) can build on and use well-known ml frameworks. the digitbrain platform provides a fast way to reuse models and train them individually with customized datasets. this fast and easy reproducibility of implementations provides a very fast way to implement ai in production. this model processing takes place in a predefined working environment supported by ml frameworks such as tensorflow, pytorch, etc. after training, the generated models can be stored in ml framework-specific formats and executed on less powerful hardware. to support model portability, the open source community has proposed the open neural network exchange(onnx) standard. with this approach, we propose a standard to exchange and transfer trained ml models to the different devices for applications. as another option, we also rely on the savedmodel format favored by google.



within this context, the discrete simulation engine(dddsimulator) was used for sos analysis. the dddsimulator is a simulation tool for integrated 3d and des, developed and distributed by technology transfer system(tts). this simulator enables its users to design new layouts combining reusable modules, each representing an element of the plant such as machines, transporters, feeding systems and robots. the simulation models can be used to assess the performance of alternative layouts, after which the model of the effective plant can be uploaded to the digitbrain platform and used to simulate the performances of different production plans.
