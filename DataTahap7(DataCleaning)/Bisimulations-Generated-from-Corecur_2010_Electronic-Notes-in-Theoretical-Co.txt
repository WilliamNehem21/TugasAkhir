a form general enough to cover all the examples in this paper. in some other cases, defining an appropriate data type and a coalgebra on it is less straightforward than above, while the method of proving unicity of solutions using bisimulations still works nicely. example 4.1 in the next section illustrates this point.



recursive step: tk+1 is generated from tk in the following way. we take the head and tail of tk and simplify them as described in the two steps below. during simplification, we are allowed to replace the head of any recursive variable x with a fresh object parameter dx and its tail with a fresh recursive variable x'. in other words, we postulate x= dx:: x'.
