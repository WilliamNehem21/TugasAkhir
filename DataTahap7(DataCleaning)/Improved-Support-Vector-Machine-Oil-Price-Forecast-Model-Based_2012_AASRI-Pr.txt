affects the generalizability of the learning machine. parameter c determines the penalty to large fitting deviation: an excessively large value may cause overlearning, but one too small easily results in less learning. the optimization of these parameters is therefore important in improving svm performance.



for traditional svm, parameter selection algorithm always lead to some problems such as overlearning and underlearning, and diminish algorithm performance and affect forecast precision. using the ga optimization choice, svm penalty factor, and kernel function parameter yielded good results. through original data confirmation and validating, the ga-svm forecast model enables good forecast results.
