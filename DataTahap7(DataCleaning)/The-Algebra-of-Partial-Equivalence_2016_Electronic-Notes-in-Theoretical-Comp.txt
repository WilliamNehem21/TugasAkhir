props(product and permutation categories) are symmetric monoidal categories with objects the natural numbers. in the last two decades, they have become increasingly popular as an environment where to study diverse computational models in a compositional, resource sensitive fashion. to make a few examples, they have recently featured in algebraic approaches to petri nets[7,26], bigraphs, quantum processes and signal flow graphs[2,4,1].



much. a counterexample is given by cospans represented by and, which have the same pullback but express different partitions of 2. the correct approach is subtler: since we only need to rewrite as, it suffices to pull back the region of the cospan where all sub-diagrams of shape lie. formally, we
