back the same ack(stamp) message to the coordinator(lines 106-110). if a worker is active upon reception of an ack(stamp) message, it simply ignores it. in that case, an act message from that worker must eventually arrive to the coordinator. finally, the coordinator detects the global termination if it receives p ack(stamp) messages(i.e., nb ack= p, lines 162-178). it can then broadcast this termination detection(i.e., trm status=stop) to all workers(lines 129-135).
