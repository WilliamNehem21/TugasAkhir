gap-[k]-vertex-labellings were introduced by a. dehghan et al. in 2013. in their article, the authors investigated both the computational complexity of decision problems associated with the gap-[k]-vertex-labelling of some families of graphs, as well as the least k for which some graphs admit such a labelling. they also show that deciding whether a given graph admits a gap-[k]-vertex-labelling is np-complete for denote by t=(t1, t2,..., tp) an(arbitrary but fixed) ordering of all the p triangles in g. also, we abuse notation to say that ti={ex, ey, ez} is the triangle of g induced by edges ex, ey and ez of e(g).
