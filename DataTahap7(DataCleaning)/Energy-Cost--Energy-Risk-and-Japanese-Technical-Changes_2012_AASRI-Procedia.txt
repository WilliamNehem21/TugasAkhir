this study assumes the existence of a short-run energy cost-driven technical application mechanism and a long-run energy risk-driven technical progress mechanism. using the japanese monthly data from 1988 to 2010, we perform granger causality tests on the four time series, namely energy price, import volume of crude oil, geographical dispersion of oil imports, as well as real industrial output. the results show that for a country with tight energy constraint, energy price shocks may trigger the both mechanisms of technical application and technical progress, which facilitate the short-run and the long-run economic growth separately. moreover, we find that the geographical dispersion of oil imports is mainly employed as a tool to control the risk of import volume, instead of energy price uncertainties.



petroleum products have constituted a considerably large proportion of total energy consumption. as a result, the oil prices have been exerting crucial influences on the price changes of the other forms of primary energies. what is noteworthy, however, is that the increasing crude oil prices may have different effects upon the energy-abundant countries and the energy-poor countries.



energy-abundant countries may directly benefit from the rising energy prices, with extra oil export incomes booming their short-run gdp growth. however, the bad news is that the easy oil export revenues may effectively hurt the incentives for technological progress in a developing country, leading up to a low- productivity specialization trap [1] or the curse of natural resources [2]-[3] in the long-run; energy-poor countries, especially the industrialized oil importing countries, often suffer from the increasing energy prices which imply higher costs. the soaring energy costs may shift the aggregate supply curve leftward and therefore generate higher prices and lower production outputs [4]-[5]. however, when there is an extremely tight energy supply constraint, the profit maximizing private firms may have more incentives to control their energy costs by means of technological and operational innovation[6], which will lead up to an endogenous cost-driven technological progress [7]-[9].



where m is oil import volume and k stands for the k-th country. a higher h implies that the oil imports are more concentrated and more risky. when assuming there is second-degree price discrimination in the world oil market, a reduction of h can diversify the risk but may generate additional transaction cost.
