we add an operation of group creation to the typed pi-calculus, where a group is a type for channels. creation of fresh groups has the effect of statically preventing certain communications, and can blockthe accidental or malicious leakage of secrets. we adapt a notion of secrecy introduced by abadi, and prove a preservation of secrecy property. when applied to the ambient calculus, the same notion of group creation can be used to create and preserve shared secrets among mobile agents.
