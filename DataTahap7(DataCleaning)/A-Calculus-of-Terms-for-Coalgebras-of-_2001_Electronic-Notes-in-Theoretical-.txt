example. to illustrate the use of rigid terms and case-formation in coalgebraic specification, here is an example adapted from[9, section 4]. let a be a set of(possibly infinite) binary trees. each tree x either is a single node with no children, or has exactly two children obtained by deleting the top node of



st is a type symbol that will denote the state set of a given coalgebra. a type is rigid if it does not have st as a subtype. the set of rigid types is thus the smallest set that includes o and satisfies(1) and(2).



the tools needed to give a structural characterisation of logically definable classes of coalgebras are now all in place. the following result is the analogue for polynomial functors of theorem 9.2 of for monomial functors, and the underlying reasoning is the same.
