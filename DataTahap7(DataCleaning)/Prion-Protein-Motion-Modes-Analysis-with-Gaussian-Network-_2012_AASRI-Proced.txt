the slow modes represent functionally relevant motions of protein. the fast modes correspond to geometric irregularity in the local structure and the fluctuations associated with fast modes are accompanied by a decrease in entropy larger than that for slow modes. therefore, residues acting in the fast modes are thought to be kinetically hot residues and they are critically important for the stability of the tertiary fold [9].
