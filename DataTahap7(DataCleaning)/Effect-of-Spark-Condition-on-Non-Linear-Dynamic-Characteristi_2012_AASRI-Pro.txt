issues relating to environmental pollution and fuel reservoirs are becoming more and more important. compressed natural gas (cng) is a good alternative fuel because of its plentiful resources and clean burning characteristics. advantages including knock tolerance, less co2 emission, greater ability to homogenate and reduction of the non-methane hydrocarbon emissions have attracted a huge public interest in cng engines.



cyclic combustion variability is also one of the main characteristics of the si natural gas engines [1]. there will be a 10% increase in the power output of the engine if the cyclic combustion variability is eliminated [2]. the problem of reducing cyclic variability has not been solved up to now. generation mechanism, source identification and elimination of cyclic combustion variability have therefore become important issues in si engine technology engineering. j.b. heywood [3] identified three main factors influencing cyclic combustion variability which include aerodynamics in the cylinder during combustion, a mixture composition near the spark plug and the amount of fuel, air and recycled exhaust gases supplied to the cylinder.
