our literature survey did not show results for image compression using the dft alone. the reason is that by applying a dft, it yields two sets of coefficients, real and imaginary. if one wishes to keep those for faithful image reconstruction, then it is not possible to achieve high compression ratios. we applied the dft as described in this paper resulting in images with good visual quality and low compression complexity. a comparative analysis between compression ratios for dft alone and dft followed by the matrix minimization algorithm show



this research has demonstrated a novel approach to compress images in greyscale, colour and structured light images used in 3d reconstruction. the method is based on the dft and the matrix-minimization algorithm. the most important aspects of the method and their role in providing high quality image with high compression ratios are highlighted as follows.
