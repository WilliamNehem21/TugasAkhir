program construction facilities. the clp scheme for constraint logic programming, started by a seminal paper by jaffar and lassez, provides a combination of cp and lp which has proved very practical for cp applications. adding a fp dimension to clp has led to various proposals of cflp schemes for constraint functional logic programming, developed since 1991 and aiming at a very expressive combination of cp, higher-order lazy fp and lp.
