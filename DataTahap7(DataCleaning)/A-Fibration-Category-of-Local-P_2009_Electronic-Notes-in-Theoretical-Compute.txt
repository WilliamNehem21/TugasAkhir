l. fajstrup, e. goubault, and m. raussen have introduced local pospaces as a model for concurrent systems. in this paper it is shown that the category of local pospaces under a fixed local pospace is a fibration category in the sense of h. baues. the homotopy notion in this fibration category is relative directed homotopy.



homotopy theoretical methods have been used successfully in the recent past to study problems in concurrency theory, the domain of theoretical computer science that deals with parallel computing. various topological models have been introduced to describe concurrent systems. examples are partially ordered spaces(or pospaces) and local pospaces, flows, globular cw-complexes, and d-spaces. the reader is referred to e. goubault for a recent introduction to different topological models for concurrency. the purpose of this paper is to study the homotopy theory or, more precisely, the relative directed homotopy theory of local pospaces.



in it has been shown that the category of pospaces(with a not necessarily closed partial order) under a fixed pospace is both a fibration and a cofibration category. unfortunately, the author does not know whether the category of local pospaces(under a fixed local pospace) is a cofibration category. the main problem is that it is not known whether the category of local pospaces has enough colimits. note in this context that p. bubenik and k. worytkiewicz have constructed a closed model category containing the category of local pospaces(essentially in the original sense) under a fixed local pospace as a subcategory.
