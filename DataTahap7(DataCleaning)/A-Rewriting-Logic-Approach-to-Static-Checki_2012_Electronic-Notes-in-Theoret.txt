many c programs assume the use of implicit domain-specific information. a common example is units of measurement, where values can have both a standard c type and an associated unit. however, since there is no way in the c language to represent this additional information, violations of domain-specific policies, such as unit safety violations, can be difficult to detect. in this paper we present a static analysis, based on the use of an abstract c semantics defined using rewriting logic, for the detection of unit violations in c programs. in contrast to typed approaches, the analysis makes use of annotations present in c comments on function headers and in function bodies, leaving the c language unchanged. initial evaluation results show that performance scales well, and that errors can be detected without imposing a heavy annotation burden.



many programs make use of domain-specific information. a common example, often occurring in scientific and engineering applications, is the use of units of measurement. units are associated with specific values or variables; unit rules then determine how operations in the language(addition, multiplication, etc) change and combine units, and also determine when this is safe. in many languages, including c, this information on units is implicit: instead of having a program-level representation, values are assumed by the programmer to have specific units, which may be documented informally in source comments. unfortunately, the implicit nature of this information means that it cannot be used to automatically ensure that



many approaches have been proposed to enforce unit safety in programs, a number of which are discussed in section 2. in this paper, we propose a new solution for the c language, cpf[units]. cpf[units], based on the cpf framework, is a significant extension of the ideas introduced in the proof-of-concept c-units system. cpf[units] allows unit-specific annotations to be added to c programs in the form of function preconditions, function postconditions, assertions, and assumptions. these annotations are then checked for validity using a combination of the abstract rewriting logic semantics of c, part of cpf, and the units policy, a collection of unit-specific semantics for certain language features and the combination of an annotation language and annotation semantics. hence the name cpf[units], for cpf parameterized by the units policy.



solutions based around language and type system extensions work by introducing units into the type system and potentially into the language syntax, allowing expressions to be checked for unit correctness by a compiler or interpreter using extended type checking algorithms. metagen, an extension of the mixgen extension of java, provides language features which allow the specification of dimension and unit information for object-oriented programs. other approaches making use of language and type system extensions have targeted ml[21,20], pascal[13,17], and ada.



instead, this type of relationship has to be added by hand-editing files generated during processing. osprey also checks dimensions(i.e., length), not units(i.e., meters or feet), instead converting all units in a single dimension into a canonical unit. this can mask potential errors: for instance, it is not an error to pass a variable declared with unit meter to a function expecting feet. on the other hand, osprey includes functionality to check explicit conversions for correctness, catching common conversion errors such as using the wrong conversion factor.



annotation-based systems, including jml and spec#, have been applied to many problem domains, but not specifically to units. systems for unit safety based on annotations include the c-units system, which used concepts about abstract semantics and annotations that first appeared in the context of bc, a small calculator language. cpf[units] was inspired by the work on c-units, and takes a similar approach, with a focus on using abstract semantics and annotations. however, cpf[units] has extended this approach in three significant ways. first, cpf[units] has been designed to be modular: the abstract semantics of c have been completely redefined using concepts developed over the last several years as part of the rewriting logic semantics project. the semantics are divided into core modules, shared by all cpf policies, and units modules, specific to cpf[units]. this allows improvements in the core modules to be shared by all policies, simplifies the unit checking logic, and greatly improves the ease with which the semantics can be understood and modified. second, cpf[units] has been designed to cover a much larger portion of c. c-units was designed as a prototype, and left out a number of important c features, with minimal or no support for structures, pointers, casts, switch/case statements, gotos, or recursive function calls. support for



in this section we present cpf[units], a tool for checking the unit safety of c programs. in cpf[units], users specify units on c objects 7 that hold numerical values by providing annotations in comments in the source code. annotations indicate function preconditions and postconditions, assertions, and assumptions. the annotated code is converted into a formal representation based on a maude-defined abstract c semantics, and then checked function by function, ensuring that the size of the verification task does not(except in some pathological conditions, such as with deeply nested conditionals where each branch makes different changes to units) grow too large. the use of conditionals and looping constructs can cause multiple units to be associated with a single object 8. techniques to handle this, while still maintaining precision, are discussed below.



the third rule handles the greater-than relational operation. here, the rule is the same as for addition: to compare two values they must have the same unit. beyond this, the returned unit is nounit, since it does not make sense to assign a unit to the result of the comparison. the fourth rule is used for assignment. here, the lvalue evaluates to an lvp, or location-value pair, with the location and current value of the object being assigned into. the value of the right-hand expression is assigned over the current value to the same location. while this works for units, it also works for other c entities, such as the representations for pointers and structures. the fifth rule, for the+= operand, is a combination of the rules for+ and assignment, performing both the check for failure and the assignment to the location of the lvalue. in this case, the values should be units, since it is necessary to compare them to verify the operation is safe; a different rule would be needed for pointer arithmetic. in both the fourth and fifth rule, parens have been added to clearly distinguish the k= from the c assignment=.



26. the potential cause of this error was explained in section 1. any assertion failures are similarly reported to the user, with additional information provided where this is possible. for instance, errors triggered by addition operations will report the line number and the fact that the error is caused by an invalid addition.



there are several areas where cpf[units] could be extended. first, some c code cannot yet be safely analyzed. this includes code that uses features that are not type-safe, such as pointer arithmetic and unions, as well as code that uses ambiguous function pointers. extending the cpf[units] definition, while using additional analysis information from cil, should make it possible to safely handle more of these cases. second, a number of conservative assumptions around aliasing and global variables preserve correctness but can generate warnings; additional analysis information from cil should also be useful in these cases, to sharpen the analysis capabilities without losing correctness. third, annotations on global variables and structure definitions would allow assumptions about units associated with globals or instances of structures to be stated once, instead of stating them in functions which use them; these are currently being added. fourth, error messages are being improved. finally, there are some useful annotations that cannot yet be properly handled, including unit annotations that depend on variables in the exponent(such as saying that, given an integer n, variable x has unit metern). extending the capabilities of the annotation language would increase the power of cpf[units], allowing it to handle more complex cases.
