the main objective of direct torque control of squirrel-cage induction generator is to control the speed of the machine and the torque given by wind turbine and this control has to be rigid and accurate without any time delay. a feed forward neural network is designed with inputs as the rotor flux, stator current to estimate the actual speed of machine. the performance of dtc of squirrel-cage induction generator(scig) in wind energy conversion system is compared with pi and neural controllers. the controlling scheme is explained and the modeling of the complete system is done in matlab/ simulink.



the direct torque control of scig in wind energy conversion system with pi controller and neural controller is implemented in matlab/ simulink. the wind energy conversion system consists of five main important blocks. they are constant pitch and variable speed wind turbine, induction generator, three-phase inverter, dtc controller and pi controller/ neural controller(speed controller). wind turbine acts as a prime mover to the induction generator. wind turbine pitch angle is 45 degrees(constant) and wind velocity is varied between 0 to 20 m/sec randomly..
