power quality is one of the major concerns in the present era. it has become important, especially, with the introduction of sophisticated devices, whose performance is very sensitive to the quality of power supply. to solve this problem, custom power devices are used. one of those devices is the dynamic voltage restorer(dvr), which is the most efficient and effective modern custom power device used in power distribution networks. its appeal includes lower cost, smaller size, and its fast dynamic response to the disturbance. this paper presents modelling, analysis and simulation of a dynamic voltage restorer(dvr) using matlab for both pi and fuzzy controllers.
