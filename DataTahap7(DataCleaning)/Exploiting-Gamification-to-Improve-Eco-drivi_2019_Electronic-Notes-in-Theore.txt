gamecar aims to develop a highly innovative and interactive serious games platform that will empower and guide users to adopt an eco-friendly driving style. this will be achieved, without distracting them from safe driving, through a multidisciplinary approach aiming at the development of a user friendly, unobtrusive multi-player gaming environment, where the users will not only play collaboratively/competitively using their mobile device but also use the car itself and their own bodies, thus turning eco-driving into an immersive and highly motivating experience. the sensing infrastructure of gamecar will acquire data related to driving from an obd sensor that will capture a complex set of parameters related to eco-driving, and will also sense environmental and physiological parameters of the driver, so as to better position the state of the system(car) in context(environment, user). the gamecar system will be quantified and evaluated in test campaigns with drivers in three different sites that will serve system development and will also demonstrate usefulness and exploitation potential.



the aggressiveness ecoscore calculation is based on the following parameters: a) engine rpm variance parameter, b) braking intensity parameter, c) acceleration magnitude parameter. high variance of engine rpm indicates driver nervousness and improper vehicle handling. for example, significant fluctuations in engine rpm are the result of a driver who is not focused on smooth cruising and overall safe driving. instead, they tend to accelerate many times for small duration, thus minimizing their fuel efficiency, eco-friendliness and safety for themselves and others. given a w= 30 seconds temporal window the aggressiveness engine rpm related score arp m is directional acceleration obtained from the mobile devices accelerometer can provide a meaningful measurement of steering and overall driving aggressiveness. while abrupt braking and engine rpm variance are a good metric of aggressiveness in slow sections of the driving route, they fail to provide similarly robust information in faster sections. to alleviate this, the lateral and directional acceleration magnitudes are incorporated, which provides high sensitivity for assessing aggressiveness aacc in fast sections. more specifically, given a the acceleration magnitude timeseries of length n,



the scores of his/her peers. similarly, a player in the safety enthusiast should face missions that are somewhat easier than the corresponding missions for the other two categories, but place a heavy focus on consistent performance and calm/eco-friendly road behaviour. finally, missions posed to the smart saver should feature as either objective or highlight the benefits of ecodriving regarding reduced fuel consumption and positive environmental impact.



discovery phase. in levels 1 to 4 after completion of 90-120 minutes of driving depending on eco-score, the participant familiarizes with the games elements, scoring features, feedback, levelling system and driving statistics extraction. to this end, the user gets introduced to levels, eco-score, heads-up display(hud) alerts and basic driving statistics.



on-boarding. in levels 5 to 14 that corresponds to an estimate of 6-8 hours of driving, approximately 9-16 days with 30 minutes of daily driving the player is exposed to more advanced features of the game. apart from the discovery phase elements, this phase includes leader-boards and leader-board points(lp), daily missions with loot-box rewards, large-scope missions with xp/lp, knowledge cards, loot-boxes. the drop likelihood depends on eco-driving performance, up



scaffolding. in levels 15 to 39 that corresponds to an estimate of 45-57 hours of driving, approximately 2.5-4 months with 30 minutes of driving daily, the game that aims to create desirable habits for the player. along with all the aforementioned features, the users are granted the ability to create their own crews in order to recruit other players as they gain a widely respected veteran status.



minutes of driving daily. in this final stage of the game, players start to receive personalized messages according to their weak driving aspects. they also gain access to advance information visualizations regarding their performance compared to global statistics. finally, most of their visible status is subject to inactivity decay, meaning that it is gradually diminished while the player remains inactive. the features are then further customized based on the detected type of each player.



driving skill scores are given to drivers and reflect their specific abilities in relation to different aspects of their driving including fuel consumption, acceleration, breaking, gear changing and driving aggression. the driving skill scores are a key part of ensuring that users are able to improve and work towards their epic goals within the game by providing individualized scores for each driving element. the user is getting live feedback that they can react and respond to when they undertake a journey. the driving skills awards recognize the achievements of the driver in specific aspects of their driving, thereby highlighting the progress that they are making. knowledge cards pop up at random times within the experience and give the user the chance to answer questions on specific aspects of eco-driving. knowledge cards open a whole subsection in the system and represent several gamification aspects within gamecar. if the drivers gather enough knowledge cards in a particular area, they can complete a page in an album. this then allows accessing missions. missions represent an additional game layer that is designed to be accessed by more advanced or experienced app users. they are designed to keep users interested in gamecar and to give them specific objectives to complete on top of keeping their scores up and gaining badges. missions can also be opened and completed collaboratively with a crew referring to a set of drivers who are playing together.
