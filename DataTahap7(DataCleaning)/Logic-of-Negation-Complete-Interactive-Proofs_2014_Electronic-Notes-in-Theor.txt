the subject matter of this paper is classical normal modal logic of non-monotonic interactive proofs, i.e., a novel modal logic of negation-complete and thus disjunctive interactive proofs(ldiip) and an existing modal logic of non-disjunctive and thus negation-incomplete interactive proofs(liip)(cf. and).(we abbreviate interactivity-related adjectives with lower-case letters.)



our immediate motivation for ldiip is first the theoretical concept and second the practical application of a negation-complete variant of our interactive proofs[20,19,17]. the overarching motivation for ldiip is to serve in an intuitionistic foundation of interactive computation. see for a programmatic motivation.
