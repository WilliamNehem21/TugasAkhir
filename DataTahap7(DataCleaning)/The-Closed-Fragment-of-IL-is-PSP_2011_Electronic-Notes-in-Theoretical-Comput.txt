not for all modal logics it is the case that the l0 is simpler than l. in particular, it is known that the minimal modal logic k and its closed fragment k0 are both pspace complete(see[3, corollary 4]). the same also happens for the modal logic k4 of transitive frames(see also).



if in addition to this we would know that il is in pspace we would obtain pspace completeness. it is commonly held that indeed the complexity of full il is pspace-compleet, but up to now nobody has yet proven this. it came as a bit of a surprise to the authors to find out that actually no complexity results in the field of interpretability logics are known. thus, this short note could well be the precursor to further investigations in various interpretability logics on very natural complexity questions in the otherwise mature field of interpretability logic.
