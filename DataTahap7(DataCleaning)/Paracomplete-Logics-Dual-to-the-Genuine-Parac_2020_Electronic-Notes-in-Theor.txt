the usefulness of a logic depends on the available connectives in its language: thus, as we have pointed out in the introduction, for talking about paracompleteness we need a negation and a disjunction satisfying particular conditions. however, we are going to complete the language with an appropriate conjunction and an appropriate implication. in definition 2.3 we establish some conditions on connectives so they can be considered as conjunction, disjunction, and implication.
