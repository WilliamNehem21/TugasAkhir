robot operating system(ros) is an open-source firmware architecture, mainly designed for the development of robotic tools. it consists of several libraries which are capable of performing complex tasks such as navigation robots, multiple robot coordination assisted with machine vision and sensor integration. araujo et al.(2015) developed a mobile robot platform using an arduino board controlled by ros. the control trajectory at the specified linear speed of the manipulator. further, acceleration at the beginning and deceleration at the end of the trajectory were provided to maintain smooth actuation. once, the manipulator reached the target position, sgf sent a handshake signal to the pgf through serial bus to continue the cycle for the next position.



coupled with the platform. thus, the rotation of the stepper motor was converted into a linear motion in z direction. a parallel jaw gripper was attached to the robot arm at the connecting point of the two passive links. the gripper was made to open and close using a servo motor. another servo motor mounted on the passive link was attached to the gripper to provide the rotary motion of the gripper in planner coordinates. four limit switches were provided at the robot arm frames to act as sensing boundary of the robot arm. two limit switches(limit switches 1 and 2) sensed the boundary position of the active robot joints. the limit switches 3 and 4 detected the upper and lower boundary positions



developed firmware was successfully implemented on an embedded hardware to pick and drop of pot seedlings loaded on a feeding conveyor using a parallel robot arm with an average cycle time of 3.5 s with a success rate of 93.3%.
