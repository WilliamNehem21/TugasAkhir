schnorr trivial real, but that there is an r.e. degree that contains no schnorr trivial reals. while this shows that the schnorr trivial turing degrees are not downward closed, the schnorr trivial tt-degrees are downward closed. the work done with reals that are low for schnorr to date has produced an entirely degree-theoretic characterization. let dn denote the nth canonical served. therefore, for these branching points, we will prune the 11 branches of the existing tree. the second is to ensure that 0s only appear in the final tree at its branching points. therefore, if we must remove a branching point, we will prune the 01 and 00 branches at that height and leave only the 11 branch as before.



as previously noted, the schnorr trivial turing degrees are not closed downwards. theorem 4.1 provides additional evidence that the turing degrees are not the appropriate framework in which to consider schnorr triviality, for it suggests that an arbitrarily computationally strong real may have minimal computational complexity.
