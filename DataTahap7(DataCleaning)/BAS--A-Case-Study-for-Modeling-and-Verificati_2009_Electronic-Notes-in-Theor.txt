contract is modeled with ocl expressions on the model level so that the pre/post condition constraints of some methods can be expressed. especially, the ocl expressions as constraints can be added into the transitions of a statechart. thanks to the assertion verification of spin, ocl constraints can be verified. besides,



the rest of the paper is organized as follows. section 2 gives an overview on the framework of tmda, and provides the formulation of some key concepts for the consistency verification. in section 3, we use a bas case study to demonstrate the procedures of model constructing, model verification, model simulation and code generation in the model-driven development process and how to apply the rigorous modeling approach to the practical software development. section 4 summarizes our work and discusses some future work.



the characteristics of the framework are generic and extendable. as have been known, different model checkers, such as spin, fdr, smv can be integrated in the framework for different verification purposes. in tmda, we chose spin as the model checking engine due to its maturity and popularity.



att is a partial function att: c~(attrn~ t). we use c.a: t to denote att(c)(a)= t, and call a an attribute of c and t the type of a. we use attv(c) to denote the set{a: t| att(c)(a)= t} of all the attributes of c.



where k1 is the number of the messages for which n is the class of target object, k2 is the number of massages handled between mi and mi+1. msgij are all those messages from source object to target object. gij is the guard of executing message msgij.
