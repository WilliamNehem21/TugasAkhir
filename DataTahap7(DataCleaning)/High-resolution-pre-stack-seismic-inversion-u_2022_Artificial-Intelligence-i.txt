labeled data in this field, but it is very expensive to get in the field of geophysics. to alleviate the problem of scarce samples, adding constraints to the ann inversion framework to improve network generalization ability has become the choice of many researchers. for example, the ann framework with initial models as constraints(zhang et al., 2021); a convolution neural network(cnn) employing a physics-guided approach and data drive(biswas et al., 2019; sun et al., 2021). song et al.(2022) proposed an inversion framework based on semi-supervised learning. in this work, we employ another ann learning architecture named fsl for high resolution pre-stack seismic inversion of reservoir parameters.
