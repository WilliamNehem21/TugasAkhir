to address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a nichebased two-stage evolutionary algorithm called nacmoea. this algorithm is supported by dual collaborative archives and incorporates a novel strategy for utilizing infeasible solutions. the key characteristics of the proposed approach are outlined below.



the cht based on a dual-archive set was first presented by ctaea. in this approach, the two archive sets have complementary roles to ensure population diversity while promoting population convergence and feasibility. in ccmo framework, a dual-population co-evolutionary strategy based on a weak cooperative relationship is provided. in this strategy, two sub-populations evolve independently and share their offspring in their respective environmental selection stages. the dual-population-based evolutionary algorithm proposed in c-dpea uses an adaptive penalty function to assist evolution using information from infeasible solutions and creates a new objective function to balance population convergence and diversity. in bico, a bidirectional co-evolutionary strategy is introduced to approximate the cpf from both the feasible and infeasible sides. the cmocso framework solves cmops through a competition and cooperation mechanism between two swarm optimizers, effectively improving convergence. for constrained many-objective optimization problems, the moea/d-dae framework offers a detection and escape mechanism that uses the overall constraint violation rate of change to determine whether the population is trapped in a local optimum. in mfo, the constraints of the original cmop are relaxed to create a simpler auxiliary problem; transferring experience gained from solving this auxiliary problem can be helpful in solving the original problem.



in c-anea, an angle-based constraint dominance rule and density estimation method are provided, which give the infeasible solutions with excellent convergence a chance to survive. this helps the population cross the infeasible regions. in ship, a shift-based penalty is imposed on infeasible solutions, retaining those that do not fall into the region dominated by locally feasible nadir after the shift. inspired by multi-task evolution, the mtcmo framework uses a highly related dynamic auxiliary task for the complex original problem and designs an improved constraint relaxation method to leverage high-quality infeasible solutions.



stage. the ppta framework presents a push-pull search strategy based on the assistance of a dual archive, which effectively improves the performance of pps. the dtaea framework suggests a two-phase approach, where the first phase conducts a dual population search based on weak co-evolution and the second phase conducts a feasibilityoriented single population search that drives the population to converge to the final cpf. in dd-cmoea, a dual-stage and dual-population strategy is employed to enhance the search capability of the algorithm by implementing different divisions of labor and collaboration strategies for each population in different stages. in fnds, a population partitioning method based on feasible non-dominated solution sets is proposed, which dynamically divides the entire population into three



cdp is the most representative cht employed in cmoeas, which was originally proposed by deb et al. in nsga-ii. it classifies the population into three categories and assigns a higher selection priority to solutions with high feasibility and excellent convergence. the ben-



the academic community has also recommended some additional chts besides the previously mentioned ones. the c3m framework determines the priority of constraints by analyzing the relationship between multiple constraints, and deals with constraints according to their priority. the nrc framework proposed a multi-objective method based cht, which uses three procedures of non-dominated sorting, reversed non-dominated sorting, and constrained crowding distance sorting to move the population toward to cpf. in moea/d-dpf, a dynamic penalty function approach is developed to solve cmops that is integrated into the moea/d framework in which the parameters gradually change with generation number. in tige-2, with the aim of achieving the balance of performances, three distinct indicators are developed while considering the convergence, diversity, and feasibility. these indicators are then co-optimized using multi-objective techniques.



a dual archive procedure, consisting of a convergence archive(ca) and a feasibility archive(fa), is established for assignment division and collaboration purposes. the ca retains the upf discovered by the algorithm, which is utilized to create angle-based niches. these niches are then employed to partition the objective space and determine the spatial relationship between individuals. as for fa, it functions as the output population responsible for storing elite solutions near the cpf. it employs a niche-based individual updating strategy to strike a balance among convergence, feasibility, and diuals. this approach aims at selecting the most feasible individual within a niche where candidate individuals congregate, thereby enhancing the overall feasibility of the population. in instances where niches are sparsely populated with candidates, this strategy ensures exploration in an approximate direction by selecting the individual closest to that trajectory, thus augmenting population diversity.



in the utilization strategy of infeasible solutions, angle-based niches are employed to provide directional information. feasible and infeasible solutions that lie approximately in the same direction are paired together for generating offspring individuals. these offspring individuals possess the potential to explore the cpf along this approximate direction, thereby enhancing both convergence and diversity of feasible solutions and facilitating the attainment of a complete cpf.



at different stages of the search, dual archives perform distinct roles and collaborate effectively. the transition between these stages is determined by evaluating the non-dominant coverage rate metric, which accurately reflects the dominance relationship of the current generation population compared to its history counterparts. in stage one, our proposed approach can rapidly converge to upf since the influence of constraints is relatively weak. at this stage, the obtained upf is saved



in the experimental section, we compare the proposed algorithm with seven other advanced cmoeas on a total of 28 test problems from the lir-cmop and mw test sets. these test problems encompass various forms of feasible regions, effectively validating the performance of cmoea across different types of cmops. the statistical results demonstrate that nacmoea outperforms the compared algorithms in terms of overall performance. to further validate the effectiveness of components in nacmoea, we compare two variants with the original nacmoea using mw suite. the experimental findings reveal that incorporating a dual archive cooperation mechanism and an infeasible solution utilization strategy significantly enhance the performance of nacmoea.



through an analysis of the limitations of existing cmoeas, this paper proposes a multi-stage framework based on the niche technique. this study substantiates the significance of a balanced strategy encompassing convergence, feasibility, and diversity. furthermore, it unveils the potential of infeasible solutions in exploring unknown feasible regions and enhancing algorithm performance. while the proposed algorithm exhibits promising results in experiments, there is scope for extending its application to tackle more challenging cmops. for instance, improvements can be made to environment selection and archive update strategies while augmenting selection pressure to address manyobjective constrained optimization problems. additionally, embedding multi-modal optimization techniques could prove beneficial for solving constrained multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems.
