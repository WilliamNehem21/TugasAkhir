in this paper, the concepts of scott s-sets, weakly local s-compactness and s-bases of posets are introduced. with these new concepts, some characterizations of supercontinuous(resp., superalgebraic) posets are given. in order to provide a topological interpretation of s-bases, the new concept of the s-essential topology on posets is also introduced. properties and characterizations of s-bases via the s-essential topology are obtained. main results are:(1) a poset l is supercontinuous iff every two different points can be separated introduced and extensively studied(see-). lawson in gave a remarkable characterization that a dcpo is continuous iff its scott topology is completely distributive. since some naturally arisen posets are important but fail to be directed complete, there are more and more occasions to study posets which miss suprema of directed sets(see-,-). by the technique of embedded bases and sobrification via the scott topology, xu in successfully embedded continuous posets into continuous domains and proved that a poset is continuous iff its scott topology is completely distributive.



directed if every finite subset of d has an upper bound in d. a poset l is a directed complete partially ordered set(dcpo, for short) if every directed subset of l has a supremum. a complete lattice is a poset in which every subset has a supremum.



tributive lattices, need not be continuous in general. in this paper, we introduced the concept of scott s-sets of posets. by remark 3.3, scott s-sets of a poset are all scott open sets of the poset and the scott s-sets of a complete lattice need not be a topology. however, by our theorems 3.7, 3.10 and 3.19, we see that scott s-sets play roles in characterizing supercontinuous posets similar to that of scott open sets in characterizing continuous posets.
