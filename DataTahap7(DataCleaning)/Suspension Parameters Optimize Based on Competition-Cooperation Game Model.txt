also multi-objective optimization has been put up for many years, the application of multi-objective optimization to solve engineering problems never decay. the most important thing in solving multi-objective optimization engineering problems is find the pareto-optimal solutions. on many occasions, there are no paretooptimal solutions[1-3]. so it is imminent to find a good way to solve multi-objective optimization problems. in recent decades, there appeared many algorithms, such as ant colony, genetic, particle swarm, artificial fishswarm, and the corresponding improved algorithms etc.



the goal of multi-objective optimization is to find the optimize value. while the game theory, is to find each game party's own maximum profit. they have the same similarity: finding the pareto solution. game theory is used to solve multi-objective optimization problems, especially in engineering fields. based on the game party's behavior, game theory can be divided into cooperative, selfish and non-cooperative game.
