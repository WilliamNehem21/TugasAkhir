a model for random simplicial complexes of higher dimension was recently introduced and studied by linial, meshulam and wallach, see,. the fundamental groups of random 2-complexes are random groups of a fairly general type. important progress in understanding this model of random groups was made recently by babson, hoffman and kahle.
