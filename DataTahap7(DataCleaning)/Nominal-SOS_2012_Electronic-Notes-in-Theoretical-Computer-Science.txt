the subscripts of nominal terms control sorting and we tend to omit them when they are clear from the context or immaterial. we call[a]t an abstraction. we have not introduced any means to introduce pairs of terms, as we only use product sorts to give a sort to transition relations(see section 3).



fa(t) is the set of atoms a in a(t) that have an occurrence in t that is not within the scope of an abstraction[a]tj, for some term tj. we call fa(t) the set of free atoms of t. for example, fa(f([a]g(a, b)))={b} and also fa(g(f([a]a), a)={a}.



we say that a nominal term is closed if it contains no variables. it is called open otherwise. for example, a and[a]f(b) are closed terms, but x and[a]y are open terms. note that neither a nor[a]f(b) is binding-closed.



the reader should notice that this definition is the very basic formulation of open bisimilarity, which does not involve distinctions, see and. in definition 5.2, it is important to note that the ranging over all the substitutions is performed at each step of the bisimulation game.
