the class of trss that satisfy the conditions of theorem 5.8 is a superclass of the class of trs that satisfy the conditions of corollary 4.17. the class of semiconstructor trss and the class of trss that satisfy the conditions of theorem 5.8 are not included in each other.



it is not difficult to implement the procedures in proofs of theorem 3.9, theorem 4.15 and theorem 4.22. the class of semi-constructor trss are a rather small class: approximately 3% of the trss in the termination problem data base 4.0 are in this class. we can extend the decidable classes if we succeed in developing a method for good approximated dp-graphs.
