later proved interpolation of all normal modal logics via amalgamation in. this result was extended for multi-modal logics in. in, marx proved interpolation for several modal logics with a technique based on bisimulation. this work includes interpolation proofs for k, fibered modal logics and the multi-modal logics of knowledge and belief. in all the above works, interpolation is proved by semantics or algebraic methods. although these methods are quite general and can be applied to several logics, they not provide an explicit construction of interpolants. in the



computation of interpolants can also be applied in the construction of explicit definitions from implicit ones. we also described a construction like this in order to prove the beth definability theorem for km. computation of explicit definitions is known important in query rewriting algorithms, whose application domain is extensive to several areas in computer science. it is then clear our motivation on interpolant size complexity as future work.
