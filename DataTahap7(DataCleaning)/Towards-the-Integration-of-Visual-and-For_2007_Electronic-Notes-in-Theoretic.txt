in previous work, the authors have developed several extensions to the modelbased testing environment spec explorer to foster its application for gui testing and address some of the above issues: techniques and helper libraries for modelling guis in spec; a gui mapping tool to automate the mapping between the gui model and the implementation; and a tool to avoid test case explosion taking into account the hierarchical structure of guis. further details can be found in. the results achieved have received significant interest from modellers and testers.
