at the syntactic level, we have the problematic issue of binders and scope of local names. at the operational semantic level, we have the issue of ensuring freshness conditions for names. at the model-theoretic level, we have the issue of providing a coalgebraic(final) semantics. finally, from the practical point of view, a finite representation for finitary processes is desirable[9,11,14].



notice that k is an upper bound of the domain of the reindexing functions between all descendents of p and q. thus, since m(k, k) is finite, there are only finitely many candidate relations to be indexed bisimulations. hence, we have an algorithm for deciding bisimilarity of finitary processes.
