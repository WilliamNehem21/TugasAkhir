relation algebras are extensions of boolean algebras; whereas boolean algebras model subsets of a given set, relation algebras model binary relations on a given set. relation algebras have operations such as relational composition and relational converse, and boolean operations such as intersection(conjunction) and complement(negation). relation algebras form the basis of relational databases and of the specification and proof of correctness of programs, particularly in the style of mili.



which searches for a term of the specified type(i.e., searches for a derivation of the stated rule) and instantiates ssasl with that term. in this example, because twelf allows substituting for x1 and y1 in the query as well as for the variables x and y in the declarations of sa and ss, the search proceeds along an infinite branch in the wrong direction.



where oo denotes function composition. tactics were written to determine the type of a term(ie, to determine the derived rule obtained by a given combination of rules), by solving a goal such as sa oo ss:?t(which contains the type variable?t). we explored tactics to search for a term of a given type(ie, a proof of a given term), by solving a goal such as the one below, which contains the term variable?p.
