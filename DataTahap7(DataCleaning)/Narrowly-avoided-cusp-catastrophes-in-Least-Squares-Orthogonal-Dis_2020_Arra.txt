{d2f/daidaj n . the aim of the optimization is to find the critical points where l = 0, while the rate of convergence to the optimum solution will be governed by the second-order response matrix m. the character of the solution, whether it is a minimum or saddle point, will be determined by the eigenvalues of m. these eigenvalues are a measure of the curvature of f when moving in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector. the gradient l can be expressed [[12], ch.2] as



use to set the determinant of m+ to zero. in effect, it defines a sub- manifold within which a crossing of solutions becomes theoretically possible. we now need to derive appropriate conditions for this to occur. the function h(u) can be calculated as follows. taking a derivative of



ever, we do not need the entire streamline, just a set of intermediate points between two critical points. we evaluate these approximately using the method of steepest descent [[23], p.121]: calculate a pre- liminary estimate of a by linearly interpolating between a saddle point and a local minimum. then perform some iterations of the steepest
