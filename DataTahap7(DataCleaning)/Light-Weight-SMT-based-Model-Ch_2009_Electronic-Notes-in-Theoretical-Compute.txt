5 the first part of(i) can be weakened to local finiteness as in; while the second part is satisfied in all practical cases(when, e.g., the models of ti are all(finite) sets, linear orders, graphs, forests, etc.). quantifier elimination for te is assumed in to show closure under pre-image computation: here we do not need it, as we adopt a more restricted notion for t-formulae.



at this point, it is interesting to consider our formalization of parametrised systems in the stopping failures model. recall, from section 2, that no transition is enabled when control reaches the additional state qcrash. this suggests a[s]/= qcrash as an obvious candidate for expressing an activity condition in such systems.
