this paper is a study of the denotational semantics of freshly generated names in a continuation-passing style(cps) setting. freshly generated names are a key element of many computational effects, and are also intrinsically interesting; they may be used to represent secrets such as cryptographic keys, for example. the behaviour of names in a functional setting is rather subtle, and has been studied, via prototypical calculi such as the nu-calculus, using both operational and denotational techniques.
