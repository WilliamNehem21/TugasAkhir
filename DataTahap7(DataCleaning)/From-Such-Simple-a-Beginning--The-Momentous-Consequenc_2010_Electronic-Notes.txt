13 whether general-purpose computation can be carried out at all by an invertible mechanism or within an invertible medium had been seriously questioned(cf., e.g.,[7,1]), until it was finally shown that such a feat is in principle possible, though generally at the cost of more complex computational infrastructure[3,17,18,10,5].
