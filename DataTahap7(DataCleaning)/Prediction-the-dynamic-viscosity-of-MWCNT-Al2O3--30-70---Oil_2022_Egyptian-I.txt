variations. ann is generated and tested with experimental data sets and the results show that there was a good agreement between the actual and predicted ann values. moreover, the results of ann simulation are compared with other data processing methods such as support vector machine(svm), partial least squares(pls), principal component regression. in addition, the results of the residual value of ann



the development of the lubricant industry is an important part of the improvement of the machine industry and other related industries. statistical data show that with a small increase in the cost of producing and choosing a better lubricant, many additional and undesirable costs can be reduced. this is due to the important and beneficial effects of using lubricants, which can reduce the amount of friction between parts with a relative motion by separating them with a film of oil, and cooling the engine and its internal components, thereby reducing thermal stresses and longer life. lubricants also seal the contact parts to prevent the diffusion of gases and fluids containing particles and carry particles due to wearing down of engine components between moving parts and collect them in the filter wall. in recent years, with the advancement of technology, the use of nanomaterials in different fields of engineering and various industries has been considered by researchers. these include the dispersion of nanoparticles in a base fluid leading to the formation of a nanofluid, first proposed by choi presented a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on lnf and knf. they found higher values for these parameters of the nanofluid in comparison with the base fluids. it was reported that increasing the svf would increase lnf and knf. moreover, they denoted that the temperature would strongly influence knf. aladag et al. examined the dependency of lnf of cnt/water and al2o3/water nanofluids on the temperature and shear rates(sr)



at low temperatures and svfs. depending on sr, the nanofluid suspensions display newtonian or non-newtonian behaviors. hojjat et al. studied three types of non-newtonian nanofluids and measured their rheological characteristics with different svfs at various temperatures. the dependency of the rheological properties of the nanofluids on the svf and temperature was reported. also, their results show that all nanofluids display pseudo-plastic behavior. recently, researchers have paid attention to a new class of nanofluids containing a combination of different nanoparticles,



multi-layer anns with back propagation(bp) learning algorithm were used to predict lnf of mwcnt-al2o3(30:70)/ oil 5w50 hybrid nano-lubricant. data used in this work is taken from literature. back propagation is an ann algorithm which, performed learning on a multilayer feed-forward ann. in order to achieve



the outputs a large number of inter-connected processors called neurons organized in layers. a three-layer(input, hidden and output) ann with a large number of nodes in each layer connected the knowledge of inputs with outputs. the strength(weights) of connections are achieved through a learning process. the main objec-



the simulated ann output. from this, we can conclude that the experimental data are close to the simulated ann and accurately predict the results. the ann was generated and tested using the collected experimental datasets and the results show that there was a good match between the actual and predicted values of the ann.



c= 0.3333333. partial least squares regression(pls) regression is a fast, efficient, and optimal covariance-based regression method that is recommended for regressions with many explanatory variables[55,56]. the explanatory variables tend to correlate. pls is a transformer or regressor and is in many ways similar to pcr. it also shrinks the sample before using the linear regressor on the transformed data. the main difference from pcr is that pls transformation is monitored[50,57].
