another solution for ensuring interoperability across devices in the iot perception layer is to utilize the mqtt protocol to handle the heterogeneous data produced by various smart objects. mqtt is a messaging protocol that allows devices to connect through a central server known as a broker, which is responsible for relaying data from machine to machine. mqtt is based on a publish/subscribe paradigm of operation. however, the widespread adoption of the mqtt protocol has also attracted the attention of cyber attackers who can launch different types of attacks, including lr-ddos attacks. the lr-ddos attack is



lr-ddos attacks are a major threat to iot systems, particularly those relying on the mqtt protocol. these attacks can congest network traffic, overload devices, and exhaust system resources, leading to service interruptions and data breaches. lr-ddos attacks are difficult to detect and mitigate, making them attractive to attackers. traditional detection mechanisms have difficulty differentiating between normal and malicious traffic, which allows attackers to move undetected. in addition to being susceptible to lr-ddos attacks, iot devices are also often resource-constrained, which makes them more vulnerable. due to their limited memory, processing power, and battery life, iot devices are unable to support complex security mechanisms. they are susceptible to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in their communication protocols.



researchers have proposed various detection and mitigation mechanisms to address the challenge of lr-ddos attacks on iot systems. however, only some of these mechanisms could be more efficient or impractical due to the resource constraints of iot devices. therefore, there is a need for an effective and efficient mechanism that can detect lr-ddos attacks based on the mqtt protocol in software-defined iot environments.



the remaining parts of this article are structured in the following manner: in section 2, the literary works are presented and summarized. section 3 provides the specifics of the proposed scheme, the methodology for evaluating its efficacy in detecting and preventing low-rate ddos attacks, and details on experiments conducted. section 4 analyzes the obtained results, compares the implemented schemes, and benchmarks the optical scheme with other state-of-the-art models. finally, section 5 concludes the article and suggests potential future directions.



lr-ddos attacks have been on the rise in iot networks, leading to the development of various techniques to detect and mitigate them. the use of machine learning(ml) algorithms has gained significant attention in detecting and mitigating ddos attacks due to the increasing number of iot devices and their susceptibility to cyber-attacks. the literature review has been divided into three categories:(1) lr-ddos attacks based on iot networks,(2) ddos attacks based on mqtt protocol in iot environment, and(3) ddos attacks in a software-defined iot environment.



proposed a method named hmm-rf, which combines the hidden markov model and random forest classifier to identify lr-ddos attacks in cloud data centers. the hidden markov model analyzes traffic flow features, while the random forest classifier differentiates between normal and attacked flow based on the predicted attack level. renyi entropy is used to calculate attack probabilities.



in, ghannadrad aimed to detect and classify dos attacks for mqtt sensor networks by simulating a smart home scenario and collecting reliable data. ghannadrad proposed a realistic mqtt-based dataset that includes legitimate and malicious flow-level traffic. online and offline machine learning(ml) solutions were presented for detecting and classifying dos attacks. through the evaluation of the study, the author successfully differentiated between malicious and legitimate traffic as a binary classification, and the classifiers were able to detect and classify different categories of dos attacks in a multi-value classification. ghannadrad simulated a smart house scenario and collected credible data to detect and classify mqtt sensor network dos attacks. ghannadrad presented a realistic mqtt-based dataset, including valid and malicious flow-level communication. online and offline machine learning(ml) systems detected and classified dos ascould detect and categorize multiple dos attack categories as multi-value classifications. aldhyani and alkahtani proposed an ml-based ids for mqtt protocol in iot networks using four algorithms, with the cnn-lstm model having the highest precision of 98.94%. the proposed frameworks and solutions effectively detected attacks in blockchain iot and mqtt networks.



an entropy-based technique for identifying and thwarting ddos assaults in iot networks utilizing sdn is proposed by galeano-brajones et al.. the approach is based on the openstate protocol, an addition to the openflow protocol that enables sdn switches to save details about previously handled flows, lessening the burden on the controller. the writers use entropy to spot malicious traffic and create filtering rules et al. developed a feed-forward neural network model to recognize dos and ddos attacks that use various activities. when the model was put through its paces using the botiot dataset, it effectively detected ddos attacks using 8 or 10 features, attaining an accuracy rate of 99.99% overall. the adam optimization technique and a hyperbolic tangent activation function are used for each neuron in the neural net-



minimum number of essential features that enable the prediction at the highest accuracy and maximum prediction speed(i.e., lightweight). as a result, only two main features(csum and src_port) have been finally used to develop the proposed lightweight detection system to capture the lr-ddos attack based on mqtt protocol in software defined-iot ecosystems.



this paper presents, discusses, and evaluates a new intelligent system to investigate the impact of lr-ddos attacks based on the mqtt protocol in the sd-iot ecosystem. specifically, the proposed system employs several supervised learning schemes to distinguish lr-ddos traffic from legitimate traffic. to evaluate the performance of the learning models, a new dataset, lrddos-mqtt-2022, extracted from real-time traffic of sd-iot communication comprising both ddos attacks and normal packets, has been used. the minimum number of input features has been used to train the learning models with a balanced number of samples per class(100,000 samples for normal traffic and 100,000 samples for lr-ddos traffic) to obtain the swiftest traffic prediction rate. as a result, the detection-based dtc model has reported the highest accuracy proportion, with 99.5% at the lowest prediction lagging. in the future, we will seek to investigate other types of cyberattacks based on the mqtt protocol in the sd-iot ecosystem, such as brute force authentication(bfa) attacks. another perceptible future work is the generation of a real-time or simulated dataset covering diverse iot protocols and attacks. furthermore, mitigation or prevention techniques can be investigated as an extension for the presented detection system to provide a completely autonomous security system. finally, incorporating the analysis of 5g attacks and persistent threats using advanced learning techniques can investigate in a similar context to this research[44,45].
