the literature study exposes that fuzzy filters in many forms have been applied in many diversified filed. however, the issues related to de-noising of noisy texture images are remained as a great challenge. in general, there are two types of noises like impulse(salt and pepper) noise, and random(or gaussian) noise. impulse noise is represented by noise density whereas random noise is expressed in terms of its mean and variance. for impulse noise, maximum portion of an original image remains unchanged, and the image is distinguished by some corrupted samples, which differ intensely. in comparison to impulse noise, random noise is more challenging type of noise. hence, it is an essential task to reduce the random noise effectively in images. in literature many manner to filter the random noise. a nonlinear filter named as moving average filter performs well in removing random noise but neither they can supress impulse noise nor preserves sharp edges of an image. hence, fuzzy filters with membership functions in terms of moving average and median center are taken into consideration for further processing.



from three measurement filters the mef has provided the classification rate of 93.27% on brodatz dataset and 68.50% on stex dataset. the amef has provided classification rate of 86.22% on brodatz dataset and 60.00% on stex dataset. the sdef has delivered the classification rates of 89.42% and 61.00% on brodatz and stex datasets respectively.



fication rate of 92.06% is obtained at m= 3 for the mef. for the highly noisy images the improvement in classification accuracy occurred with higher window size i.e. when rg= 20 classification rate is 89.52% with m= 5, when rg= 25 classification rate is



i.e. 88.14% at rg= 15 and 82.69% at rg= 30. similarly, for the sdef increased classification rates are attained for the window size m= 3 at each level of noise. for the noise levels rg= 10, rg= 15, rg= 20, rg= 25, and rg= 30 the corresponding classification



rates of 89.42%, 87.92%, 88.94%, 86.63%, and 84.94% are attained when rg= 10, rg= 15, rg= 20, rg= 25, and rg= 30 respectively at m= 7 for the sdef. in addition higher classification rates are also obtained with window size m= 3 for lower noise levels for the sdef.



rg= 30 improved classification rates of 89.10%, 88.14% at m= 5, and 89.94%, 87.82% at m= 7 are obtained respectively for the mef. likewise for the amef higher classification accuracies of 89.13%, 87.76%, 88.18%, 88.78%, and 84.62% are achieved when rg= 10, rg= 15, rg= 20, rg= 25, and rg= 30 respectively at



and rg= 30 improved classification rates of 87.67%, 83.97% at m= 5, and when rg= 30 classification rate of 83.65% at m= 7 are obtained respectively for the amef. there is no increment in classification rates at the noise level rg= 10 and rg= 15for the sdef by applying this technique. however it is observed that for the higher noise levels i.e. when rg= 20, rg= 25, and rg= 30 the clas-



sification accuracies are increased to 89.42%, 86.65%, and 84.29% at m= 3 and 87.50%, 87.82%, 84.62% at m= 5 respectively for the sdef. for the window size m= 7 the classification accuracies are increased to 91.67% and 86.65% when rg= 25 and rg= 30 respectively for the sdef.



classification accuracies are not improved by using any of the window sizes. classification rates are not improved for lower noise levels for the amef using any of the window size. however, when rg= 25 and rg= 30 classification rates are improved to 41.00% and 38.00% at m= 7 for the amef. the similar case occurred in sdef, when rg= 25 and rg= 30 classification rates are improved to 47.00% and 40.50% at m= 7.



fication rate of 62.50% is observed only when rg= 10 for the mef. classification rates are not improved for lower noise levels for the amef using any of the window size. however, when rg= 20, rg= 25 and rg= 30 classification rates are improved to 49.50%, 42.00%, and 39.50% at m= 3, 49.00%, 40.50%, and 39.50% at m= 5,
