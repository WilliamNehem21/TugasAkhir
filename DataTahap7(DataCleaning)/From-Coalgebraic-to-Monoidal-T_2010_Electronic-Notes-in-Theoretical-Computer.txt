now that we have seen additive structure on kleisli homsets we can conclude from that we have traced monoidal structure in these kleisli categories. but before we do so we return to section 3 and re-describe the iterate c# of a coalgebra c in terms of the newly discovered sums. this will be used(in the proof of theorem 5.2) to show that the induced traced monoidal structure coincides with the coalgebraic trace.
