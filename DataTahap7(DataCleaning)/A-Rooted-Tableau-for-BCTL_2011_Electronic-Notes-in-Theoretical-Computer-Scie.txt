the closure set is linear in the length of the input formula. we see that the number of hues is singly exponential in the size of the closure set, the number of colours are exponential in the number of hues. we only apply rules to the rule nodes, and there is at most one rule node per colour. each step is at worst polynomial in the number of colours, or singly exponential in the number of hues. thus bctl*rtab will halt in an amount of time at worst doubly exponential in the length of the formula.
