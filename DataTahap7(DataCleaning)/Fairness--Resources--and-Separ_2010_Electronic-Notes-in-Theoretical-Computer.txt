2 our emphasis on prefixes does not contradict the fact that fairmerge is non-monotone with respect to the prefix ordering on traces. our results do run counter to the longstanding tendency to conclude from non-monotonicity that fairness is beyond the denotational pale. lack of monotonicity turns out to be irrelevant in our approach.



there is an extensive literature concerning various alternative notions of fair interleaving, characterized in different settings, notably earlier definitions based on automata and oracles[14,15,16,19,22] and a significant collection of work using traces of some kind[10,12,24,26]. a major aim in much of this prior work was to generalize the kahn principle to dataflow networks containing non-deterministic processes. a number of strikingly original and surprising results have been obtained concerning the relative expressive power of various variant forms of fair merge in dataflow networks[19,20]. since fairness is a key factor in the semantics of concurrent programs, it is not surprising that the concepts, and some of the technical details, made explicit in our approach may have implicit or explicit roots in prior literature. however, our development shows how to spell out the details carefully in a general setting, avoiding the use of book-keeping machinery such as oracles, and avoiding the need to tag and untag actions with channel labels that typically appears in dataflow semantics. moreover, unlike most of the earlier work, our formulation permits straightforward derivation of natural algebraic properties such as associativity.
