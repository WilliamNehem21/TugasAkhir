plasma will dash to the wall of vacuum vessel and disrupt without control. it causes failure of discharge, the high heat load stress and a lot of runaway electrons caused by the disruption may be serious or even destructive. so the feedback control system must be built to control vertical displacement of plasma.



passive feedback and active feedback are two methods to restrain plasma vertical displacement. passive feedback is a kind of fast response on millisecond level. once plasma moves at vertical direction, conductor around the plasma(such as the metal wall of vacuum vessel) will induce eddy current, which will produce magnetic field. the radial component of the magnetic field br interacting with the plasma current produces lorentz force at opposite direction to plasma, so that the vertical displacement is suppressed. the passive feedback to plasma vertical displacement in east is formed by double layer stainless steel vacuum vessel and two pairs of passive conductor plate. but passive feedback will be weakening after the conductor diffusion time because the eddy current will be dissipated by conductor resistance. therefore, active feedback is needed for slow disturbance beyond the diffusion time scale. method of active feedback is to detect plasma's vertical displacement and feed it back to the control power supply, then excitation current in the active feedback coils will be built, and magnetic field will be product to restrain the plasma's vertical displacement.



there are two kinds of controller in power supply. one is system controller that controls the coil current according to the demand of plasma control and performs protection. the output of this controller is divided by 24 to controller in each inverter unit based on current feedback.
