chen, chen, feng, yu, lin, et al. reported findings from genome-wide analysis in 102,900 taiwan biobank(twb) participants across 36 human quantitative traits. a total of 1,986 significant loci were identified, and comparative analyses with biobank japan, uk biobank, and previous gwass revealed 968 novel loci. we also showed the utility of cross-phenotype, crosspopulation polygenic risk scores in disease risk prediction. these results highlight the potential to advance gene discovery with diverse populations.





statistics from bbj and ukbb, we found that the genetic architecture for the quantitative traits examined was largely consistent within eas and between eas and eur populations. integrating twb and bbj gwass identified a total of 3,825 genetic loci(3,382 for 24 traits from eas meta-analysis and 443 for 12 traits from twb alone), among which 968 had not been reported in previous gwass. we additionally fine-mapped over 200 association signals to a single variant with pip>95% and identified 24 putative causal missense variants that implicated novel genes underlying quantitative traits. lastly, our prs analysis demonstrated the potential utility of biomarker gwas in predicting disease risk and the promise of multi-trait cross-population polygenic prediction.



as an application of the biobank resources, we utilized biomarker gwas summary statistics from twb, bbj, ukbb, and international consortia to predict disease risk. we used a recently developed polygenic scoring methodology, prscsx,39 to jointly model biomarker gwass from eas and eur samples, and we designed a prs validation and testing strategy to obtain the optimal weights for combining multiple biomarker prss into a single predictor. we showed that polygenic prediction for disease risk can be improved by incorporating multiple biomarker prss derived from gwass in diverse populations. these results suggest that expanding biobank resources to collect a wider range of biomarkers with larger sample sizes in diverse populations may further improve the clinical utility of prss.42



we note that, despite the large number of novel loci identified, the current study was limited to 36 quantitative traits for the genome-wide association analysis and 5 diseases for polygenic prediction that were made available for our study. expanding the analyses to a wider range of quantitative and disease phenotypes is warranted as the ongoing sample and data collection efforts in twb continue. in addition, the collective sample size of twb and bbj remains relatively small compared with genetic studies in eur populations. future endeavors on increasing the sample size and phenotype coverage in twb, in east asia and in other non-european populations, and improving crossbiobank data harmonization will facilitate genetic discovery for human complex traits.

study permissions the access to and use of the taiwan biobank data in the present work was approved by the ethics and governance council(egc) of taiwan biobank(approval number: twbr10907-05) and the institutional review board(irb) of national health research institutes, taiwan(approval number: ec1090402-e). the data collection of taiwan biobank was approved by the ethics and governance council(egc) of taiwan biobank and the department of health and welfare, taiwan(wei-shu-i-tzu no.1010267471). taiwan biobank obtained informed consent from all participants for research use of collected data. only publicly available gwas summary statistics, without individual-level information, were used from biobank japan(bbj) and uk biobank(ukbb).



after pre-imputation qc, we used eagle v2.444 for pre-phasing and minimac445 for genotype imputation with 1kg phase 3 data as the reference panel. we performed post-imputation qc by retaining variants with imputation info>0.6 and maf>0.5% for the downstream analyses, which included up to 8,190,806 variants for discovery batch 1 and 8,156,315 variants for discovery batch 2, respectively. the imputed dataset included a total of 92,615 samples for loci discovery(27,033 samples for discovery batch 1 and 65,582 samples for discovery batch 2), and 12,997 samples for polygenic risk score(prs) analysis. we further restricted the prs analysis to 10,285 unrelated individuals that were also unrelated with the discovery gwas samples. we note that while most of the phenotypes examined in this study were measured on the large majority of the discovery samples, the final analytic sample size of gwas reduced to 62,901(17,111 from discovery batch 1 and 45,790 from discovery batch 2) for fev1, fvc and fev1r, and 65,360(19,509 from discovery batch 1 and 45,851 from discovery batch 2) for afp due to missing phenotypic data.





by self-reported paternal and maternal places of ancestral origin of holo, hakka, and northern and southern han chinese.6 we only retained twb samples with the same paternal and maternal place of origin for this prs distribution comparison.
