stress and strain fields for a given structure can be calculated using several techniques [5]. the most common and available ones can be found in several commercial packages employing the finite element method (fem) [6] or the boundary element method (bem) [7]. nowadays, new techniques based on mesh less methods such as the extended finite element model (xfem), are emerging and have several advantages compared to the traditional methods, particularly in problems of fracture mechanics [8].



the position of defect (internal, middle or external) has a large effect on the impedance. obtained results show the great sensitivity of the differential sensor with respect to the detection of the surface defects. however, the major disadvantage of this type of sensor lies in the fact that it is unable to detect a defect located between two reels.
