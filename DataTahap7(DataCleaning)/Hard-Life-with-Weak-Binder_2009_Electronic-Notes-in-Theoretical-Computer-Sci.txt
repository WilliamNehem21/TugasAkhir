a further contribution is a trace inclusion preorder for weakly bound processes: when p q, the traces of p are included in those of q. we compare this preorder with a trace inclusion preorder for strongly bound processes. preorders of processes are a relevant and non-trivial aspect of subtyping/subeffecting for type and effect systems. also, thay can be udes to study the compliance of contracts with implementations and subcontract relations in calculi for web services[5,6].



we shall now introduce a preorder p n q on weakly bound processes. here, we use a set of names n as an index to the preorder relation. this index is needed to avoid name confusion, as we shall see below. when p n q holds, then the semantics of p is included in that of q(second item of theorem. 5.7).
