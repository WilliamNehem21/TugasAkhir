however, the above mentioned methods have some restrictions and disadvantages. for instance, there is a big difference between the results obtained by dtm, but as we have shown in examples there is a small point wise absolute error between the numerical result obtained by rk4 and the exact value. the classical rk4 is widely used for solving initial value problems and provides approximations which converge to the true solution as h approaches zero[8,9].
