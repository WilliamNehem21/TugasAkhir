the proof proceeds by induction on the complexity of the cut inferences. below, we present the principal cases of the cut elimination transformation: the cases where a cut on a complex cut formula is replaced by a cut on its subformula, thus decreasing the complexity. the other cases follow the same ideas.



in(7) and(8), isotone cuts(c1; c3) on the complex formula a0 are replaced by antitone cuts(c4; c2). similarly for cuts on 0a.(we use double lines for the instantiation of the premise that makes a logical rule applicable.)



from this comparison the following conclusions can be drawn:(i) there could be contexts where both ppi and api are felicitous(e.g. conditionals and modal operators);(ii) there could be non-veridical operators which do not license polarity items(eg. in italian fci are not allowed in conditionals),(iii) there can be other sorts of polarity items sensitive to these and to other kinds of non-veridical expressions.
