the qarara formation consists mainly of shale at the base and overlain by limestone at the top. the formation is middle eocene(lutetian) in age. three sections located at the eastern bank of the nile river in el-minya province have been measured, described, and sampled. these sections from north to south are: gebel qarara, el-sheikh fadl, and gebel el-ahmar. the main microfacies identified in the studied sections are: silty claystone, silty shale, fossiliferous glauconite, glauconitic(green) sand, glauconitic fossiliferous ironstone, glauconitic bioclastic wacke-packstone, glauconitic bioclastic lime-mudstone-wackestone. these



interpretation: glauconite forms exclusively in marine environments. mcrae stated that the accumulation of glauconite in large quantities indicates a low rate of sedimentation with normal marine salinity and weakly reducing environments. because glauconite is slow to form, it is usually common with a transgression of relative sea level.



shale and claystone in the studied qarara formation were deposited in a quiet water environment. the presence of glauconite represents a condensed setting in an overall calm environment[23,24]. the carbonate microfacies are deposited in inner ramp settings because of the presence of larger foraminifera and bivalves.

from these cycles and facies changes, the deposition of the three sections has been affected by initial stages of sea level rise. the gebel qarara section was deposited under deeper conditions than el-sheikh fadl and gebel el-ahmar sections due to the presence of glauconitic bioclastic lime-mudstonewackestone microfacies. this is in line with the concept of sea transgression during the eocene period, as gebel qarara section lies in the north(i.e. deeper than the other two sections).

shale and claystone of the studied qarara formation deposited in quiet water settings. the presence of glauconite represents a condensed setting in an overall calm environment. the carbonate microfacies are deposited in inner ramp setting because of presence of the larger foraminifera and bivalve fragments.
