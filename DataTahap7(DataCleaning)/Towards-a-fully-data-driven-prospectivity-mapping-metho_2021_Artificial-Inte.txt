the lake sediment geochemical data used for this study, the sampling protocol, analytical methodology, quality control and quality assurance procedures are documented in mccurdy et al. (2016). the survey consists of 3441 samples, including field duplicates, and was sampled at a reso- lution of about one sample per 13 km2. the data used in this study is from a campaign to re-analyze lake sediment samples using modern analytical methods as part of the geological survey of canada's gem program geochemical anomalies related to bedrock mineralization. for one of our workflows, the data was transformed using centered log-ratio (clr) (aitchison, 1982). censored data were replaced with half the detection limit. for a discussion on the appropriateness of the application and ef- fect of log-ratio transformations, particularly as it pertains to data embedding (e.g., feature space geometry), algorithm selection and per- formance impacts for our intended ml task of geochemical anomaly



there have been many approaches to using geochemical composi- tional data, much of it within the multivariate domain. for the purpose of prospectivity mapping, the key goal is to produce maps that correctly identify, with as high selectivity as possible, true geochemical anomalies that are invariably indicative of the locations of mineral occurrences. although the definition of geochemical anomaly has not changed, the methods used to delineate baselines from anomalies have continued to evolve and improve. there has been a general trend of further adoption
