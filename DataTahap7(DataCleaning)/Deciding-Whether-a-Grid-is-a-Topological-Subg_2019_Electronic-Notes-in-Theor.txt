in other words, theorem 1.1 says that finding largest topological grid minors in planar graphs with maximum degree 6 is np-hard. our proof of the previous theorem is a novel reduction, sketched in section 1.4, from the planar monotone 3-sat problem, which is np-complete.



cycle((i, j),(i+ 1, j),(i+ 1,j+ 1),(i, j+ 1)). to add a left arrow in the face f means to replace the edge{(i, j),(i, j+ 1)} by the path((i, j), s1, s2,(i, j+ 1)), where s1 and s2 are new vertices, and to add the edges{(i+ 1, j), s1} and{(i+ 1,j+ 1), s2}. similarly, we define right arrow, up arrow, and bottom arrow.



edge{s2, s3} and a new edge joining s1 to the common vertex of the edges at the bottom and at the right of the face f1. faces f1 and f0 are called bifurcation faces, and f0 is also called the right connection face of the positive bifurcation gadget. this finishes the description of the positive bifurcation gadget. we add some more
