in this work, an adaptive algorithm with variable tap-length is proposed for diffusion networks, where all nodes exchange information with their connected group without a fusion center and utilize both exchanged information and their local observation to make their individual estimations. based on a fractional tap-length solution and the fully distributed structure of networks, we propose the algorithm to resolve the estimation problems on both tap-length and tap-weights. the proposed algorithm with adaptive tap-length structure enables the networks to reduce communication energy and network resources. the convergence properties of this algorithm are confirmed by the simulation results.



within the networks, the tap-length of the adaptive filter at each node is assumed as a fixed value in many applications of distributed adaptive algorithms[9, 10]. nevertheless, when tap-length is unknown or variable it gives rise to the tap-length estimation problem for distributed networks. the incremental adaptive algorithm with the fractional tap-length solution has been proposed before in the literature. this algorithm is based on incremental learning over a distributed network, where a hamiltonian cycle is built to make all the nodes communicate its neighbor at every iteration. the network topology is therefore determined by this type of connection. in order to resolve the tap-length estimation problem within networks with fully distributed structure, we introduce the fractional tap-length solution. in this type of network, each node not only communicates with its neighbors, but also experiences the effect of the entire network. in this paper, the fractional solution is utilized in the proposed distributed variable tap-length algorithm to resolve the both taplength and tap weights estimation problems in a distributed diffusion network. we provide performance analysis for the new algorithm and provide simulation results to confirm its convergence properties.



the remainder of this work consists of 4 parts. section 2 provides the estimation problem which motivates us to formulate the proposed algorithm. and then, the steady-state performance of this algorithm is analyzed in section 3. section 4 shows that the simulation is carried out to confirm the analysis. in section 5, we draw the conclusions.



assume a network consists of n nodes, which are distributed over some area. when two nodes can exchange information with each other in a direct way, we regard them as connected. each node can connect to itself. all the nodes communicating with node k are included in the its neighborhood, which is defined as k. the total number of neighbors of node k is denoted by nk. at each instant i, every node k receives
