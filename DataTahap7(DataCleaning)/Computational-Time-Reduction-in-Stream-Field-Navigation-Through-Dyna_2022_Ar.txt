the local minima problem in the apf algorithms can be solved by estimating obstacles to be cylinders and then calculating fluid stream only around these cylinders using specific potential functions. the downside in this solution is that complex obstacles are approximated to be cylinders and it may not be a valid approximation in some cases. another solution is also introduced in. machine learning techniques



this research introduces another layer of efficiency improvement for the case of the mentioned kinematic environments. in the next section, the mathematical model and the fundamental sfn approach are explained while section 3 shows how a path can be dynamically updated to avoid stream re-calculations in special cases. section 4 show the results and time improvement of the introduced approach.



always generate a path from the start point qs to the goal point qg as long as a path exists. this property is guaranteed as the underlaying physical model ensures the conservation of momentum and mass. in other words, it guarantees that if there is mass flowing inside the system, there will be mass flowing outside.



there are generally two approaches when dealing with the variable field problem, the online approach(the local approach) or the offline approach(the global approach). a robotic system using the former approach updates the path while navigating the environment and while the robot is moving to its target. as for the latter approach, the path is recalculated from the beginning before the robot takes any more actions. in case of an upcoming collision, the local field planner processes the



the experiment is executed 100 times in each field to obtain empirical statistical results of execution times. for each field, the results are expressed as the mean(average) execution time and the standard deviation of the execution times of the 100 runs. the standard deviation is included in the results as the mean by itself is not an effective statistical measure for execution times.
