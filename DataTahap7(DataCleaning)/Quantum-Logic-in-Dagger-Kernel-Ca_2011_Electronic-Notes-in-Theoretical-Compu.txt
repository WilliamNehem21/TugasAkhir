the paper is organised as follows. after introducing the notion of dagger kernel category in section 2, the main examples are described in section 3. factorisation and(co)images occur in sections 4 and 5. finally, section 6 introduces the sasaki hook and and-then connectives via adjunctions, and investigates booleanness.



it remains an open question whether a similar construction can be performed for orthomodular lattices(see), instead of boolean algebras. the straightforward extension of the above construction does not work: in order to get kernels one needs to use the and-then connective(&, see proposition 6.1) for composition; but& is neither associative nor commutative, unless the lattice is boolean.
