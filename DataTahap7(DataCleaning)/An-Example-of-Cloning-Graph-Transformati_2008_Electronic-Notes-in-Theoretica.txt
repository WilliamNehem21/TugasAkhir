the following section briefly introduces the idea of graph transformation with cloning before the problem of flattening statecharts is described in sect. 3. sect. 4 shows the proposed approach of applying graph transformation with cloning to solve this problem. the last section concludes the paper.



this section gives only an informal overview of graph transformation with cloning. details can be found in. the idea is to specify rule schemes which represent an in general infinite number of rule instances by cloning certain subgraphs. before describing the rule schemes, we describe the graphs that constitute their left-hand sides and right-hand sides.



a rule scheme is a double-pushout rule where left-hand side(lhs), interface, and right-hand side(rhs) are patterns, and which uses pattern morphisms as a straightforward extension of graph morphisms. cardinality variables of the rhs have to occur in the lhs also. a rule instance is again a double-pushout rule. a rule is obtained by binding variables of the rhs to the same values as the ones of the lhs and instantiating lhs, interface, and rhs.



also simplified: it may consist of events only; firing conditions and actions are not considered here. also, transitions are not allowed to cross the borders of and-states and or-states. finally, we simplify handling of conflicting transitions. uml statecharts give transitions firing from higher levels priority over those firing from lower levels. we ignore priorities and assume non-determinism for simplicity.



sect. 2 introduced rule schemes which shall here be used for specifying the single transformation steps. they have to be combined with a control program in order to present a complete algorithm for flattening hierarchical statecharts. we do not present the control program in some existing language, but use a rather informal notation as we focus on rule schemes and how they make programming with graph other or-states, is flattened in the second part(line 9 and 10). this procedure has to be repeated because the graph may contain several and-states, and and-states can be nested, i.e., and-states are flattened from the inside out. the operations follow the overview of the algorithm given in sect. 3.



application conditions make sure that this and-state does not contain any andor or-state. this elementary rule is not shown here for space restrictions. the control if possible tries to apply rule mark bottom level and, but simply continues if the rule fails, i.e., if there is no bottom level and-state.



in this paper, we have considered the flattening of hierarchical statecharts as a case study for programming based on graph transformation. space restrictions did only allow to treat simplified statecharts. the missing concepts, like history states, final states, firing conditions, and transition actions as well as enter and exit actions of hierarchical states, can be added in a straight-forward way. a complete specification will be provided in the future.
