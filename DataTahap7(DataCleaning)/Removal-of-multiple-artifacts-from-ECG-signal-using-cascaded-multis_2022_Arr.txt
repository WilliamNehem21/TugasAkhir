adaptive noise cancellation is a method of estimating signals, which are corrupted by additive noise or interference. this method employs a primary input, which is the corrupted signal, and a secondary or reference input, which is the noise correlated with the noise present in the primary input. the reference input is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the primary input in order to obtain the signal estimate. the adaptive noise cancellation method can be employed whenever an appropriate reference input is available[1,2].

the sign adaptive filters are used for the processing and analysis of ecg signals as they are computationally less complex. however, the performance of a sign adaptive filter is compromised because of the clipping effect due to the application of signum function to either the regressor vector, estimation error, or both. the srlms, selms, and sslms algorithms are also known in the literature as the sign regressor algorithm(sra), sign algorithm(sa), and sign-sign algorithm(ssa), respectively. the srlmmn algorithm is a combination of the srlms to remove the respective ecg artifacts as mentioned above. we succeeded in achieving an snr improvement of 12.7319 dbs, which is better than the other compared methods. it is found that the proposed cascaded 4-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the lmmn, lmf, lmmn, lmf algorithms outperforms those that employ the lms, lms, lms, lms algorithms, the lmf, lmf, lmf, lmf algorithms, the lmmn, lmmn, lmmn, lmmn algorithms, and the srlmmn, srlmf, srlmmn, srlmf algorithms in terms of snr improvement. it is also found that the performance of a single-stage adaptive noise canceller employing the sslms algorithm is comparatively poor in terms of snr improvement as compared to the other seven algorithms studied in this work, viz. lms, lmf, lmmn, srlms, selms, srlmf, and srlmmn. the different types of normalized adaptive algorithms and their respective sign counterparts in identifying the best candidates for the removal of multiple artifacts from the ecg signal using adaptive filters in cascade as discussed in this work will be the subject of our future studies.
