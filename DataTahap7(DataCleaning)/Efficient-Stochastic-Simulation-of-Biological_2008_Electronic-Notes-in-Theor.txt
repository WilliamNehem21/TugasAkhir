unfortunately, the mssa inherits the computational complexity of the original ssa with the additional parameter of the number of compartments. this causes any simulation to be unfeasible when the number of compartments grows significantly, as noted in. several improvements of the ssa have already been proposed[8,1,7] but none of them can be applied to the mssa with appreciable gain because of its unique features of considering multiple, stochastically varying volumes.



nevertheless, the computational complexity order of the mssa can be reduced to o(log m+ log c) by exploiting the same data structures proposed in for enhancing directly the ssa. these structures are justified by two observations. the first is that only few propensity functions change at each transition and these can be easily identified by building a dependency graph. the second is that the linear represented by{t 1,...,tc}, contains the informations on the propensity functions of the reactions inside each compartment. this double-tree organisation allows to express the propensity functions independently of their respective volumes, so that they do not need to be recalculated as the volumes change.
