this example demonstrates type-preserving syntax-to-syntax transformations between object-language programs. substitution, which we shall develop in the remainder of this paper, is one such transformation. furthermore, a correct implementation of substitution can be used to build more syntax-to-syntax transformations: we shall provide an implementation of big-step semantics that uses substitution.
