in china, the lng receiving stations almost located in the southeastern areas of it, where the electric power resource is relatively nervous. so that using lng cold energy to generate electricity and supply it to lng receiving station is a reasonable method [6]. for the purpose of researching lng cold energy generation, three different cold energy combined generation process are designed in this paper. in order to get better performance of power generation technology, the cold energy generation capacities of the different process are calculated and compared in the same conditions.



lng is a low temperature liquid mixture, and it has both cold energy and pressure energy. neither the rankine cycle nor the natural gas direct expansion cycle can fully and effectively use this energy. combing natural gas direct expansion with rankine cycle can obtain more energy recovery [9]. in this paper, it designs three kinds of combination process to compare their utilization rate of cold energy generation.



multi-component mixed refrigerant (mfr) is generally the mixture of methane, thane, propane and butane, which is prepared by the raw materials of liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. in this design, through the control of the inlet and outlet temperature for the device of mfr, and the outlet temperature of lng, mfr condenser side reaches the dew point feeding, bubble point discharge, as well as the cold terminal temperature difference of condenser, to determine the composition of mfr. based on the above design principles, the mfr molar composition: ethane is 20%, propane is 70%, and n-butane is 10%.
