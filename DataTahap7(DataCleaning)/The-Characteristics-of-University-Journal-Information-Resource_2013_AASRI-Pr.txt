the basic features and unique superiority of knowledge creativity of university journal information resources provide scientific basis for building a management system of university journal information resources. to set up an effective a management system of university journal information resources, develop rationally journal information resources, make it participate in scientific researches, become a part of college teaching and scientific researches, remote the wide spread of information, and pay attention to the transference and expanding of information. to set up competitive conceptions, change the introversion of journals; and promote spreading of information by network and plural patterns with an open and creative conception.



university journal accumulated a very rich literature information in the long-term scientific research and teaching activities, as well as domestic and international academic exchange activities. it is characterized by a complete disciplines, a wide range covering, rich knowledge content and a strong academic nature. it can directly reflect the development state of university research and teaching with the information resources superiorities of dissemination, application and production of knowledge. the teachers and researchers are not only the user, but also the innovator of knowledge. they have quick thinking, innovative spirit and the conditions of linking theory with practice. universities have the information environment of intensive knowledge, information interchange and rich academic atmosphere which constitute the unique advantages of knowledge innovation.



carry the burden of propagating innovation information, finding and cultivating the innovative talents. university journal is not only the main component of knowledge innovation, but also most sensitive and agile to knowledge innovation. the scientific researches in university journals are the creation and processing of science and technology information. the university journals constantly stimulate inspiration of scientific research, enlighten creative thinking, encourage people to know new scientific principles, open up new research areas, and guide the trend of science and technology. university journal has a contingent of scholars and experts as the main body of authors with high level, and the reliable talent and discipline superiority. this is the never dried up source of innovation and development of the journal. moreover, the knowledge economy provides favorable conditions for the development of university journals and knowledge innovation.the authority and synthesization of university journal information provide strong support for teachers and scientific research personnel to consulting literature, absorbing knowledge nutrition, constantly studying and innovating knowledge.



the scientific management of information resources is a complicated and professional system engineering. the information management personnel need not only professional information knowledge, but also a wide range of all kinds of professional knowledge, and higher information consciousness and professional ethics, then they can handle the information resources management work. they must take the professional road of information, enhance the information consciousness, cultivate information ability, develop and utilize information resources positively.



information ability is a comprehensive ability of collecting information, processing information and transmiting information etc, which is the basic quality that the journal librarians must have. the contemporary science and technology have been developing rapidly, and a lot of interdisciplinary and subject arise, the literature material accumulates rapidly and numerously, the journal literature material also becomes more diverse, complicated and comprehensive. the journal librarians face the various types of professional users who have their own information needs. and the combination and mutual infiltration of teaching and scientific research aggravate the diversity of the need for the information. therefore, only having good information



firstly, strengthen the management of the learned journal, adopt agile service way. the journal reference room collects all of the university journals. in the face of so such journal literatures, only use scientific library management methods for the classification management, make all kinds of journal literature orderly, can we make the teachers and students find the needed journals quickly and effectively, so as to improve the utilization rate of journal literature. at the same time, the service mode should show greater flexibility according to the continuous reform of teaching and research and the development and change of the teachers and students demand. such as combining the service for all teachers and students with the service for key users, combining the information consultation service with active developing user education, combining the first time service with the second time service, etc. the journal reference room should bring convenience to the teachers and students for the use of journal literature, build the connection between the librarian readers, so as to maximizing the development of journal resources.



thirdly, carry out the intelligence research, do a good job of the deep-seated intelligence service work. there are many kinds of academic journals with a sharp rise of literatures. it is very difficult for the teaching and research staff to get their needed document and information, just like looking for a needle in a haystack. so only the deep-level processing of document and information, many ways to reveal the contents of the documents, carrying out a variety of services, can we change the dead material into living information, so as to improve the utilization rate of the journal data.(1) the first time literature service and the latest information services. the first time literature service is to maximize the transforming of static knowledge information into intelligence information for all users. large amount of information accuracy are the characteristics of the first time literature service. the latest information services is to prompt the new arrivals of the journal literature through the forms of information consulting and information columns and so on, and pass them to teachers and researchers at the fastest speed to serve the teaching and research. being new in document and fast in transmission speed is the the characteristics of the latest information services.(2) the second and third times literature services. the fundamental task of the journal information work is to make



the information management consciousness of the journal librarians mainly in three aspects: first, the master consciousness of information systems. the journal librarians should have the strong desire of information and the information development mission to put themselves in the information tides, search and take advantage of all the valuable information on human development, and become the organize and builders of the literature information system. second, the awareness of information dissemination and utilization. the journal librarians should be fully aware of the importance of information dissemination and utilization, take online information dissemination and utilization as a good way of educating information users. make full use of the advantages of online information for the service of teaching and research. third, the open and shared consciousness. the journal librarians should have more wide field of vision, place oneself on the environment of a whole university and social information system, push the mining information to the user and even the social information market with the concept of open information, so as to achieve common development and sharing of information resources in a joint network.



scientific management of information resources is not only the management of information, but also to participate directly in the process of scientific research, to become part of university teaching and research. the characteristics of university journal as a form of information carrier are professional, targeted and extensive amount of information. the task of a journal librarian is not only the literature management, but also offering all kinds of services for the teachers and editors. the journal librarian should provide the latest information, report timely the trend of subject development, establish the special subject database, do a good job of consultation, compile more and faster the high-quality second times and the third times literature, make full use of the information function of all the professional literature resources to ensure editing, teaching and scientific research work smoothly.



the task of scientific management of information resources is to promote the transfer and diffusion of knowledge and information and find demanders. the scientific managements of information make the literature information in disorder into order, make the curing knowledge into activation, through the collection, processing and finishing of literature information, and make the knowledge information spread across space and time with the help of modern communication technology. that not only provides powerful information security for university and college to cultivate useful professionals, but also creates conditions for vocational training and continuing education in order to improve the quality of citizens. at the same time, cultural information can be transformed into implicit knowledge assets, and then into productive forces, through the information consultation and the popularization and introduction of information and other activities.that promote the development of social economy. this is the core task of scientific management of information. to set up competitive conceptions, change the introversion of journals; and promote spreading of information by network and plural patterns with an open and creative conception.
