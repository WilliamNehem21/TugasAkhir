in order to show the relevance of the proposed optimisations, we devise several classes of conditional formulas. each class has a characteristic general shape, defining its complexity w.r.t. different parts of the algorithms and thus exhibiting specific advantages or disadvantages of each algorithm:



the tests were conducted on a linux pc(dual core amd opteron 2220s(2800mhz), 16gb ram). it is obvious that a significant increase of performance may be obtained through the proposed optimisations. in general, the performance of the implementation of the proposed algorithms in the generic reasoner coloss is comparable to dedicated conditional logic provers such as condlean; a direct comparison is presently made difficult by the fact that the benchmarking formulas used to evaluate condlean are not listed explicitly in.
