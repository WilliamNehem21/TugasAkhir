we consider deterministic probabilistic real-time automata model of real-time systems, having nondeterministic choice only for times, which is a subclass of probabilistic real-time automata. the extended logic pwdc consists of formulas representing the constraints for the probability of the satisfaction of a wdc formula by a set of adversaries of the underlying model of a deterministic probabilistic real-time automaton for an observation interval. we then develop techniques to check deterministic probabilistic real-time automata for some subclass of pwdc formulas.



in this section, we introduce linear occurrence invariants(loi) and describe an algorithm to check a real-time automaton for a loi using integer programming. we use wdc to define loi. we will recall wdc when we introduce the probabilistic wdc in the next section, but for now, we consider wdc formulas as dc formulas with the extension that we allow a term to be the number of occurrences of a state variable as well, and assume that several state changes can happen at the same time.
