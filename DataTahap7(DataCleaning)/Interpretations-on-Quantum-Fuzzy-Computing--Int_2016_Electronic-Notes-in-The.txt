the uncertainty of the real world is concerned with fundamental concepts of quantum computing by making use of properties of quantum mechanics as the superposition, suggesting an improvement in the efficiency regarding complex tasks. in addition, simulations using classical computers allow the development and validation of basic quantum algorithms(qas), anticipating the knowledge related to their behaviours when executed in a quantum computer. quantum interpretations come from measurement operations performed on the corresponding quantum states.
