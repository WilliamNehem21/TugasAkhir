the rest of this paper introduces vtggs and is structured as follows: in section 2 an example of two interdependent meta models is introduced, where one meta model plays the role of a view onto the other one. a short discussion of related work concerning the construction of(database) views is presented in section 3. the following section 4 introduces vtggs, a modified variant of tggs used for view specification purposes. section 5 concludes this paper, discusses open issues, and future work. please note that a detailed presentation of the translation process of vtgg rules into view implementing graph transformation rules had to be omitted due to lack of space.



this subsection introduces the initial vtgg rule that matches the empty axiom graph and creates the top-level object of the underlying model and its view. the application of a tgg rule to a pair of related model graphs is based on finding matches for all untagged elements of the rule. in the initial state of the derivation of a model and its view there are no objects which could be matched by any pattern.
