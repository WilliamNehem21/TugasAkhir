a tree is a net with one distinguished free port, called the root. it is either a single wire, in which case the root is fixed arbitrarily, or it is obtained by plugging the auxiliary ports of a cell to the root of smaller trees. in this case, the root is the free port which is connected to the principal port of this cell.
