outline of the paper. in the next section, we give some notations and preliminary results. section 3 introduces the notion of quasi-solved form, called qsnf, and its basic operations. in section 4, we describe an efficient satisfiability test on qsnfs. finally, in section 5, we give some conclusions and discuss future work.



according to the conjunction of uqcds with a linear characteristic term. linearity ensures that set uncover returns an empty or non-empty explicit representation(see proposition 4.2). if the returned explicit representation for some auxiliary variable is empty, then the test stops and decides that the given qsnf is not satisfiable, since there is no possible assignment for that variable. otherwise, we obtain a non-empty



in order to discard more variables, we could defined stronger conditions than the ones in definition 4.7. however, analizing more complicated conditions would become as expensive as the call to uncover with all the remaining uqcds. hence, we choose the condition in definition 4.7 because it is not difficult to check and, besides, the set of discarded variables is optimal in most of the cases.
