in those cases in which we just want to test for executability, or consider the evolution of the system with no specific interest in a concrete execution path, maude provides two built-in strategies: the rewrite command follows a top-down lazy rule-fair strategy, and the frewrite command follows a positionfair bottom-up strategy. maude also provides a search command, for those cases in which we are interested in exploring all possible execution paths from the starting term for states satisfying some property. the search command does a breadth-first exploration of the tree of possible rewrites.



in general however we may be interested in other forms of execution, and the choice of appropriate strategies is crucial for executing rewrite theories. in the maude system, this need for providing strategies for controlling the rewriting process has been satisfied by developing strategies at the metalevel. strategies are defined in extensions of the predefined module meta-level by using predefined functions in it, like metareduce, metaapply, metaxapply, etc. as building blocks. it is in this way possible to define at the metalevel a whole variety of internal strategy languages[2,5], that is, the strategy language is defined inside the same rewriting logic framework, instead of being defined as an add-on extralogical feature.
