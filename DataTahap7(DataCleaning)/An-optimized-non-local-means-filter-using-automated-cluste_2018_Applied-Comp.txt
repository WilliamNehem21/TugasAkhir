the lower processing time is an important criterion for medical image denoising. so we have concentrated methods, which reduce computational time. yan et al. used clustering based preclassification to achieve faster processing without the elimination of any pixels in weight calculation. the k-means algorithm is used for clustering, where the value of k(number of clusters) has been set manually though visual perception as well as through peak signal to noise ratio(psnr) values. in k-means algorithm, the patches are divided into distinct clusters and each element of a patch belongs to exactly one cluster. this restricts the candidates to be present in more than one cluster. such a restriction is not present in fuzzy clustering where the elements of a patch can spread over



in this article, we have presented a novel nlm framework for removing speckle noise in breast ultrasound images. the proposed method has improved the nlm performance in two ways: an automated clustering based preclassification scheme through gap statistics and a new similarity measure using rotationally invariant moment distance measure. the results have shown that the presented method gives better quantitative results compared to other state-of-the-art nlm based methods. thus, the robustness against noise and low processing time make the filter appropriate for ultrasound computer aided breast cancer diagnosis systems.
