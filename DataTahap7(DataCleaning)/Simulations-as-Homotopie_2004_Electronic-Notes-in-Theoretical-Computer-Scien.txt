and their simulations. the link between the latter and oplax transformations as noticed by hermida is explained. section 4 goes into the heart of the matter. a novel model structure on 2-cat is described. a simulation is then characterized as a right homotopy. the reader unfamiliar with the lore of model categories may wish at this point to consult say the first two chapters of in order to get acquainted with the jargon. section 5 generalizes the setup to cubical sets and cubical 2-categories. section 6 draws some conclusive remarks.
