markov processes with continuous state spaces are important mathematical models in different physical sciences such as physics, biology, finance and computer sciences. the dynamics of the processes is governed by the present state rather than by the past history of the processes. with the ever-growing computer technology, we need to develop a theory of computational grip of this kind of important structures. if one is interested in computing them, we must build a machinery to approximate markov processes with continuous state space and also make sure that the approximating



originally, danos et. al. would like to present event bisimulation as a weakening of state bisimulation. however, from the following example(adapted from example 4.11 in), we know that a state bisimulation r is not in general an event bisimulation although a closely-related bigger state bisimulation r(a(r)) is indeed an event bisimulation(part 4 of the following proposition, which is from).
