models arguments as abstract entities among which an attack relation is defined. dung proposed important concepts widely adopted by the computational argumentation community, such as the concept of argument admissibility. this concept builds on the intuition that to accept a claim c, one needs both to have an argument a supporting c and to justify the rejection of all other arguments that conflict with a. in short, while in logic the reasoning process is focused on the inference within an argument, in argumentation the reasoning process also involves the interactions between arguments.



in this section we overview the main definitions connected with(abstract) argumentation frameworks. we are particularly interested in how abstract argumentation semantics can be formulated in terms of labellings. in this piece of work, we will restrict ourselves to finite argumentation frameworks.
