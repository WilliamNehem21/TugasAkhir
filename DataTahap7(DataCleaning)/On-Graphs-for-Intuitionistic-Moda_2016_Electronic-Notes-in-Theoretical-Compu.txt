we present a graph approach to intuitionistic modal logics, which provides uniform formalisms for expressing, analysing and comparing kripke-like semantics. this approach uses the flexibility of graph calculi to express directly and intuitively possible-world semantics for intuitionistic modal logics. we illustrate the benefits of these ideas by applying them to some familiar cases of intuitionistic multi-modal semantics.



we provide graph calculi, having diagrams as terms and whose rules transform diagrams, capturing graphically the semantics of the modal operators and accessibility relations. these calculi provide uniform and flexible formalisms where one can explore kripe-like semantics for intuitionistic modal logics: satisfaction conditions, valid formulas, etc. we illustrate these ideas by 2 case studies: logics as in[13,5].
