in this article, we make an introductory step to reconstruct effectively the theory of walsh-fourier series(,). although walsh-fourier series and haar wavelets have become important tools in digital processing nowadays, it seems that haar, rademacher, walsh, fine and others had already investigated these subjects in the middle of the twentieth century from mathematical interest. the theory of walshfourier series is treated similarly to that of fourier series by replacing trigonometric functions with walsh functions.



theorem 2.14 a bounded function f is riemann integrable if and only if the lebesgue measure of the set of all e-discontinuous points is zero. in this case, f is also lebesgue integrable and the both integrals have the same value.
