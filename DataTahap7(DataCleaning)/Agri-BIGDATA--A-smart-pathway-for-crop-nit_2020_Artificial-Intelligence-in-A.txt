big data provide a pathway to lower crop nitrogen inputs from genetic breeding to field production. moreover, multidisciplinary efforts from plant health sensing, deep machine learning and cloud computing can integrate multi-source data to form information and knowledge. so big data analysis as a prospective optimal method, will make leaps towards addressing future issues of sustainable agriculture.





in addition, online social media(e.g., twitter, wechat, and google search) as an important source of big data, for example, to learn fertilizing operation, collect fertilizer and grain market information. on the one hand, more and more users are timely sharing agriculture-related information(e.g., nutritional diagnosis, fertilization prescriptions, yield and quality, food consumption, profit information etc.). on the other hand, advanced production experience, consumer interests and food marketing trends can be retrieved from social media platforms, which are valuable references for farmers.
