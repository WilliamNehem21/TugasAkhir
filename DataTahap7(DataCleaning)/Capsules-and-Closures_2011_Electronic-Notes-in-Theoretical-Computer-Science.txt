the idea behind those propositions is that for every capsule, there are several bisimilar states corresponding to different computations, and each keeping track of a different set of superfluous information. similarly, for every irreducible capsules, there are several bisimilar results keeping track of superfluous information. capsules thus offer a much cleaner representation of the state of computation.
