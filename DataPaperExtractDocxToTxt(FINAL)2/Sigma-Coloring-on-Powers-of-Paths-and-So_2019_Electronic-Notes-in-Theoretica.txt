Abstract
Consider a vertex coloring of a graph where each color is represented by a natural number. The color sum of a vertex is the sum of the colors of its adjacent vertices. The Sigma Coloring Problem concerns determining the sigma chromatic number of a graph G, σ(G), which is the least number of colors for a coloring of G
such that the color sum of any two adjacent vertices are different. In this article, we proved that σ(Pk) ≤ 3 when 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, and we determined the sigma chromatic number for Pk in the remaining cases. This

article also presents the sigma chromatic number for Blanuˇsa 1st and 2nd families of snarks, Flower snarks, Goldberg and Twisted Goldberg snarks.

Introduction
A coloring of a graph G is an assignment of colors for the vertices of G. In this work, the colors are represented by natural numbers, c : V (G) → N is a vertex coloring of a graph G, and c(v) denotes the color of a vertex v. If any two adjacent vertices u and v have c(u) /= c(v), then c is a proper vertex coloring of G.
Consider a non-proper vertex coloring of G. The color sum of a vertex v, denoted σ(v), is the sum of the colors of all vertices adjacent to v. If for every two adjacent vertices u and v, σ(u) /= σ(v), then the coloring is a sigma coloring of G. The

minimum number of colors for a sigma coloring of a graph G is called the sigma chromatic number of G and it is denoted σ(G). The Sigma Coloring Problem is, given a graph G, to determine the sigma chromatic number of G.
The Sigma Coloring Problem was introduced by Chartrand and Zhang [1] in 2008 as a study project. In 2010 Chartrand et al. presented the first paper with results to this problem [2], determining the sigma chromatic number for complete graphs, cycles, and complete r-partite graphs with r ≥ 2. In the same work, [2] proved that for any graph G, σ(G) ≤ χ(G), where χ(G) is the least number of colors to a proper vertex coloring of G. To the best of our knowledge, there are few other works on the Sigma Coloring Problem. Dehghan et al. [3] showed that to decide if a graph G has σ(G)= s, for any fixed s ≥ 3, is an NP-Complete Problem. Dehghan et al. [3] also proved that to decide if a cubic graph G has σ(G)=2 is an NP-complete Problem. For circulant graphs, Luzon et al. [7] determined the sigma chromatic number for Cn(1, 2), Cn(1, 3), C2n(1, n).
Given a graph G, the degree of a vertex v, deg(v), is the number of vertices that are adjacent to v in G and the maximum degree of G, Δ(G), is the greatest degree of a vertex of G. Note that σ(G) = 1 if and only if deg(u) /= deg(v) for any pair of adjacent vertices u and v in G. So, any path graph with n vertices, Pn, has σ(Pn) ≥ 2 when n ≥ 2 and n /= 3. Since Chartrand et al. [2] proved that for any graph G, σ(G) ≤ χ(G) and it is a well known result that χ(Pn)=2 for n ≥ 2, then σ(Pn)=2 when n ≥ 2 and n /= 3. By inspection, one can check that σ(P3)= 1.
A power of a path, Pk, with n > 0 and 0 < k < n, is a simple graph with n vertices v0, v1,..., vn−1 such that (vi, vj) ∈ E(G) if, and only if, 0 < |i—j|≤ k. Note that the path graph with n vertices is the graph P 1, for which the sigma chromatic number is known. Moreover, the complete graphs are the powers of paths Pn−1, for which Chartrand et al. [2] showed σ(Pn−1)= n. Considering these results, this work expands the knowledge on the sigma chromatic number of powers of paths. We determine σ(Pk) when k = 2 and when k > n — 1. The proofs presented in this
n	3
work provide polynomial time algorithms for an optimum sigma coloring of these
graphs. Note that many of theses graphs have σ(Pk) ≥ 3 and according to Dehghan et al. [3] to decide ifa graph G has σ(G)= s, for any fixed s ≥ 3, is an NP-Complete Problem. We also prove that σ(Pk) ≤ 3 for the remaining open cases.
Since Dehghan et al. [3] proved that to decide if a cubic graph G has σ(G)=2 is an NP-complete Problem, it is interesting to consider the Sigma Coloring Problem for subclasses of cubic graphs. So, this article also presents the sigma chromatic number for Blanuˇsa 1st and 2nd families of snarks, Flower snarks, Goldberg and Twisted Goldberg snarks. For all these classes of cubic graphs the proofs results in polynomial time algorithms for an optimum sigma coloring. So the decision version of the Sigma Coloring Problem can be solved in polynomial time for these classes of snarks.

Theoretical Framework
This section presents the definitions and previous results that are essential to the development of this work.
The neighborhood of v, N (v), is the set of all vertices adjacent to v. the closed neighborhood of v, N [v], is the set N (v) ∪ {v}. If for two vertices v and u have N [u]= N [v] they are called strong twins.
If a graph G has every vertex v with deg(v)= 3, then G is a cubic graph. Snarks are cubic graphs with chromatic index 4 and without any bridge 3 .

A canonical ordering of a graph Pk
is a linear ordering of the vertices

(v0, v1, ...vn−1) such that vertices are adjacent if, and only if, 0 < |i — j|≤ k.
Remark 2.1 provides a lower bound for the sigma chromatic number of any graph that has adjacent vertices with same degree.
Remark 2.1 [2] Let G be a nontrivial connected graph. Then σ(G) = 1 if, and only if, every two adjacent vertices of G have different degrees.
Remark 2.2 increases the lower bound previously established by the number of strong twins on any graph.
Remark 2.2 [2] If u and v are two adjacent vertices in a graph G such that N [u]= 
N [v], then c(u) /= c(v) for every sigma coloring c of G.
Remark 2.3 is a direct result of Remark 2.2 and it is a lower bound for the sigma chromatic number of every complete graph. In fact, this lower bound is tight due to Theorem 2.4.
Remark 2.3 [2] If H is a complete subgraph of order k in a graph G such that
N [u]= N [v] for every two vertices u and v of H , then σ(G) ≥ k.
The Theorem 2.4 sets an upper bound for the sigma chromatic number of any graph.
Theorem 2.4 [2] For every graph G, σ(G) ≤ χ(G).
Dehghan et al. [3] define a sigma partition of a graph G as a partition of the set of vertices of G, [P0, P1,..., Pσ(G)−1], such that for every edge uv there is an index i where u and v have different numbers of neighbors in Pi. Let s ≥ Δ(G)+1 be a constant. If the vertices of each set Pi, 0 ≤ i ≤ σ(G) — 1, are colored with the color si, we obtain an optimum sigma coloring of G [3]. The Remark 2.5 is a direct consequence of the observations presented in the work of Dehghan et al. [3].
Remark 2.5 Let G be a nontrivial connected graph with a sigma coloring using the set of colors {x1, x2, x3,..., xn} such that the relation xi+1 > Δ(G)xi is satisfied for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Then no two vertices u and v in G with deg(v) /= deg(u) will have σ(v)= σ(u).

3 A bridge is an edge e in a connected graph G such that G − e is disconnected.

Results on powers of paths
The results presented in this section are divided based on the relation between k
and n for a Pk as follows: Theorem 3.1 defines σ(Pk) when k ≥  n ; Theorem 3.2
n	3	2
the sigma chromatic number when 2 ≤ k ≤ n — 1; and Theorem 3.4 determines
σ(Pk) when k = 2 and n > 3.
The following theorem defines the sigma chromatic number of a graph when
k ≥  n , notice that when k = n — 1 the graph Pk is a Kn and the theorem still

Theorem 3.1 In a graph Pk, where k ≥  n , σ(Pk)= nΔ, where nΔ is the number
n	2	n
of vertices with degree Δ(Pk).

Proof. Since every pair of vertices u and v in a Pk, with deg(v)= deg(u)= Δ(P k)
n	n
are strong twins, then they need to be colored with a unique color so their color
sums are pairwise distinct 2.2. For this reason it is possible to present a sigma coloring with nΔ colors for Pk.
To present a sigma coloring of a Pk with nΔ colors, consider that the set of
vertices of this graph, ordered according to the canonical order will be partitioned in three subsets A, B and D such that A = {vi : 0 ≤ i ≤ n — k — 2}, B = {vi : k +1 ≤ i < n} and D contains all the vertices with degree Δ(Pk). Let ai be the vertex with degree Δ(Pk) — i in A,1 ≤ i < n— k. Similarly, let bi be the vertex with degree Δ(Pk) — i in B, 1 ≤ i < n — k. Consider that the pairwise distinct colors
k
c1, c2, ..., cnΔ−2, x,y are positive natural numbers such that ci+1 ≥ (Δ(P )+ 1)ci,
1 ≤ i ≤ nΔ — 3, and c1 ≥ (Δ(Pk)+ 1)y ≥ (Δ(Pk)+ 1)2x. Color the vertices from
n	n
A∪{b1} with the color x, the vertices from B\{b1} with the color y and the vertices
from D with distinct colors from {c1, c2, ..., cnΔ−2, x, y}.
We will demonstrate that this is a valid sigma coloring. When two vertices have different degrees, by the Remark 2.5, their color sum are different, by the choice of the colors. Then, consider that the vertices v and u have the same degree. If they belong to D, then they are twins as previously stated and we are done. So consider that u ∈ A and v ∈ B, without loss of generality. So there is an index i, 1 ≤ i < n — k, such that u is ai and v is bi. Let dj,1 ≤ j ≤ nΔ, be the vertices with degree Δ(Pk) and, for any vertex w, let λ(w) be the color of w. The color sum of

ai and bi are: σ(ai)= (ΣnΔ λ(di)) — λ(ai)+

Now suppose by contradiction that the color sum of ai  and bi  are

k−nΔ+1 j=k−nΔ−i+2
λ(aj) + λ(bi)= Σk−nΔ+1
λ(bj) + λ(ai).

Consider the case where 1 < i < n — nΔ. Since λ(ai) = x and λ(bi) = y, this equation has the form cx + y = dy + x, with c, d ∈ N. Since deg(ai)= deg(bi), c = d, therefore (d — 1)x = (d — 1)y and x = y, which is a contradiction since x /= y.
When i = 1, we have: Σk−nΔ+1	λ(aj) + λ(b1)= Σk−nΔ+1	λ(bj) +
λ(a1). Then, λ(ak−nΔ+1)+ λ(b1) = λ(bk−nΔ+1)+ λ(a1). Since λ(a1) = λ(b1), λ(ak−nΔ+1) = λ(bk−nΔ+1) which is a contradiction seeing that by the hypothesis λ(ak−nΔ+1) /= λ(bk−nΔ+1). So the proposed coloring of the graph is a valid sigma coloring and σ(Pk) on those cases is nΔ.	2
When k is sufficiently large it is possible to find a sigma coloring using only two colors, as it is demonstrated by the Theorem 3.2.
Theorem 3.2 In a graph Pk with n — 1 < k < n , σ(Pk)= 2.
n	3	2	n
Proof. By Remark 2.1, σ(Pk) > 1 in this case, since there are adjacent vertices
with the same degree.
First, consider the case where k > 3 and k = n−2 . Suppose that the vertices of the graph Pk are in the canonical order. Partition the vertices of Pk in four sets
n	n
X0, X1, X2 and X3, such that the first k + 1 vertices of Pk are in X0, X1 = {vk+1},
X2 = {vk+2, vk+3,..., v2k+1} and X3 = {v2k+2, v2k+3,..., v3k+1}. Denote the ith vertex of each set Xj by xj, 0 ≤ i < |Xj| and 0 ≤ j ≤ 3.
Consider two colors a and b such that b > Δ(Pk)a. Color every vertex of the sets X0 and X2 with the color a and every vertex of the sets X1 and X3 with the color b. This way, vertices with different degrees have different color sums by the Remark 2.5. Therefore, the k first vertices of the set X0 and the vertices of the set X3 have different color sum from their neighbors by Remark 2.5.
The color sum of the vertices of this coloring are: σ(x0)= ka; σ(x0)= (k + i —
0	i
1)a + b, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k; σ(x1)= 2ka; σ(x2)= (2k — 2 — i)a + (2+ i)b, for 0 ≤ i < k;
0	i
and σ(x3)= (k — i)a + (k — 1)b, for 0 ≤ i < k. Thus, using the proposed coloring,
all the vertices of the graph have different color sums and σ(Pk)= 2.

When k > n — 1, use the same technique to color a power of path Pk
. It

3
is possible to remove the last vertex of the graph Pk
3k+2
(in the canonical order),

successively, at most k — 1 times in such a way that the color sum will still be different in every vertex. After that it is possible to remove the first vertex of the resulting graph for as long as k < n , the color sum of every vertex will continue to
be different to all others. That way every graph Pk, with n > k > n — 1 can be
n	2	3
obtained, and σ(Pk)= 2.	2
When k is not large enough to fit the description of Theorem 3.2, then an upper bound can be found, as proved on Theorem 3.3. Notice that the upper bound, if not tight, is at most one greater then the sigma chromatic number.
Theorem 3.3 In a graph Pk with 2 ≤ k ≤ n — 1, σ(Pk) ≤ 3.
n	3	n

Proof. Consider a graph Pk, with 2 ≤ k ≤ n — 1 and n ≡ 0	(mod 2k + 1), in
n	3
such a way that its vertices are in the canonical order. Let the vertex set of Pk
be partitioned in blocks G0, G1,..., G  n 	, such that the first 2k + 1 vertices in
2k+1
the canonical order belong to G0, the next 2k + 1 vertices belong to G1 and so on.
Label the vertices in Gi as vi,0, vi,1,..., vi,2k, 0 ≤ i <  n  . Consider the colors a,
b and c, where b > Δ(Pk)a and c > Δ(Pk)b. This way, it is possible to use the
n	n
following function λ : V (G) → {a, b, c} to color the vertices of Pk, as follows: a,
if j /= k, 0 ≤ j ≤ 2k, and i ≡ 0 (mod 3); b, if j = k and i ≡ 0 (mod 3); b, if j /= k, 0 ≤ j ≤ 2k, and i ≡ 1 (mod 3); c, if j = k and i ≡ 1 (mod 3); c, if j /= k, 0 ≤ j ≤ 2k, and i ≡ 2 (mod 3); and a, if j = k and i ≡ 2 (mod 3).
By the Remark 2.5, vertices with different degrees have different color sum. Thus, each vertex from the first and last k vertices of the graph (in the canonical order) have different color sum from their neighbors, since vertices with the same degree are not adjacent if the degree is less then 2k. It remains to prove that vertices with same degree have different color sums.
First consider blocks Gi with i ≡ 1 (mod 3). In those cases the color sum are as follows: σ(vi,j)= (k—j)a+(k—1+j)b+c, when 0 ≤ j < k (case 1); σ(vi,j)= 2kb, when j = k (case 2); and σ(vi,j)= (3k — 1 — j)b + (1+ j — k)c, when k +1 ≤ j ≤ 2k (case 3).
The vertices of the case 1 are different from each other because σ(vi,j) < σ(vi,j+1), since σ(vi,j+1) = σ(vi,j) — a + b. There is only one vertex in the case 2. The vertices from case 3 are different because σ(vi,j) < σ(vi,j+1), since σ(vi,j+1)= σ(vi,j) — b + c.
Now consider blocks Gi with i ≡ 0 (mod 3). In those cases the color sum are as follows: σ(vi,j)= (k — j)c + (k — 1+ j)a + b, if0 ≤ j < k (case 1); σ(vi,j)= 2ka, if j = k (case 2); and σ(vi,j)= (3k — 1 — j)a + (1+ j — k)b, if k +1 ≤ j ≤ 2k (case 3).
At last consider blocks Gi with i ≡ 2 (mod 3). In those cases the color sum are as follows: σ(vi,j)= (k — j)b +(k — 1+ j)c + b when 0 ≤ j < k (case 1); σ(vi,j)= 2kc when j = k (case 2); and σ(vi,j)= (3k — 1 — j)c + (1+ j — k)a when k +1 ≤ j ≤ 2k (case 3).
By analogue arguments to those used on blocks Gi with i ≡ 1 (mod 3), ver- tices have different color sum on the same block when i ≡ 0 (mod 3) and i ≡ 2 (mod 3). Then it remains to prove that two vertices with the same degree in differ- ent blocks have different color sums.
Let vi,p and vi+1,q be two adjacent vertices with the same degree, 0 ≤ i <
 n  — 2. Then, σ(vi,p) /= σ(vi+1,q) because no vertex of the block Gi have neighbors with the color of vi+1,q in its color sum, which is by turn adjacent to all the vertices in the block Gi+1.

Now consider the graph Pk
in which n is not a multiple of 2k + 1.	It

is possible to obtain a sigma coloring for the graph Pk
by coloring a graph

k
n+2k+1−(n mod 2k+1)
is obtained.
and removing the last vertices of this graph until Pk

Consider the power of path H with a sigma coloring like the one defined previ-

ously. Remove the last vertex of the graph H and observe that the new graph has a sigma coloring, since the removing of the vertex will only affect the color sum of the vertices vp−k−1 to vp−1, where p = n + 2k +1 — (n mod 2k + 1). Such vertices are the new last k vertices of the graph, in the canonical order, and therefore have different degrees which are less then 2k. By the Remark 2.5 the color sum of those vertices are different between themselves and they are never adjacent to the first k vertices with same degrees. This way the sigma coloring is still valid.
Using the same proceeding it is possible to remove the vertices of H until Pk is
obtained with a valid sigma coloring when k ≤ n — 1.
Therefore σ(Pk) ≤ 3 when k ≤ n — 1.	2
n	3
If k = 2 the sigma chromatic number is defined to any value of n > 3. If n =3 then P 2 is a K3, and so σ(P 2)= 3. If n = 2, then no simple graph has k = 2.
3	3
Theorem 3.4 In a graph Pk with k =2 and n > 3, then σ(Pk)= 2.
n	n
Proof. Consider the graph Pk with k = 2, and vertices in the canonical order.
Color the first six vertices (if existent) with the colors b, a, b, b, a, a, on that order, and b ≥ Δ(Pk)a. The next six vertices are painted with the same sequence of colors and so on. We can define this coloring by the function λ : V (P 2) → {a, b} such that λ(v6i)= b, λ(v6i+1)= a, λ(v6i+2)= b, λ(v6i+3)= b, λ(v6i+4)= a, λ(v6i+5)= a, with i ∈ N.
So σ(v0), σ(v1), σ(vn−2), σ(vn−1) have different color sums from the rest for having different degrees, by the Rermark 2.5. To the remaining vertices, we have: σ(v3j+2)= 2a + 2b; σ(v3j+3)= 3a + b; and σ(v3j+4)= a + 3b, with j ∈ N.
Note that v0 and vn−1 are never adjacent. If v1 and vn−2 are adjacent they have color sum σ(v1)= 3b and σ(vn−2)= a + 2b or σ(v1)= 3b and σ(vn−2)= 2a + b.
Therefore, ∀i, σ(vi) /= σ(vi ± 1) and σ(vi) /= σ(vi ± 2). Since k = 2 the graph has a valid sigma coloring.	2
Based on computational tests, done using a brute force algorithm, after observing the results from theorems 3.2 and 3.3. A minimum sigma coloring for all Pk with n ≤ 27 and k ≤ 8 was obtained. The following conjecture was then enunciated.
Conjecture 3.5 Let Pk be a power of a path. If 2 < k ≤ n — 1, then σ(Pk)= 3.

Results on snarks
This section presents the results about the sigma chromatic number of snarks, in particular for the families of Blanuˇsa first and second families, the flower snark, the Goldberg snarks and the Twisted Goldberg snarks.
Watkins [8] presented two infinite families of snarks, the Blanuˇsa First family and the Blanuˇsa second family. Each snark in the Blanuˇsa First family is denoted by B1 and it uses a copy of the block H1 illustrated in Figure 1a and n copies of
n	0
the block B, presented in Figure 1c. The ith copy of the block B is denoted Bi,
1 ≤ i ≤ n. Similarly, each snark in the Blanuˇsa Second family is denoted by B2 and it uses a copy of the block H2 illustrated in Figure 1b and n copies of the block B.

Each block H1 is connected to others by creating the edges (v0, vn), (v0, vn),
0	1	8	7	3
(v0, v1) and (v0 , v1). Each block H2 is connected to others by creating the edges
4	6	10	1	0
(v0, vn), (v0, vn), (v0, v1) and (v0 , v1). Each block Bi will connect to another block
1	8	8	3	3	6	10	1

Theorem 4.1 If a graph is a B1, so σ(B1)= 2.
n	n
Proof. Let G be a snark of the Blanuˇsa first family. The proof is direct and is divided into two cases, according to the parity of the number of blocks B in G.
First consider that the number of blocks B in G is odd. Color each block Bi, i even, such that c(vi ) = 1 when j ∈ {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8} and c(vi ) = 2 otherwise.
j	j
Color each block Bi, i odd, such that c(vi ) = 1 when j ∈ {3, 7} and c(vi ) = 2 
j	j
otherwise. The coloring of the vertices of the block H1 are as follows: c(v0) = 2 
0	j
when j ∈ {6, 7, 9} and c(v0) = 1 otherwise.
The color sum of each vertex in the block Bi, i even, is σ(vi ) = 5 when j ∈
{1, 3, 7}, σ(vi ) = 4 when j ∈ {4, 8} and σ(vi ) = 3 otherwise. The color sum of
j	j
each vertex in the block Bi, i odd, is σ(vi )=4 when j ∈ {2, 6, 8}, σ(vi )=5 when
j	j
j ∈ {1, 5} and σ(vi ) = 6 otherwise. The color sum of each vertex v0 is σ(v0) = 6 
j	j	j
when j ∈ {10}, σ(v0) = 5 when j ∈ {1, 4, 8}, σ(v0) = 4 when j ∈ {3, 5} and
j	j
σ(v0) = 3 otherwise.
Now consider that the number of blocks B in G is even. Color each block Bi, i
even, such that c(vi )=2 when j ∈ {4, 8} and c(vi ) = 1 otherwise. Color each block
j	j
Bi, i odd and i /= 1, such that c(vi )=1 when j ∈ {1, 5} and c(vi ) = 2 otherwise.
j	j
The coloring of each vertex v0 in H1 are as follows: c(v0)=2 when j ∈ {6, 7, 9} and
j	0	j
c(v0) = 1 otherwise. The coloring of the vertices v1 in B1 are as follows: c(v1)=2 
j	j	j
when j ∈ {3, 6, 8} and c(v1) = 1 otherwise.
The color sum of each vertex in the block Bi, i odd and i /= 1, is σ(vi )=6 when
j ∈ {1, 5, 7}, σ(vi )=5 when j ∈ {2, 6} and σ(vi ) = 4 otherwise. The color sum of
j	j
each vertex in the block Bi, i even, is σ(vi )=5 when j ∈ {1, 5, 6}, σ(vi )=4 when
j	j
j ∈ {3, 7} and σ(vi ) = 3 otherwise. The color sum of each vertex in the block H1 is
j	0
σ(v0)=5 when j ∈ {1, 4, 8, 10}, σ(v0)=4 when j ∈ {3, 5} and σ(v0) = 3 otherwise.
j	j	j
The color sum of each vertex on the block B1 is σ(v1)=5 when j ∈ {5, 7}, σ(v1)=4 
j	j
when j ∈ {2, 4} and σ(v1) = 3 otherwise.

Therefore, since no two adjacent vertices have the same color sum on the sigma coloring described in this proof, σ(B1) ≤ 2. By Remark 2.1, σ(B1)= 2.	2

Proof. Let G be a snark of the Blanuˇsa second family. The proof is direct and is divided into two cases, according to the parity of the number of blocks B in G.
First consider that the number of blocks B in G is odd. Color each block Bi, i even, with the following coloring of vertices: c(vi ) = 1 when j ∈ {3, 6, 8} and c(vi ) = 2 otherwise. Color each block Bi, i odd, with the following coloring of

in Bi, i odd and j /= 10, is σ(vi )=5 when j ∈ {5, 7}, σ(vi )=4 when j ∈ {2, 4, } and
j	j
σ(vi ) = 3 otherwise. When i is odd and j = 10, σ(vi )=3 if i = n and σ(vi )=4 
j	10	10
otherwise. Notice that σ(vi ) are fine for all cases. The color sum of each vertex v0
is σ(v0)=6 when j ∈ {6, 8}, σ(v0)=5 when j ∈ {1, 3, 10}, σ(v0)=4 when j ∈ {4}
j	j	j
and σ(v0) = 3 otherwise.
Now consider that the number of blocks B in G is even. Color each block Bi, i even, such that c(vi )=2 when j ∈ {1, 3, 6} and c(vi ) = 1 otherwise. Color each
j	j
block Bi, i odd and i /= 1, such that c(vi ) = 1 when j ∈ {1, 3, 6} and c(vi ) = 2 
j	j
otherwise. The coloring of each vertex of the block H2 are as follows: c(v0) = 2 
0	j
when j ∈ {5, 7, 9} and c(v0) = 1 otherwise. The coloring of the vertices of the block
B1 are as follows: c(v1)=2 when j ∈ {5, 6, 7, 8} and c(v1) = 1 otherwise.
j	j
The color sum of each vertex in Bi, i even, is σ(vi )=5 when j ∈ {2, 4}, σ(vi )=4 
j	j
when j ∈ {1, 5, 7} and σ(vi ) = 3 otherwise. The color sum of each vertex in Bi, i
odd and i /= 1, is σ(vi ) = 6 when j ∈ {3, 6, 8}, σ(vi ) = 5 when j ∈ {1, 5, 7} and
j	j
σ(vi ) = 4 otherwise. The color sum of each vertex v0 is σ(v0)=6 when j ∈ {6, 8},
j	j	j
σ(v0) = 5 when j ∈ {10}, σ(v0) = 4 when j ∈ {1, 4}, and σ(v0) = 3 otherwise.
j	j	j
The color sum of each vertex in B1 is σ(v1) = 6 when j ∈ {8}, σ(v1) = 5 when
j	j
j ∈ {3, 4, 7}, σ(v1)=4 when j ∈ {2, 5, 6, }, and σ(v1) = 3 otherwise.
j	j
Since no two adjacent vertices have the same color sum, σ(B2) ≤ 2. By Re-
mark 2.1, σ(B2)= 2.	2
Other infinite family of snarks, the Flower snarks, were found in 1975 [6]. Each Flower snark, denoted Fn, is formed by a set of n blocks f with 4 vertices each, n odd and n ≥ 3. The ith block in a flower snark is denoted fi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. A block fi is illustrated on Figure 2.


Fig. 2. Block fi

Each flower snark Fn  is made by creating the edges (vi , v(i mod n)+1),
1	1
(vi , v(i mod n)+1) and (vi , vi+1 (mod n)) for each block fi and f(i mod n)+1,1 ≤ i ≤ n.

This way connecting all blocks on the graph.
Theorem 4.3 If a graph is a flower snark Fn, then σ(Fn)= 2.
Proof. The proof is direct. Color each block fi, with odd i and i < n as follows:
c(vi )=1 when j ∈ {3} and c(vi ) = 2 otherwise. Color each block fi, with even i,
j	j
as follows: c(vi ) = 1 when j ∈ {1, 2, 4} and c(vi ) = 2 otherwise. The coloring of
j	j
the vertices in block fn is c(vn) = 2 for every vertex.
The color sum of each vertex vi with odd i and i /= 1 is σ(vi ) = 3 when
j ∈ {1, 2, 4} and σ(vi )= 6. If i = 1 then the color sum of each vertex is σ(vi )=4 
3	j
when j ∈ {1, 2, 4} and σ(vi ) = 6, both values of color sums for odd i are valid in this
coloring. The color sum of each vertex in fi with even i is σ(vi )=6 if j ∈ {1, 2, 4}
and σ(vi ) = 3. The color sum of each vertex on the block fn is σ(vn) = 5 when
3	j
j ∈ {1, 2, 4} and σ(vn)= 6.
Therefore, since no two adjacent vertices have the same color sum on the sigma coloring described in this proof, σ(Fn) ≤ 2. By Remark 2.1, σ(Fn)= 2.	2
The infinite family of Goldberg snarks were found in 1981 [5]. Each Goldberg snark is denoted Gn, and is formed by a set of n blocks g with 8 vertices, n odd and n ≥ 3. The block g is illustrated on Figure 3 and the ith copy of the block g is denoted by gi.
Fig. 3. Block gi

The vertex vk of a block gi is denoted gi , as illustrated in Figure 3. Each Gold- berg snark Gn is constructed by adding the edges (vi , v(i mod n)+1), (vi , v(i mod n)+1)
2	1	7	6
and (vi , v(i mod n)+1) to each block gi and g(i mod n)+1. The Twisted Goldberg snark
8	8
is constructed by “twisting” two edges on a Gn and it is denoted TGn. Twisting two
edges on the graph consists in removing edges (vi , v(i mod n)+1) and (vi , v(i mod n)+1),
2	1	7	6
and creating edges (vi , v(i mod n)+1) and (vi , v(i mod n)+1), for a pair of blocks gi and
2	6	7	1
g(i mod n)+1. Twisting more then two pairs of blocks will not result in a new graph [4].

Theorem 4.4 If a graph is a Goldberg snark Gn, then σ(G)= 2.
Proof. The proof is direct. Color each block gi, with i odd and i > 1 as follows:
c(vi ) = 1 when j ∈ {1, 6, 7} and c(vi ) = 2 otherwise. The coloring of the vertices
j	j
in the block g1 are as follows: c(v1) = 1 when j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 7} and c(v1) = 2
j	j
otherwise. Color each block gi, i even, as follows: c(vi )=1 when j ∈ {1, 7, 8} and
c(vi ) = 2 otherwise.
The color sum of each vertex in gi, with i odd is σ(vi ) = 6 when j ∈ {1, 4},
σ(vi ) = 5 when j ∈ {3, 7} and σ(vi ) = 4 when j ∈ {2, 5, 6}. For the vertex vi ,
j	j	8
σ(vi )=4 when i /= n and σ(vi )=5 when i = n. The color sum of each vertex in
8	8
the block g1 is σ(v1) = 5 when j ∈ {1, 4}, σ(v1) = 4 when j ∈ {3, 8}, σ(v1) = 3 
j	j	j
when j ∈ {2, 5, 6} and σ(v1) = 6. The color sum of each vertex in gi, i even, is
σ(vi )=4 when j ∈ {2, 5, 6}, σ(vi )=5 when j ∈ {4, 7}, σ(vi )=6 when j ∈ {3, 8}.
j	j	j
When j ∈ {1}, σ(v2)=5 if i = 2 and σ(v2) = 6 otherwise.
1	1
Therefore, since no two adjacent vertices have the same color sum on the sigma
coloring described in this proof, σ(Gn) ≤ 2. By Remark 2.1, σ(Gn)= 2.	2
Theorem 4.5 The twisted Goldberg T Gn has σ(G)=2 if n > 3, and σ(G)=3 if
n = 3.
Proof. The proof is direct and there are two cases. If n > 3, color each block
gi, with i odd and i > 1, as follows: c(vi ) = 1 when j ∈ {1, 4, 7} and c(vi ) = 2 
j	j
otherwise. Color each block gi with i even and i > 2 as follows: c(vi ) = 1 when
j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 6, 7} and c(vi ) = 2 otherwise. Remains to color the vertices in the blocks g1 and g2. Assign the colors to vertices in g1 as follows: c(v1) = 1 when j ∈ {1, 3, 8} and c(v1) = 2 otherwise. Color the block g2 as follows: c(v2)=1 when
j	j
j ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6, 7} and c(v2) = 2 otherwise.
The color sum of each vertex in gi, with i odd is σ(vi ) = 6 when j ∈ {4},
σ(vi )=5 when j ∈ {1, 3}, σ(vi )=4 when j ∈ {2, 6}, and σ(vi )=3 when j ∈ {5}.
j	j	j
When i = n then σ(vn)=6 and σ(vn)= 4, if i /= n then σ(vi )= σ(vi ) = 5. The
7	8	7	8
color sum of each vertex in gi with i even is σ(vi ) = 6 when j ∈ {8}, σ(vi ) = 5 
j	j
when j ∈ {1, 4, 7}, σ(vi )=4 when j ∈ {3, 5}, and σ(vi ) = 3 otherwise. The color
j	j
sum of each vertex on the block g1 is σ(v1) = 6 when j ∈ {1, 3, 7, 8}, σ(v1) = 5 
j	j
when j ∈ {5}, σ(v1) = 4 when j ∈ {4, 6}, and σ(v1) = 3. The color sum of each
j	2
vertex in g2 is σ(v2) = 5 when j ∈ {1, 4, 7}, σ(v2) = 4 when j ∈ {2, 5, 6, 8}, and
j	j
σ(v2) = 3. Therefore, since no two adjacent vertices have the same color sum, this
is a sigma coloring and σ(TGn) ≤ 2. By Remark 2.1, σ(T Gn)=2 when n > 3.
If n = 3, the graph T G3 has no valid sigma coloring with two colors. This fact was established after computational inspection of all combinations of coloring with two colors 4 . However, it is possible to find a coloring with 3 colors. Follow the previous instructions and color v2 with 3. The color sum of the vertices v1, v2
8	8	4
and v3 will change to 7, 6 and 5 respectively, and the sigma coloring will be valid.
Therefore σ(TG3)= 3.	2

5	Conclusion
For any power of a path Pk, the sigma chromatic number was determined except when 2 < k ≤ n — 1. In this last case, we present a sigma coloring with at most σ(Pk) + 1 colors. Considering the snarks, the sigma chromatic number was determined for the Blanuˇsa First and Second families, Flower snarks, Goldberg and twisted Goldberg snarks. Those results are interesting since for cubic graphs the complexity the decision version of the Sigma Coloring Problem is NP-Complete, and for those families the results can be found in polynomial time using algorithms that can be obtained from the constructive proofs presented in this work.
It is interesting to emphasize that the sigma chromatic number of a graph does not have a simple behavior when analyzing similar structures in different graphs. As an example, the result found for the graph TG3 is different from the result on the graph G3, even those graphs being different only by two edges.
