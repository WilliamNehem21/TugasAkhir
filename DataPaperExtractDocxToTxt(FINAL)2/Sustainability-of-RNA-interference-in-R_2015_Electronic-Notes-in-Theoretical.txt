Abstract
RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism whereby small pieces of RNA directly control gene expression in target messenger RNA by identifying complementary sequences. We model RNAi in terms of rule-based modelling. Interpreting a small interfering RNA (siRNA) as a primitive agent, the model provides a fine- grained interpretation to directly capture the fundamental interactions (e.g., hybridization, denaturation, cleavage, copying, degradation) among double and single strands of RNA and siRNA. We investigate the sustainability of RNAi, which is characterized by the population level of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during the interference. Our model aims to capture the individual level of each agent in RNAi in terms of the Galton–Watson multitype branching processes determined by the modelling. Each siRNA has a type that represents its original position inside the dsRNA from which it was cleaved. The probability of extinction of populations of siRNA is investigated and analyzed for both primer-dependent and -independent synthesis of RNAi, which are important topics in experimental biology from the perspective of the difference
between animal and plant RNAi. The sustainability is shown to be invariant under some appropriate model
refinements for the primer-dependent synthesis. This invariance guarantees the sufficiency of the compact description of our rule based modelling in capturing the sustainability of RNAi.

Introduction
The mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi), also known as RNA silencing, is widely found throughout eukaryotes, where small pieces of RNA (21–26 nts), known as small interfering RNA (siRNA), directly control gene expression [1,23]. RNAi consists of three fundamental biochemical processes: (i) Formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA); (ii) The Dicer enzyme’s cleavage of dsRNA into siRNAs; and (iii) The incorporation of siRNA into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by argonaute- protein, targeting and degrading a long single-stranded messenger RNA (mRNA) by Watson–Crick complementary pairing. (See the right half of Figure 1 for (i), (ii), and (iii).)

This work concerns a certain circularity among the three processes, which ex- plains the persistence with which RNAi is sustained. We model circular paths from
(ii) and (iii) to (i) such that secondary dsRNA is synthesized by RNA-directed RNA
polymerase (RdRp) mediation.
The synthesis is performed in two ways [1,2,4,26]: (1) primer-dependent syn- thesis: An siRNA resulting from (ii) and (iii) triggers polymerization from a single- stranded mRNA template; (2) primer-independent synthesis: RNA containing an aberrant feature resulting from (iii) is duplicated without the trigger.
(See Figure 2 for an illustration of these synthesis mechanisms and Figure 1 for
RNAi with primer-dependent synthesis.)

Fig. 2. Two circular paths for the synthesis of dsRNA
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of primer- independent duplication (2) compared to primer-dependent polymerization (1). To show this, we first represent RNAi as a rule-based model using kappa calculus, which is a well-established means of handling the combinatorics of molecular interactions [9,10,12]. The machinery of RNAi is seen as the combinatorial expression of vari- ous sized segments of nucleotides in terms of hybridization, denaturation, ligation,

cleavage, copying and so on. Our representation takes siRNA as a primitive agent that has appropriate sites for phosphate bonds and hydrogen bonds. Each siRNA has an associated type denoting its original position inside the dsRNA from which it was cleaved. Other agents can be defined in terms of these primitive agents and types. (mRNA is represented as a sequence of siRNAs with phosphate bonds to each predecessor and successor, and dsRNA is described by two complementary strands of RNA joined by hydrogen bonds.) Interactions involving RNAi are described by a set of rules according to the binding and unbinding of certain sites on the differ- ent types of siRNA. (The cleavage of dsRNA by Dicer is a simultaneous unbinding reaction via phosphate bonds. RISC matching of a complementary sequence is the binding of hydrogen bonds between two complementary sites of mRNA and siRNA.) Importantly, these principal reactions consisting of RNAi are digital in nature, with certain stochastic rates for each rule and site. This fits into the stochastic semantics [25,5] of stochastic processes calculi, which include kappa calculus.
We analyze how RNAi evolves under these rule-based dynamics. In such mod- elling, the sustainability of RNAi, which is our main concern in this paper, is cap- tured by individual populations of each agent in each generation. As seen in Figure 1, dsRNA is an initiator of RNAi, and is itself produced by an siRNA trigger. Hence, the population level of siRNA is a prime factor in sustaining RNAi. In general, the kappa syntactical modelling yields stochastic Markov processes as its seman- tical counterpart. Moreover, our RNAi modelling with typed siRNA agents yields Galton–Watson multitype branching processes, the semantics of which allow us to analyze the growth of each siRNA population. The use of a multitype branch- ing process was suggested in [3], though most mathematical modelling of RNAi is phenomenologically and deterministically given by differential equations [3,6,13,18]. Rule-based modelling naturally provides the stochastic process of branching by di- rectly capturing the interactions among agents.
Besides its practical agility for statistical analysis [7,9,21], the main advantages of rule-based modelling in our work are its compactness for describing rules and its model refinement to incorporate less-compact details. Our aim in this paper is to show that a certain property of the evolution of RNAi is sufficiently captured by this compact modelling to allow polymerization to synthesize dsRNA. To ensure this, the model is refined in such a manner that the property obtained in the compact model is shown to be invariant under some appropriate class of model refinements.
We show that, with only primer-dependent synthesis, the population of each type of siRNA becomes extinct. Hence, RNAi ceases to be sustained. The probability of these extinctions is proved to be 1 by the compact description of the rules, and the probability is shown to remain invariant under plausible classes of model refinements, which globalize the compact rules by incorporating contextual traits of the complexes. Then, as soon as primer-independent synthesis is augmented, RNAi is shown to become sustainable because the extinction probabilities become less than 1.

Rule Based Modelling of RNAi
In this section, we model RNAi syntactically using kappa calculus [10]. In our rule- based modelling of RNAi, each siRNA is considered a primitive agent, denoted by Sk, where the index k (called the type) designates the position inside the dsRNA from which the agent originates. (In this paper, siRNA stands for single-stranded one.) Types are natural numbers 1, 2,...,m from downstream to upstream (3j to 5j of mRNA). T denotes the set of all types. Each primitive agent has three sites
siRNA = Sk(l, h, r),
where r and l are for phosphate bonds and h is a segment for a series of hydrogen bonds with 21–26 nts. Binding of two sites is represented by a common superscript. The mRNA and dsRNA agents are represented as complexes consisting of primitive Sks with appropriate bonds.
mRNA =
..., Sn+1(ln+2, rn+1), Sn(ln+1, rn),..., S2(l3, r2), S1(l2, r)

dsRNA =
..., Sn+1(ln+2, h1n+1 , rn+1), Sn(ln+1, h1n , rn),..., S2(l3, h12 , r2), S1(l2, h11 , r)



..., Sn+1(ln+2, h1n+1 , rn+1), Sn(ln+1, h1n , rn),..., S2(l3, h12 , r2), S1(l2, h11 , r)
Note that in the definition of mRNA, site h for each Sk is not written, whereas it is present in the definition of dsRNA. See Figure 3 for a visual representation of each agent with their respective sites, where bound (res. unbound) sites are represented by black (res. white) circles.

Three fundamental reactions of RNAi are described by the following rules:
Definition 2.1
polymerization
Sk(l, h1k , rk) −→ Sk(lk+1, h1k , rk), Sk+1(l, h1k+1 , rk+1)
This rule describes how siRNA of type k + 1 is produced from its predecessor type.  The bounded site h (res.  r) on the left-hand side (LHS) gives the

condition that the hydrogen (res. ligation) bond must connect to the template mRNA (res. to the predecessor of Sk). This rule is compact in that only the local part of the domains and ranges of the rule are specified. The contextual siRNA so far produced (i.e., Si with i < k) and the template mRNA (i.e., the upper strand mRNA having the complementary site for the hydrogen bond h of Sk) are not relevant to this rule.
cleavage
Y(Si(li+1, h1i , ri) | Si(li+1, h1i , ri)) −→ Y(Si(l, h1i , r) | Si(l, h1i , r))
i∈T	i∈T
where the LHS of the rule describes dsRNA, written with | in place of , and
to denote compositions of |. All the phosphate bonds on the RHS are released by the rule.
degradation

RISC(h1k ),	Sk(lk+1, h1k , rk) |	Y
i∈T \ {k}
Si(li+1, ri) −→ RISC(h), 0

where RISC is an agent with a site for hydrogen bonding to a complementary sequence of mRNA. The second agent on the LHS is mRNA with one bound site for hydrogen bonds. RISC is recycled, that is, it occurs on both the LHS and RHS.
See Figure 4 for an illustration of each rule.

Fig. 4. Rules of RNAi
Remark 2.2 In the above cleavage rule (ii), we choose a modelling process that destroys several bonds simultaneously. However, for a smaller time-scale, intermedi- ate steps may be needed in terms of successive Dicer interactions against the dsRNA. Given that Dicer is a molecular ruler [19] for recognizing dsRNA and cleaving 21–26 nts for the length of siRNA, we define it as an agent D(1,..., k, ..., m) with m sites for measuring/cleaving dsRNA. The cleaving of dsRNA is then represented by the successive interactions of Dicer, for which siRNA needs to be augmented with another site d. The following is an alternative, fine-grained representation of the cleavage rule that produces a series of (ii-k) rules, k = 1,..., m, corresponding to (ii).

(ii-k) k-th measuring/cleaving of Dicer over dsRNA

D(1,..., k, ..., m) | (Sk(lk+1, h1k , r, d) | Sk(lk+1, h1k , r)) | Ck+1,k

D(1,..., k, ..., m) | (Sk+1(lk+2, h1k+1 , r) | Sk+1(lk+2, h1k+1 , r)) | Ck+2,k+1

where Cn1,n2 = Y Ui | Y Ti with

Ui = Si(li+1, h1i , ri) | Si(li+1, h1i , ri) and Ti = Si(l, h1i , r) | Si(l, h1i , r).

An important aspect of the fine-grained rules (ii-k) is that they make the description of cleavage compact, involving only local structures without mentioning the whole structure.
RNAi as a Multitype Branching Process for siRNA
This section describes a semantical study of the rule-based modelling presented in Section 2. We show that the two syntheses of dsRNA described in Section 1

are captured and discriminated by Galton–Watson multitype branching processes [20,14] for the different siRNA types introduced in Section 2.
A sequence {Z(n)} of vector random variables represents the number of individ- uals of the various types of siRNA in the n-th generation
Z(n)= (Z1(n),..., Zm(n))
so that Zi is a random variable for Si (i.e., for siRNA of type i).
The m × m-matrix M = (mij), called the mean matrix, is defined by
mij = E[Zj(1) | Z(0) = ei]
for all i, j = 1, 2,..., m, where ei denotes the vector whose i-th component is 1 and whose other components are 0. That is, each element mij gives a type i individual’s expected number of children of type j. Let us write
u(n)= E[Z(n)]= (E[Z1(n)],..., E[Zm(n)])


so that

u(n)= u(0)Mn.

Corresponding to the sequence of vector-valued random variables is the sequence f (s) = (f1(s),..., fm(s)) of generating functions for s = (s1,..., sm) ∈ [0, 1]T , defined by
fi(s)= Σ P [Z(n)= r | Z(0) = ei]sr1 sr2 ··· srm .
1  2	M
r
The generating functions characterize trivial processes without any branching, such that each individual has exactly one offspring of any type with probability 1. The characterization of this singular process is f (s)= AsT for some matrix A.
In this paper, we are interested in the probabilities qi of the eventual extinction of the process initiated with a single particle of type i. These are given by

qi = lim
n→∞
qi(n) where qi(n)= P [Z(n)=0 | Z(0) = ei].

The generating functions fi(s) yield a recursive definition of the probability qi(n) such that
qi(1) = fi(0) and qi(n + 1) = fi(q(n))
for q(n) = (q1(n),..., qm(n)). Taking the limit of this recursion, we have (i ∈
{1,..., m})
qi = f (q) for q = (q1,..., qm).
In an irreducible branching process, each type of individual may eventually have progeny of any other type. For every pair (i, j) of types, there exists an integer n ≥ 1 such that
P [Zj(n) ≥ 1 | Z(0) = ei] > 0.
That is, the (i, j)-th element of Mn is strictly positive.

The irreducibility is a criterion to discriminate primer-independent from primer- dependent synthesis:
Proposition 3.1
RNAi with primer-dependent synthesis yields a reducible branching process.
RNAi with primer-independent synthesis yields an irreducible branching process.
Proof. In primer-dependent synthesis, it is directly observed that no children of type Sk with k < n are produced by a parent of type Sn. In contrast, in primer- independent synthesis, every type of offspring is produced immediately, thus this process becomes irreducible.	2
The well-known Perron–Frobenius theorem for the classical theory of matrices (cf. Theorem 6.1 of [20]) says that, for every irreducible process, the mean matrix M has a unique positive eigenvalue ρ (called its Perron–Frobenius root) that is greater in absolute value than any other eigenvalue, and the powers of M have the property that
Mn = ρnM1 + o(ρn),
where M1 is the matrix whose (i, j)-th element is given by ui · vj for the normalized right and left eigenvectors tu and v such that ρv = vM and Mu = ρu.
Irreducibility is the property that any initial configuration can lead to any other composition. Hence, in irreducible populations, all types grow at the same rate according to the single parameter ρ of the Perron–Frobenius root. Therefore, this parameter completely characterizes the extinction and growth:
Lemma 3.2 (Theorem 7.1 of pg. 16 [20] for irreducible processes) For a non-singular and irreducible process, the probability of extinction is the solution of
f (s)= s
that is closest to the origin in the unit cube [0, 1]T . Moreover,
If ρ ≤ 1, then qi =1 for all i = 1,..., m.
If ρ > 1, then qi < 1 for all i = 1,..., m.
In reducible processes, distinct groups of types that do not produce those of other groups can be distinguished. Reducible systems can, in general, display great heterogeneity. One type may become extinct, whereas another thrives, and different types may grow at different rates. Nevertheless, uniform extinctions occur in the following case, with λ given by the maximal eigenvalue of the mean matrix:
Lemma 3.3 (Theorem 3.1 of pg. 65 [20] for reducible processes) If a re- ducible multitype branching process is non-singular and λ ≤ 1, then the population becomes extinct with probability 1 given that Z(0) = ei for all i.
The primer-dependent polymerization of RNAi gives the following mean matrix
Mdep, which is triangular with lower left elements of 0.

⎛ s1	∗ ⎞


(1)
Mdep = ⎜
⎜
s2
. . .	⎟

⎝ 0	sm ⎠
Let un denote the n-th row of the matrix (1):
un = (0,... 0, sn, mn,n+1,..., mnm).
Then, each element of un (from left, respectively) corresponds to the birth rate of children Si (with i = 1, 2,..., m, respectively) triggered by the polymerization of agent Sn. The front 0s indicate that no children Sj (1 ≤ j < n) are produced by the polymerization triggered by Sn. The element mn,i, which is the birth rate of the individual Si, is then determined by its immediate predecessor Si−1 according to the polymerization rule of Definition 4. Thus, we have
sn = siten(Sn) and mn,i = siten,i(Si−1, Si),
where site indicates that sn and mn,i are determined by the states of all the sites of the agents inside the arguments.
Example 3.4 Each siRNA of type k decays with probability sk. Then, with prob- ability q, siRNA binds to a complementary mRNA to trigger RdRp to copy the template mRNA. With probability h, denaturation takes place between Sk and the mRNA, breaking the hydrogen bonds. With probability r, ligation breaks between two siRNAs of types k − 1 and k. Under these conditions, un for (1) is given by the following, where x¯ =1 − x:

′
sn =1 − sn
and m

n,i
= h¯(h¯r¯)i−1 q sn.


Proposition 3.5 (Extinction of siRNA in solely primer-dep. synthesis)
The populations of all types of siRNA S1,..., Sm eventually become extinct.
Proof. The eigenvalues of (1) are given by its diagonal elements.	Hence, the Perron–Frobenius root is the maximum eigenvalue, and this is less than or equal to
1. Thus, the assertion follows from Lemma 3.3.	2
As soon as primer-independent synthesis is enabled, we have the following:
Proposition 3.6 ( Sustainablility of RNAi with primer-indep. synthesis) RNAi may be sustainable with primer-independent synthesis.	That is, The probability of extinction of every type S1,..., Sm becomes less than 1.
Proof. The mean matrix Mindep for the primer-independent synthesis has the fol- lowing form:
Mindep = Mdep + Σ u ⊗ tej
j=1

where
u = (q, qc, qc2,... , qcm−1)
is given by a geometric sequence whose initial term q denotes the probability of RdRp mediation. Each element (from left, respectively) represents the birth rate of the corresponding type S1,..., Sm, respectively. Following the convention of Example
3.4, the common ratio c is given by c = h¯r¯.
The Perron–Frobenius root of Mindep − Mdep is given by ρ = Σm  ui =
q  m−1 ci−1. With appropriate choices for the parameters q and c, it is possible to ensure ρ > 1. By Lemma 3.2 for irreducible processes, the assertion holds.	2

Invariance under Model Refinements
The original rule of polymerization is local and compact in that the creation of Sk+1 of the lower strand is determined only by local knowledge of the immediate predecessor Sk. The knowledge concerns whether sites h and r of Sk are bound to the upper strand and to the predecessor by hydrogen and phosphate bonds, respectively. We can refine this rule to make this local description global, and thus incorporate contextual knowledge from all predecessors of siRNA (i.e., Sj with j ≤ k) as well as on the template mRNA.
Definition 4.1 The polymerization rule is refined as follows:
Sk(lk+1, h1k , rk),

Sk(l, h1k , rk),
−→
j<k Sj, mRNA(h1k , h)
j<k Sj, mRNA(h1k , h1k+1 ), Sk+1(l, h1k+1 , rk+1)

Although the states of all sites of Sj (j < k) are accounted for, no bonding conditions are required for the hydrogen and phosphate sites. mRNA(h, h) denotes the two sites of contiguous agents of Sk and Sk+1 in the template. See Figure 6 for the refined rule.

Fig. 6. Rule refinement for polymerization

The branching process for the refined rule is given by the mean matrix Mref (dep).
This has the same form as (1), but the n-th row un is now given by
sn = siten(Sn, mRNA) and mn,i = siten,i(Sn, Sn+1,..., Si−1, Si, mRNA).
Note that the number of arguments of site is enlarged to accommodate all Sj (j ≤ n) as well as mRNA.
Proposition 4.2 (Invariance under the rule refinements) The extinction property of Proposition 3.5 is invariant under the rule reﬁnement of Deﬁnition 4.1.
Proof. The Perron–Frobenius roots of the mean matrices do not increase under the refinement. That is, ρMdep ≥ ρMref (dep) for any model refinement ref (dep) defined in Definition 4.1 to the primer-dependent synthesis. This is because the diagonal elements of the matrices do not increase, i.e., siten(Sn) ≥ siten(Sn, mRNA) for 1 ≤ n ≤ m. These elements are sufficient to determine the root, given that both Mref (dep) and Mdep are triangular.	2
Conclusions and Future Works
In this paper, we modelled RNAi using a rule-based approach and investigated Galton–Watson multitype branching processes for several types of siRNA. We demonstrated the extinction of all types of siRNA for primer-dependent synthe- sis of RNAi in a compact model (Proposition 3.5). Model refinement was used to validate our compact description, so that the extinction property remains invariant throughout the class of the refinement (Definition 4.1), forcing the model to be less compact (Proposition 4.2). We also studied a branching process for primer- independent synthesis, which was shown to make RNAi sustainable (Proposition 3.6).
In future work, we will consider the following three problems: (1) This pa- per does not discuss any heterogeneity peculiar to reducible branching processes for primer-dependent synthesis. We expect that distributions of individuals of each siRNA type may be captured by rule-based modelling. The distribution of spreading concentrations of siRNA has been experimentally observed in [23] for animal RNAi, with the concentration differing according to the origin (5’ or 3’) of the siRNA. This spreading is being investigated by experimental biologists from the standpoint that the two syntheses discussed in our paper could explain the difference in RNAi
[17] between plants [1,4] and animals [23]. Branching in continuous time should be examined, and stochastic semantics and quantitative Monte Carlo simulations [25,5], especially the kappa simulator [11], are naturally applicable in this domain.
(2) Although our interest in the interactions of nucleic acids is to capture an au- tonomous computational mechanism [15] of RNAi, which in this paper results from the stochastic process calculus of the kappa, the interactions via hydrogen bonds also play fundamental roles in Cardelli-Phillips’ strand displacement calculus [24] for designing DNA circuits. A challenging angle for future work would be to design analogous information-processing circuits for RNA. (3) The dual notion of model refinement is model abstraction [8], which is an important tool for avoiding the

problem of combinatorial explosion. The results of this paper can be seen as the exactness of abstraction employed by local descriptions of rules. A theoretical for- mulation of the dual notions may characterize the exactness of an abstract model in terms of some invariance under appropriate model refinements.
