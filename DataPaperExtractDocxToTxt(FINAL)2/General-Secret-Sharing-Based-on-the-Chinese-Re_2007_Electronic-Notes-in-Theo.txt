Abstract
Threshold secret sharing based on the Chinese remainder theorem has been considered by Mignotte [23] and Asmuth and Bloom [1]. In this paper we demonstrate that the Chinese remainder theorem can be used for realizing more general access structures, as the compartmented or the weighted threshold ones. We also prove that there exist some non-weighted threshold access structures whose realizations require the general variant of the Chinese remainder theorem, i.e., the variant in which the modules are not necessarily pairwise coprime.
As an application of the proposed secret sharing schemes, we present a multi-authority e-voting schemes in which, as a novelty, the tallying authorities may have non-equal weights.
Keywords: secret sharing, Chinese remainder theorem, e-voting


Introduction and Preliminaries
A secret sharing scheme starts with a secret and then derives from it certain shares (or shadows) which are distributed to users. The secret may be recovered only by certain groups which belong to a predetermined access structure. In the first secret sharing schemes only the number of shares was important for recovering the secret. Such schemes have been referred to as threshold secret sharing schemes. We mention here Shamir’s scheme [29] based on polynomial interpolation, Blakley’s geometric scheme [5], Mignotte’s scheme [23] and Asmuth-Bloom scheme [1], both based on the Chinese remainder theorem. Ito, Saito, and Nishizeki [19], Benaloh and Leichter
[4] have proposed constructions for more general secret sharing schemes.
In this paper we prove that the Chinese remainder theorem can be used for realizing more general access structures. We consider first the compartmented secret

sharing schemes, in which the set of users is partitioned into compartments and the secret can be recovered if and only if the number of participants from any compartment is greater than or equal to a fixed compartment threshold and the total number of participants is greater than or equal to a global threshold. We extend Brickell’s construction [6] to the case that the global threshold is strictly greater than the sum of the compartment thresholds and we indicate how to use the threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chinese remainder theorem in order to decrease the size of shares.
We also extend the threshold Mignotte and Asmuth-Bloom schemes in order to address more general access structures. We present how to realize any weighted threshold access structure (in which some positive weight is associated to each user and the secret can be reconstructed if and only if the sum of the weights of the participants is greater than or equal to a fixed threshold) but we prove that our extensions are also suitable for some non-weighted threshold access structures.
The paper is organized as follows. The rest of this section is dedicated to some preliminaries on number theory, focusing on the Chinese remainder theorem. After a short introduction to secret sharing, we survey the threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chinese remainder theorem in Section 2. In Section 3 we extend the Brickell’s construction for compartmented secret sharing to the case that the global threshold is strictly greater than the sum of the compartment thresholds and we indicate how to use the threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chinese remainder theorem in order to decrease the size of shares. In Section 4 we extend the threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chinese remainder theorem to more general access structures and discuss the homomorphic properties of the resulted schemes. In Section 5 we describe a multi-authority e-voting scheme based on the proposed secret sharing schemes. Our conclusions and some interesting future research directions are presented in the last section.
In the rest of this section we present some basic facts and notations from number theory. For more details, the reader is referred to [8].
Let a, m ∈ Z, m /= 0. The quotient of the integer division of a by m will be denoted by a div m and the remainder will be denoted by a mod m. Let a, b, m ∈ Z. We say that a and b are congruent modulo m, and we use the notation a ≡ b mod m, if m|(a — b). In case m /= 0, a ≡ b mod m is equivalent with a mod m = b mod m. The set {0, 1,... ,m — 1} will be denoted by Zm, for any integer m ≥ 1.

Let a1,... , an ∈ Z, a2 + ··· + a2
/= 0. The greatest common divisor (gcd)

1	n
of a1,... , an will be denoted by (a1,... , an).  It is well-known that there exist
α1,... , αn ∈ Z that satisfy α1a1 + ··· + αnan = (a1,... , an) (the linear form of the
gcd).
Let a1,... , an ∈ Z such that a1 ··· an /= 0. The least common multiple (lcm) of
a1,... , an will be denoted by [a1,... , an].
The Chinese remainder theorem has many applications in computer science (see [10] for a survey on this topic). We only mention its applications to the RSA decryption algorithm as proposed by Quisquater and Couvreur [27], the discrete logarithm algorithm as proposed by Pohlig and Hellman [26], and the algorithm

for recovering the secret in Mignotte’s threshold secret sharing scheme [23] or in Asmuth-Bloom threshold secret sharing scheme [1].
Several versions of the Chinese remainder theorem have been proposed. The next one is called the general Chinese remainder theorem ([24]):
Theorem 1.1 Let k ≥ 2, p1,... , pk ≥ 2, and b1,... , bk ∈ Z. The system of equa- tions
⎪⎨	.
⎪⎪⎩ x ≡ bk mod pk
has solutions in Z if and only if bi ≡ bj mod (pi, pj), for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k. Moreover, if the above system of equations has solutions in Z, then it has a unique solution in Z[p1,...,pk].
Ore has proven that this solution can be obtained as
Σ γiδibi mod [p1,... , pk],
i=1
where δi = [p1,...,pk] , for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and γ1,... , γk are arbitrary integers such that
γ1δ1 + ··· + γkδk =1 (remark that (δ1,... , δk)= 1).
When (pi, pj) = 1, for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k, one gets the standard version of the Chinese remainder theorem. Garner [13] has found an efficient algorithm for this case and Fraenkel [12] has extended it to the general case.

Threshold Secret Sharing Schemes Based on the Chi- nese Remainder Theorem
We present first some basic facts about secret sharing schemes. The reader is referred to [31] for a survey on this topic. Suppose we have n users labeled with the numbers 1,... ,n and consider a set of groups 2 A ⊆ P({1, 2,... , n}). Informally, an A-secret sharing scheme is a method of generating (S, (I1,... , In)) such that
(correctness) for any A ∈ A, the problem of finding the element S, given the set
{Ii | i ∈ A}, is “easy”;
(security) for any A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) \ A, the problem of finding the element S, given the set {Ii | i ∈ A}, is intractable.
The set A will be referred to as the authorized access structure or simply as the access structure, S will be referred to as the secret and I1,... , In will be referred to as the shares (or the shadows) of S. The elements of the set A will be referred to as the authorized groups.

2 P({1, 2, ... , n}) denotes the set of all subsets of the set {1, 2,. .. , n}.

In a perfect secret sharing scheme, the shares of any unauthorized group give no information (in information-theoretic sense) about the secret. Karnin, Greene, and Hellman [20] have proven, using the concept of entropy, that in any perfect threshold secret sharing scheme, the shares must be at least as long as the secret and, later on, Capocelli, De Santis, Gargano, and Vaccaro [7] have extended this result to the case of any perfect secret sharing scheme. In an ideal secret sharing scheme, the shares are as long as the secret.
A natural condition is that an access structure A be monotone ([4]), i.e., (∀B ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}))((∃A ∈ A)(A ⊆ B) ⇒ B ∈ A).
Any monotone access structure A is well specified by the set of the minimal authorized groups, i.e., the set Amin = {A ∈ A|(∀B ∈ A \ {A})(¬B ⊆ A)}. Also, the unauthorized access structure A, A = P({1, 2,... , n}) \ A, is well specified by the set of the maximal unauthorized groups, i.e., the set Amax = {A ∈ A|(∀B ∈ A\ {A})(¬A ⊆ B)}.
In the first secret sharing schemes only the number of the participants in the reconstruction phase was important for recovering the secret. Such schemes have been referred to as threshold secret sharing schemes.
Definition 2.1 Let n ≥ 2, 2 ≤ k ≤ n. The access structure
A = {A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) | |A| ≥ k}
will be referred to as the (k, n)-threshold access structure.
In this case we also obtain that Amin = {A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) |  |A| = k},
A = {A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) | |A| ≤ k — 1}, and Amax = {A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) |
|A| = k — 1}. Any A-secret sharing scheme will be referred to as an (k, n)-threshold secret sharing scheme.
We briefly discuss next the most important threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chinese remainder theorem.
Mignotte’s Threshold Secret Sharing Scheme
Mignotte’s threshold secret sharing scheme [23] uses some special sequences of in- tegers, referred to as the Mignotte sequences.
Definition 2.2 Let n be a positive integer, n ≥ 2, and 2 ≤ k ≤ n. An (k, n)-
Mignotte sequence is a sequence of pairwise coprime positive integers p1 < p2 <
··· < pn such that
k−2	k
  pn−i <  pi.
i=0	i=1
The above inequality is equivalent with
max1≤i1<···<ik−1≤n(pi1 ··· pik−1 ) < min1≤i1<···<ik≤n(pi1 ··· pik ).

Given a publicly known (k, n)-Mignotte sequence, the scheme works as follows:
The secret S is chosen as a random integer such that β < S < α, where α =

k i=1
pi and β =  k−2 pn−i;

The shares Ii are chosen as Ii = S mod pi, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n;
Given k distinct shares Ii1 ,... , Iik , the secret S is recovered, using the stan- dard variant of the Chinese remainder theorem, as the unique solution modulo pi1 ··· pik of the system

⎪⎨	.	.
⎪⎪⎩ x ≡ Iik mod pik
Indeed, the secret S is an integer solution of the above system by the choice

of the shadows and, moreover, S lies in Zpi ···pi
because S < α. On the other

1	k
hand, having only k — 1 distinct shares Ii1 ,... , Iik−1 , we obtain only that S ≡
x0 mod pi1 ··· pik−1 , where x0 is the unique solution modulo pi1 ··· pik−1 of the resulted system (in this case, S > β ≥ pi1 ··· pik−1 > x0). Therefore, in order to assure a reasonable level of security, (k, n)-Mignotte sequences with a large factor

α−β
β
must be chosen (a method of generating such sequences is presented in [21,

page 9]).
Obviously, Mignotte’s scheme is not perfect, but it can lead to small shares and, thus, can be used in applications in which the compactness of the shares is the deciding factor.
We have extended Mignotte’s scheme in [17], by introducing the generalized threshold Mignotte sequences whose elements are not necessarily pairwise coprime.
Definition 2.3 Let n be an integer, n ≥ 2, and 2 ≤ k ≤ n. A generalized (k, n)-
Mignotte sequence is a sequence p1,... , pn of positive integers such that
max1≤i1<···<ik−1≤n([pi1 ,... , pik−1 ]) < min1≤i1<···<ik ≤n([pi1 ,... , pik ]).
It is easy to see that every (k, n)-Mignotte sequence is a generalized (k, n)- Mignotte sequence. Moreover, if we multiply every element of a (generalized) (k, n)- Mignotte sequence p1,... , pn by a fixed element δ ∈ Z, (δ, p1 ··· pn) = 1, we also obtain a generalized (k, n)-Mignotte sequence.
The extended Mignotte scheme works like Mignotte’s scheme, where α = min1≤i1 <···<ik ≤n([pi1 ,... , pik ]) and β = max1≤i1 <···<ik−1≤n([pi1 ,... , pik−1 ]). In this case, the general variant of the Chinese remainder theorem must be used for recov- ering the secret.
Asmuth-Bloom Threshold Secret Sharing Scheme
This scheme, proposed by Asmuth and Bloom in [1], also uses some special sequences of integers. More exactly, a sequence of pairwise coprime positive integers p0, p1 <

··· < pn is chosen such that
k−2	k
p0 ·   pn−i <  pi.
i=0	i=1
Given a publicly known Asmuth-Bloom sequence, the scheme works as follows:
The secret S is chosen as a random element of the set Zp0 ;
The shares Ii are chosen as Ii = (S + γ · p0) mod pi, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where γ is an arbitrary integer such that S + γ · p0 ∈ Zp1···pk ;
Given k distinct shares Ii1 ,... , Iik , the secret S can be reconstructed as S = x0 mod p0, where x0 is obtained, using the standard variant of the Chinese re- mainder theorem, as the unique solution modulo pi1 ··· pik of the system

⎪⎨	.	.
⎪⎪⎩ x ≡ Iik mod pik
Goldreich, Ron, and Sudan [15] have proposed choosing p0, p1,... , pn as prime numbers of the same size. Quisquater, Preneel, and Vandewalle [28] have proven that, by choosing p0, p1,... , pn as consecutive primes, the resulted schemes are asymptotically perfect and asymptotically ideal (for technical details, the reader is referred to [28]).
The sequences used in Asmuth-Bloom scheme can be also generalized by allowing modules that are not necessarily pairwise coprime in an obvious manner. We can use any sequence p0, p1, ··· , pn such that
p0 · max1≤i1 <···<ik−1 ≤n([pi1 ,... , pik−1 ]) < min1≤i1<···<ik ≤n([pi1 ,... , pik ]).
It is easy to see that if we multiply the elements, excepting the first one, of a (generalized) Asmuth-Bloom sequence p0, p1, ··· , pn with a fixed element δ ∈ Z, (δ, p0 ··· pn) = 1, we also obtain a generalized Asmuth-Bloom sequence.

Compartmented Secret Sharing Based on the Chi- nese Remainder Theorem
In case of compartmented secret sharing, the set of users is partitioned into com- partments and the secret can be recovered only if the number of participants from any compartment is greater than or equal to a fixed compartment threshold, and the total number of participants is greater than or equal to a global threshold. The compartmented secret sharing has been discussed for the first time by Simmons in [30]. Simmons has presented the example of an official action that requires that at least two U.S. members and at least two U.S.S.R. members be simultaneously present for its initiation.

The compartmented access structures can be introduced as follows.
Definition 3.1 Let C = {C1, C2,... , Cm} be a partition of C0 = {1, 2,... , n} and consider a sequence K = (k0, k1, k2,... , km), where kj ≤ |Cj|, for all 0 ≤ j ≤ m,
and Σm kj ≤ k0. The (C, K)-compartmented access structure is given by
A = {A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) |(∀j = 0, m)(|A ∩ Cj| ≥ kj)}.

In this case, any A-secret sharing scheme will be referred to as a (C, K)- compartmented secret sharing scheme. The sets C1, C2,... , Cm will be referred to as the compartments of the scheme, the values k1, k2,... , km as the compartment thresholds and k0 as the global threshold of the scheme.
An (k, n)-threshold secret sharing scheme is nothing else than a (C, K)- compartmented secret sharing scheme with C = {{1, 2,... , n}} (m = 1) and
K = (k, k).
Brickell [6] has proposed an elegant solution for the case k0 = Σm  kj by ex-
pressing the secret S as a combination of some compartment secrets s1,... , sm
and using an (kj, |Cj|)-threshold secret sharing scheme for obtaining the shares
{Ii|i ∈ Cj} corresponding to the compartment secret sj, for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m. In the reconstruction phase, if the number of participants from the jth com- partment is greater than or equal to kj, for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m, then all com- partment secrets can be recovered and, thus, the secret S can be obtained (re- mark that in this case the compartmented access structure can be simplified to
{A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) | (∀j = 1, m)(|A ∩ Cj| ≥ kj)}).
Ghodosi, Pieprzyk, and Safavi-Naini proposed an efficient scheme for the general case in [14].
We extend Brickell’s construction to the case Σm  kj < k0 as follows.
The secret is chosen as S = s0 + s1 + ··· + sm, where s0, s1,... , sm are positive integers;
The shares are chosen as Ii = (gi, ci), for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where
g1,... , gn are the shares corresponding to the secret s0 with respect to an ar- bitrary (k0, n)-threshold secret sharing scheme - these elements will be referred to as the global components of the shares;
for every 1 ≤ j ≤ m, {ci|i ∈ Cj} are the shares corresponding to the secret sj with respect to an arbitrary (kj, |Cj|)-threshold secret sharing scheme - these elements will be referred to as the compartment components of the shares.
Remark 3.2 (Correctness)
Let A be an authorized access group. Thus, |A|≥ k0 and, for all j = 1, m, |A∩Cj|≥ kj. Having at least k0 of the shares g1,... , gn, the value s0 can be obtained. Then, for any j = 1, m, having at least kj of the shares {ci|i ∈ Cj}, the value sj can be obtained, and finally, the secret S can be reconstructed as S = s0 + s1 + ··· + sm.
Remark 3.3 (Security)
Let A be an unauthorized access group. There are two possibilities:

|A| < k0 - in this case, the value s0 can not be determined;
There is an compartment j such that |A ∩ Cj| < kj - in this case the value sj can not be determined.
In both cases, the secret S can not be reconstructed.
Using perfect threshold secret sharing schemes as building blocks can lead to large shares. We propose using the threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chinese remainder theorem in order to decrease the size of shares, maintaining, at the same time, a reasonable level of security. For simplicity, we shall use only Mignotte’s scheme, but we have to mention that this technique can be also applied using Asmuth-Bloom scheme.
For any 0 ≤ j ≤ m, we will generate and broadcast a generalized (kj, |Cj|)- Mignotte sequence (pj,i|i ∈ Cj). Let βj = maxi1 ,...,ikj −1 ∈Cj ([pj,i1 ,... , pj,ikj −1 ]) and αj = mini1,...,ik ∈Cj ([pj,i1 ,... , pj,ik ]), for 0 ≤ j ≤ m. We may use a generalized
Mignotte sequence twice in case that kj = kl and |Cj| = |Cl|, for some 1 ≤ j < l ≤
m. The secret S is chosen as S = Σm  sj, where βj < sj < αj. The components
of the shares will be chosen as
gi = s0 mod p0,i, ci = sc(i) mod pc(i),i,
where c(i) is the unique element j, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, such that i ∈ Cj, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Example 3.4 illustrates this scheme.
Example 3.4 (with artificially small parameters)
Let us consider n = 6, C = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}, the compartment thresholds k1 = 2,
k2 = 2 and the global threshold k0 = 5. The sequence 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 is a (5, 6)-Mignotte sequence, with α0 = 85085 and β0 = 46189, and the sequence 7, 11, 13 is a (2, 3)-Mignotte sequence with α1 = α2 = 77 and β1 = β2 = 13. We choose s0 = 50000, s1 = 30, and s2 = 40. The secret is S = 50070 and the corresponding shares are I1 = (0, 2), I2 = (6, 8), I3 = (5, 4), I4 = (2, 5), I5 = (3, 7),
and I6 = (11, 1).
Having the shares I1 = (0, 2), I2 = (6, 8), I4 = (2, 5), I5 = (3, 7), and I6 = (11, 1),
we solve the systems
⎧⎪ x ≡ 0 mod 5
⎪ x ≡ 6 mod 7
x ≡ 2 mod 13	,
x ≡ 3 mod 17
⎪⎩ x ≡ 11 mod 19
⎧⎨ x ≡ 2 mod 7	,
⎩ x ≡ 8 mod 11

⎧⎨ x ≡ 7 mod 11 ,
⎩ x ≡ 1 mod 13
and obtain, respectively, s0 = 50000, s1 = 30, s2 = 40, and finally S = 50070.
Let us analyze the security of the scheme. Let B be an unauthorized group and consider ΔB = {j ∈ {0, 1,... , m}| |A ∩ Cj| < kj}. The informations obtained from the shares corresponding to B lead to a set of possible vectors (s0, s1,... , sm)

of cardinality at least 
j∈ΔB
αj −βj . The generalized Mignotte sequences can be
j

thus generated accordingly to the unauthorized access structure in order to obtain
a suitable security level.
Although the shares of our scheme have two components, by using Mignotte’s scheme as a building block, the sizes of shares can be smaller than the size of the secret. Further improvements can be obtained by choosing the Mignotte sequences and the values s0, s1,... , sm such that the global components of some shares coincide with the corresponding compartment ones, i.e., gi = ci, for some i ∈ {1, 2,... , n}. In this case we can define the share Ii as Ii = gi = ci. For this, we can generate first s1,... , sm and c1,... , cn and determining s0 by solving the system of equations

⎪⎨	.	.
⎪⎪⎩ x ≡ ck0 mod p0,k0
We will choose Ii = gi = ci, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k0, gi = s0 mod p0,i and Ii = (gi, ci), for all k0 +1 ≤ i ≤ n. Further improvements can be obtained in case that s0 mod p0,i = sc(i) mod pc(i),i, for some k0 +1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Example 3.5 illustrates the reduction of the shares.
Example 3.5 (with artificially small parameters)
Let us reconsider Example 3.4. We choose s1 = 30 and s2 = 40. We obtain c1 = 2,
c2 = 8, c3 = 4, c4 = 5, c5 = 7, and c6 = 1. The system
⎧⎪ x ≡ 2 mod 5
⎪⎨ x ≡ 4 mod 11

⎪⎩ x ≡ 7 mod 17
has the solution s0 = 32817. The secret will be S = 32887 and the shares I1 = 2,
I2 = 8, I3 = 4, I4 = 5, I5 = 7, and I6 = (4, 1).

Thus, in case that k0 is close to n, real improvements related to the size of shares can be made. However, every compression of a share, i.e., any equalization of form
g = c , can affect the security with a factor of αc(i) −βc(i) . Thus, depending of the
i	i	βc(i)
intended application, a compromise between the size of the shares and the level of
security must be made.

More General Secret Sharing Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem
In this section we extend the threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chinese remainder theorem in order to deal with more general access structures. For this, we will generalize the threshold Mignotte and Asmuth-Bloom sequences in a natural manner, the rest of these secret sharing schemes remaining unaffected.
We begin with extending Mignotte sequences.
Definition 4.1 Let n be a positive integer, n ≥ 2 and A ⊆ P({1, 2,... , n}). An
A-Mignotte sequence is a sequence of positive integers p1,... , pn such that
β = maxB∈A([{pi|i ∈ B}]) < minA∈A([{pi|i ∈ A}]) = α.
The above property is equivalent with
maxB∈Amax ([{pi|i ∈ B}]) < minA∈Amin ([{pi|i ∈ A}]).
If A is specified by Amin = {A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) | |A| = k} then any A-Mignotte sequence is a generalized threshold (k, n)-Mignotte sequence in sense of Definition
2.3. It is easy to see that if we multiply the elements of an A-Mignotte sequence p1, ··· , pn with a fixed element δ ∈ Z, (δ, p1 ··· pn) = 1, we also obtain an A- Mignotte sequence.
We will describe next how to construct Mignotte sequences in case of the weighted threshold access structures.
In a weighted threshold secret sharing scheme, a positive weight is associated to each user and the secret can be reconstructed if and only if the sum of the weights of all participants is greater than or equal to a fixed threshold. Such schemes have been considered for the first time by Shamir [29]. Shamir has discussed the case of sharing a secret between the executives of a company such that the secret can be recovered by any three executives, or by any executive and any vice-president, or by the president alone. The Shamir’s solution for this case is based on a threshold secret sharing scheme with the threshold 3. Thus, the president receives three shares, each vice-president receives two shares and, finally, every simple executive receives a single share.
The weighted threshold access structures can be introduced as follows.
Definition 4.2 Let n ≥ 2, ω = (ω1,... , ωn) a sequence of positive integers, and w

a positive integer such that 2 ≤ w ≤ Σn	ωi. The access structure
A = {A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) | Σ ωi ≥ w}
i∈A
will be referred to as the (ω, w, n)-weighted threshold access structure.
In this case, any A-secret sharing scheme will be referred to as an (ω, w, n)- weighted threshold secret sharing scheme. The parameters ω1,... , ωn will be referred to as the weights and w will be referred to as the threshold of the scheme.
An (k, n)-threshold secret sharing scheme is nothing else than an (ω, w, n)- weighted threshold secret sharing scheme with ω1 = ··· = ωn =1 and w = k.
In case that A is the (ω, w, n)-weighted threshold access structure, an A- Mignotte sequence will be referred to as an (ω, w, n)-Mignotte sequence. More exactly, an (ω, w, n)-Mignotte sequence is a sequence of positive integers p1,... , pn such that
maxB∈P({1,2,...,n}) ([{pi|i ∈ B}]) < minA∈P({1,2,...,n})([{pi|i ∈ A}]).

i∈B
ωi≤w−1
i∈A
ωi≥w

An (ω, w, n)-Mignotte sequence can be constructed as follows (see also [18]). Let
p' ,... , p' be a generalized threshold (w, N )-Mignotte sequence, where N = Σn	ωi
and define pi = [{p' | j ∈ Pi}], for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where {P1,... , Pn} is an arbitrary
partition of the set {1, 2,... ,N } such that |Pi| = ωi, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It is easy to prove that the sequence p1,... , pn is indeed an (ω, w, n)-Mignotte sequence.
Benaloh and Leichter have proven in [4] that there exist access structures that are not weighted threshold. We present next their example that proves this statement.
Example 4.3 (Benaloh and Leichter [4])
Let n = 4 and Amin = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}. Suppose that this access structure is a weighted threshold access structure with the weights ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4, and the thresh- old w. So, ω1 + ω2 ≥ w and ω3 + ω4 ≥ w. If we sum these inequalities we obtain ω1+ω2+ω3+ω4 ≥ 2w, and, thus, we obtain that 2·max(ω1, ω2)+2·max(ω3, ω4) ≥ 2w which leads to max(ω1, ω2)+ max(ω3, ω4) ≥ w. Thus, one of the sets {1, 3}, {1, 4},
{2, 3} or {2, 4} is an authorized access group!
We will present how to realize this access structure using the proposed extension of Mignotte scheme. In fact, the main problem is to find an A-Mignotte sequence. More exactly, we are interested in finding a sequence of positive integers p1, p2, p3, p4 such that
max([p1, p3], [p1, p4], [p2, p3], [p2, p4]) < min([p1, p2], [p3, p4]).

It is interesting to remark that this access structure can not be realized using sequences of pairwise coprime numbers. Indeed, there is no A-Mignotte sequence with pairwise coprime elements, because, otherwise, the above inequality will lead to p1p3 < p1p2 and p2p4 < p3p4 and, thus, to p3 < p2 and p2 < p3!

If q1, q2, q3, q4 are pairwise coprime, then the sequence p1 = q1q2, p2 = q3q4, p3 = q1q3, p4 = q2q4 is an A-Mignotte sequence. In this case, the general variant of the Chinese remainder theorem must be used for recovering the secret.
Asmuth-Bloom sequences can be extended as follows.
Definition 4.4 Let n be a positive integer, n ≥ 2 and A ⊆ P({1, 2,... , n}). An
A-Asmuth-Bloom sequence is a sequence of positive integers p0, p1,... , pn such that
p0 · maxB∈A([{pi|i ∈ B}]) < minA∈A([{pi|i ∈ A}]).
The above property is equivalent with
p0 · maxB∈Amax ([{pi|i ∈ B}]) < minA∈Amin ([{pi|i ∈ A}]).
If A is specified by Amin = {A ∈ P({1, 2,... , n}) | |A| = k} then any A-Asmuth- Bloom sequence is a generalized threshold (k, n)-Asmuth-Bloom sequence. It is easy to see that if we multiply the elements, excepting the first one, of an A-Asmuth- Bloom sequence p0, p1, ··· , pn with a fixed element δ ∈ Z, (δ, p0 ··· pn) = 1, we also obtain an A-Asmuth-Bloom sequence.
We will describe next how to construct Asmuth-Bloom sequences in case of the weighted threshold access structures. Let n ≥ 2, ω = (ω1,... , ωn) a sequence of weights, and w a threshold. An (ω, w, n)-Asmuth-Bloom sequence is a sequence of positive integers p0, p1,... , pn such that
p0 · maxB∈P({1,2,...,n}) ([{pi|i ∈ B}]) < minA∈P({1,2,...,n})([{pi|i ∈ A}]).

i∈B
ωi≤w−1
i∈A
ωi≥w

An (ω, w, n)-Asmuth-Bloom sequence can be constructed as follows.	Let

p' , p' ,... , p'
be a generalized threshold (w, N )-Asmuth-Bloom sequence, where

0	1	N

n i=1
ωi and define p0 = p'
and pi = [{p'
| j ∈ Pi}], for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where

{P1,... , Pn} is an arbitrary partition of the set {1, 2,... ,N } such that |Pi| = ωi,
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It is easy to prove that the sequence p0, p1,... , pn is indeed an (ω, w, n)-Asmuth-Bloom sequence.
Example 4.5 illustrates this construction.
Example 4.5 (with artificially small parameters)
Consider n = 4, the weights ω1 = ω2 = 1, ω3 = ω4 = 2, and the threshold w = 3. We obtain N = 6. The sequence 5, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 is a (3, 6)-Asmuth-Bloom
sequence and, if we consider the partition {{6}, {5}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}} of the set
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we obtain that the sequence 5, 37, 31, 17 · 29, 19 · 23 is an
((1, 1, 2, 2), 3, 4)-Asmuth-Bloom sequence.
The access structure given by Amin = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}} can not be realized using Asmuth-Bloom sequences of pairwise coprime numbers. Indeed, there is no A- Asmuth-Bloom sequence with pairwise coprime elements, because, otherwise, the condition p0 · max([p1, p3], [p1, p4], [p2, p3], [p2, p4]) < min([p1, p2], [p3, p4]) will lead

to p0p1p3 < p1p2 and p0p2p4 < p3p4 and, thus, to p0p3 < p2 (which implies p2p3 <
p0p2), and p0p2 < p3, which will finally lead to p2 < 1!
If q1, q2, q3, q4 are pairwise coprime, then the sequence p0, p1 = q1q2, p2 = q3q4, p3 = q1q3, p4 = q2q4 is an A-Asmuth-Bloom sequence, for any p0 < min(q1, q2, q3, q4). Indeed, in this case, min([p1, p2], [p3, p4]) = q1q2q3q4 and max([p1, p3], [p1, p4], [p2, p3], [p2, p4]) = q1q2q3q4 , for some i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. In this case, the general variant of the Chinese remainder theorem must be used for recovering the secret.

Secret Sharing Homomorphisms
Benaloh has introduced the notion of secret sharing homomorphisms in [2]. We present here a slightly different version of his definition.
Definition 4.6 Let S and S1,... , Sn be the set of possible secrets and, respectively, the set of possible shares corresponding to each user. Consider the binary operations
⊕ and ⊗1,... , ⊗n over these sets.  We say that an A-secret sharing scheme is
(⊕, ⊗1,... , ⊗n) — homomorphic if for any S1, S2 ∈S with the corresponding shares (I1,... ,I1), and respectively, (I2,... ,I2), the shares of the secret S1 ⊕ S2 are (I1 ⊗1
1	n	1	n	1
I2,... ,I1 ⊗n I2).
1	n	n
Intuitively, this means that the compositions of the shares are shares of the composition of the secrets.
The extended Mignotte scheme has such properties. Let ⊗ be a binary operation over Z, ⊗ ∈ {+, —, ·}, and let ⊗m denote the corresponding operation modulo m, i.e., ⊗m is the binary operation over Zm given by a ⊗m b = (a ⊗ b) mod m, for any a, b ∈ Zm. If p1,... , pn is an extended Mignotte sequence and ⊗ ∈ {+, —, ·}, then the corresponding secret sharing scheme is (⊗, ⊗p1 ,... , ⊗pn )-partial homomorphic, in sense that, if S1 and S2 are some secrets such that β < S1 ⊗ S2 < α, with
the corresponding shares (I1,... ,I1), and respectively, (I2,... ,I2), then (I1 ⊗p
1	n	1	n	1	1
I2,... ,I1 ⊗p I2) are the shares corresponding 3 to the secret S1 ⊗ S2.
1	n	n  n
The extended Asmuth-Bloom scheme has homomorphic properties in case that
the extended Asmuth-Bloom sequence has the property p0|pi, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In this case, the secret can be expressed as
S = (Σi∈A γiδiIi mod [{pi|i ∈ A}]) mod p0
= Σi∈A γiδiIi mod p0,
for some authorized group A, where δi = [{pi|i∈A}] , for all i ∈ A, and γi, for i ∈
pi
A, are arbitrary integers such that	i∈A γiδi = 1. Thus, any extended Asmuth-
Bloom scheme based on a sequence with such properties is (⊗p0 , ⊗p0 ,... , ⊗p0 ) - 
homomorphic, where ⊗ ∈ {+, —}. Unfortunately, the property p0|pi also implies

3 This property follows directly from the properties of the congruences. More exactly, if S1 ≡ I1 mod pi
and S2 ≡ I2 mod pi then S1 ⊗ S2 ≡ I1 ⊗pi I2 mod pi.

that
Ii mod p0 = ((S + γ · p0) mod pi) mod p0
= (S + γ · p0) mod p0
= S,
and, thus, the security of the scheme is entirely compromised. It will be interesting to find Asmuth-Bloom sequences which lead to homomorphic properties, without affecting the security of the scheme. One solution would be to find A-Asmuth-Bloom sequences p0, p1,... , pn such that p0|[{pi|i ∈ A}], for all A ∈ Amin, but p0 / |pi, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

An E-voting Scheme
According to [32], “an electronic voting (e-voting) system is a voting system in which the election data is recorded, stored and processed primarily as digital information”. We present next the most important requirements for an e-voting scheme (the reader is referred to [16] for more details):
Correctness - according to this requirement, the announced tally is identical with the real outcome of the election;
Privacy - this requirement guarantees that no reasonable sized coalitions of voters or authorities may link a voter’s identity to his vote;
Robustness - according to this requirement, no reasonable sized coalitions of voters or authorities may affect the election;
Veriﬁability - this requirement assures the existence of some mechanisms for au- diting the election in order to verify if it has taken place properly.
We have to remark that these properties may contradict or interrelate one with another. For example, verifiability implies the existence of some proofs for the consistency of the votes but these may affect privacy. On the other hand, verifiability is a strong supporter both for the correctness and for the robustness of the scheme. We focus only on the case of yes/no e-voting. We follow the approach of Benaloh [2], [3] for designing a multi-authority e-voting scheme. The novelty of our scheme is that the tallying authorities may have non-equal weights. The parties involved are the voters V1,... , Vm, the tallying authorities A1,... , An and the central authority
A. We present next the steps of our e-voting scheme.
Setup
The central authority A decides on an authorized access structure A for the tally- ing authorities and generates and broadcasts an A-Mignotte sequence p1,... , pn with a large factor α−β ;
The central authority A broadcasts the values vyes and vno, where vyes, vno ∈
{β + 1,... ,α — 1} are assigned to the yes vote and to the no vote;
Ballot Construction

For 1 ≤ j ≤ m, the voter Vj chooses a vote mask 4 bj, 0 < bj < α — vj, for his vote vj ∈ {vyes, vno} and forms the ballot Bj = vj + bj;
The voter Vj securely sends the sub-ballot Bj,i = Bj mod pi to the tallying authority Ai, for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m and for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n;
Ballot Tallying
At the end of ballot construction period, the tallying authority Ai computes

m j=1
central authority A, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n;
Bj,i mod pi and securely sends it to the

· The central authority A obtains the final “masked” tally T = Σm  Bj by solv-
ing, using the general variant of the Chinese remainder theorem, the system of equations
 x ≡ Ti mod pi, i ∈ A
for some A ∈ A; for the correctness of this reasoning, any possible final “masked” tally T must satisfy T < α (the relation β < T holds by the choice of the values vyes, vno and of the mask values). Indeed, in this case, by the fact that the extended Mignotte secret sharing scheme is (+, +p1 ,... , +pn )-partial homomorphic, the values T1,... , Tn are the shares of the element T . In order to assure T < α, the central authority A may impose, for example, the condition
m · (max(vyes, vno)+ max(b1,... , bm)) < α;
· At the previous step, the central authority A can also verify the consistency of the values Ti,i ∈ A, by testing if Ti ≡ Ti' mod (pi, pi' ), for any i, i' ∈ A;
Vote Casting
At the end of ballot tallying period, the voter Vj securely sends bj to the central authority A, for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m;
Vote Counting
At the end of vote casting period, the central authority A computes the sum of
votes S = Σm  vj as S = T — Σm  bj;
The numbers of yes and no votes can be obtained as the solution of the equation vyes · x+ vno · y = S; if the values vyes and vno are chosen such that m · vyes < vno, then this solution can be determined as
number votes no = S div vno,
number votes yes = (S mod vno) div vyes.
The central authority broadcasts number votes yes, number votes no. Our e-voting scheme has the following properties:
Privacy - in order to link a voter’s identity (Vj) to his vote (vj), at least an au- thorized group of tallying authorities and the central authority must collaborate.

4 The purpose of the masks is to hide any information about the voters’ choices. Moreover, the ballot construction and ballot tallying can be performed in advance.

Indeed, the ballot Bj may be reconstructed only by an authorized group of tal- lying authorities and the mask bj is known only by the central authority. Thus, our scheme assures privacy against any coalition formed by a group B ∈ A of tallying authorities and the central authority A;
Veriﬁability - some verifications are made in the ballot tallying phase but some proofs have to be added at the voters’ level. This includes the proof that a voter really chooses a vote in {vyes, vno} and the proof that the sub-ballots are properly derived. For the second part, verifiable secret sharing (see [11], [25]) may be used. A non-interactive modular verifiable secret sharing scheme was proposed in [22] and we may use it for our case;
Robustness - assuming that the voters’ actions are performed honestly (or using verifiable secret sharing for detecting frauds), the election carries on correctly if at least a group A ∈ A of tallying authorities and the central authority A act honestly.

Conclusions and Future Work
We have demonstrated that the Chinese remainder theorem can be used for realizing more general access structures than the threshold ones.
We have first extended Brickell’s construction for compartmented secret sharing to the case that the global threshold is strictly greater than the sum of the com- partment thresholds and we have proposed using threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chinese remainder theorem as building blocks in order to decrease the size of shares, maintaining, in the same time, a reasonable level of security.
We have then extended the threshold secret sharing schemes based on the Chi- nese remainder theorem in order to deal with more general access structures. We have presented how to realize any weighted threshold access structure but we have also proven that our extensions are suitable for realizing some non-weighted thresh- old access structures. In our future work, we will investigate what other classes of access structures can be realized using our schemes and we will also study the related problem of generating Mignotte or Asmuth-Bloom sequences. It is inter- esting to remark that some access structures can not be realized using sequences of pairwise coprime numbers and, thus, the general variant of the Chinese remain- der theorem must be used for recovering the secret. The access structure given by Amin = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}} is such an example (see Section 4). It will be interesting to find other access structures with the same property or even find a general criterion for deciding if a certain access structure may be realized using the standard variant of the Chinese remainder theorem.
We have presented a multi-authority e-voting scheme based on the proposed secret sharing schemes, in which, as a novelty, the tallying authorities may have non-equal weights. The resulted e-voting scheme has some important properties as privacy and robustness. Some verifiability mechanisms are present in the ballot tallying phase but in our future work we will try to add proofs of consistency at voters’ level and at the central authority level (following, for example, the approach

described in [9]).
Threshold cryptography in which the implicated parties may have non-equal weights is another promising future research direction and we think that our secret sharing schemes can be used in this sense.
