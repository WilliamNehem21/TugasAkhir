Abstract
The Symmetric Circulant Traveling Salesman Problem asks for the minimum cost of a Hamiltonian cycle in a circulant weighted undirected graph. The computational complexity of this problem is not known. Just a constructive upper bound, and a good lower bound have been determined.
This paper provides a characterization of the two stripe case. Instances where the minimum cost of a Hamiltonian cycle is equal either to the upper bound, or to the lower bound are recognized. A new construction providing Hamiltonian cycles, whose cost is in many cases lower than the upper bound, is proposed for the remaining instances.
Keywords: Traveling Salesman Problem, Circulant weighted undirected graphs, computational complexity.


Introduction
An n × n matrix M = (mi,j) is called circulant if mi,j = m0,(j−i) mod n, for any 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n−1 (for more details on circulant matrices, see [6]). An undirected (directed) graph is said to be circulant if its adjacency matrix is circulant. Similarly, a weighted undirected (directed) graph is said to be circulant if its weighted adjacency matrix is circulant.
In the last years, graph theoretic properties of circulant graphs have been ana- lyzed. In particular, it was investigated if a known graph problem becomes easier

when the general instance is forced to be a circulant graph. Codenotti, Gerace and Vigna [5] have shown that Maximum Clique, and Minimum Graph Coloring remain Np-hard, and not approximable within a constant factor, even if restricted to circulant undirected graphs. Muzychuk [12] has, instead, proved that Graph Isomorphism restricted to circulant undirected graphs is in P, while the general case is, probably, harder.
As well as we know, it is an open question whether Hamiltonian Circuit, and Traveling Salesman Problem (for short, TSP) restricted to circulant directed graphs remains Np-hard, or not. Some special cases are solved in [7], [14], [11] and [2].
The undirected case is less difficult. As shown by Burkard, and Sandholzer [4], Hamiltonian Circuit, and Bottleneck TSP are polynomial time solvable on the circulant weighted undirected graphs. Unfortunately, a similar result is not known for TSP (see [3], for a survey on the well solvable special cases).
In this paper we study TSP in the circulant weighted undirected graph case. In §2, and in §3, some definitions, and preliminaries are introduced. In §4, the not Hamiltonian case is solved. For the Hamiltonian case, an upper bound, and a lower bound are presented. More results appear independently in [13], and in [9]. In §5, the two stripe case is analyzed. In the last theorem we link the minimum cost of a Hamiltonian cycle to a set AG. In particular, we prove that such cost is equal to the upper bound if AG is empty, and is equal to the lower bound if AG contains a suitably bounded integer. In the remaining cases, we determine a new Hamiltonian cycle whose cost is in many cases lower than the upper bound. §6 completes the paper by presenting open problems, conclusions, and remarks.

The Traveling Salesman Problem
A weighted undirected graph (shortly, w.u. graph) G = (Zn, E, c) consists of a node set Zn = {0, 1,... ,n − 1}, for some integer n ≥ 2, of a collection E of 2-subsets of Zn called edges, and of a cost function c : E → N.
The weighted adjacency matrix of G is an n×n matrix M = (mi,j), whose general entry is c({i, j}), if {i, j} ∈ E, or ∞, otherwise. Note that E = {{i, j} : mi,j /= ∞}, and that M is symmetric, as G is undirected.
A path P  in G = (Zn, E, c) is a node sequence [v0, v1,... , vm] such that
{vk−1, vk} ∈ E, for any k = 1,... , m; v0, and vm are called, respectively, the
starting point, and the ending point of P . If they coincide, then P is a cycle. The
positive integer m is called the length of P . Any path of length 1 is called an arc. We attach to P the cost c(P )= Σk c({vk−1, vk}).
The inverse path −P  corresponds to the node sequence [vm, vm−1,... , v0].
Clearly, c(P ) = c(−P ).  Finally, given a path Q = [u0, u1,... , um' ] such that u0 = vm, the composed path P · Q corresponds to the node sequence [v0, v1,... , vm, u1,... , um' ].
A path is elementary if any two nodes of its node sequence are distinct. The path [v0, v1,... , vm] is an Hamiltonian path for A ⊂ Zn, if it is elementary, and A =

{v0, v1,... , vm}. It is a Hamiltonian cycle for G, if vm = v0, and [v0, v1,... , vm−1] is a Hamiltonian path for Zn.
G is said to be Hamiltonian if there exists a Hamiltonian cycle for it. If G is Hamiltonian, we denote by c∗(G) the minimum cost of a Hamiltonian cycle for it. Otherwise, we set c∗(G)= ∞. Any Hamiltonian cycle C such that c(C)= c∗(G) is said to be minimal.
TSP asks for finding c∗(G), given a w.u. graph G. TSP is an Np-hard problem, and no performance guarantee polynomial time approximation algorithms for it are known. In this paper we study the case in which G is a circulant w.u. graph. As suggested in [13], we call such problem Symmetric Circulant Traveling Salesman Problem, shortly SCTSP.
Definitions on Circulant Graphs
Throughout this paper a ≡m b denotes the relation a ≡ b mod m, and ⟨a⟩m denotes the integer a mod m, for any a, b ∈ Z, and m ∈ N.
A w.u. graph G = (Zn, E, c) is circulant if its weighted adjacency matrix M is a circulant one.  The set SG = {a : a ∈ Zn, {0, a} ∈ E, a ≤ n/2} is called the stripe set of G.  An element of SG is called a stripe.  Clearly, E = { {u, v} : u, v ∈ Zn, (v − u) ≡n ± a, a ∈ SG}.
For any a ∈ SG, an edge {u, v} such that (v − u) ≡n ±a is called an edge of stripe
a. As M is a circulant, and symmetric matrix, it follows that any edge of stripe a has cost c({0, a}). This integer is called the cost of stripe a. An arc [v0, v1] is called a +a-arc (respectively, a −a-arc), if (v1 − v0) ≡n +a (respectively, (v1 − v0) ≡n −a).

Let s = |SG|, and let ({ct}s
) be the s-tuple obtained by sorting in non de-

creasing order the multiset {c({0, a}) : a ∈ SG}. The integer ct is called the t-th cost of G.

A permutation ({at}s
) of the set SG satisfying c({0, at})= ct, for any 1 ≤ t ≤
'

s, is called a presentation for SG. Clearly, for any 1 ≤ t < t ≤ s, at, at' ∈ [1, n/2],
at /= at' , and c({0, at}) = ct ≤ ct' = c({0, at' }). It can be easily shown that there exists a unique presentation for SG if and only if the costs of any two different stripes are different.

If π = ({at}s
) is any presentation for SG, let gπ = n, and let gπ = gcd(gπ
, at),

t=1
0	t	t−1

for any 1 ≤ t ≤ s. Clearly, gπ = gcd(n, a1,... , at), for any 1 ≤ t ≤ s. It follows
from the next theorem that gπ represents the number of connected components of
G.
Theorem 3.1 (Boesch, and Tindell, [1]) Let G  = (Zn, E, c) be a circulant
w.u. graph, and let SG = {a1,... , as}. Then, G has gcd(n, a1,... , as) connected components.
We say that a (circulant) w.u. graph G is presentable as G(n; π; {ct}s	), if Zn
is its node set, s is the cardinality of SG, ct is the t-th cost of G, for any 1 ≤ t ≤ s,
and, finally, π is a presentation for SG.
Example 3.2 The w.u. graph presentable as G(8; 2, 1; 1, 6) is depicted in Figure 1.

As the costs of the two stripes are distinct, π = (2, 1) is the unique presentation for
G. We note that gπ = 2, gπ = 1, and that a Hamiltonian cycle for G containing
1	2
only edges of stripe 2 does not exist.
We end this section by stating a result of Bach, Luby, Goldwasser [10].

Bounds for SCTSP

Any Hamiltonian w.u. graph is connected, while the converse is not true. Proposi- tion 3.5 in [4] proves that any connected circulant w.u. graph is also Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the following statement holds.

Proposition 4.1 Let G be the w.u. graph presentable as G(n; π; {ct}s
). Then,

∗	π	t=1
c (G)= ∞ if and only if gs > 1.
Definition 4.2 Let G be the w.u. graph presentable as G(n; π; {ct}s	), and let

π = ({at}s
). If G is connected, let us define
r(π) = min{t : 0 ≤ t ≤ s, gπ = 1};
q(π) = min{t : 0 ≤ t < r(π), gπ = gπ	}.

t	r(π)−1
According to Proposition 4.1, we may consider SCTSP just in the connected case. In this case, Van der Veen [13] has proposed a recursive procedure for con- structing Hamiltonian cycles. UB(G, π), that is, the cost of the Hamiltonian cycle so obtained, given in input a w.u. graph G, and a presentation π for SG, is an upper bound for c∗(G).
An explicit calculus of UB(G, π) will be given in [8]. The next theorem, due to Van der Veen [13], gives its expression in some cases including the two stripe one.

Theorem 4.3 Let G be the w.u. graph presentable as G(n; π; {ct}s
). Suppose

that G is connected. If r(π)= 1, then UB(G, π)= c (G)= nc1. If gπ
is even, or

r(π)= 2, then

Proposition 4.4 Let G be the two striped connected w.u. graph presentable as
G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2). If c1 = c2, then, c∗(G)= nc1.
Proof. We observe that nc1 ≤ c∗(G) ≤ nc2, as any Hamiltonian cycle contains n
edges of cost at least c1, and at most c2. As c1 = c2, the claim follows.	 
A lower bound for SCTSP, and some sufficient conditions for reaching such bound appear independently in [13], and in [9]. We present here the lower bound (Theorem 4.5), and two of these sufficient conditions in the two stripe case (Propo- sition 4.6).

Theorem 4.5 Let G be the w.u. graph presentable as G(n; π; {ct}s
). Suppose

that G is connected. Then,
r(π)−1

c (G) ≥ LB(G, π) =

As gπ = 1, for any r(π) ≤ t ≤ s (by Deﬁnition 4.2), and Theorem 3.3 holds, it follows that LB(G, π)= SHP (G)+ cr(π). As the cost of the shortest Hamiltonian path of G, and the r(π)-th cost of G do not depend on the considered presentation, it follows that also LB(G, π) does not depend on the considered presentation. This is the reason why we will denote such lower bound simply by LB(G).
Proposition 4.6 Let G be the two striped connected w.u. graph presentable as

G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2).	Suppose that r(π) = 2.	If gπ
= 2, or there exists an in-

teger y1 such that 0 ≤ y1 ≤ gπ, and (2y1 − gπ)a1 + gπa2 ≡n 0 holds, then,
∗	1	1	1
c (G)= LB(G)= (n − g1)c1 + g1c2.
Example 4.7 Let G be the w.u. graph presentable as G(20; 8, 5; 1, 2), and let π =
(8, 5). As gπ = 4, gπ = 1, and the equation (2y1 − 4)8 + 20 ≡20 0 has solution
y1 = 2 ≤ 4 = gπ, it follows that c∗(G) = 36. A minimal Hamiltonian cycle is depicted in Figure 2: the bold black ones are (+a1)-arcs, the thin black ones are (−a1)-arcs, the red ones are edges of stripe a2. The integer y1 = 2 denotes how many times an edge of stripe a2 is followed by a (−a1)-arc.

Fig. 2. A minimal Hamiltonian cycle for G(20; 8, 1; 1, 2)

has been already solved. In particular, the not connected case is solved by Propo- sition 4.1, the case c1 = c2 is solved by Proposition 4.4, the case gcd(n, a1) = 1 is solved by Theorem 4.3, and, finally, the case gcd(n, a1) = 2 is solved by Theo- rem 4.6.
In order to end the analysis of the two stripe case, we may consider only
w.u. graphs in G. Any such w.u. graph, has just a presentation, say it π, as c1 < c2. This is the reason why we will use the notation G = G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2), instead of G is presentable as G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2). Moreover, we will omit any superscript from g1 = gcd(n, a1), and g2 = gcd(n, a1, a2), and denote UB(G, π), simply by UB(G). Finally, let us note that always r(π)= 2.
Let G = G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2) be a w.u. graph in G. For any path P in G, we denote by αP (respectively, βP ) the number of (+a2)-arcs (respectively, (−a2)-arcs) contained in P .
Note that (αP + βP ) denotes the number of edges of stripe a2 in P , as a2 /= n/2. Indeed, if n is even, a2 = n/2, and g2 = 1, then g1 ≤ 2, as g1 divides n, and g2 = gcd(g1, a2). As G in G, and, then, g1 ≥ 3, it can not happen that an arc is at the same time a (+a2)-arc, and a (−a2)-arc.
Theorem 5.1 Let G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2) be a w.u. graph in G. There exists a minimal Hamiltonian cycle C such that (αC − βC ) ∈ {0, g1}.
Proof. Let C' = [u0, u1,... , un] be a minimal Hamiltonian cycle. Let us observe that 0 = (un − u0) = Σk (uk − uk−1), and that each summand belongs to the set
{a1, a2, n − a1, n − a2}. In particular, a2 is summed αC'  times, and (n − a2) is
summed βC' times. Since g1 divides n, and a1, it follows that (αC' − βC' )a2 ≡g1 0. As g2 = gcd(g1, a2)= 1, then a2 is invertible in Zg1 , and (αC' − βC' ) ≡g1 0 holds.
On the other hand, it follows by Theorem 4.3, and Theorem 4.5 that
'
(n − g1)c1 + g1c2 ≤ c(C ) ≤ (n − 2(g1 − 1))c1 + 2(g1 − 1)c2.

As c1 < c2, the number of edges of stripe a2 in C , that is, (αC' + βC' ), verifies g1 ≤ (αC' + βC' ) ≤ 2(g1 − 1). Hence, |αC' − βC' | ≤ 2(g1 − 1). It follows from (αC' − βC' ) ≡g1 0 that (αC' − βC' ) ∈ {−g1, 0, g1}.
If (αC' − βC' ) ∈ {0, g1}, the claim follows for C = C . Otherwise, it follows for

C = −C , as αC = βC' , βC = αC' , and then (αC − βC )= g1.	 
Theorem 5.2 Let G = G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2) be a w.u. graph in G. If, for some mini- mal cycle C, (αC − βC)= 0, then, c∗(G)= (n − 2(g1 − 1))c1 + 2(g1 − 1)c2.
Proof. Let C = [u0, u1,... , un] be a minimal Hamiltonian cycle such that (αC − βC )= 0. Any of the (αC + βC)= 2αC edges of stripe a2 in C costs c2. Any other edge in C costs c1. Hence, c∗(G) = c(C) = (n − 2αC )c1 + (2αC )c2. The claim follows if we show that αC = g1 − 1.
Theorem 4.3 implies that c∗(G) ≤ (n − 2(g1 − 1))c1 + 2(g1 − 1)c2. Hence, we have that αC ≤ g1 − 1. Here we prove the converse.
Without loss of generality we may assume that (u1 − u0) ≡n ±a1. For any h = 1,... , n, let Ph be the path [u0,... , uh], let M (h) = max {αPh, βPh }, and let C(h)= |{ ⟨uk⟩g1 : 1 ≤ k ≤ h}|. Clearly, Pn = C, M (n)= αC , and C(n)= g1. The last relation holds, as C is a Hamiltonian cycle.
We claim that, for any h = 1,... , n, (C(h) − 1) ≤ M (h).
As (u1 − u0) ≡n ±a1, it follows that u0 ≡g1 u1. Hence, C(1) = 1, and M (1) = 0.
The claim thus holds for h = 1.
Assume, now, that (C(h') − 1) ≤ M (h'), for some h' < n.
If C(h' + 1) = C(h'), then (C(h' + 1) − 1) ≤ M (h' + 1) holds, since M (h) is a non decreasing function.
'	'
If C(h + 1) = C(h )+ 1, then uh'+1 ≡g1 (uh' ± a2). Suppose αP ' = βP ' . Then,
'	'	'	h	h
M (h + 1) = M (h ) + 1, and the claim holds also for (h + 1).

Suppose, now, αP '
note that
> βP '
. For any j = 1,... , h', let δ(j) = αP
βPj . Let us



uj − u0 ≡g1
Σ(uk − uk−1) ≡g1 αPj · a2 + βPj · (−a2) ≡g1 δ(j)a2,
k=1

and that |δ(j) − δ(j − 1)| ≤ 1, if j > 1.
'	'	'
Hence, there exists j < h such that uj' − u0 ≡g1 (δ(h ) − 1)a2, as δ(1) = 0, and
'	'	'
uh' − u0 ≡g1 δ(h )a2. In particular, uj' ≡g1 (uh' − a2). Since C(h + 1) = C(h )+ 1,
then uh'+1 /≡g1 uj' . Hence, uh'+1 ≡g1 (uh' + a2), and [uh' , uh'+1] is a (+a2)-arc.

So, αP

(C(h ) − 1) ≤ M (h ) hold, it follows that

C(h + 1) − 1 ≤ M (h )+ 1 = αP ' +1 = αP '	= M (h

h	h +1
The case αPh' < βPh' is similar to the latter one. The claim is thus proved. For h = n, we obtain that αC = M (n) ≥ C(n) − 1 = g1 − 1. The lemma is thus proved.	 
Theorem 5.3 Let G = G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2) be a w.u. graph in G, and let AG = {y ∈
Z : 0 ≤ y < n/g1, (2y − g1)a1 + g1a2 ≡n 0}. The following statements hold.
If AG is empty, then c∗(G)= UB(G)= (n − 2(g1 − 1))c1 + 2(g1 − 1)c2.

If AG is not empty, let y1, and y2 be, respectively, the minimum, and the maximum of AG, and let m = min{y1 − g1, n/g1 − y2}.
If m ≤ 0, then c∗(G)= LB(G)= (n − g1)c1 + g1c2. Otherwise, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle for G of cost (n − g1 − 2m)c1 + (g1 + 2m)c2.
Proof. Suppose, first, that AG is empty. We are in the case (i). If we show that no Hamiltonian cycles C for G such that (αC − βC)= g1 exist, the claim follows by Theorem 5.1, and by Theorem 5.2.
Suppose, ad absurdum, that there exists C = [u0, u1,... , un], Hamiltonian cycle for G, such that (αC − βC )= g1. Let
γC = |{k ∈ {1,... , n} : (uk − uk−1) ≡n a1}|
δC = |{k ∈ {1,... , n} : (uk − uk−1) ≡n −a1, (uk − uk−1) /≡n a1}|
Note that, also in the case a1 = n/2, any edge of stripe a1 in C is considered once. By definition of αC , and βC , we have that n = αC +βC +γC +δC. As (αC −βC)= g1, it follows that (γC − δC ) = −2(βC + δC)+ (n − g1). Let y0 = ⟨−(βC + δC )⟩n/g1 . Note that (γC − δC)a1 ≡n (2y0 − g1)a1, as g1 = gcd(n, a1), and note that


0 ≡n
Σ(uk − uk−1) ≡n (γC − δC )a1 + (αC − βC )a2.
k=1

Hence, 0 ≤ y0 < n/g1, and (2y0 − g1)a1 + g1a2 ≡n 0, that is y0 ∈ AG, contradicting the hypothesis. Case (i) is thus proved.
Suppose, now, that AG is not empty. We are in the case (ii).
If m ≤ 0, then m = (y1 − g1), as y2 ∈ AG implies (n/g1 − y2) > 0. Hence, y1 ∈ Z verifies 0 ≤ y1 ≤ g1, as m ≤ 0, and (2y1 − g1)a1 + g1a2 ≡n 0, as y1 ∈ AG. The claim on c∗(G), then, follows by Theorem 4.6.
Otherwise, m = min{y1 − g1, n/g1 − y2} is a positive integer less than n/2g1. Indeed, 2m ≤ (y1 − g1)+ (n/g1 − y2) ≤ n/g1 − g1 < n/g1. Let us denote by
'
Δλ, for any λ ∈ Zg1 , the set {v ∈ Zn : v ≡g1 λa2}, and by n the integer n/g1.
Δ0, Δ1,... , Δg1−1 forms a partition of Zn, the node set of G, and the equivalence
n'a1 ≡n 0 holds. Finally, v ∈ Z denotes the node ⟨v⟩n of G.

For any ε ∈ {+1, −1}, Pε

If m = y1 − g1, C+1 is a Hamiltonian cycle for G, as it ends in
v ≡n (2m + g1)a1 + g1a2 ≡n (2y1 − g1)a1 + g1a2 ≡n 0. If m = n/g1 − y2, C−1 is a Hamiltonian cycle for G, as it ends in v ≡n (2m + g1)a1 − g1a2 ≡n (2y2 − g1)a1 + g1a2 ≡n 0.
In both cases, it follows that there exists a Hamiltonian cycle for G of cost (n −
g1 − 2m)c1 + (g1 + 2m)c2.	 
Example 5.4 Let G1 be the w.u. graph G(32; 8, 1; 1, 2). We have that g1 = 8, n/g1 = 4, and g2 = 1. Since (2y − 8)8 + 8 ≡32 0 has no integer solutions, AG1 is empty. Hence, c∗(G1) = UB(G1) = 46. A minimal cycle of cost 46 is depicted in Figure 3.
Example 5.5 Let G2 be the w.u. graph G(243; 18, 1; 1, 2). We have that g1 = 9,
n/g1 = 27, and g2 = 1. AG2 = {25}, as y1 = 25 is the unique integer solutions in

[0, 26] of the equation (2y − 9)18 + 9 ≡
243
0. Hence, m = n/g1
— y1
= 2, and C−1

is a Hamiltonian cycle for G2 (see Figure 4).
In general, we may observe that, given G = G(n; a1, a2; c1, c2) in G, the following statements hold:
AG is empty, if n/g1 is even, and g1 or a2 are even.
AG contains just an element, if n/g1 is odd.

Finally, let us consider the w.u. graph G = G(45; 20, 9; 1, 2). It is easy to verify that g1 = 5, AG = {7}, and, so, m = 2. Theorem 5.3 assures the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle of cost 54. Such cycle is not a minimal one, as UB(G)= 53 by Theorem 4.3.
Hence, if AG is not empty, and m > 0, the Hamiltonian cycle found in Theo- rem 5.3 is not necessarily minimal. Anyway, we conjecture that it happens whenever its cost is less than UB(G).


Conclusions
Although a solution of SCTSP has not been found, we think that SCTSP is poly- nomial time solvable at least in the case in which any two stripes have different costs. Actually, if we understand how a Hamiltonian cycle, or, more generally, a Hamiltonian path for a circulant w.u. graphs with s stripes can be transferred to circulant w.u. graphs with more stripes, we could be very close to the solution of SCTSP.
To this aim we have analyzed SCTSP on the w.u. graphs with 2 stripes. Theo- rem 5.3, in particular, gives an algebraic characterization of those w.u. graphs hav- ing the cost of its minimal Hamiltonian cycle equal either to the upper bound, or to the lower bound. Moreover, it proposes a new method for constructing Hamiltonian cycles in the remaining cases. We conjecture that such cycles are also minimal, but it is not yet proved it. Finally, we are planning to run some heuristics for SCTSP in order to evaluate the soundness of this conjecture.
