Introduction

Extensive research was carried out in the field of nano today, so that most researchers in various fields of this field, such as nanoflu- ids (NFs), nanopowders, nanofibers, nanocomposites, etc., have conducted extensive studies [1–12]. Nanoscience is used in various scientific fields, one of the most important of which is in the field of fluids and heat transfer. Because since ancient times, fluids have been used in various applications such as lubrication, heat transfer, pumping, etc. they were tested in numerical, analytical and exper- imental ways [13–17], and for this reason, the use of nanotechnol- ogy can have a great impact on the performance of fluid-containing systems. Also, extensive research was done to investigate and increase the heat transfer coefficient and improve viscosity in var- ious processes and industries [18]. In 1995, to increase the thermal

conductivity of base fluids (BFs), the idea of using nanoparticles (NPs) in BFs was proposed [19]. NPs dispersed in composites or fluids maintain a much higher surface-to-volume ratio compared to particles in the range of millimeters and micrometers. Hence, mechanical and physical properties increase with increasing sur- face area [20–22]. Since nanofluids (NFs) are considered suspen- sions of NPs (smaller than 100 nm) in BFs, heat transfer occurs on the surface of suspended NPs. On the other hand, many researchers have tried to use this method to significantly increase the thermophysical properties of BFs [23]. The increase in fluid properties ultimately leads to the reduction of equipment size, reduction of industrial unit costs, and higher energy efficiency [24–27]. For this purpose, scientists have always tried to produce new NFs and identify factors affecting thermophysical properties.
lnf and knf can affect NF applications. Various experimental studies
show that adding more NPs to BFs can increase the lnf and knf [28– 29].
In addition, one of the important parameters that can increase the knf is increasing the temperature [30–34]. Various studies show that changes in temperature and SVF can also affect lnf . Any tem-
perature increase can decrease the lnf . However, the addition of
NPs can increase lnf [35–39]. In investigating the characteristics of NFs, some equations are proposed to predict the behavior of NFs. These equations are useful to make laboratory research more

practical. Table 1 lists the studies that led to new empirical equa- tions. Fig. 1.
For more than a decade, the use of artificial intelligence to model the behavior of systems have received much attention (see Fig. 2). The results show that this method has high accuracy compared to the classical method. On the other hand, in recent years, this method was increasingly used to model the behavior and thermophysical properties of NFs [44]. Esfe et al.[45] used ANN to estimate the laboratory findings of MWCNT-MgO (25:75)/SAE40 NF in different parameters (T, SVF, and SR). The ANN was used by the MLP method with LM algorithm. The optimal structure with 5 and 8 neurons in the first and second layers has been selected among different structures.The MOD for the grid
data set is in the range of less than —1% < MOD < +1%. It shows high
accuracy and a great ability to predict data.
Researchers who study NFs tried, by designing ANNs with dif- ferent algorithms, to predict the knf or lnf . In this type of modeling, the effects of different factors, such as SVF, temperature, particle size, knf , type of BF, NPs, and their density can be investigated.
Table 2 shows some investigations on the modeling of NFs.
Raising the quality of oils by enhancing their viscosity is one of the main concerns of scientists. As mentioned before, adding NPs to BFs can fulfill this need. The prediction of lnf is one of the
aspects of the studies on fluids. In general, the rheological behavior of fluids can be distributed into two categories: Newtonian and non-Newtonian. A fluid is Newtonian if there is a linear relation between SR and shear stress, but if there is not a linear relation between SR and shear stress, the fluid has a non-Newtonian behav- ior [50–55]. In a study on ethylene glycol/ZrO2 NF, Goharshadi et al. [56] showed that this NF atSVF = 0.01 %, 0.02 % and 0.04 %
shows Newtonian behavior at T = 25 to 45 °C. However, in SR = 70–120 s—1, the this NF shows a non-Newtonian behavior. Esfe et al. [57] measured the knf of MWCNT-MgO/water-EG NF in seven
SVFs from 0.015 to 0.96 % and in T = 30 to 50 °C. The cost- effectiveness evaluation of the knf data shows that the hybrid NFs are better than the mono NFs. In the study on Ag/oil NF, Aberoumand et al. [58] examined the lnf of Ag/oil NF. The lnf
atSVF = 0.12 % to 0.72 % and T = 25–60 °C was measured. The
results show that with any increase in SVF, the NF’s behavior shifts from Newtonian to non–Newtonian. In addition, NFs had non- Newtonian and Newtonian behaviors at T < 35 °C, respectively. Several investigations show that utilize of CNTs, even in small quantities, can also have a important influence on thermophysical propertiess of NFs. Hemmat Esfe research team [59–60] has done a lot of research in the field of hybrid NFs and is one of the pioneer
groups in this field. Comparison of the lnf of MWCNT-TiO2/10W40

NF at different percentages (10–90 % and 45–55 %), T = 15–55 °C and SVF = 0.25–1 % was done. The SR parameter is considered to evaluate the lnf . In all types of NFs, the lnf decreases by about 80 % with increasing temperature. Also, experimental results show that increasing the percentage of CNTs has a significant effect on the non-Newtonian behavior of NFs, and this increase in the per-
centage of CNTs increases the shear-thinning behavior of NFs.
In the present study, an optimized ANN was used to accurately estimate the lnf of MWCNT-CuO (10 % – 90 %)/10W40 NF under different conditions (temperature, SVF and SR). The selected struc-
ture is selected after measuring and evaluating the number of neu- rons and the activation function in each layer. According to the authors, no research was done on modeling the lnf of MWCNT- CuO (10 % – 90 %)/10W40 NF. Also, to increase the accuracy of data
estimation, different structures are studied in the design of ANN and the most optimal structure is selected.

About ANN

ANN is one of the important branches of artificial intelligence that has the ability to learn the relationship between several sets of data and can store each of these data for similar cases. [61–62]. The data proposed by ANN has high accuracy and performance. ANN modeling has wide applications in various sciences, a limited

number of which can be mentioned, including medical sciences, astronomy, and pharmaceuticals. [63–64]. Recently, ANN is used to estimate complex problems. These networks are trained to pre- dict the rheological properties of nanomaterials. Some researchers used ANNs to predict the behavior of nanofluids. In recent years,
researchers used this efficient tool in their studies due to ANN’s ability to estimate the lnf [65–66]. Summary of past studies shows that there is still no accurate theory for determining the lnf , and the existing classical models for NFs are used, which are not very accurate. MLP is one of the most important neural network models. [67–68]. The activation position of a neuron in the ANN is deter- mined by the activation function. [70,71].

Laboratory data and ANN training

In the current work, the lnf of a hybrid nano-lubricant was computed with modeling experimental data by ANNs, for which the MLP-ANN algorithm was utilized. For this purpose, the labora- tory data of lnf includes 174 data for the ANN modeling procedure.
ANN inputs are divided into three kinds including temperature, SR and SVF, and the ANN output is the lnf . Sigmoid activation function is used for each layer of this modeling. Each function is tan-sigmoid
and log-sigmoid. The selected structure is then selected from the above set of network structure, which has 4 and 8 morons in each
layer. In each part of this modeling, the number of each neuron and the activation function for the hidden layers were set to define the optimal ANN structures. The input data for ANN is divided into
three collections of training, validation, and testing. Of the 174 experimental lnf data, 70 % of the data was evaluated in the train- ing stage, 15 % was used for the validation stage, and 15 % of the data was used to assess performance. The foremost sample from the 400 investigated samples to forecast the lnf is plotted in Fig. 3. To analyze and check the performance of the ANNs, the regres- sion coefficients for different stages are reported in Table 1.
According to Table 1, the highest value of R belongs to the fourth structure, which has 4 and 8 neurons in each hidden layer and is equal to 0.9999744. In Table, 4 optimal structures were presented among different network structures.


Results and discussion

After defining the optimal structure among different network structures based on the number of neurons and hidden layers in the ANN, it is necessary to analyze and check the performance of the proposed data. Regression (R) coefficients for different steps are drawn in 4 separate sections. Regression coefficients close to 1 indicate high accuracy of this model. As you can see in Fig. 4, R for the data set is more than 0.999. In this section, the results

of R are more important than other coefficients, which is equal to 0.9999744 and belongs to fourth structure.
In this part of the research, the different stages of the ANN based on accuracy and proper performance were evaluated to introduce the best ANN model selected from the MSE criterion. The MSE is according to Eq. 1, which is between experimental data and predicted data. As shown in Fig. 5, the MSE in the training phase is lower than other phases. Based on Eq. 1, the MSE value is 0.433182095.

In Fig. 6, the results of the laboratory data are evaluated with the proposed ANN data for different stages. As shown in Fig. 6, there is a good match between the proposed data and the experi- mental data. This shows the high accuracy of ANN data compared to other data.
Fig. 7 compares the ANN results at different stages, with exper- imental data collection at different SVFs using the ANN technique. According to Fig. 7, a good homogeneity can be seen between all the data proposed by ANN with the experimental data, which indi- cates the proper performance and correctness of the proposed data of the ANN model with practical data.

such as T =25oC, there is no good agreement between the data,

Fig. 9 predicts lnf -related errors and compares the data of dif-
ferent stages for collected data in 4 separate parts. Based on Fig. 9, the maximum error is between ± 20, which shows the high precision of the predicted viscosities from the ANN model. As shown in Fig. 9, the highest error at T = 5 0C was seen in all data,
training, and testing stages in the range greater than —20. The least
error in the validation stage is less than ± 20.
The error histogram of the proposed ANN data for different stages is shown in Fig. 10. If the data error is closer to the origin or zero, this indicates the high accuracy of this modeling. Accord- ing to Fig. 10, most of the data are in the range of less than ±10. Also, the training stage has the lowest error and the highest type of frequency and is equal to -1.513978547.

Conclusion

Due to the high benefits of NFs in changing the proper function- ing of heat transfer such as reactors or vehicles, in this study, the research was done to estimate the lnf of MWCNT-CuO (10:90)/10W40 nano-lubricant using ANN. Also, a set of from the
experimental data set in terms of T (T = 55–55 0C), and SVF = 0.05 %-1% was used for lnf modeling by ANN. Based on the studies, the following can be mentioned:

The design of this ANN was done with the MLP method and LM algorithm.
To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model by ANN, MSE, regression coefficient and also MOD were used.
The optimal model with 4 and 8 neurons in each hidden layer was presented among 400 different ANN structures.
The results of the data error check show that the proposed data have an error of less than -20 < error < +20.
lnf The data comparison results (laboratory, computational and proposed model) show that the data of the proposed model is
better and more accurate than the computational data.
Laboratory investigations are very time-consuming and require a lot of laboratory equipment, so it is suggested to use ANN
model for prediction of lnf .
