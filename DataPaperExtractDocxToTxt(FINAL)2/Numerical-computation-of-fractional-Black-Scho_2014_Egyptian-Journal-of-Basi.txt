The aim of present paper is topresent a numerical algorithm for time-fractional BlackeScholes equation with boundary condition for a European option problem by using homotopy pertur- bation method and homotopy analysis method. The fractional derivative is described in the Caputo sense. The methods give an analytic solution in the form of a convergent series with easily computable components, requiring no linearization or small perturbation. The methods show improvements over existing analytical techniques. Two examples are given and show that the homotopy perturbation method and homotopy analysis method are very effective and convenient overcomes the difficulty of traditional methods. The numerical results show that the approaches are easy to implement and accurate when applied to time-fractional BlackeScholes equation.

Introduction

In 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes [1] derived the famous theoretical valuation formula for options. The main conceptual idea of Black and Scholes lie in the construction of a riskless portfolio taking positions in bonds (cash), option and the underlying stock. Such an approach strengthens the use of
the no-arbitrage principle as well. Thus, the BlackeScholes formula is used as a model for valuing European (the option can be exercised only on a specified future date) or American (the option can be exercised at any time up to the date, the option expires) call and put options on a non-dividend paying stock [2]. Derivation of a closed form solution to the Black- eScholes equation depends on the fundamental solution of the heat equation. Hence, it is important, at this point, to

transform the BlackeScholes equation to the heat equation by change of variables. Having found the closed form solution to the heat equation, it is possible to transform it back to find the corresponding solution of the BlackeScholes PDE. Financial models were generally formulated in terms of stochastic dif- ferential equations. However, it was soon found that under certain restrictions these models could written as linear evolutionary PDEs with variable coefficients [3]. Thus, the BlackeScholes model for the value of an option is described by the equation

Basic definitions of fractional calculus

In this section, we mention the following basic definitions of fractional calculus which are used further in the present paper.

Definition 1. The Riemann-Liouville fractional integral oper-
ator of order a > 0, of a function f (t)2C ; m ≥ —1 is defined as

vv + s x v v + r t x vv — r t v = 0;  x; t 2R+ × 0; T	(1)	m

where v(x,t) is the European call option price at asset price x and at time t, K is the exercise price, T is the maturity, r(t) is the risk free interest rate, and s(x,t) represents the volatility

function of underlying asset. Let us denote by vc(x,t) and vp(x,t)
the value of the European call and put options, respectively.
Then, the payoff functions are
vc x; t = max x — E; 0 ; vp x; t = max E — x; 0 ;	(2) where E denotes the expiration price for the option and the
function max(x,0) gives the larger value between x and 0. During the past few decades, many researchers studied the existence of solutions of the Black-Scholes model using many methods in [4e12]. Many important phenomena are well
described by fractional differential equations in electromag-

For the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral we have:

(HAM), which was introduced and developed by Liao [27e31].

Basic idea of homotopy perturbation method (HPM)

To illustrate the basic idea of the HPM for fractional differ- ential equations, we consider the following problem
Da u x; t = v x; t — Lu x; t — Nu x; t ;  m — 1 < a ≤ m;

This method is applied to solve many nonlinear problems [32e35] and the references therein to handle a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications: linear and nonlinear

derivative of u,ci, i = 0,1,2,…,m—1 are the specified initial function of time, i.e., vanishing for t < 0. Also u(i)(x,t) is the ith conditions and B is a boundary operator.
We construct the following homotopy
 1 — p Da u x; t + p Da u x; t + Lu x; t + Nu x; t — v x; t  = 0;


where NF is a nonlinear fractional operator, x and t denote the independent variables and u is an unknown function. For simplicity, we ignore all boundary or initial conditions, which can be treated in the similar way. By means of the HAM, we first construct the so-called zeroth-order deformation equa-
tion as

p2 0; 1 

(13)
(1 — q)LF[f(x; t; q)— u0(x; t)] = ZqH(x; t)NF[u(x; t)];	(22)

which is equivalent to

Da u x; t + p(Lu(x; t)+ Nu(x; t)— v(x; t)) = 0;  p2 0; 1	(14) unity.  In  case  p  =  0,  Eq.  (14)  becomes The homotopy parameter p always changes from zero to
a
*t

when p = 1, Eq. (14) turns out to be the original fractional differential equation. The homotopy parameter p is used to
expand the solution in the following form
u x; t = u0 x; t + pu1 x; t + p2u2 x; t + p3u3 x; t + … .   (16)
where q2[0; 1] is the embedding parameter, Z s 0 is an
auxiliary parameter, LF is an auxiliary linear operator, 4(x,t ;q)
is an unknown function,u0(x,t) is an initial guess of u(x,t) and
the embedding parameter q = 0 and q = 1, it holds H(x,t) denotes a nonzero auxiliary function. Obviously, when
f(x; t; 0)= u0(x; t);  f(x; t; 1)= u(x; t);	(23)
respectively. Thus as q increases from 0 to 1, the solution
4(x,t ;q) varies from the initial guess u0(x,t) to the solution u(x,t). Expanding 4(x,t ;q) in Taylor series with respect to q, we have
X

For nonlinear problems, we set Nu(x,t) = S(x,t). Substituting Eq. (16) into Eq. (14) and equating the terms with identical
power of p, we obtain a sequence of equations of the form
f(x; t; q) = u0(x; t) +	um(x; t)qm;	(24)

with boundary condition for a European option problem, we have applied the methods for two different examples.

Example 1. We consider the fractional BlackeScholes equa-

This is the exact solution of the given problem of (31).

To solve the Eq. (31) by HAM, we choose the auxiliary op- erators as follows

with initial condition v(x,0) = max (ex—1, 0). Notice that this eters k = 2 r/s2, where k represents the balance between the system of equations contains just two dimensionless param- rate of interests and the variability of stock returns and the
dimensionless time to expiry ½s2T, even though there are four dimensional parameters, E, T, s2 and r, in the original state- ments of the problem.
According to the HPM [18e22], we construct the following homotopy

with the property LF[c1] = 0.
Using the above definition, we first construct the zeroth-
order deformation equations as

(1 — q)LF[f(x; t; q)— cmv0(x; t)] = ZqNF[f(x; t; q)].	(37) Obviously, when the embedding parameter q = 0 and q = 1,
it holds
f(x; t; 0)= v0(x; t);  f(x; t; 1)= v(x; t).	(38) Differentiating the zeroth-order deformation Eq. (37) m-

expressed as power series in p as given below
v = v0 + pv1 + p2v2 + p3v2 + …	(33)
finally setting q = 0, we get the following mth-order defor- mation equations
LF[vm(x; t)— cmvm—1(x; t)] = Z঩m(→u m—1);	(39) where

Substituting (33) into (32) and equating the coefficients of

Taking Z = —1, we get the same solution as obtained by
HPM.


Concluding remarks

In this study, the HPM and HAM are implemented to solve the time-fractional BlackeScholes equation with boundary con- dition for a European option problem. They provide the solu- tions in terms of convergent series with easily computable components in a direct way without using linearization, perturbation or restrictive assumptions. The solution ob- tained with the help of HAM is more general as compared to HPM solution. We can easily recover all results HPM by
assuming Z = —1. The results show that the HPM and HAM are
powerful and efficient techniques in finding exact and
approximate solutions for fractional differential equations. In conclusion, the HPM and HAM may be considered as a nice refinement in existing numerical techniques and might find the wide applications.
