To ensure data security in the cloud, there exist several techniques proposed by various researchers. The most common method is the usage of data encryption techniques like profile, rule, and attribute-based encryption techniques. However, they struggle in achieving higher data security performance due to insuﬃcient resistance to tampering. Also, the existing techniques are not good enough for achieving a higher quality of service perfor- mance. To handle this issue, an eﬃcient time-oriented latency approximation-based data encryption technique (TLADE) has been presented in this article. The method focuses on the selection of optimal encryption techniques at different time stamps according to the latency approximation. Accordingly, the method would select an opti- mal technique for data encryption based on the QoS values. To perform this, different encryption schemes have been implemented and each of them is measured for their QoS support values (QoSV) based on latency. Based on the values of QoSV, an eﬃcient approach for the current duty cycle has been selected and applied to the cloud service data. The proposed approach improves the performance of different QoS factors and also has reduced the latency factor.





Introduction

The cloud environment provides different services at various levels to support the organizational process. The cost-effectiveness of cloud services has helped organizations in maintaining their data at the least cost. Unlike traditional data management, organizations do not need to maintain their data servers which claim higher costs from the organiza- tions which cannot be offered by all the units [1]. To support such or- ganizations in maintaining their data at the least cost, the cloud service providers provide several services at various levels like presentation, network, and data layers. This has encouraged organizations to main- tain their data at the least cost while allowing users to access his/her data through different services.
Like any other network and environment, the cloud faces several threats at various levels. The security threats could be directed toward data as well as services. Various types of cyber-attacks, such as Dis- tributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and brute force attacks, specif- ically aim at disrupting the functioning of services. However, all the threats target the service functionality and are targeted to degrade the service performance. If the service is targeted by a DDoS attack, then the malicious user would generate several service requests to the service provider which generates traﬃc at the service point. Also, the malicious user would keep the service handled without any data transfer or would place malformed data on the service. Both approaches would degrade

the service throughput and affect the performance of the entire environ- ment [2]. To handle this issue, there exist numerous approaches which monitor the service request and allow the service access based on the profile, trust, and so on. The trust-based approaches are becoming popu- lar in this case, which maintains the traces of service access belonging to different users. According to the traces available, the method measures the trust of the users. The value of trust can be measured using service access behaviors, service protocol being followed, frequency of service access, completeness of service access, and so on. Still, the performance of access restriction schemes is not addressable. So, by enforcing a rigid security algorithm at the service level, the security performance of the model can be improved [3].
In terms of data security, it has been a huge threat to the cloud sys- tems as the malicious user can post malicious data to the service which in turn would end up in failure and affect the performance [4–5]. Similarly, if the adversary is capable of fetching the service packets in the network, they can modify, or steal the data from the service packets. Both of these activities in turn would adversely affect the service performance. To ad- dress this issue there exist different data encryption schemes that use various encryption standards. All these approaches lack higher perfor- mance metrics in data security [6].
In this way, the service packets are transmitted through several routes and pass-through various routers, hubs, and so on. If there ex- ists a malicious node, then it would involve different routing attacks to

maximize the delay, minimize the throughput, and so on. However, the performance of the entire system depends on various factors like the selection of a routing scheme, the selection of an encryption scheme, and so on. Choosing an eﬃcient data encryption scheme and routing scheme would support the performance achievement of various QoS pa- rameters. This work is focused on improving the QoS of the environ- ment by choosing an eﬃcient latency-centric data encryption scheme. Any data encryption scheme takes a specific amount of time. Therefore, by choosing the least latency data encryption scheme, the performance of the entire system can be improved.
QoS of any environment is greatly dependent on how well the se- curity performance is and how effective trust verification has been en- forced [6]. By considering all this, an eﬃcient TLADE is presented in this paper. The method is focused on the selection of eﬃcient data encryp- tions scheme and route selection in such a way as to reduce the latency. The method performs latency approximation on the working of the data encryption scheme and routing. For each of them, QoSV is measured to perform an eﬃcient selection of routes as well as security schemes. Both methods are focused on improving the QoS of the complete envi- ronment. The detailed approach has been discussed in this section.
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
To enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) in the environment by se- lecting a data encryption scheme that prioritizes low latency.
Choosing the most suitable encryption techniques at various time intervals based on an estimated latency.
An effective method has been chosen and implemented to handle the cloud service data based on the QoSV values for the current opera- tional cycle.
To enhance the performance of various QoS aspects while simulta- neously reducing latency.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the relevant previous research. Section 3 introduces the Time Oriented Latency Approximation Based Data Encryption Tech- nique. Section 4 presents the results and accompanying discussion. Sec- tion 5 elaborates on the findings, followed by the paper’s conclusion.

The literature review which has been carried out in tabulated form (as shown in Table 1) provides a meta-analysis of available work and has established a ground for the proposed work.
A Markov decision-based SLA violation detection scheme has been presented in [7], which uses the requirements of various users in regulating the actions. In [8], an encryption scheme based on Non- Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and homomorphic encryption is introduced. This scheme incorporates a channel coding mechanism to address the presence of malicious nodes. In [9], a public key encryp- tion scheme called Probabilistic Public Key Encryption (EPPKE) is intro- duced. This scheme leverages Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategies (CMA-ES) to enhance data security. Furthermore, reference

A time and attribute-based dual access control have been presented in [14], which performs attribute-based encryption with hier- archical identity-based encryption schemes. An encrypted data-sharing scheme has been presented in [15], which enables dynamic data sharing
without the use of public keys and applies proxy re-encryption technol- ogy to maximize data security. In [16], a combined approach has been presented toward privacy preservation, which uses the Lanczos algo- rithm and the Nyström algorithm with additive homomorphic encryp- tion. A user-side encrypted file system is presented in [17], which per- forms transparent encryption with structure-based information. A multi- Authority vector policy (MAVP) is presented in [18], which uses various access policies in the form of a matrix and uses a multi-authority vector policy function encryption scheme (MAVP-FE). In [19], an encryption transformation called Identity-Based Encryption Transformation (IBET) is introduced. This transformation combines Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) schemes with the goal of enhancing data security.
In [20], a public key searchable encryption scheme with forward security is introduced. This scheme utilizes a public key to enhance se- curity. In order to safeguard medical data, reference [21] presents a Se- cure and Eﬃcient Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SEDSSE) scheme. This scheme aims to establish a dynamic searchable symmet- ric encryption system for the purpose of preserving privacy. A dis- crete wavelet transform-based selective encryption scheme has been presented in [22], which divides the data into three fragments and each has been enforced with different protection levels. In [23], a rekeying-aware encrypted deduplication scheme (RAEDS) has been pre- sented, which handles various attacks by applying a convergent all-or- nothing transform (CAONT) on the data provided which challenges the adversaries. Reference [24] introduces a revocable storage ciphertext- policy attribute-based encryption scheme known as RS-CPABE-ASP. This scheme employs an arithmetic span program (ASP) access structure to address the challenges associated with policy maintenance costs. By leveraging the structure, access restrictions are enforced. On the other hand, in reference [25], a privacy-preserving aggregation scheme is pre- sented. This scheme utilizes the Simulated Annealing Module Partition (SAMP) algorithm to divide the data into multiple blocks and applies the Differential Aggregation Encryption (DAE) scheme for encryption.
The state of the art in KMS security has primarily focused on tradi-
tional security mechanisms, leaving a gap for integrated technological solutions to handle complex cybersecurity issues. In this context, our research addresses a pressing need and contributes to the state of the art in KMS security by proposing a novel approach. By leveraging ad- vanced cryptographic techniques, machine learning, deep learning, and IoT technologies, our framework enhances KMS security [47–49], filling this critical gap in the literature. This unique amalgamation of technolo- gies promises a robust defense against evolving cyber threats, thereby paving the way for a more secure digital world.
The methods discussed in the literature have been analyzed and have been found to have poor performance. This is the motivation behind this work of designing an optimal eﬃcient approach towards achieving higher QoS performance as compared to other approaches.


Time-oriented latency approximation-based data encryption: a proposed methodology

The proposed time-oriented latency approximation-based data en- cryption scheme has been remarked for and destination initially where the data is available. The method first determines the set of available routes to reach the desired source location or the location where the data needs to be delivered. The method performs route discovery which col- lects traﬃc data in different hops and routers present between the source and the service point. Such data has been maintained in the server and using the information, the method finds the routes available to perform latency approximation. Similarly, according to the service requested, the method finds the set of data encryption schemes available and their time complexity in encrypting the data. Using both of them, the method per- forms latency approximation to select an optimal route and an optimal encryption scheme to perform data transmission.

The architecture of the proposed TLADE approach has been pre- sented in Fig. 1. It involves several operations and each has been pre- sented in detail in this section.

Preprocessing

The preprocessing process involves two different operations in this approach (as shown by Algorithm 1). First, the access trace set has been processed to eliminate the noise. It has been performed by finding a set of features of the trace and verifying each trace for the presence of all the features with values. If any of the traces have been found incomplete, then it has been removed from the data set. Second, the method finds the service requested and the user’s location. Using these two values, a set of routes available to deliver the result has been identified. The
routes available are identified and given to the next stage to perform approximation.
The preprocessing algorithm finds the features and performs noise removal from the access trace data set. Additionally, the method iden- tifies and adds the list of routes to reach the source and destination to the set. The features extracted and preprocessed traces have been used to perform latency approximation.

Traffic-Throughput-Latency QoSV estimation

The quality of service of the cloud system depends on traﬃc and throughput factors. When the traﬃc is higher it introduces higher la- tency and affects the throughput performance. So, by choosing a route with the least traﬃc, the throughput performance can be improved

which in turn would improve the QoS performance. The value of Traﬃc QoSV (TQoSV) is measured according to the traﬃc present on the route in different time stamps and current time stamps. Similarly, the value of throughput QoSV is measured according to the throughput present in a specific route in the various time stamp. Similarly, the latency QoSV is measured based on the average latency in various time stamps and cur- rents. The values estimated have been used in latency approximation.
The equations (i) to (vi) are presented in Algorithm 2 which cal- culates the average throughput, average latency, TQoSV, ThQoSV, and LQoSV respectively. The traﬃc-throughput-latency QoS estimation al- gorithm computes the QoS support value produced by different routes in terms of latency, throughput, and traﬃc. Such computed parameters
are converted into feature sets and are used to perform latency Approx- imation.

Time-oriented latency (TLE) approximation

The time-oriented latency approximation technique estimates differ- ent QoS support values for given routes (As shown by Algorithm 3). Different routes would have different traﬃc, latency, and throughput according to different conditions. However, if the route is free of adver- saries and traﬃc, then it would produce higher throughput and latency will be less. So, this approach estimates QoS support values on differ- ent parameters like traﬃc, throughput, and latency. To perform this, the method preprocesses the access traces and then traces from which noise has been removed have been used in estimating different QoS support values throughput Traﬃc-Throughput-Latency QoSV estimation scheme. The method returns values of TqosV, ThQoSv, and LQoSV sets which contains values of QoS support belonging to different factors at the different time stamp. The method calculates QoSV values for various routes using the provided values. By evaluating the QoSV value [21], the method selects a specific route for data transmission. Equation (vii) is employed to compute the QoSV, and equation (viii) is used to calculate the route R. The time complexity of the proposed method is determined by the encryption time, denoted as O(n).
The time-oriented latency approximation algorithm measures differ- ent QoS support values on latency, traﬃc, and throughput on different routes with various time stamps. The method calculates a distinctive Quality of Service Value (QoSV) and chooses the route with the highest QoSV value. This selected route is utilized for secure data transmission [23]. The general outline of Algorithm 3 is provided in Table 4.

TLADE data encryption

Cloud computing has gained immense popularity as a storage and data access solution, facilitated by the Internet and remote servers. In- stead of owning physical resources, clients lease them from third-party providers. User management and key management are crucial aspects in cloud computing, encompassing tasks such as user setup, key gener- ation, expiration, and destruction. The security of data is a significant

concern for businesses due to the sensitive information transmitted over the Internet [38–43]. The term "key management" encompasses the cre- ation, distribution, processing, usage, destruction, and replacement of cryptographic keys during the process of crypto shredding. It includes cryptographic protocols, key servers, client procedures, and other rel- evant protocols. Keys can be shared at the user or system level, and this concept differs from key preparation, which pertains to managing keys within the internal functioning of a cipher. The effectiveness of a cryptosystem’s security relies on its ability to manage keys eﬃciently. Cryptography involves not only computational aspects but also social technology features such as system processes, user training, organiza- tional interactions, and departmental collaborations.
The TLADE scheme maintains a set of encryption schemes to enforce data security. The method first identifies the set of schemes available and measures their average latency from the trace. According to the trace available, the method computes latency support according to the data size and calculated latency. Using these values, the method finds the most effective scheme for data encryption and hands over the data to be transmitted through the selected route. The latency support LS has been presented in Algorithm 4 and calculated by equation (ix).
The TLADE data encryption algorithm evaluates the latency support of various schemes and selects a route with the highest latency sup- port. Subsequently, the data is encrypted and transmitted through the selected route.


Results and discussion

The time-variant latency approximation-based data encryption scheme, as proposed, has been implemented and thoroughly evaluated across various scenarios to assess its performance. The evaluation results are compared against the outcomes of alternative approaches.
The details of the evaluation considered for performance analysis of the proposed approach have been presented in Table 2. The proposed technique has been compared with techniques present in literature on the basis of encryption/decryption time with respect to varying data size. This has been presented in Table 3.
The encryption/decryption time introduced by various methods is measured and presented in Fig. 2. The proposed TLADE technique takes less time due to its eﬃcient methodology that optimizes encryption and

decryption functions, reducing computational overhead and enhancing overall performance.
The average latency can be computed using Appendix B, as presented in Table 4, which provides a general representation of the algorithm.
The Table 5 represents the results for each timestamp (Ti) analyzed in the algorithm. For each timestamp, the average traﬃc, throughput, and latency values are computed based on the corresponding traces. The QoS values for traﬃc, throughput, and latency are have also been cal- culated using Appendix B. Table 5 shows the traﬃc-throughput-latency QoSV estimation.
To calculate the average latency (Alt) (see equation x) for each times- tamp in the table, you need the sum of latencies and the number of traces available for each timestamp. Assuming you have the following data:
For T1:
∑ 𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑓𝑜𝑟 T1: 50 Number of traces for T1: 5

For T2:

For T4:
∑ 𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑓𝑜𝑟 T4: 36 Number of traces for T3: 2
The formula to calculate the average latency (Alt) for a specific timestamp (Ti) is:
Alt(Ti)= ∑ 𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑓𝑜𝑟 Ti∕Numberof tracesforTi(x)
Now, let’s calculate the values for the table:
For T1: Alt(T1) = 50 / 5 = 10
For T2: Alt(T2) = 60 / 4 = 15
For T3: Alt(T3) = 48 / 4 = 12
For T4: Alt(T4) = 36 / 2 = 18
An evaluation of the latency ratio can be derived from Appendix D. To determine the Analysis of the Latency Ratio, we require the Latency Average (Alt) values obtained from the previous table (Table 5) and

random Latency Support (LS) values. With these inputs, we can calculate the Latency Ratio and present the results in a new table (Table 6).
Now, we can calculate the Analysis of Latency Ratio using the equa- tion (xi):

LR for T1, T2, T3, and T4 can be calculated using equation (xi) LRT1 = 10 / 8 = 1.25

LRT4 = 18 / 15 = 1.20
Based on the provided Table 5, the calculations for Traﬃc QoS Value (TQoSV) and Throughput QoS Value (ThQoSV) are as follows:
For Traﬃc QoS Value (TQoSV):

Conclusion

A novel approach to TLADE has been presented in the papers. The method identifies the routes and services. For the routes identified, the support of the route on latency, throughput, and traﬃc toward QoS max- imization is measured. Based on the QoS support values, the method selects an optimal route for data transmission. Also, towards data en- cryption, the method estimates latency support according to the bytes encrypted and the time taken. Using the value of latency support an op-

The proposed approach improves the performance of different QoS factors with reduced latency. As an extension of this work, multi-key homomorphic encryption tech- niques can be implemented to further increase secrecy and address cloud security challenges.
