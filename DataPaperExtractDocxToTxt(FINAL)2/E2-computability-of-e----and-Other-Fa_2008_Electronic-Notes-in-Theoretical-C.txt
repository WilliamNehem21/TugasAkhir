Abstract
We show that e, π and other remarkable real numbers are limits of E 2-computable sequences of rational numbers having a polynomial rate of convergence (as usual, E 2 denotes the second Grzegorczyk class).
However, only the rational numbers are limits of E 2-computable sequences of rational numbers with an exponential rate of convergence
Keywords: computable real number, second Grzegorczyk class, e, π, Liouville’s number, Euler’s constant.


Introduction
The notion of computable real number is often introduced in the following way: a real number α is called computable if there exists a computable sequence r0, r1, r2,... of rational numbers such that |rn − α| ≤ 2−n for any natural num- ber n (cf. for example [2,6]). Of course, some acceptable definition of computability for sequences of rational numbers is presupposed, say, the sequence r0, r1, r2,... is called computable if there are one-argument recursive functions f , g and h such that



for all natural numbers n. 2
rn =
f (n) − g(n)


h(n)+1 
(1)

One could introduce subrecursive versions of computability of real numbers by replacing the class of recursive functions with some appropriate subclass of it, for

2 Of course such computability of a sequence of rational numbers is stronger than its computability as a sequence of computable real numbers. For instance, let ϕ be a two-argument recursive function such that
the set {n ∈ N|∃m(ϕ(n, m)= 0)} is non-recursive, and let rn be 2−k with k = μm(ϕ(n, m) = 0) for any n in the set in question, and rn be 0 for all other n in N. Then the sequence of the rational numbers r0, r1, r2,... is computable as a sequence of computable real numbers, but it is not computable in the above sense.

instance with some of the classes Sm introduced in [1]. The replacements with classes Sm, where m ≥ 3, turn out to be reasonable, since one gets sufficiently large subsets of the set of the computable real numbers. However, the result of a replacement with S 2 is quite different, as the following proposition shows.
Proposition 1.1 Let α be a real number, and let there exist one-argument functions f, g and h such that h belongs to the class S 2 and for any n in N the rational number rn deﬁned by means of (1) satisﬁes |rn — α|≤ 2−n. Then α is a rational number.
Proof. Since
1
|rn — rn+1|≥ (h(n) + 1)(h(n + 1)+ 1) ,
whenever rn /= rn+1, and any function from S 2 is dominated by some polynomial, there exists a polynomial p(n) such that
p(n)|rn — rn+1|≥ 1,
whenever rn /= rn+1. Since
|rn — rn+1|≤ |rn — α| + |rn+1 — α|≤ 3 · 2−n−1, this polynomial will satisfy the inequality
3p(n) ≥ 2n+1
for all n such that rn /= rn+1, and therefore only finitely many such n can exist. 
Remark 1.2 A weaker result in this direction can be obtained by using Liouville’s approximation theorem. Its application proves the above proposition under the additional assumption that α is an algebraic number (the possibility of such an application of Liouville’s theorem is implicitly indicated in footnote 2 of [3]).
To get a reasonable definition of the notion of S 2-computable real number, we note that 2−n can be replaced with (n + 1)−1 in the definition of computability of a real number, since the definition obtained in this way will be equivalent to the other one. The same holds also for Sm-computability of real numbers in the case of m ≥ 3. We suggest to adopt such a definition also for S 2-computability, namely: a sequence of rational numbers r0, r1, r2,... is called S 2-computable if there exist one-argument functions f , g and h belonging to S 2 such that for any n in N the equality (1) holds, and a real number α is called S 2-computable if there exists an S 2- computable sequence of rational numbers r0, r1, r2,... such that |rn — α|≤ (n +1)−1 for all n in N.
Remark 1.3 It is easy to prove the S 2-computability of any real number α such that p(n)(rn — α) is bounded for some non-constant polynomial p(n) and some sequence r0, r1, r2,... defined by means of (1) with functions f , g and h belonging to S 2.

As shown in [5], the set of all S 2-computable real numbers is a field containing the real roots of any non-constant polynomial with coefficients from this field. Since this implies the S 2-computability of all real algebraic numbers, it is natural to ask whether there exist S 2-computable transcendental numbers. A positive answer to this question is given in the present paper, in particular the numbers e and π will be shown to be S 2-computable.
S 2-computability of the number e
For any natural number k, let
1	1	1



Since
sk = 1 + 1! + 2! + ... + k! .	(2)

1
sk < e < sk +


k!k
for all positive integers k, to assure the inequality |sk — e| < (n + 1)−1 for a given
n in N, it is sufficient to choose k in such a way that k!k ≥ n + 1. A simple choice would be k = n + 1, but unfortunately the sequence r0, r1, r2,.. ., where rn = sn+1, is not S 2-computable 3 . Therefore we shall proceed in a more sophisticated though natural way, namely we shall use the numbers rn = skn , where kn is the least k
satisfying k!k ≥ n + 1. These rational numbers also form a sequence r0, r1, r2,... 
such that |rn — e| < (n + 1)−1 for all n in N. We shall prove its S 2-computability.
Let us consider the two-argument function f0 and the one-argument function f1
in N that are defined by the equalities
f0(k, n) = min(k!,n + 1),  f1(n) = max{k ∈ N | k!k ≤ n}.
These functions belong to S 2 thanks to the equalities
f0(0, n) = 1,  f0(k + 1, n) = min(f0(k, n)(k + 1),n + 1), f1(n) = max{k ∈ N | k ≤ n, f0(k, n)k ≤ n}
(the second one of them follows from the equality (k + 1)! = k!(k + 1) , and for checking the third one it is appropriate to observe that any of the inequalities k!k ≤ n and f0(k, n)k ≤ n implies the equality k! = f0(k, n), thus these two inequalities are equivalent). Clearly kn = f1(n)+ 1.
Let f2 be the two-argument function in N defined by the equality
f2(k, n) = min(k!sk,n + 1).
This function also belongs to S 2, since we have the equalities
f2(0, n) = 1,  f2(k + 1, n) = min(f2(k, n)(k + 1)+ 1,n + 1)

3 This statement follows from Proposition 1.1 by the inequality |sn+1 − e| < 2−n and the irrationality of the number e (cf. also the Some comments and acknowledgments, where a direct proof of the statement is given).

(the second one of them follows from the equality (k + 1)!sk+1 = k!sk(k + 1) + 1). Now, by the equality kn = f1(n)+ 1, we have



rn =
kn!skn kn!
= f1(n)!sf1(n)(f1(n)+ 1)+1 
f1(n)!(f1(n)+ 1)

Since f1(n) is one of the numbers k with k!k ≤ n, the inequality f1(n)! ≤ n + 1 holds (even in the case of n = 0). Thus f1(n)! = f0(f1(n), n) and
f1(n)!sf1(n) ≤ (n + 1)sf1(n) < (n + 1)e < 3(n + 1),
hence f1(n)!sf1(n) ≤ 3n + 2 and therefore f1(n)!sf1(n) = f2(f1(n), 3n + 1). Conse- quently,

rn =
f (n)
,


h(n)+1 
where
f (n) = f2(f1(n), 3n + 1)(f1(n)+ 1)+ 1,  h(n) = f0(f1(n), n)(f1(n)+ 1) — 1.
Since the functions f and h belong to the class S 2, the S 2-computability of the sequence r0, r1, r2,... and of the number e are thus established.

S 2-computability of Liouville’s number
As well-known, the first examples of transcendental real numbers were constructed by Liouville. The most famous of them is the sum of the infinite series
∞
10m!
m=1
This number is called now Liouville’s number or Liouville’s constant. It is sometimes denoted by L, and we shall adopt this notation here. Let

k
=
10m!
m=1
for k = 1, 2, 3,.. ., and let s0 = 0. Since
1
sk < L < sk + 10k!k
for all k, to assure the inequality |sk — L| < (n + 1)−1 for a given n in N, it is sufficient to choose k in such a way that 10k!k ≥ n + 1. We shall denote by kn the least k satisfying the last inequality, and by setting rn = skn , n = 0, 1, 2,... , we get a sequence r0, r1, r2,... of rational numbers such that |rn — L| < (n + 1)−1 for all n in N. We shall prove the S 2-computability of this sequence.

Let us consider the two-argument function f3 and the one-argument function f4
in N that are defined as follows:
f3(m, n) = min(10m,n + 1),  f4(n) = max{k ∈ N | 10k!k ≤ n} for n > 0,  f4(0) = 0.
These functions belong to S 2 thanks to the equalities
f3(0, n) = 1,  f3(m + 1, n) = min(10f3(m, n),n + 1),
f4(n) = max{k ∈ N | k ≤ n, f3(f0(k, n)k, n)sg n ≤ n},

where f0 is the same function as in Section 2 (to check the last of these equalities, it is appropriate to observe that in the case of n > 0 any of the inequalities 10k!k ≤ n and f3(f0(k, n)k, n)sg n ≤ n implies the equality 10k!k = f3(f0(k, n)k, n)sg n, thus these two inequalities are equivalent). Evidently kn = (f4(n) + 1)sg n.
Let f5 be the two-argument function in N defined by the equality
f5(k, n) = min(10k!sk,n + 1).
This function also belongs to S 2, since we have the equalities
f5(0, n) = 0,  f5(k + 1, n) = min(f5(k, n)f3(f0(k, n)k, n)+ 1,n + 1)
(the second one of them follows from the equality 10(k+1)!sk+1 = 10k!sk10k!k + 1). Suppose now that n is a positive integer. Then we have kn = f4(n) + 1, hence



rn =
10kn!sk 10kn!
10f4(n)!sf  (n)10f4(n)!f4(n) +1 
= 	4	 .
10f4(n)!f4(n)10f4(n)!

Since f4(n)! ≤ 10f4(n)!f4(n) ≤ n, the equalities
f4(n)! = f0(f4(n), n),  10f4(n)!f4(n) = f3(f0(f4(n), n)f4(n), n)
hold. If n ≥ 10 then f4(n) ≥ 1, hence we have also 10f4(n)! ≤ 10f4(n)!f4(n) ≤ n, therefore
10f4(n)! = f3(f0(f4(n), n), n)
in this case. In the same case we have also
10f4(n)!sf (n) ≤ nsf (n) < nL < n,


therefore

10f4(n)!sf (n) = f5(f4(n), n).

Thus for any n ≥ 10 we have

rn =

f (n)
,


h(n)+1 

where f and h are defined for all natural numbers n by means of the equalities
f (n) = f5(f4(n), n)f3(f0(f4(n), n)f4(n), n)+ 1,
h(n) = f3(f0(f4(n), n)f4(n), n)f3(f0(f4(n), n), n) — 1.
Since the functions f and h belong to the class S 2, this is sufficient for a conclusion about the S 2-computability of the sequence r0, r1, r2,... and of the number L.

S 2-computability of the number π
The author does not see a way for proving the S 2-computability of the number π by the method used in the previous two sections. However, another method that has a larger field of applicability can be used, namely replacing the terms of the series with appropriate approximations of them.
The equality
π = 1 — 1 + 1 — 1 + 1 — 1 + ... 
					

shows that
4	3	5	7	9	11
8	8	8


After setting
π = 1 · 3 + 5 · 7 + 9 · 11 + ... 
k



we have the inequalities
s  =		8	
k	(4m + 1)(4m + 3)
m=0


hence
8
sk < π < sk + 4k + 5 ,
1
s4n+3 < π < s4n+3 + 2(n + 1) .

For any m and n in N, let f6(m, n) be the greatest integer not exceeding the number
64(n + 1)2
(4m + 1)(4m + 3) .
Then f6 is a function belonging to S 2, and for all m and n in N the inequalities
 f6(m, n)	8	f6(m, n)+1 
8(n + 1)2 ≤ (4m + 1)(4m + 3) <	8(n + 1)2
hold. Therefore, if we set





then
r = 	1	
n	8(n + 1)2

f6(m, n),
m=0

rn ≤ s4n+3 < rn + 2(n + 1) ,

hence

1
rn < π < rn +	.


n +1 
To complete the proof, it is sufficient to show the S 2-computability of the function

4n+3
f7(n) =	f6(m, n).
m=0
This can be done by showing the S 2-computability of the function

k
f8(k, n) =	f6(m, n),
m=0
and its S 2-computability can be seen by observing that
f7(n) = 8(n + 1)2rn < 8(n + 1)2π < 26(n + 1)2,
and f6(m, n) = 0 for any m greater than 4n + 3, hence f8(k, n) < 26(n + 1)2 for all
k and n in N.
Remark 4.1 To make the proof as simple as possible, we used a simple represen- tation of π that, unfortunately, is not convenient for its numerical computation. Actually other representations of π could be also used.

S 2-computability of Euler’s constant
To prove that Euler’s constant γ is S 2-computable, we shall use its representation





as well as the equality

1 — ln  1+  1  =  1  —  1  +  1  —  1  +  1  —  1  + ...

if j > 0 and m > 0, and let f9(j, m, n) be 0 otherwise. Then for all positive integers
j, m and all n in N the inequalities

2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2	m2j	2j	(2j + 1)m	2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2

To complete the proof, it is sufficient to show the S 2-computability of the function

4n+3 4n+3

f10(n) = 
m=1
f9(j, m, n).
j=1

To achieve this, we shall first prove the S 2-computability of the function f9. We note that f9(j, m, n) = 0, whenever m2j ≥ 2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2. With regard to this, we consider the function
f11(j, m, n) = min(m2j, 2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2).
This function belongs to the class S 2 thanks to the equalities
f11(0, m, n) = 1,  f11(j + 1, m, n) = min(f11(j, m, n)m2, 2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2).
Now the S 2-computability of f9 can be seen by observing that for non-zero values of j and m the value f9(j, m, n) is the greatest integer not exceeding the number
2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2   1		1	 
—	.

f11(j, m, n)	2j	(2j + 1)m
Once the S 2-computability of f9 is established, the S 2-computability of f10 can be easily derived from the fact that
f10(n) = 2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2rn < 2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2γ < 2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2.
For instance, one may use the equality f10(n) = f12(4n + 3, 4n + 3, n), where f12 is defined as follows: we consider the function f' such that f' (j, m, n) = f9(j, m, n) if
9	9
j ≤ 4n + 3, m ≤ 4n + 3, and f' (j, m, n) = 0 otherwise, then we set

k	l
f12(k, l, n) = Σ Σ f' (j, m, n)
m=1 j=1

and, making use of the inequalities
Σ f' (j, m, n) < 2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2, f12(k, l, n) < 2(n + 1)(4n + 3)2,
j=1
we show that f12 belongs to S 2.

Some comments and acknowledgments
Although our proofs concern only four concrete real numbers, the methods used in the proofs or similar ones can be applied in many other cases. It seems that S 2- computability of real numbers is present much more often than one could expect.
Several characterizations of the class S 2 are known that are in the terms of computational complexity, for instance the characterization from [4] according to which a function belongs to S 2 iff it can be computed on a linear tape bounded Turing machine in the case of binary encoding of inputs and outputs. As the referee indicated, such characterizations could be useful for comparison with already known

results and for further studies, and, in particular, the characterization from [4] allows relating complexity of real functions as in [2,6] to S 2-computability. The author thanks the referee for his or her remarks.

Appendix
For any natural number k, let sk be the approximation of e defined by (2). The integer k!sk is never divisible by 3. This can be shown by means of an inductive proof of the following statement: the remainder of the division of k!sk by 3 is 1 if k is divisible by 3, and this remainder is 2 otherwise (the equalities 0!s0 = 1 and (k + 1)!sk+1 = k!sk(k + 1) + 1 are used in the proof).
Now consider any representation of the numbers sk in the form
s =   pk  ,  k = 0, 1, 2,... ,
k	qk +1 
where p0, p1, p2,... and q0, q1, q2,... are natural numbers. Then (k!sk)(qk+1) = k!pk for all k. For any natural number l, if k ≥ 3l then k! is divisible by 3l, hence qk +1 is also divisible by 3l, thus qk +1 ≥ 3l holds. Therefore if the sequence q0, q1, q2,... or some infinite subsequence of it is regarded as a one-argument function in N then this function cannot be dominated by a polynomial, hence it does not belong to S 2.
Remark 7.1 Although the sequence s0, s1, s2,... is not S 2-computable as a se- quence of rational numbers, it is S 2-computable as a sequence of S 2-computable real numbers, namely there exist two-argument functions f and h belonging to S 2 such that
 f (m, n)  	 1 
	— s  ≤
 h(m, n)+1	m	n +1 
for all natural numbers m and n. To show the existence of such functions, let us set

km,n = min{k ∈ N | k = m or k!k ≥ n + 1}

for any m and n in N. Then
1



and
skm,n ≤ sm < skm,n + n + 1 ,

f (m, n) skm,n = h(m, n)+1 

holds with appropriately chosen f and h in S 2. They can be constructed as follows.
We consider the two-argument function f' such that
f' (m, n) = max{k ∈ N | k < m, k!k ≤ n}

if m > 0, and f' (m, n) = 0 otherwise. Then km,n = (f' (m, n) + 1)sg m, and the
1	1
function f' belongs to S 2 since in the case of m > 0 we have
f' (m, n) = max{k ∈ N | k < m, f0(k, n)k ≤ n},
where f0 is the same function as in Section 2. Having the function f' at our disposal,
we set
f (m, n) = f2(f' (m, n), n)(f ' (m, n)+ 1)+ 1,
1	1
h(m, n) = f0(f' (m, n), n)(f ' (m, n)+ 1) — 1
1	1
in the case of m > 0, where f2 has the same meaning as in Section 2, and we additionally set f (0, n) = 1, h(0, n) = 0.
