Abstract
A graph is locally irregular if any pair of adjacent vertices have distinct degrees. A locally irregular de- composition of a graph G is a decomposition of G into locally irregular subgraphs. A graph is said to be decomposable if it admits a locally irregular decomposition. In this paper we prove that any decomposable split graph whose clique has at least 10 vertices can be decomposed into at most three locally irregular sub- graphs. Furthermore, we characterize those whose decomposition can be into one or two locally irregular subgraphs.
Keywords: Locally irregular, graph decomposition, split graphs.


Introduction
All graphs considered in this text are simple and finite, i.e., contain neither loops nor parallel edges and their vertex and edge sets are finite, and we follow standard notation and terminology (see [6,7]).
Given a graph G, a collection D = {H1, H2,..., Hk} of subgraphs of G is a decomposition of G if {E(H1), E(H2),..., E(Hk)} is a partition of E(G). A graph is locally irregular if any pair of adjacent vertices have distinct degrees. A locally irregular decomposition of a graph G is a decomposition D of G such that every

subgraph H ∈ D is locally irregular. Not all graphs admit a locally irregular decomposition; take for example the K3 (complete graph with three vertices). We say that a graph is decomposable if it admits a locally irregular decomposition. Given a decomposable graph G, the irregular chromatic index of G, denoted by

j
irr
(G), is the smallest size of a locally irregular decomposition of G. Alternatively,

one can see a locally irregular decomposition of a graph G as being an edge coloring
of G such that each color induces a locally irregular graph. We call such coloring of a locally irregular edge coloring.
This problem arose from the question “what is the antonym of regular graphs?”. The natural answer, which is “graphs for which all vertices have distinct degrees” is immediately infeasible, since it is well-known that all graphs have at least two vertices with same degree. The notion of locality is thus considered. It is worth mentioning that there are other attempts to answer the question, such as the class of highly irregular graphs [1]. Also, the locally irregular edge coloring is closely related to the 1-2-3 Conjecture, the 1-2 Conjecture, and to the concepts of distinguishing colorings and irregularity strength [5,2].
Locally irregular decomposition as defined above was introduced by Baudon, Bensmail, Przyby-lo, and Wo´zniak [2]. They characterized all graphs that are de- composable and another main result is that d-regular graphs with d ≥ 107 have a locally irregular 3-edge coloring. They also showed a locally irregular 3-edge color- ing for trees that are not an odd-length path, and for Kn with n ≥ 4, and showed a locally irregular 2-edge coloring for regular bipartite graphs with minimum degree at least 3, and hypercubes Qn with n ≥ 2. Furthermore, the authors showed that

j
irr
(G) ≤ [|E(G)|/2♩ for all decomposable graphs G and proposed the following

conjecture.
Conjecture 1.1 (Baudon, Bensmail, Przyby~lo, and Wo´zniak, 2015 [2]) If

G is a decomposable graph, then χj
(G) ≤ 3.

Although we can check in polynomial time whether a graph G is locally irregular, deciding if there exists a locally irregular 2-edge coloring of G is NP-complete, even when restricted to planar graphs with maximum degree at most 6 [3]. Note that proving Conjecture 1.1 would show that deciding whether there exists a locally irregular k-edge coloring for k ≥ 3 is in P.
A result from Przyby-lo [9] shows that every graph with minimum degree at least 1010 has a locally irregular 3-edge coloring. Bensmail, Merker, and Thomassen [4]

gave the first constant upper bound on χj
(G), showing that χj
(G) ≤ 328 for any

decomposable graph G. They also showed that every 16-edge-connected bipartite

graph G has χj
(G) ≤ 2 and every bipartite graph G has χj
(G) ≤ 10. Luˇzar,

Przyby-lo, and Sot´ak [8] then improved the previous results showing that χj
(G) ≤

220 for any decomposable graph G and that χj (G) ≤ 7 for any bipartite graph G.
They also showed that if G is subcubic, then χj (G) ≤ 4.

Our focus is to characterize decomposable split graphs. A graph G is split if there exists a partition {X, Y } of V (G) such that G[X] is a complete graph and Y is a stable set. When defining a split graph G for the first time, we usually write

G(X, Y ) to also define a partition {X, Y } of V (G), where X is a maximal clique and Y = V (G) \ X is a stable set.
Let G(X, Y ) be a split graph with X = {v1,..., vn}. For any vi ∈ X, we denote by dG(vi,Y ) the number of neighbors of vi in Y , i.e., dG(vi,Y )= |NG(vi) ∩ Y |. For simplicity we just write di for dG(vi,Y ) whenever the graph G and the stable set Y are clear from the context.
It is easy to verify that for split graphs G(X, Y ) with X = {v1,..., vn}, we have

j
irr
(G) = 1 if and only if d1 > ··· > dn. In fact, since X is a maximal clique,

dG(y) ≤ n − 1 for all y ∈ Y , which implies that dG(y) is smaller than the degree of
all its neighbors in X. Therefore, G is locally irregular if and only if the vertices in X have distinct degrees in G, which is possible if and only if d1 > ··· > dn, and hence the result follows. We state this in the following fact.
Fact 1.2 Let G(X, Y ) be a split graph with X = {v1,..., vn} where d1 ≥ ··· ≥ dn
and n ≥ 2. We have χj (G)=1 if and only if d1 > ··· > dn.

Our main result is Theorem 1.3, which describes χj G(X, Y ) such that X is a clique with at least 10 vertices.
(G) for all split graphs

Theorem 1.3 Let G(X, Y ) be a split graph with X = {v1,..., vn} where d1 ≥ · · ·≥ 
dn. If n ≥ 10, then the following holds.

(i ) χj
(ii ) χj
(G) ≤ 2 if and only if d1 ≥ [n/2♩ or d2 ≥ 1; (G)=3 if and only if d1 < [n/2♩ and d2 = 0.

Theorem 1.3 is proved in Section 2.
In the remainder of the paper, given a graph G and a coloring ϕ: E(G) →
{red, blue}, we denote the two edge-disjoint spanning monochromatic subgraphs under ϕ by Gred,ϕ and Gblue,ϕ. Formally,
Gred,ϕ = (V (G), ϕ—1(red))	and	Gblue,ϕ = (V (G), ϕ—1(blue)) .

We may omit the term ϕ from Gred,ϕ and Gblue,ϕ whenever ϕ is clear from the context. This notation naturally extends to colorings that use more than two colors.

Decomposing split graphs with a large maximal clique
In this section we give a characterization of the irregular chromatic index of all split graphs with a maximal clique that has at least 10 vertices.
Let G(X, Y ) with X = {v1,..., vn} with n ≥ 10. In Lemma 2.3 we prove that

d1 < [n/2♩ and d2 = 0 implies χj
(G) = 3. We also prove that if d1 ≥ [n/2♩

or d2 ≥ 1, then χj
(G) ≤ 2, which follows directly from Lemmas 2.4 and 2.7.

Therefore, note that Theorem 1.3 follows from Lemmas 2.3, 2.4 and 2.7.
In Section 2.1 we prove Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4. The starting point for proving these lemmas is a specific coloring of E(Kn), which we call normal, given in Definition 2.1. In Section 2.2 we prove Lemma 2.7. For proving this result, we start with an intricate

coloring of E(Kn), which we call strange (see Definition 2.5).
Given a graph G, we say that the edge uv ∈ E(G) is a conflicting edge if
dG(u)= dG(v).
Normal colorings of complete graphs
We start this section by defining normal colorings of complete graphs. See Figure 1 for example.
Definition 2.1 (Normal colorings) Given a complete graph G with n vertices and a sequence V = (v1,..., vn) of V (G), the normal coloring for V is the 2-edge coloring ϕ: E(G) → {red, blue} deﬁned as follows, where X1 = {v1,..., v[n/2|} and X2 = V (G) \ X1:
(i ) Gred[X1] is a complete graph;
(ii ) Gred[X2] contains no edges;
(iii ) NGred (vi)= {v1,..., vn—i+1} for [n/2| +1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Note that in a normal coloring of a complete graph G for a sequence V = (v1,..., vn), we have
dGred,ϕ (vi)= n − i, for 1 ≤ i ≤ [n/2|;
dGred,ϕ (vi)= n − i + 1, for [n/2| +1 ≤ i ≤ n. Therefore, we know that, for a normal coloring ϕ of G,
the only vertices with same degree in Gred,ϕ (and Gblue,ϕ) are v[n/2| and v[n/2|+1 .
(1)
From the definition of normal colorings and (1), since there is a (unique) con- flicting edge v[n/2|v[n/2|+1, we know that if n is even (resp. odd), then Gblue (resp. Gred) is locally irregular and Gred (resp. Gblue) is not locally irregular.
The following proposition will be useful for proving Lemma 2.3.
Proposition 2.2 Let G be a connected graph with V (G) = {u1, u2,..., un} and dG(u1) ≥ ··· ≥ dG(un). If G contains only one pair of vertices u, v with dG(u) = dG(v), then the following holds:
(i ) dG(u)= dG(v)= [n/2♩;
(ii ) u = u[n/2| and v = u[n/2|+1;
(iii ) X = {u1,..., u[n/2|—1} is a clique and Y = {u[n/2|+2,..., un} is a stable set;
(iv ) X ⊆ NG(u) ∩ NG(v);
(v ) (NG(u) ∪ NG(v)) ∩ Y = ∅;
(vi ) uv ∈ E(G) if and only if n is even.
Proof The proof follows by induction on n. If n = 2, then G  K2, and if n = 3, then G  P3. In both cases, (i )-(vi ) hold. Thus, we may assume that n ≥ 4.
Since G is a connected graph with n vertices and u and v are the only vertices of
G with the same degree, there are n − 1 distinct values of degrees in G. Moreover,

since G is connected, for any vertex w of G we have 1 ≤ dG(w) ≤ n − 1, and as a result of this, we know that the set of degrees of all vertices in G is {1, 2,...,n− 1}. Therefore, dG(u1) = n − 1 and dG(un) = 1. Let Gj = G − {u1, un}. Note that dG′ (w)= dG(w) − 1 for all w ∈ V (G) \ {u1, un}.
We will show that Gj is a connected graph with only one pair of vertices with the same degree. If dG(u) ∈ {1,n − 1}, then the vertices of Gj have distinct degrees. In particular, there exists a non-trivial component of Gj where all vertices have distinct degrees, which is an absurd. Thus, we may assume that dG(u) ∈/ {1,n − 1}, and hence Gj has precisely two vertices with the same degree. Now note that graph Gj has no trivial components, since un is the only vertex of G with degree 1. Also, if Gj had more than one component, then it would contain a component where all vertices have distinct degrees, which is an absurd. Therefore, the graph Gj is connected and contains precisely two vertices with the same degree (u and v), and hence, by induction hypothesis, (i )-(vi ) hold for Gj.
For clarity, let V (Gj) = {uj , uj ,..., uj ′ } = {u2, u3,..., un—1}. Since (i ) holds
1	2	n

for Gj, and dG′ (w)= dG(w)−1 for all w ∈ V (G)\{u1, un}, we have dG(u)= dG(v)= 
dG′ (u)+1 = [nj/2♩ = [(n − 2)/2♩ +1 = [n/2♩. Thus, (i ) holds for G. Since (ii )

holds for Gj, the vertices u = uj ′
= u[(n—2)/2|+1 = u[n/2| and v = uj ′	=

[n /2|	[n /2|+1
u([(n—2)/2|+1)+1 = u[n/2|+1 have the same degree in Gj, and consequently in G, and hence (ii ) holds for G. Since (iii ) holds for Gj, the set Xj = {u2,..., u[n/2|—1} is a clique of Gj, the set Y j = {u[n/2|+2,..., un—1} is a stable set of Gj, and hence X = {u1}∪Xj is a clique of G and Y = {un}∪Y j is a stable set of G, from where we conclude that (iii ) holds for G. Since (iv ) holds for Gj, and Xj ⊆ NG′ (u) ∩ NG′ (v),
and since dG(u1) = n − 1, we have X ⊆ NG(u) and X ⊆ NG(v). Therefore, (iv ) holds for G. Since (v ) holds for Gj, and (NG′ (u) ∪ NG′ (v)) ∩ Y j = ∅, and since un has degree 1 in G and u1un ∈ E(G), we have NG(u) ∩ Y = ∅ and NG(v) ∩ Y = ∅. Therefore, (v ) holds for G. Finally, since (vi ) holds for Gj, and Gj has n − 2 vertices, (vi ) holds for G, which finishes the proof.	2
Lemma 2.3 Let G(X, Y ) be a split graph with X = {v1,..., vn} where d1 ≥   ≥

dn and n ≥ 4. If d1 < [n/2♩ and d2 = 0, then χj
(G) = 3.

Proof Sketch. Let G(X, Y ) be a split graph with X = {v1,..., vn}, d1 ≥ · · ·≥ dn,

n ≥ 4, d1 < [n/2♩, and d2 = 0. We start by proving that χj
(G) ≥ 3. This

is shown by supposing that there exists a locally irregular 2-edge coloring of G, ϕ: E(G) → {red, blue}, which allows us to show that Gred satisfies Proposition 2.2. Then we find a contradiction by showing that the degree of v1 in Gred is the same as one of its neighbors, contradicting the fact that Gred was locally irregular in the first place. To finish the proof, we exhibit a locally irregular 3-edge coloring of G.2
In the proof of Lemma 2.4 below the reader may find it useful to refer to Figure 1.
Lemma 2.4 Let G(X, Y ) be a split graph with X = {v1,..., vn} where d1 ≥ ··· ≥

dn and d[n/2♩ ≥ 1. If n ≥ 3, then, χj
(G) ≤ 2.

Proof There are two cases to consider depending on the parity of n, but the only difference in the proofs is the coloring we give to E(G[X]), which are symmetric. For n even, we start with a normal coloring ϕ: E(G[X]) → {red, blue} for the sequence (v1,..., vn/2, vn, vn—1,..., vn/2+1). In case n is odd we consider a normal coloring of E(G[X]) for sequence (v[n/2|,..., vn, v[n/2♩,..., v1). Thus, for the rest of this proof, we may assume, without loss of generality, that n is even.
Let X1 = {v1, v2,..., vn/2} and X2 = X \ X1. From (1) we know that the only vertices with the same degree in Gred[X] or Gblue[X] are vn/2 and vn.
We will obtain a locally irregular 2-edge coloring of G from ϕ. We start by extending ϕ to a coloring ϕj of E(G) with colors red and blue in the following way. For all edges xy between X1 and Y let ϕj(xy) = red, and for all edges xy between X2 and Y let ϕj(xy) = blue.
Let us first analyze the graph Gred,ϕ′ . Since dn/2 ≥ 1, for every vertex x ∈ X1 we have dGred,ϕ′ (x) > dGred,ϕ (x) ≥ n/2, and since d1 ≥ · · · ≥ dn/2, the degree of any two vertices of X1 remain different in Gred,ϕ′ . Also, since there are no red edges between vn and Y , we have dGred,ϕ′ (vn)= n/2 < dGred,ϕ′ (x) for every x ∈ X1. The red degree of vertices vn/2+1,..., vn are the same in ϕ and ϕj, and the red degree

of any vertex y ∈ Y is at most n/2, since there are no red edges between X2 and Y . Therefore, since the degrees of the vertices of X1 in Gred,ϕ′ are at least n/2+ 1, we conclude that Gred,ϕ′ is locally irregular.
It remains to show that Gblue,ϕ′ is locally irregular. Since ϕ is a normal coloring and n is even, we know that Gblue,ϕ′ [X] is locally irregular. If there is no y ∈ Y
that has a neighbor x ∈ X2 with dGblue,ϕ′ (y)= dGblue,ϕ′ (x), then the result follows. Thus we may assume the opposite, i.e., there exist y ∈ Y and x ∈ X2 with the same degree in Gblue,ϕ′ . Since the maximum possible degree of a vertex of Y in Gblue,ϕ′ is
n/2 and the minimum degree of a vertex of X2 in Gblue,ϕ′ [X] is n/2 − 1, we conclude that
dGblue,ϕ′ (y)= dGblue,ϕ′ (vn)= n/2.
Therefore, because of the pair y, vn, the graph Gblue,ϕ′ is not locally irregular. In this case, we can change the color of one or two edges in ϕj to obtain a locally irregular 2-edge coloring ϕjj for G, as we explain next.
If dn/2 ≥ 2, then let ϕjj be the coloring obtained from ϕj by changing the color of yvn from blue to red. We claim that the graphs Gred,ϕ′′ and Gblue,ϕ′′ are locally irregular. In fact, this holds since vn has degree n/2+1 in Gred,ϕ′′ and every vertex in X1 has degree at least n/2+2 in Gred,ϕ′′ .
Now assume that dn/2 =1 and let z ∈ Y be the only neighbor of vn/2 in Y . In this case consider the coloring ϕjj obtained from ϕj by changing the color of yvn from blue to red and the color of zvn/2 from red to blue. Although dGblue,ϕ′′ (y)= dGblue,ϕ′′ (vn) = (n/2) − 1, they are not neighbors in Gblue,ϕ′′ . Also, any vertex in X2 \ {vn} has degree at least (n/2) + 1 in Gblue,ϕ′′ , so there are no conflicts in Gblue,ϕ′′ involving y or vn. Note that we have dGred,ϕ′′ (vn) = (n/2) + 1, but since dGred,ϕ′′ (vn/2) = n/2 and every vertex in X1 \ {vn/2} has red degree at least (n/2) + 2 in Gred,ϕ′′ , there are no conflicts in Gred,ϕ′′ involving vn. This also implies that, since dGred,ϕ′′ (vn/2) = n/2, there are no conflicts involving vn/2 in Gred,ϕ′′ . Furthermore, since dGblue,ϕ′′ (vn/2)= n/2 and any vertex in X2 \ {vn} has degree at least (n/2) + 1 in Gblue,ϕ′′ , we conclude that there are no conflicts involving vn/2 in Gblue,ϕ′′ . Therefore, Gred,ϕ′′ and Gblue,ϕ′′ are locally irregular, and the result follows.	2
2.2  Strange colorings of complete graphs
As in Section 2, we start by defining the colorings of complete graphs that are the starting point for proving the results in this section. The following definition is technical, so we refer the reader to Figure 2 for a better understanding of it.
Definition 2.5 (Strange coloring) Given a complete graph G with n vertices and a sequence V = (v1,..., vn) of V (G), ﬁrst consider a coloring ϕj: E(G) →
{red, blue} deﬁned as follows, where X1 = {v1,.  , v[n/2|} and X2 = V (G) \ X1:
(i ) Gred[X1] is a complete graph;
(ii ) Gred[X2] contains no edges;
(iii ) NGred,ϕ′ (vi)= {v1,.  , vn—i} for [n/2| +1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1;

(iv ) ϕj(v1vn)= red;
(v ) ϕj(v[n/2|+1v[n/2♩)= red; (vi ) All other edges are blue.
The strange coloring of G for V is the coloring ϕ obtained from ϕj by changing the color of the following edges, which we call strange edges:
v[n/2♩v[n/2♩—1 becomes blue;
v[n/2♩—1vn—1 becomes red;
v1v[n/2|+1 for [n/2| even becomes blue;
v1v[n/2♩+1 for [n/2| odd becomes blue;
vn—2vn—3, vn—4vn—5, . .., vn/2+4vn/2+3 for n =0 (mod 4) become red;
vn—1v[n/2♩—1,	vn—2v[n/2♩,	vn—3v[n/2♩+1,	vn—4vn—5,	vn—6vn—7,	. . . , v[n/2♩+3v[n/2♩+2 for n =1 (mod 4) become red;
vn—2vn—3, vn—4vn—5, . .., vn/2+3vn/2+2 for n =2 (mod 4) become red;
vn—2vn—3, vn—4vn—5, . .., v[n/2♩+4v[n/2♩+3 for n =3 (mod 4) become red.
Note that in a strange coloring of a complete graph G for a sequence V = (v1,..., vn), we have




and
dGred,ϕ (vi)= n − i + 1, for 3 ≤ i ≤ n , dGred,ϕ (v1)= n − [n/2♩− 1 ,
d	(v )= (n − [n/2♩− 2	if [n/2| is even

Therefore, we know that, for a strange coloring ϕ of G,
the only vertices with same degree in Gred,ϕ are v1 and v[n/2♩+2 ,	(2)
and
the only vertices with same degree in


Gblue,ϕ
are	v2 and v[n/2♩+3	if [n/2| is even
v2, v1, and v[n/2♩+1	otherwise.

From the definition of strange coloring and by (2) and (3), we conclude that
Gred has exactly one conflicting edge v1v[n/2♩+2 while



Gblue
has exactly	one conflicting edge v2v[n/2♩+3	if [n/2| is even two conflicting edges v2v[n/2♩+2 and v2v1	otherwise.

Given a graph G and a 2-edge coloring ϕ: E(G) → {red, blue}, we say an even cycle C = (u1,..., uk, uk+1 = u1) is an alternating cycle in ϕ if ϕ(uiui+1) /= ϕ(ui+1ui+2), for any 1 ≤ i < k, and dGγ (ui) /= dGγ (ui+1), for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k

and γ ∈ {red, blue}\ ϕ(uiui+1). In other words, an alternating cycle has incident edges with different colors and the endpoints of a red edge (resp. blue edge) have different blue degrees (resp. red degrees). Let ϕj be the 2-edge coloring of E(G) such that ϕj(uv) ∈ {red, blue}\ ϕ(uv) if uv ∈ E(C) and ϕj(uv)= ϕ(uv) otherwise. We say ϕj is obtained from ϕ by inverting C.
Lemma 2.6 shows that an inversion on an alternating cycle does not create conflicting edges. It will be used in the proof of Lemma 2.7.
Lemma 2.6 Let G be a graph, ϕ: E(G) → {red, blue} be a 2-edge coloring of G. Let C be an alternating cycle in ϕ and let ϕj be obtained from ϕ by inverting C. The set of conflicting edges of Gγ,ϕ′ is a subset of the conflicting edges of Gγ,ϕ, for any γ ∈ {red, blue}.
Proof First note that, in ϕ, every vertex of V (C) has one incident blue edge and one incident red edge, which remains valid in ϕj. No other edge has its color changed. Thus, dGγ,ϕ (v)= dGγ,ϕ′ (v) for any v ∈ V (G) and γ ∈ {red, blue}.
Let γ ∈ {red, blue}, γ¯ ∈ {red, blue}\ {γ}, and consider any edge uv ∈ E(G). If
uv ∈/ E(C), then uv is conflicting in Gγ,ϕ (resp. Gγ¯,ϕ) if and only if it is conflicting in Gγ,ϕ′ (resp. Gγ¯,ϕ′ ). So let uv ∈ E(C) and let ϕ(uv) = γ. From the definition of alternating cycle, dGγ¯,ϕ (u) /= dGγ¯,ϕ (v). This means that uv is not conflicting in Gγ¯,ϕ, no matter if it is conflicting in Gγ,ϕ or not.	2

Lemma 2.7 Let n ≥ 10 and let G(X, Y ) be a split graph with X = {v1,..., vn}

where d1 ≥ · · ·≥ dn and d[n/2♩ = 0. If d1 ≥ [n/2♩ or d2 ≥ 1, then χj
(G) = 2.

Proof Sketch. First note that since d[n/2♩ =0 we have χj
(G) ≥ 2 due to Fact 1.2.

Let ϕj: E(G[X]) → {red, blue} be the strange coloring of E(G[X]) for the se- quence
π =	(v3,..., v[n/2♩+1, v1, v[n/2♩+2, v[n/2♩+3, v2, v[n/2♩+4,..., vn)	if [n/2| is even
(v3,..., v[n/2♩+1, v1, v[n/2♩+2, v2, v[n/2♩+3,..., vn)	otherwise .

We show how to obtain a locally irregular 2-edge coloring of G from ϕj. We start by extending ϕj to a coloring ϕ of E(G) with colors red and blue. Let Xred =
{v1, v3, v4,..., v[n/2♩—1}. We give color red to all edges between Xred and Y , and color blue to all edges between v2 and Y . Note that this is a coloring of E(G) because d[n/2♩ = 0.
We first show that if there is a conflicting edge in Gred,ϕ, then it is unique and there exists an alternating cycle that removes it. Then we show the same for Gblue,ϕ.	2
