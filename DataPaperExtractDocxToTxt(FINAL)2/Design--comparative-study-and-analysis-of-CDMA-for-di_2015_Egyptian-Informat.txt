Abstract In this work, we have design a MIMO–CDMA using 4 * 8 antennas with the combina- tion of MMSE (Minimum Mean square Error Equalizer) for BPSK (Binary Phase shift Keying), QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulation schemes. The analysis is built on the basis of transmit–received signal, constellation and MMSE plot simulated on a MatLab/Simulink. On the basis of BER (Bit-Error-Rate), it is also concluded that this work is mostly suitable for high order modulation schemes as the BER of 16-qam, 64-QAM and 256-QAM is zero. The proposed study has increased the quality of the wireless link and Inter-Symbol-Interference (ISI) is likewise cut by applying a combination of MMSE and MIMO (Multiple In and Multiple Out) with OSTBC (Orthogonal space Time Block Code) encoder and combiner.

the transmission bandwidth is more as compared to the band- width of the original signal. Here, the signal at the transmitter is spread, modulate through a channel and at the receiver the signal is de-spread and demodulate to the received original sig- nal from modulated wave. Mathematically it is shown below:
Let X(t) be the original message to be send	(1)
Spreading the signal X(t) is given as follows:
Y(t)= X(t) XOR B(t)	(2)
where B(t) is a pseudo sequence generator and Y(t) transmits a signal.
Once more on the channel there is an addition OF noise (n) so Eq. (2) becomes
Y(t)= X(t)XOR B(t)+ n	(3)

At the receiver the signal is de-spread with B (t) and demodulated, Hence
Z(t)= Y(t)XOR B(t)	(4)
where Z(t) is receiving signal.
CDMA can efficiently use the spectrum, can also increase the capacity and data-rate in communication organization, but the disadvantage of CDMA is that it needs a high power in a circuit and sometime due to the interference the call can be ended. In gain to it, Inter-Symbol-Interference (ISI) is a big- gest problem in CDMA. When two or more signals are so tight to each other than it results in ISI. In that respect are different equalizers that can melt off the ISI but it cannot be totally eliminated and one of the disadvantages of using equalizer is that it’s hardware implementation is so complex [1]. The performance of CDMA has drastically reduced in multipath environment due to the fading of the signal which in-turn reduces the quality of the radio link. In this paper, we have used four antennas at transmitters and 8 antennas at receivers so that the receiver will receive eight signals; so out of eight one best signals can be selected and can be processed further. The data rate and capacity can also be drastically increased if we can send four different signals at a same frequency by using an efficient DSP algorithm. In the proposed employment, the analyses of MIMO–CDMA are clearly shown so that one can select the best modulation scheme and can likewise know the behavior of MIMO–CDMA system under the different modulation scheme. The BER is also computed for different modulation schemes. BER may be defined as the error in transmitting signal to the ratio of total transmit bits. BER occurs due to noise, interference, and distortion in the signal.

8 * 8 MIMO system is designed by using a BPSK modulation technique where the focus was to amend the design of CDMA Mobile in a fading environment and also amended the design frequency of the system using an efficient matrix inversion technique [2,3]. MIMO-MC-DS–CDMA is designed at low SNR two stage and MMSE out-execute the single stage, whereas at high SNR single stage provides a better performance [4]. 2 * 3 MIMO-MC–CDMA is designed by using a convolu-
tion code and found that with this approach the BER is greatly
and QAM [10]. The author has designed and analyzed the per- formance of CDMA QAM-16 under AWGN and RAYLEIGH Channel and concluded that the performance of CDMA is better in AWGN channel as compared to Rayleigh Chanel [11]. An improvement in MIMO–CDMA is achieved without increasing the complexity in the receiver [12]. A Joint Transcei- ver was designed by combining equalizer with antenna, multiuser interference and multiantenna interference reduction is achieved [13]. 2 * 4 MIMO CDMA for 8-PSK, QPSK, QAM- 16, 32, 64 is designed and work reveals that, QPSK is the best modulation scheme with high gain as compared to other mod- ulation schemes [14]. 256-Qam CDMA modulator with zero error was simulated result reveals that the BER performance of the proposed system was equivalent to theoretical QAM BER [15]. The performance of the CDMA MMSE receiver was analyzed and predicted user capacity can be increased with a high order modulation scheme to cause the MMSE receiver to operate away from the interference limited region [16]. The peak rate of WC–CDMA was increase for high order modula- tion scheme by using a powerful control with combination of rate allocation scheme [17].

Modulation technique

In General, modulation system may be defined as the process of sending a message with the help of carrier, but now the efficiency and performance of communication system depend upon the choice of modulation system. In this section we dis- close about BPSK, QPSK and QAM modulation techniques.

BPSK

BPSK stands for a Binary phase shift keying. When one is received there is a phase shift of 180° and when zero is received there is phase shift of 360°. The modulating signal of BPSK is given by the following equation:

g(t)= p2ﬃﬃﬃEﬃﬃﬃbﬃﬃﬃ/ﬃﬃTﬃﬃﬃbﬃﬃ cos 2pfct	(a)
From Eq. (a) we can say that BPSK is described as one dimensional digital carrier modulation scheme. And the demodulated signal is given by

reduced, which in-turn has increased throughput of the system [5]. MIMO-MC-DS–CDMA is analyzed using a chaotic spreading sequence and significant increased the performance

is achieved as compared to the Walsh Hadamard spreading code [6]. Combination of Space–Time-Block-Coding and MIMO–CDMA was implemented by using 2, 3, 4 transmitter to provide the best signal diversity in the system 2 Bps Hz spec- tral efficiency is achieved [7]. The performance of multiple antenna MC–CDMA system was evaluated and performance of BPSK, QPSK, DPSK and QAM with different equalizers are analyzed and concluded that BPSK is a best modulation scheme as compared to other modulation techniques [8]. The author has designed a CDMA with different modulation techniques and concluded that QPSK gives better performance as compared to BPSK, ASK and FSK [9]. The author has projected and compared CDMA for BPSK, QPSK and QAM, and found that BPSK is the best modulation scheme in CDMA because it gives less BER as compared to QPSK
In Eq. (b) the first term represents desired BPSK signal and
second term represents the effect of noise.

QPSK

QPSK stands for a quadrature phase shift keying. The QPSK modulating signal is given by

The QPSK is detected by integrating Eq. (c) with a local oscillator and setting some threshold value which is given by following equation:

QAM

In QAM, two signals are generated which are 180° out of phase with each other. The I and Q signals are given by
I = Acos(Ø) and Q = Asin(Ø)	(e)
At the receiver the modulated signal is demodulated by using a coherent demodulator. The receivers multiply the received signal with sin and cosine terms. Finally LPF is used

which allows the low frequency to pass and blocking the high order frequency signal. The different modulation schemes with states and data-rate are shown in Table 1.

Proposed methodology

The proposed simulated block diagram for MIMO CDMA using 4 * 8 antennas for BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM is shown in Figs. 1–5. A Bernoulli Binary gen- erator is used as an input which generates random numbers whose output is given to a CRC generator which generates
the CRC bit according to the generator polynomial used (here 16 bit polynomial is used) and CRC bit appends them to an input data frame. The convolution encoder encodes the CRC generated data whose output is given to a convolution encoder which consists of an N shift register which shifts the bit from one shift register to another and its output I modulated by using a modulator (BPSK, QPSK and QAM). A combination of frequency hopping and digital filter is used to avoid the interference with another device, to transmit the modulated data by switching a carrier among many frequencies and to fil- ter out the signal whose output is encoded at the rate of ¾ by using an OSTBC encoder. The encoded output is transmitted

by using a four transmitter antennas and received by using an eight receiver antennas over an AWGN channel. The output of AWGN channel and 8 receiver antennas is combined by using an OSTBC combiner and given to frequency de-hopping and digital filter which de-hops the signal and filters out the unwanted signal. The output of digital filters is demodulated and de-interleaved by using a convolution de-interleaver whose output is decoded by using a Viterbi decoder and decoded signal is given to a CRCN syndrome detector which detects the error in input data frame. Finally, the CRC detector output is given to an error detector and MMSE Equalizer where the former calculates the BER, transmitted signal and error in the signal and the MMSE Equalizer further reduces the error in the symbol by computing the efficient outer and the inner products.
MIMO antenna
MIMO stands for multiple inputs and multiple outputs which mean a multiple antenna at transmitter and receiver in a com- munication system. The performance of communication sys- tem has been greatly affected by co-channel interference and multi path fading, MIMO plays a very important role to erad- icate the effect of fading and co-channel interference. Thus increasing the capacity, data-rate, radio link and also effi- ciently utilizing the spectrum. The MIMO system used a large number of antenna arrays and by using an efficient DSP algorithm it is also possible to makes them smart which study’s the environment and takes the decision on the basis of environ- ment condition. In this paper, four transmitting antennas and eight receiving antennas is used and the MIMO is implemented

by using OSTBC Code. The transmitted and received signals are described in [14].

OSTBC codes

Let us consider a signal Xk = {x1, x2, x3, x4,	xn} to
be transmitted. As compared to traditional approach x1 signal will transmit at first time slot and x2 at second time slot but in this paper x1–x4 signals will transmit at first time slot and
rate of a communication system [18]. As the number of antenna is increased in transmitter and receiver, the capacity is also increased and also the capacity of MIMO is more as compared than SISO, MISO, and SIMO which were studied in [19,20,21].

is independent from the channel condition experience by other antennas. By increasing the number of antennas, power effi- ciency is also achieved and also increases the capacity and data

cation system to transmit the data. For BPSK as shown in Fig. 21, EVM gives  1.294 dB with a peak value of

Conclusion

It is concluded that with higher order modulation scheme, there is an efficient utilization of spectrum and data rate is also enhanced at the cost of high inter-symbol interference and complex transmitter and receiver. The 4 * 8 MIMO CDMA with a combination of OSTBC and MSE Equalizer is simu- lated for the BPSK, QPSK, QAM-16, 64 and 256 modulation schemes. From the analysis of Transmitted and received signal spectrum, MSE and Scatter plot, it is concluded that QPSK performance is better as compared to BPSK but overall QAM-16, 64 and 256 is most suitable for massive MIMO sys- tem. It is also found that the proposed work efficiently reduces the ISI and also has increased the performance as compared to the conventional CDMA system since the achieve BER is low for QPSK, BPSK and zero for QAMs. The work also gives a
motivation to implement a large number of MIMO for next generation network because implementation of large MIMO can only meet the demands and expectation of telecommunica- tion for future generation. The BER performance of this mod- ulation schemes is given in Table 2.
