In this study, the prediction of dynamic viscosity (lnf) of MWCNT-Al2O3 (30:70)/ Oil 5W50 hybrid nano- lubricant using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is performed. The objective of the present research is to investigate the effect of temperature and solid volume fraction (SVF) to predict the shear rates (SR) and
lnf using ANN. The feed-forward ANN consists of a multilayer perceptron network (MLP), which is cap-
able of predicting lnf in connection with experimental data of temperature, SR and SVF. Sensitivity anal- ysis is used to evaluate the importance and role of temperature, SR, and SVF in experimental lnf
variations. ANN is generated and tested with experimental data sets and the results show that there was a good agreement between the actual and predicted ANN values. Moreover, the results of ANN sim- ulation are compared with other data processing methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Squares (PLS), Principal Component Regression. In addition, the results of the residual value of ANN
with seven neurons for lnf can be very small and close to the expected normal value. From this, it can be
concluded that the given model can expect exact values.

Introduction

Nowadays, the use of nanotechnology in almost all branches of science is being seriously pursued [1,2]. In addition, the use of intelligent systems for predicting data, along with nanotechnology, has helped researchers in the growth and development of various branches of science [3–13]. Therefore, it seems that different branches of science in the fields of chemistry, physics, mechanics, etc. can experience many advances with nanotechnology [14–20].

The development of the lubricant industry is an important part of the improvement of the machine industry and other related indus- tries. Statistical data show that with a small increase in the cost of producing and choosing a better lubricant, many additional and undesirable costs can be reduced. This is due to the important and beneficial effects of using lubricants, which can reduce the amount of friction between parts with a relative motion by sepa- rating them with a film of oil, and cooling the engine and its inter- nal components, thereby reducing thermal stresses and longer life. Lubricants also seal the contact parts to prevent the diffusion of gases and fluids containing particles and carry particles due to wearing down of engine components between moving parts and collect them in the filter wall. In recent years, with the advance- ment of technology, the use of nanomaterials in different fields of engineering and various industries has been considered by researchers. These include the dispersion of nanoparticles in a base fluid leading to the formation of a nanofluid, first proposed by Choi

and Eastman. This led to the development of lubricants with higher efficiency than conventional ones in cooling by changing some thermal properties and hydrodynamic characteristics of the base fluid [21–24]. Studies in this field show that the knf is a function of factors such as the shape, size and properties of the nanoparti- cles, temperature, base fluid properties, and solid volume fraction
(SVF). The lnf of a lubricant is one of the most important and basic
properties of the fluid which affects the flow rate and pumping power of the fluid. The investigations on lnf show their depen- dency on factors like temperature, particle size, SVF, nanoparticle type and base fluid [25]. lnf analysis is one of the most important key factors in determining the hydrodynamic behavior of nanoflu-
ids due to its influence on Rayleigh and Reynolds number values. Therefore, extensive studies were conducted on the effect of nanoparticles on lnf, some of which are given as follows. Kole and Dey [26] dispersed alumina nanoparticles in-car coolant and
analyzed their experimental results on lnf. It was reported that SVF would increase the lnf while an increase in temperature would decrease it. Sundar et al. [27] investigated the lnf and thermal con-
ductivity (knf) of magnetic Fe3O4/water nanofluid experimentally and theoretically. Hemmat Esfe et al. [28] also studied on predict- ing the rheological behavior of MWCNT–Al2O3 (30–70%)/oil SAE40 hybrid nanofluid [28]. The other study on Experimental evaluation of MWCNT–Al2O3 (40–60%)/5W50 hybrid nanofluid and compar- ison with MWCNT–Al2O3 (35–65%)/5W50 hybrid nanofluid with focus on thermophysical properties and cost performance index were reported by Hemmat Esfe and Alidoust [29]. Data analysis and modeling with ANN were reported by Esfe et al. [30] and in case of modeling the thermal conductivity ratio of an antifreeze- based hybrid nanofluid containing graphene oxide and copper oxide for using in thermal systems studied by Rostami et al. [31]. An experimental study on the thermal conductivity of new anti- freeze containing copper oxide and graphene oxide nano- additives were reported by Rostami et al. [32]. Rostami et al. [33] also studied on The effect of hybrid nano-additive consists of gra- phene oxide and copper oxide on rheological behavior of a mixture of water and ethylene glycol. Using the chemical precipitation method, they prepared the nanofluid by synthesizing Fe3O4 nanoparticles and then dispersing them in water. A range of 0.0%
to 2.0% for SVF and a variation of 20–60 °C for the temperature
were considered. Their results show that increasing the SVF would increase the lnf and knf while the amount of lnf enhancement was greater than that of knf. In addition, they proposed analytical equa-
tions without resorting to Maxwell and Einstein models to predict the lnf and knf. In another study, Naina et al. [34] examined the knf of TiO2/Water nanofluid over a range of 0.5–2.5% for SVF and tem- perature varying from T = 10 to 40 °C. They reported a maximum of 50% increase in lnf for 2.5 % TiO2-water nanofluid. Murshed et al.
[35] presented a combined theoretical and experimental investiga- tion on lnf and knf. They found higher values for these parameters of the nanofluid in comparison with the base fluids. It was reported that increasing the SVF would increase lnf and knf. Moreover, they denoted that the temperature would strongly influence knf. Aladag et al. [36] examined the dependency of lnf of CNT/water and Al2O3/water nanofluids on the temperature and shear rates (SR)
at low temperatures and SVFs. Depending on SR, the nanofluid sus- pensions display Newtonian or non-Newtonian behaviors. Hojjat et al. [37] studied three types of non-Newtonian nanofluids and measured their rheological characteristics with different SVFs at various temperatures. The dependency of the rheological proper- ties of the nanofluids on the SVF and temperature was reported. Also, their results show that all nanofluids display pseudo-plastic behavior. Recently, researchers have paid attention to a new class of nanofluids containing a combination of different nanoparticles,
called hybrid nanofluids, and studied their thermophysical proper- ties. Esfe et al. [38] investigated the effect of SVF on lnf and knf of
Ag–MgO/water nanofluid through an experimental study. In another study, Esfe et al. [39] measured knf of SWCNT-MgO/EG nanofluids which were produced at SVF = 0.05% to 2%. The range of temperature was considered from 30 to 50 °C through the tests. A comparison between the results of the hybrid nanofluid and nanofluids made with a single particle of MgO and SWCNT was
performed. Through an experimental study, Rejvani et al. [40] examined the behavior of MWCNTs–SiO2 (30–70)/10W40 nano- fluid. The lnf was measured at SVF = 0.05 to 1% with T = 5 to
55 °C. It was reported that the behavior of the samples was so close
to the pseudo-plastic Ostwald de Waele non-Newtonian model. Batmunkh et al. [41] reported a development in the knf of TiO2 - nanofluids by adding negligible amounts of ‘‘Ag” nanoparticles. The temperature variation was considered 15–40 °C through the experiments. Suresh et al. [42] prepared a stable hybrid nanofluid in SVF = 0.1% by dispersing hybrid nanopowder Al2O3–Cu in deion-
ized water. Their results show an enhancement of 13.56% in Nus- selt number in comparison with that of water. Esfe et al. [43] evaluated the lnf of Al2O3-MWCNT (65:35)/5W50 nanofluid. The
mean diameter of Al2O3 nanoparticles was 50 nm, and the range of inner and outer diameters of MWCNTs was 3–5 nm and 5– 1 nm, respectively. The variation of temperature was between 5 and 55 °C. It was reported that the hybrid nano-lubricant behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid and increasing the SVF magnifies the non-Newtonian behavior; on the contrary while, the temperature
increase had a reverse result. Chen et al. [44] investigated knf of Fe2O3-MWNT /Water hybrid nanofluid. Madhesh et al. [45] per- formed an experimental study to investigate the heat transfer and rheological properties of Cu–titania hybrid nanofluids. Although the experimental studies and the simulations performed based on molecular dynamics to determine the properties of nanofluids have provided useful and efficient results, nevertheless, their high cost and time consumption can be mentioned as disad- vantages of these methods. On the other hand, when it is difficult to provide a mathematical model for a physical system, or detailed information is not available, or the process has time-dependent or nonlinear variables, the results of analytical modeling using scien- tific and knowledge-based methods may not be convincing. For such complex systems, simplifying assumptions may limit the accuracy of the proposed models. In addition, most of the equa- tions used in modeling analyses cannot be applied to a wide range of processes under different conditions, because they are only suit- able for a given set of conditions and can be used under certain assumptions. These ambiguities have led to a strong tendency to present methods based on the direct use of experimental data to predict process results. Examples include ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks), genetic algorithms, adaptive neural-fuzzy inference systems, and fuzzy logic, which were also used to analyze the behavior of nanofluids. Using an ANN, Toghraie et al. [46] inspected
lnf of Ag/Ethylene glycol nanofluid with SVF = 0.2–2% for T = 25–
55 °C. Their results show that ANN could guess the lnf with good accuracy compared to the correlation method. Esfe et al. [10] applied the ANN to predict Nusselt number and pressure drop of aqueous nanofluids. They examined the influence of different vari- ables on pressure drop and Nusselt number. It was shown that the ANN modeling could accurately model the experimental data.
Toghraie et al. [47] applied ANN to investigate the lnf of
MWCNTs–ZnO/water–EG (80:20). After preparing the required experimental data, the ANN was chosen based on different gener- ating architectures. Also, lnf was predicted by the correlation
method. It was reported that the ANN was better than the correla- tion method in forecasting the lnf. Via ANN and RSM, Esfe et al.
[48] modeled the knf of the water–titania nanofluid versus SVF and temperature. It was reported that the influence of temperature on knf was more evident than the effect of SVF. Beigzadeh [49] pre-
sented an ANFIS model to predict the lnf of Cu/Water-Glycerin

nanofluid. Appropriate matching of ANFIS estimating results with the test data set show the reliability of their model. By utilizing
ANN, Esfe et al. [8] examined the impact of different temperatures SVFs on lnf of MWCNT–Al2O3 (30–70%)/Oil SAE40 nanofluid. Some experiments were performed to obtain the required data to train an ANN. The results of well-trained ANN show that when SVF
increases, the lnf would increase at all temperatures while increas- ing the temperature resulted in decreasing the lnf.
In this study, the prediction of lnf of MWCNT-Al2O3 (30:70)/ Oil
5W50 hybrid nano-lubricant using ANN was performed. The objective of the present research is to investigate the effect of temperature and SVF to predict the SRs and lnf using ANN. The feed-forward ANN consists of a MLP, which is capable of predicting
lnf in connection with experimental data of temperature, SR and
SVF.

Material and methods

ANNs are numerical and mathematical models composed by a few neurons organized completely different layers, connected
through the variable weights. These weights are calculated by an iterative strategy among the training process when a large amount of training data representing, the pattern to be modeled, input and output pairs are supplied to the network [50]. In the ANN analysis,
multi-layer ANNs with back propagation (BP) learning algorithm were used to predict lnf of MWCNT-Al2O3 (30:70)/ Oil 5W50 hybrid nano-lubricant. Data used in this work is taken from litera- ture [59]. Back propagation is an ANN algorithm which, performed learning on a multilayer feed-forward ANN [46]. In order to achieve
the outputs a large number of inter-connected processors called neurons organized in layers. A three-layer (input, hidden and out- put) ANN with a large number of nodes in each layer connected the knowledge of inputs with outputs. The strength (weights) of con- nections are achieved through a learning process. The main objec-
tive is to study the variation of lnf within a certain range of
temperature, SR and SVF of hybrid nano-lubricant to find critical values of variation in the behavior of hybrid nano-lubricants for each of the parameters. In other words, in the present study, the
ANN is trained by using temperature, SVF, and SR experimental data to estimate the lnf of MWCNT-Al2O3 (30:70)/ Oil 5W50 hybrid nano-lubricant. In order to simulate the ANN model, a real dataset collected from experiment have been used. Table 1 contains some
information from MWCNT-Al2O3 (30:70)/ Oil 5W50 hybrid nano- lubricant.
Initial data is typically split into 70% for training, 10% for valida- tion, and 20% for testing the efficiency of the model. Validation data prevent ANN overtraining due to premature outages and gen- eralize ANN results.

Results and discussion

In the present study, experimental data, including temperature, SR, and SVF, are first obtained and compared to lnf data through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a discounting method. This approach is frequently utilized to calculate the measurements of
large-scale data. A unit that includes an expansive set of parame- ters, gets to be a small set of parameters that contains the greatest value of total data. Fig. 1 shows the results of PCA for overall data. As shown in Fig. 1, the second principal component was utilized as an index of the variation of all data and different measurable char- acteristics. This indicator is usually utilized to recognize outliers. Since the PCA minimizes the quadratic norm, it either has the same least-squares issue or is delicate to exceptions in a Gaussian con- veyance. By squaring, deviations from exceptions overwhelm the common criteria and, as a result, can drive PCA components. Out- liers were analyzed utilizing the PCA strategy and expelled from the general data, as illustrated in Fig. 2 [51,52]. Due to the PCA minimizing quadratic norms, it has the same least-squares prob- lems, or it becomes Gaussian the sensitivity to outliers. By squar- ing, deviations from outliers, can dominate the general norm and consequently drive PCA components.

For training data, when the network weights are randomly cho- sen, the amount of MSE is exceptionally high, and significantly decreased by the training loops. To get the best performance ANN for each training calculation, 15 distinctive ANNs are trained with different layers, and the networks with the slightest error and highest performance are chosen to predict the problem.

from the figures that the excellent agreement of ANN as an approx- imation function of the lnf is achieved. It can be concluded that the temperature has a significant effect on lnf. In addition, with increasing the SVF of MWCNT-Al2O3 (30:70)/ Oil 5W50 hybrid nano-lubricant the effect of shear rate increases, enhancing the lnf. Fig. 9 illustrates the lnf of MWCNT-Al2O3 (30:70)/ Oil 5W50 hybrid nano-lubricant compared to the experimental data and

The ANN was generated and tested using the collected experimental datasets and the results show that there was a good match between the actual and predicted values of the ANN.
Table 3 shows the results of data processing by various meth- ods. These methods include support vector machines (SVM), par- tial least squares (PLS) method, and PCR. The SVM was presented by Vapnik [53,54]. The distinctive features of SVM and ability to promise empirical performance, causing to utilize them for the facial expression classification problem. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression purposes. Support vector machines can also be used as a regression method, preserving all the key features (maximum margins) that characterize the algorithm. You can use SVM to determine the acceptable error in your model and find a line (or higher dimensional hyperplane) that fits your data. In this case,

the polynomial algorithm and its parameters were used: m = 0.5,
c = 0.3333333. Partial least squares regression (PLS) regression is a fast, efficient, and optimal covariance-based regression method that is recommended for regressions with many explanatory vari- ables [55,56]. The explanatory variables tend to correlate. PLS is a transformer or regressor and is in many ways similar to PCR. It also shrinks the sample before using the linear regressor on the trans- formed data. The main difference from PCR is that PLS Transforma- tion is monitored [50,57].
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), also known as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several independent variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. MLR is an extension of Linear Regression (LS) that uses only one independent variable. As can be seen from Table 3, the best training methods related to the Broydon - Fletcher - Goldfarb - Shann (BFGS) algo- rithm is due to having the least amount of error and highest perfor- mance. The ANN during the other method led to the selection, which we will explain and analyze in the following Regression and Performance diagrams.
Fig. 7 presents error graphs for various aspects of the MLP 3-8-1 error such as the difference between the residual and the expected normal. In Fig. 7, the error values demonstrate that ANN is work- ing appropriately, which the training approach	is satisfactory. Therefore, the expected dynamic viscosity results of MLP 3-8-1 are very good predictors. In addition, the resulting ANN residuals of 8 neurons at dynamic viscosity were very low and probably close to the expected normal. From this, we can conclude that a given model can be expected to have exact values.
Here, a BFGS 30 algorithm of an ANN with a single hidden layer and 8 neurons is used to effectively estimate the lnf [58]. Given the obtained ANN structure, the lnf of MWCNT-Al2O3 (30:70)/ Oil
