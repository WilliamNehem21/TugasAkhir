Abstract
Given a topological space X, the set Q(X) of all nonempty saturated compact subsets of X is a poset with respect to the reverse inclusion order. The posets of the form Q(X) play important roles in several aspects of domain theory. In this paper, we investigate some further properties of such posets, in particular their links to the dcpo models of T1 topological spaces.

A dcpo model of a topological space X is a dcpo (directed complete poset) P such that X is homeomorphic to the maximal point space of P with the subspace topology of the Scott space of P . Although it has been proved that every T1 topological space has a dcpo model [11], one may not be able to construct a simply defined dcpo model for a general T1 space, if it is not a complete metrizable space. In [12], the authors considered the dcpo models of the form CK(X) consisting of all nonempty compact closed subsets of space X with the reverse inclusion order. The key notion employed in [12] is the CK-filter defined topology, described using the nonempty compact closed subsets. They proved that if a T1 space is CK-filter defined, then the dcpo (CK(X), ⊇) is a bounded complete dcpo model of X. In particular, for every Hausdorff k-space (namely, compactly generated space), CK(X) is a bounded complete dcpo model of X. In the current paper, we shall make use the set Q(X) of all nonempty compact saturated subsets of a topological space X in the place of CK(X) to investigate the corresponding problems considered in [12]. The main results include: (1) For any T1 well-filtered K-filter defined space (to be defined in Section 2) X, Q(X) is a dcpo model of X; (2) a Hausdorff space is a k-space iff it is CK-filter defined; (3) a first countable, coherent T1 space is well-filtered if and only if it is sober. The result (2) answers a problem posed in [12] and establishes a new characterization of Hausdorff k-spaces.
Preliminaries
In this section, we recall some basic notions and results to be used in the sequel, most of them can be found in [1, 2].
Let P be a poset. For D ⊆P , we use WD (resp., VD) to denote the supremum
(resp., infimum) of D if it exists.
A subset A of a poset P is called an upper (resp., a lower) set if A = ↑A = {x ∈ P | a ≤ x for some a ∈ A} (resp., A = ↓A = {x ∈ P | x ≤ a for some a ∈ A}). A subset D of P is directed if it is nonempty and every finite subset of D has an upper bound in D. A poset is called a directed complete poset (dcpo, for short) if every directed subset in it has a supremum. A poset is called bounded complete if every subset that is bounded above has a supremum. In particular, a bounded complete poset has a bottom element, the supremum of empty set.
For two elements x and y in a poset P , We say that x is way below y, written as x   y if for any directed set D ⊆ P with existing W D and W D ≥ y, there
is some d ∈ D such that x ≤ d. An element x ∈ P is called compact if x   x.
The set of all compact elements of P will be denoted by K(P ). A poset L is said to be continuous (resp., algebraic) if every element is the directed supremum of

(resp., compact) elements that are way below it. A continuous dcpo is often called a domain.
A subset U ⊆P of poset P is Scott open iff (i) U = ↑U , and (ii) for any directed subset D ⊆P , W D ∈ U implies D ∩ U /= ∅ whenever W D exists. The collection of
all Scott open sets of P forms a topology, called the Scott topology of P and denoted
by σ(P ). The space ΣP = (P, σ(P )) is called the Scott space of P .
For a topological space X, a nonempty subset A ⊆ X is said to be irreducible if for any finite family {Ci}i∈F of closed sets, whenever A ⊆ ∪i∈F Ci, then A ⊆ Ci for some i ∈ F . A topological space X is called sober if for every irreducible closed set C, there exists a unique x ∈ X such that cl({x})= C, where cl({x}) means the closure of {x}. The specialization order on a T0 space X is defined by that x ≤ y iff x ∈ cl({y}). Alternatively x ≤ y iff every open set that contains x must also contain y. Thus open sets are upper sets and closed sets are lower sets. A subset of X is called saturated if it is an intersection of open subsets, equivalently if it is an upper set with respect to the specialization order. Notice that for a poset L, a subset A is saturated in (L, σ(L)) iff A is an upper set. A topological space X is called well-ﬁltered if for each filter basis C of compact saturated sets and each open set U with  C ⊆ U , there is a K ∈ C with K ⊆ U . It is known by [1, Theorem II-1.21] that if X is sober, then X is well-filtered. A topological space is said to be coherent if the intersection of any two compact saturated sets is again compact.
A dcpo L is said to be well-filtered (resp., compact, sober, coherent) if ΣP is a well-filtered (resp., compact, sober, coherent) space.
Proposition 1.1 ( [1, Proposition I-1.24.2.]) Let X be a topological space. If X is well-ﬁltered, then K =  C is a nonempty compact saturated set for each ﬁlter base C of nonempty compact saturated sets C.
Upper Vietoris topologies and Scott topologies on
Q(X)
In this section, instead of nonempty compact closed subsets of a T1 space used by Zhao and Xi in [12], we use nonempty compact saturated subsets of a topological space X to form a dcpo model of X.
For any T0 well-filtered space (X, τ ), let Q(X, τ ) (Q(X) for short) be the set of all nonempty compact saturated subsets of X. The poset (Q(X), ⊇) is directed
complete: for any directed subset D ⊆ Q(X),  D = W	D.
Definition 2.1 An upper set U of a topological space (X, τ ) is called K-open if, for any filtered family {Ki}i∈I ⊆ Q(X) with  i∈I Ki =↑ x ⊆ U for some x ∈ U , then Ki ⊆ U for some i ∈ I.
Definition 2.2 An upper set U of a topological space (X, τ ) is called K∗-open if, for any filtered family {Ki}i∈I ⊆ Q(X) with  i∈I Ki ⊆ U , then Ki ⊆ U for some i ∈ I.
Let τK be the set of all K-open sets of X. Obviously, ∅ and X are K-open. It

is easy to verify that τK is indeed a topology on X. We call τK the K-generated topology.
Clearly, the intersection of two K∗-open sets is K∗-open. In general, the union of two K∗-open sets may not be K∗-open. So, all K∗-open sets may not form a topology. The topology generated by K∗-open sets and ∅ as a base is denoted by τK∗ , called the K∗-generated topology.
It is easy to see that every K∗-open set is K-open. For a well-filtered space, every open set of X is K∗-open. Thus, we have the following result.
Proposition 2.3 Let (X, τ ) be a well-ﬁltered space. Then we have τ ⊆ τK∗ ⊆ τK.
Definition 2.4 Let (X, τ ) be a T0 space. Then
(X, τ ) is called K-filter defined if τK = τ .
(X, τ ) is called K∗-filter defined if τK∗ = τ .
Remark 2.5 1) For every well-filtered dcpo L, the space ΣL = (L, σ(L)) is K-filter defined.
2) The well-known non-sober dcpo constructed by Johnstone [3] is K-filter de- fined but not well-filtered.
Recall that in [7] the upper Vietoris topology has a basis of open sets of the form 2U = {K ∈ Q(X) | K ⊆U} where U ranges over the open subsets of X. The specialization order for the upper Vietoris topology on Q(X) agrees with the Smyth preorder A ≤ B, i.e., B ⊆A.
Note that, the specialization order on T1 space (X, τ ) reduces to the discrete order. So, for a T1 space X, compact saturated subsets of X are the same as compact subsets of X. Let ηX : X → Q(X) be the mapping given by ηX (x)= {x} for all x.
Proposition 2.6 Let X be a T1 well-ﬁltered space and Q(X) endowed with the upper Vietoris topology. Then ηX : X → Max(Q(X)) is a homeomorphism.
Denote the upper Vietoris topology (resp., the Scott topology) on Q(X) by UV (Q(X)) (resp., σ(Q(X))). Clearly, for a well-filtered space X, UV (Q(X)) ⊆ σ(Q(X)).
Proposition 2.7 If (X, τ ) is T1, well-ﬁltered and K-ﬁlter deﬁned, then
UV (Q(X)) |Max(Q(X))= σ(Q(X)) |Max(Q(X)) .
Proof. It suffices to show that UV (Q(X)) |Max(Q(X))⊇ σ(Q(X)) |Max(Q(X)). For any U ∈ σ(Q(X)), let U = {x | {x} ∈ U ∩ Max(Q(X))}. It is easy to see that U ∩ Max(Q(X)) = 2U ∩ Max(Q(X)). Next we show that U ∈ τ . Since U ∈
σ(Q(X)), for any x ∈ U and any filtered family {Ki}i∈I ⊆ Q(X), if W	Ki =
i∈I Ki = {x} ∈ U , then there exists some i ∈ I such that Ki ∈ U , which implies that Ki ⊆ U . Thus, U ∈ τK. Since (X, τ ) is K-filter defined, we have U ∈ τK = τ .2
Theorem 2.8 Let X be a T1 well-ﬁltered K-ﬁlter deﬁned space. Then Q(X) is a dcpo model of X.

Proof. It follows from Propositions 2.6 and 2.7.	2
Proposition 2.9 Let  (X, τ )  be  a  T1  and  well-ﬁltered  space.    If
UV (Q(X)) |Max(Q(X))= σ(Q(X)) |Max(Q(X)), then (X, τ ) is K∗-ﬁlter deﬁned.
Proof. Let U ∈ τK∗ . We show that U ∈ τ . Let U = {K ∈ Q(X) | K ⊆ U}. Then {x} ∈ U holds for any x ∈ U .  Since U ∈ τK∗ , U ∈ σ(Q(X)).  As UV (Q(X))  |Max(Q(X))=  σ(Q(X))  |Max(Q(X)),  there exists V  ∈  τ  such that
{x} ∈ 2V ∩ Max(Q(X)) ⊆ U ∩ Max(Q(X)). So, we have x ∈ V ⊆ U , and thus U ∈ τ .	2
Example 2.10 Let X = R be the set of all real numbers and τ the topology on X, where U ∈ τ if and only if U = V − A for some Euclidean open set V and a countable set A. Then, Q(X) is the family of all nonempty finite subsets of R. Thus, every subset is K-open, and thus τK is a discrete topology. So, (X, τK) is not K-filter defined. Also σ(Q(X)) |Max(Q(X)) is discrete, which reveals that Q(X) can not be a dcpo model of X.
Proposition 2.11 Every T1 ﬁrst countable and well-ﬁltered space is K-ﬁlter de- ﬁned.
Proof. Let (X, τ ) bea T1 first countable and well-filtered space. It suffices to show τK ⊆ τ . Let U ∈ τK. For any x ∈ U , we need to show that there exists a V ∈ τ such that x ∈ V ⊆ U . Let {Vi | i ∈ N} be a neighborhood base of x with Vi+1 ⊆ Vi. Suppose that x ∈ Vi ¢ U for all i ∈ N. Take xi ∈ Vi \ U (∀i ∈ N). Then {xi | i ∈ N} converges to x. Set Ai = {xj | j ∈ N,j ≥ i}∪{x}. Then Ai is compact for all i ∈ N.
Since (X, τ ) is well-filtered,  ∞ Ai = {x} ⊆ U . However, Ai ¢ U for all i ∈ N,
which contradicts U ∈ τK.	2
By Theorem 2.8 and Proposition 2.11, we have the following result.
Corollary 2.12 Let X be a T1 ﬁrst countable and well-ﬁltered space. Then Q(X)
is a dcpo model of X.
Compact subsets in K∗-generated topological spaces
For a well-filtered space X, the K∗-generated topology may contain more open subsets than the original topology. In this section, we show that the compact subsets with respect to these two topologies are the same.
Lemma 3.1 Let X be a T1 well-ﬁltered space. For any K ∈ Q(X, τ ) and any closed set C in (X, τK∗ ), we have C ∩ K ∈ Q(X, τ ).
Proof. It suffices to verify the compactness of C ∩ K for each K ∈ Q(X, τ ) and any closed set C in (X, τK∗ ). Suppose that {Ui}i∈I is a directed family of open sets in (X, τ ) such that  i∈I Ui ⊇ C ∩ K and Ui ∩ (C ∩ K) /= ∅ for any i ∈ I, while Ui /⊇ C ∩ K for any i ∈ I. Then for any i ∈ I, (X − Ui) ∩ (C ∩ K) /= ∅. Set Di = K ∩ (X − Ui)(∀i ∈ I). Then each Di is a compact saturated subset of K and

 i∈I Di ⊆ K − C. Since C is closed in (X, τK∗ ), there exists some i0 ∈ I such that
Di0 = K ∩ (X − Ui0 ) ⊆ K − C, which contradicts (X − Ui0 ) ∩ (C ∩ K) /= ∅.	2
Let Q(X, τK∗ ) be the set of all compact saturated sets of (X, τK∗ ).
Theorem 3.2 Let X be a T1 well-ﬁltered space. Then
Q(X, τ )= Q(X, τK∗ ).

Proof. It is easy to check that Q(X, τK∗ ) ⊆ Q(X, τ ). Conversely, we show that Q(X, τ ) ⊆ Q(X, τK∗ ). Let K ∈ Q(X, τ ) and {Ci | i ∈ I} be a family of closed subsets in (X, τK∗ ) with {K ∩ Ci | i ∈ I} satisfying finite intersection property.
It suffices to show the compactness of K in τK∗ . Next, we need to check that
i∈I (K ∩ Ci) /= ∅.
By Lemma 3.1, we have K ∩ Ci ∈ Q(X, τ ) for all i ∈ I. Suppose that i∈I (K ∩ Ci)= ∅. Since (X, τ ) is well-filtered, there exists some i0 ∈ I such that K ∩Ci0 = ∅, which contradicts the finite intersection property. Thus, K ∈ Q(X, τK∗ ), which implies that Q(X, τ ) ⊆ Q(X, τK∗ ).	2
Corollary 3.3 Let X be a T1 well-ﬁltered space. Then (X, τK∗ ) is K∗-ﬁlter deﬁned.
CK-filter defined topologies and k-spaces
In this section, we give a positive answer to a question raised by Zhao and Xi in [12].
For any T0 space (X, τ ), let CK(X) be the set of all nonempty closed compact subsets of X. The poset (CK(X), ⊇) is directed complete: for any directed subset
D ⊆ CK(X),  D = W	D.
Definition 4.1 ( [12]) A subset U of a topological space (X, τ ) is called CK-open if, for any filtered family F ⊆ CK(X) with |  F |= 1, that is,  F is a singleton, and  F ⊆ U , then F ⊆ U for some F ∈ F. The topology consisting of all CK-open subsets is called the CK-generated topology.
Definition 4.2 ( [12]) A subset U of a topological space (X, τ ) is called CK∗-open if, for any filtered family F ⊆ CK(X) with  F ⊆ U , then F ⊆ U for some F ∈ F. The topology generated by all CK∗-open subsets as a basis is called the CK∗-generated topology.
Obviously, every open set of X is CK∗-open, and every CK∗-open set is CK- open. It is shown in [12, Lemma 2.9] that a subset of a Hausdorff space is CK-open if and only if it is CK∗-open. The next example shows that a CK-open set of a T1 space need not to be CK∗-open.
Example 4.3 Let (N, τcof ) be the set N of all positive integers equipped with the co-finite topology τcof . Then (N, τcof ) is not well-filtered. However, for any x ∈ N, any open neighborhood U of x and filtered family of compact subsets {Ki}i∈I ,

i∈I
Ki = {x}⊆ U implies that there exists i0 ∈ I such that Ki0
⊆ U .

Definition 4.4 ( [12]) i) A topological space (X, τ ) is called CK-filter defined if
τCK = τ .
ii) A topological space (X, τ ) is called CK∗-filter defined if τCK∗ = τ .
Definition 4.5 ( [12]) A space X is a k-space (or, compactly generated space) if a subset U of X is open if and only if for any compact set K, U ∩ K is open in the subspace K. Equivalently, a subset B is closed if and only if for any compact set K, B ∩ K is closed in the subspace K.
Lemma 4.6 ( [12, Theorem 2.4]) Every Hausdorff k-space is CK-ﬁlter deﬁned.
Xi and Zhao in [12] asked if Hausdorff CK-filter defined spaces are k-spaces. We now give a positive answer for more general case as follows.
Theorem 4.7 Every CK-ﬁlter deﬁned space is a k-space.
Proof. Let (X, τ ) be CK-filter defined. Assume U ⊆ X such that U ∩ K is open in
K for any compact set K ⊆ X. Let {Ki}i∈I be a filtered family of compact closed
sets such that	Ki = {x} ⊆ U . Then there is an i0 ∈ I such that Ki ⊆ Ki for
0
i ≥ i0. So, we assume that every Ki is contained in Ki0 . Then every Ki is a closed
subset of the compact space Ki . Suppose that Ki − U = Ki ∩ UC /= ∅ for all i ∈ I, then, as U ∩ Ki is open in Ki, Ki − U = Ki ∩ UC is closed in Ki. Hence, every
Ki − U is closed in Ki0 and {Ki | i ∈ I} satisfies the finite intersection property.

Now 

i∈I
(Ki − U )= 

i∈I
Ki − U = ∅, which contradicts that Ki0
is compact. So,

there exists an ij such that Ki∗ ⊆ U . Since (X, τ ) is CK-filter defined, U ∈ τCK = τ ,
and thus U is open in X. Therefore, X is a k-space.	2
By Theorem 4.7 and Lemma 4.6, we have the following result which gives a new characterization for Hausdorff k-spaces.
Corollary 4.8 A Hausdorff space is a k-space iff it is CK-ﬁlter deﬁned.

First countable spaces with bounded complete dcpo models are sober
It is well known that every sober space is well-filtered. But there exists a well- filtered T1 space which is non-sober. There are also dcpos whose Scott spaces are well-filtered but non-sober (see [6], [4, Example 2.6.1], [13]). There are even coherent well-filtered spaces which are non-sober.
We now show that if we add the first countability, then coherence and well- filteredness imply sobriety. Using this result we deduce that if a first countable T1 space has a bounded complete dcpo model, then it is sober.
Lemma 5.1 Let X be a coherent and ﬁrst countable space. Then X is well ﬁltered if and only if it is sober.
Proof. We only need to show that X is sober if it is well-filtered. Suppose that
X is well-filtered. If X is not sober, there is an irreducible closed subset X˜ which

is not the closure of any single point. We consider Max(X˜), the set of maximal points of X˜ which is also irreducible, although it may not be closed.
Then for any x, y ∈ Max(X˜), there exist two countable neighborhood bases
{V i | i ∈ N} with V i+1 ⊆ V i and {V j | j ∈ N} with V i+1 ⊆ V i. Since Max(X˜)
is irreducible, V i ∩ V j ∩ Max(X˜) /= ∅ for any i, j ∈ N. For any i ∈ N, we take
a ∈ V i ∩V j ∩Max(X˜). By the choice of each a , each neighbourhood of x contains
all ai, except finite elements. Thus, {ai | i ∈ N} ∪ {x} is compact. Similarly,
{ai | i ∈ N}∪ {y} is also compact. By the coherence of X, we have {ai | i ∈ N} = ({ai | i ∈ N}∪ {x}) ∩ ({ai | i ∈ N}∪ {y}) is compact. Let
A0 = {ai | i ≥ 0,i ∈ N}, A1 = {ai | i ≥ 1,i ∈ N},
A2 = {ai | i ≥ 2,i ∈ N}, ··· , Ak = {ai | i ≥ k, i ∈ N}, ··· .
Note that Ak = ({ai | i ≥ k, i ∈ N}∪ {x}) ∩ ({ai | i ≥ k, i ∈ N}∪ {y}), we have
that Ak is compact by the coherence, while  ∞ Ak = ∅, which contradicts the
well-filteredness.	2
Remark 5.2 (1) The set R of all real numbers equipped with the co-countable topology is coherent (because only finite subsets are compact) and well-filtered, but it is non-sober.
(2) The set N of all positive integers equipped with the co-finite topology is first countable and coherent (in this case every subset is compact), but it is non-sober.
For any bounded complete dcpo P , the Scott space ΣP is coherent [4, Corollary 4.1.8] and well-filtered [8, Corollary 3.2]. It thus follows that the maximal point space Max(P ) is also coherent and well-filtered. So the above theorem implies the following result.
Corollary 5.3 If a ﬁrst countable space has a bounded complete dcpo model, then it is sober.
In [12, Corollary 2.14], it was proved that every Hausdorff k-space (particularly, every first countable Hausdorff space) has a bounded complete dcpo model. The above result indicates that the sobriety is a necessary condition for a first countable T1 space to have a bounded complete dcpo model.
However, we do not know the answer to the following problem.
Problem 1. If a k-space has a bounded complete dcpo model, must it be sober?
