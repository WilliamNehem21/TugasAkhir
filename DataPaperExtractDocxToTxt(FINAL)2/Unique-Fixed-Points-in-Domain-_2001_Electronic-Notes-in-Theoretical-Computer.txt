Abstract
We unveil new results based on measurement that guarantee the existence of unique fixed points which need not be maximal. In addition, we establish that least fixed points are always attractors in the µ topology, and then explore the consequences of these findings in analysis. In particular, an extension of the Banach fixed point theorem on compact metric spaces [3] is obtained.

Introduction
The standard fixed point theorem in domain theory states that a Scott con- tinuous map f : D → D on a dcpo D with least element ⊥ has a least fixed point given by
fix(f ) := . f n(⊥).
n≥0
This is perhaps the single most important result in domain theory, given its effectiveness in handling the semantics of recursion, and the fact that its reasoning extends naturally to the categorical level to explain why it is that equations like D  [D → D] may be solved.
It could be argued that one ofits faults is that it only applies to continuous mappings, since there are now more general fixed point theorems available [5]. However, within the context of continuous mappings, the only criticism that seems plausible is that its canonical fixed points are not as canonical as they could be. There is, after all, one thing more satisfying than a least fixed point: A unique fixed point.
Using ideas all originally introduced in [6], we establish that there are natural fixed point theorems in domain theory which guarantee the existence of unique, attractive fixed points. In the next three sections, we discuss domains, content and invariance. These are preliminary ideas needed later on. We then introduce contractions on domains and prove a fixed point theorem about them very reminiscent of the Banach theorem in analysis. In fact, this new result has the Banach theorem as one ofits consequences.

Finally, in the case of a domain with a least element, we learn that least fixed points are always attractive in the µ topology and that the results on contractions also hold for a larger and more natural class of nonexpansive mappings. Because of the latter, an improvement of the Banach fixed point theorem on compact metric spaces [3] can be obtained.

Background
A poset is a partially ordered set [1].
Definition 2.1 Let (P, ±) be a partially ordered set. The least element ⊥ of P satisfies ⊥ ± x for all x, when it exists. A nonempty subset S ⊆ P is directed if (∀x, y ∈ S)(∃z ∈ S) x, y ± z. The supremum of a subset S ⊆ P is the least of all its upper bounds provided it exists. This is written  S. A dcpo is a poset in which every directed subset has a supremum.
Definition 2.2 For a subset X ofa dcpo D, set
↑X := {y ∈ D : (∃x ∈ X) x ± y} & ↓X := {y ∈ D : (∃x ∈ X) y ± x}.
We write ↑ x = ↑ {x} and ↓ x = ↓ {x} for elements x ∈ X. The set of maximal elements in a dcpo D is max D = {x ∈ D : ↑ x = {x}}.
By Hausdorff maximality, every dcpo has at least one maximal element.
Definition 2.3 A subset U ofa dcpo D is Scott open if
U is an upper set: x ∈ U & x ± y ⇒ y ∈ U , and
U is inaccessible by directed suprema: For every directed S ⊆ D,
. S ∈ U ⇒ S ∩ U /= ∅.
The collection σD ofall Scott open sets on D is called the Scott topology.
Proposition 2.4 A map f : D → E between dcpo’s is Scott continuous iff
f is monotone: x ± y ⇒ f (x) ± f (y).
f preserves directed suprema: For every directed S ⊆ D,
f (. S)= . f (S).
Definition 2.5 In a dcpo (D, ±), a  x iff for all directed subsets S ⊆ D, x ± S ⇒ (∃s ∈ S) a ± s. We set ↓x = {a ∈ D : a  x}. A dcpo D is continuous if ↓x is directed with supremum x for all x ∈ D.
The sets ↑x = {y ∈ D : x  y} for x ∈ D form a basis for the Scott topology on a continuous dcpo D. Finally, we adopt the following definition of‘domain’ in this paper.
Definition 2.6 A domain is a continuous dcpo D such that for all x, y ∈ D, there is z ∈ D with z ± x, y.


For example, a continuous dcpo with least element ⊥ is a domain in the present sense.

Content
The ideas in this and the next section are covered in embarassing detail in [6]. Let [0, ∞)∗ be the domain ofnonnegative reals ordered as x ± y ⇔ y ≤ x.
Definition 3.1 A Scott continuous map µ : D → [0, ∞)∗ on a continuous dcpo D induces the Scott topology near X ⊆ D if for all x ∈ X and all sequences xn  x,
lim µxn = µx ⇒	xn = x,
n→∞
and this supremum is directed. We write this as µ → σX.
That is, ifwe observe that a sequence (xn) ofapproximations calculates x, it actually does calculate x. The map µ measures the information content of the objects in X. For this reason, we sometimes say that µ measures X.
Definition 3.2 A measurement is a Scott continuous map µ : D → [0, ∞)∗ that measures the set ker µ = {x ∈ D : µx = 0}.
The nature ofthe idea is that information imparted to us by a measurement about the environment may be taken as true. Here is an illustration of this principle.
Proposition 3.3 Let µ : D → [0, ∞) be a measurement with µ → σD. Then
For all x ∈ D, µx =0 ⇒ x ∈ max D.
For all x, y ∈ D, x ± y & µx = µy ⇒ x = y.
A monotone map f : D → D is Scott continuous iff µf : D → [0, ∞)∗ is Scott continuous.
One of the first motivations for measurement was the desire to prove useful fixed point theorems. Generally speaking, ‘useful’ means theorems which are easy to apply to nonmonotonic mappings, or results which say more about monotonic maps than the Scott fixed point theorem. Here is the first example ever found of the latter type [6].
Theorem 3.4 Let f : D → D be a monotone map on a domain D with a measurement µ for which there is a constant c < 1 such that
(∀x) µf (x) ≤ c · µx.
If there is a point x ∈ D with x ± f (x), then
x٨ = . f n(x) ∈ max D
n≥0


is the unique ﬁxed point of f on D. Furthermore, x٨ is an attractor in two different senses:
For all x ∈ ker µ, f n(x) → x٨ in the Scott topology on ker µ, and
For all x ± x٨,	n≥0 f n(x) = x٨, and this supremum is a limit in the Scott topology on D.
The only problem with this theorem is that it requires fixed points maxi- mal. Very shortly we will uncover some new results that overcome this diffi- culty in what appears to be a more elegant approach.

Invariance
All ways ofmeasuring a domain appeal to a common objective.
Definition 4.1 The µ topology on a continuous dcpo D has as a basis all sets ofthe form ↑x ∩ ↓y,for x, y ∈ D. It is denoted µD.
One unsatisfying aspect of the Scott topology is its weak notion of limit. Ideally, one would hope that any sequence with a limit in the Scott topology had a supremum. But this is far from true. For instance, on a continuous dcpo with least element ⊥, all sequences converge to ⊥.
Lemma 4.2 (Martin [6]) Let D be a continuous dcpo. Then
A sequence (xn) converges to a point x in the µ topology iff it converges to x in the Scott topology and (∃n) xk ± x, for all k ≥ n.
If xn → x in the µ topology, then there is a least integer n such that
. xk = x.
k≥n
If (xn) is a sequence with xn ± x, then xn → x in the µ topology iff
xn → x in the Scott topology.
In a phrase, µ limits are the Scott limits with computational significance.
Proposition 4.3 A monotone map f : D → E between continuous dcpo’s is
µ continuous iff it is Scott continuous.
So what does all this have to do with information content? Given a mea- surement µ → σD, consider the elements ε-close to x ∈ D, for ε > 0, given by
µε(x) := {y ∈ D : y ± x & |µx − µy| < ε}.
Regardless ofthe measurement we use, these sets are always a basis for the µ
topology. In fact, it is this property which deﬁnes content on a domain.
Theorem 4.4 (Martin [6]) For a Scott continuous map µ : D → [0, ∞)∗,
µ → σD iff {µε(x): x ∈ D & ε > 0} is a basis for the µ topology on D.

This realization not only improves our understanding ofthe µ topology, it also allows us to make more effective use ofmeasurement.
Lemma 4.5 Let (D, µ) be a continuous dcpo with a measurement µ → σD.
If (xn) is a sequence with xn ± x, then

xn → x in the µ topology iff lim
n→∞
µxn = µx.

A monotone map f : D → D is Scott continuous iff µf : D → [0, ∞)∗ is
µ continuous.
Notice that the Scott topology can always be recovered from the µ topology as σD = {↑ U : U ∈ µD}.

Fixed points of contractions
In this section, (D, µ) isa domain with a measurement µ → σD.
Definition 5.1 Let f be a monotone selfmap on (D, µ). If there exists a constant c such that
x ± y ⇒ µf (x) − µf (y) ≤ c · (µx − µy),
for all x, y ∈ D, then f is a contraction if c < 1 and nonexpansive if c ≤ 1.
Proposition 5.2 A contraction is Scott continuous.
Proof. First, µf is µ continuous. By Theorem 4.4, the µ topology on D is first countable, and so we can work with sequences in verifying this assertion. Let xn → x in the µ topology on D. Then we can assume xn ± x. Hence
0 ≤ µf (xn) − µf (x) ≤ c · (µxn − µx)
which means
lim µf (xn)= µf (x)
n→∞
since µxn → µx. Then µf is µ continuous. By Lemma 4.5(ii), f is Scott continuous.	✷
The last proposition does not require a contraction: The same proofworks for any value of c ≥ 0. It is our next result that requires c < 1.
Theorem 5.3 Let f be a contraction on (D, µ). If there is a point x ± f (x), then
fix(f ) := . f n(x)
n≥0
is the unique ﬁxed point of f on D.
Proof. By Prop. 5.2, f is Scott continuous, so it is clear that fix(f ) isa fixed point of f .

Let x = f (x) and y = f (y) be two fixed points of f . By our assumption on D, there is an element z ∈ D with z ± x, y. Then
f n(z) ± x = f n(x),
for all n ≥ 1. By induction, we have
µf n(z) − µf n(x)= µf n(z) − µx ≤ cn · (µz − µx),
for all n ≥ 1. Then µf n(z) → µx and so
. f n(z)= x
n≥0
since µ → σD. But the same argument applies to y.	✷
In fact, careful inspection of the proof of the last theorem shows that the unique fixed point is an attractor in the µ topology.
Definition 5.4 A fixed point p = f (p) ofa continuous map f : X → X on a space X is called an attractor ifthere is an open set U around p such that
f n(x) → p
for all x ∈ U. We also refer to p as attractive.
Examples of attractive fixed points are easy to find: In the analysis of hyperbolic iterated function systems, where they are sometimes called frac- tals, or in the study of iterative methods in numerical analysis like Newton’s method, where they arise as the solutions to nonlinear equations.
Corollary 5.5 Let f be a contraction on (D, µ). If a ± fix(f ), then
. f n(a)= fix(f ),
n≥0
and this supremum is a limit in the µ topology. That is, fix(f ) is an attractor in the µ topology.
Proof. The claim is implicitly established in the previous theorem. For the attractor bit, let U = ↓fix(f ). This is a lower set and hence µ open.	✷
Thus, beginning with any approximation a of fix(f ), the iterates f n(a) converge to fix(f ), even if a /± f (a). In addition, we can obtain a good estimate ofhow many iterations are required to achieve an ε-approximation offix(f ).
Proposition 5.6 Let f be a contraction on (D, µ) with unique ﬁxed point
fix(f ). Then for any x ± fix(f ) and ε > 0,

log(µx − µ fix(f )) − log ε
n > 
log(1/c)
for any integer n ≥ 0, provided x /= fix(f ).
⇒ |µf n(x) − µ fix(f )| < ε,

Proof. If c = 0, then f is constant, and the statement holds trivially, adopting the convention that log(1/0) = log ∞ = ∞. Let 0 < c < 1.


For an integer n ≥ 0, we have
|µf n(x) − µ fix(f )| = µf n(x) − µ fix(f ) ≤ cn · (µx − µ fix(f )).
Thus,
log(µx − µ fix(f )) − log ε
n >	⇒ cn · (µx − µ fix(f )) < ε,
log(1/c)
which proves the claim.	✷
Of course, for the estimate to be useful we must know the measure of fix(f ). One case when this is easy to calculate is if µf (x) ≤ c · µx. Then µ fix(f )= 0. Surprisingly, this condition amounts to saying that f is the extension to D of a continuous map on ker µ.
Proposition 5.7 For a contraction f on (D, µ) with ker µ = max D, the following are equivalent:
The map f preserves maximal elements.
For all x ∈ D, µf (x) ≤ c · µx. In either case, fix(f ) ∈ max D.
Proof. Let f have contraction constant c.
(i) ⇒ (ii): Let x ∈ D. By the directed completeness of D, there is an element y ∈ ↑x ∩ max D. Then
µf (x) − µf (y)= µf (x) ≤ c · (µx − µy)= c · µx which holds since µf (y)=0 by (i).
(ii) ⇒ (i): Let x ∈ max D. Then µx =0 so 0 ≤ µf (x) ≤ c · µx = 0. Thus,
f (x) ∈ ker µ = max D.	✷
In fact, every contraction on a complete metric space can be represented as a contraction on a domain ofthe type above.
Example 5.8 Let f : X → X be a contraction on a complete metric space
X with Lipschitz constant c < 1. The mapping f : X → X extends to a monotone map f¯ : BX → BX on the formal ball model BX [2] given by
f¯(x, r)= (fx, c · r),
which satisfies
πf¯(x, r) − πf¯(y, s)= c · π(x, r) − c · π(y, s)= c · (π(x, r) − π(y, s)),
where π : BX → [0, ∞)∗, π(x, r) = r, is the standard measurement on BX. Now choose r so that (x, r) ± f¯(x, r). By Theorem 5.3, f¯ has a unique fixed point which implies that f does too.
Thus, Theorem 5.3 has the Banach fixed point theorem as a consequence. A constant mapping taking any value off the top is a contraction with a unique fixed point that is not maximal, and hence not of the sort mentioned in Prop. 5.7. We will see a more substantial example later on.

Fixed points of nonexpansive maps
We begin with a fundamental result on a well-known theme.
Theorem 6.1 Let f : D → D be a Scott continuous map on a continuous dcpo D with least element ⊥. Then its least ﬁxed point is an attractor in the µ topology: For all x ± fix(f ),
. f n(x)= fix(f ),
n≥0
and this supremum is a limit in the µ topology.
Proof. By monotonicity, we have
f n(⊥) ± f n(x) ± fix(f ),
for all n ≥ 0. Then since f n(⊥) → fix(f ) in the µ topology, f n(x) → fix(f ) in the µ topology.	✷
Proposition 6.2 Let f be a monotone map on (D, µ) with least element ⊥
and measurement µ → σD such that
x ± y ⇒ µf (x) − µf (y) < µx − µy,
for all distinct pairs x, y ∈ D. Then
fix(f ) := . f n(⊥)
n≥0
is the unique ﬁxed point of f on D.
Proof. The map f is nonexpansive and hence Scott continuous by the remark following Prop. 5.2. Thus, fix(f ) is its least fixed point.
If x is any fixed point of f , then fix(f ) ± x. Ifthese two are different, then µ fix(f ) − µx = µf (fix(f )) − µf (x) < µ fix(f ) − µx. Then they are the same. This proves that fix(f ) is the only fixed point of f .	✷
If the map in the last result preserved max D = ker µ, it would satisfy µf (x) < µx, for µx > 0. Happily, for maps like these, we can prove the last result assuming only a measurement.
Theorem 6.3 Let (D, µ) be a continuous dcpo with measurement µ and least element ⊥. If f : D → D is a Scott continuous map with µf (x) < µx for µx > 0, then
fix(f ) := . f n(⊥) ∈ max D
n≥0
is the unique ﬁxed point of f on D. In addition, if f (ker µ) ⊆ ker µ, then
(∀x ∈ ker µ) f n(x) → fix(f ),
in the relative Scott topology on ker µ.
Proof. If µ fix(f ) > 0, then µ fix(f )= µf (fix(f )) < µ fix(f ). Hence µ fix(f )= 0 which means fix(f ) ∈ ker µ ⊆ max D. But if a least fixed point is maximal, it must be unique.

To see that fix(f ) is an attractor in the relative Scott topology on ker µ, let U ⊆ D be a Scott open set around fix(f ). Then there is K such that
n ≥ K ⇒ f n(⊥) ∈ U

which means

n ≥ K ⇒ f n(x) ∈ U ∩ ker µ

since f n(⊥) ± f n(x) and f (ker µ) ⊆ ker µ. Hence, f n(x) → fix(f ) in the relative Scott topology on ker µ, for any initial guess x ∈ ker µ.	✷
This is the same result as Theorem 3.4 extended to a larger class ofmap- pings on domains with least elements. In addition, in each of the last two results, Theorem 6.1 implies fix(f ) is an attractor in the µ topology on D. Now for why all this matters.
Applications
Time to be sixteen again. Let f : [0, π/2] → [0, π/2] be f (x) = sin x. As is well-known, beginning with any point x ∈ [0, π/2] and successively applying f yields a sequence ofiterates (f n(x)) that magically tends to zero. Why?
At first glance, one thinks of the Banach theorem, which explains that contractions behave this way. Upon closer inspection, however, we see that things are more interesting in the case of the sine wave. Because f '(0) = 1, f (x) = sin x is not a contraction on [0, π/2], and so the Banach theorem is not applicable. But domain theory is.
Example 7.1 Let D = [0, π/2]∗ be the domain with
x ± y ⇔ y ≤ x
and natural measurement µx = x.
The function f (x)= sin x is a monotone selfmap on D. By the mean value theorem, if x ± y and x /= y, there is c ∈ (y, x) such that
µf (x) − µf (y)= f (x) − f (y)= f '(c)(x − y)= (cos c)(µx − µy).
Hence, µf (x) − µf (y) < µx − µy, since 0 < cos c < 1.
Then Theorem 6.2 implies that f has a unique fixed point, given by
fix(f )= . f n(π/2).
n≥0
However, f (0) = 0, so we must have fix(f ) = 0, by uniqueness.
Now the interesting part. By Theorem 6.1, fix(f ) is an attractor in the µ topology. Thus, for any x ± fix(f ), f n(x) → fix(f ) in the µ topology. But convergence in the µ topology on D implies convergence in the euclidean topology. Thus, for all x ∈ [0, π/2], f n(x) → 0.
In fact, the reasoning in the last example extends to any compact metric space, since they can all be modeled [4] as the kernel ofa measurement.

Proposition 7.2 ([3]) Let f : X → X be a function on a compact metric space (X, d) such that
d(fx, fy) < d(x, y)
for all x, y ∈ X with x /= y. Then f has a unique ﬁxed point x∗ such that for all x ∈ X, f n(x) → x∗.
Proof. Let UX be the domain of nonempty compact subsets of X ordered under reverse inclusion. The map f has a Scott continuous extension to UX given by f¯ : UX → UX :: K '→f (K).
The domain UX has a natural measurement, µx = diam x, the diameter mapping derived from the metric d. In addition, the space X can be recovered as ker µ = {{x} : x ∈ X} = max UX  X in the relative Scott topology.
For µx > 0, either µf¯(x)=0 < µx, or the compactness of x yields distinct
points a, b ∈ x such that
µf¯(x)= d(fa, fb) < d(a, b) ≤ µx.
The result now follows from Theorem 6.3.	✷
That is, the Banach fixed point theorem holds on compact metric spaces under weaker assumptions. The impressive aspect ofthe last result is not the uniqueness of x∗: It is that x∗ is a global attractor.
Corollary 7.3 Let f : [a, b] → [a, b] be a continuous map on a nonempty compact interval. If |f '(x)| < 1 for all x ∈ (a, b), then f has a unique ﬁxed point x∗ ∈ [a, b] such that f n(x) → x∗, for all x ∈ [a, b].
Proof. By the mean value theorem,
|f (b) − f (a)| = |f '(c)||b − a| < |b − a|
for some c ∈ (a, b). Now Prop. 7.2 applies.	✷
The map f (x)= sin x satisifes 0 < f '(x) < 1 on (0, π/2), but as we have already seen, it is not a contraction. Thus, Theorem 6.3 yields another insight into why the sine wave behaves the way it does. But the reader should not be misled into thinking that these ideas are only applicable to domain theoretic fragments of classical mathematics.
Example 7.4 Let D = [N → N⊥] be the domain of partial functions on the naturals. The elements of D are measured as

µf = Σ
f(n)=⊥
 1  2n+1 .

Then ker µ = {f ∈ D : dom(f ) = N} is the set of total functions. Now consider the operator φ : D → D given by
φ(f )(n)= , n	if n =0 or n = 1;
, n + f (n − 2)/ cos(nπ/2) otherwise.


Because φ(f )(n) = ⊥ ⇒ f (n − 2) = ⊥ or (n > 1 and odd), we are able to write for elements f ± g that

µφ(f ) − µφ(g)=	Σ
f(n−2)=⊥
 1  −
2n+1
g(n−2)=⊥
 1  2n+1

= Σ
f(n)=⊥
1
 1  −
2n+3
g(n)=⊥
 1  2n+3

=  (µf − µg).
4
By Theorem 5.3, φ has a unique fixed point. Clearly this fixed point is not
maximal: It is undefined on the set {2k +1 : k > 1}.
Ideas
It would be nice to see a metric based approach to semantics replaced with one based on results like Theorem 5.3. Especially on a model ofCSP. Trying to obtain estimates in the spirit ofProp. 5.6 for nonexpansive maps also seems like a fun question. It would be neat to find out if the informatic derivative [6] (derivative of a map on a domain with respect to a measurement) can be useful in this regard.
