Abstract
This article presents a novel Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN) model to estimate the behavior of sediment strata formation in continental margins resulting from interaction between sea level, sediment input and subsidence over the last 130 million years. The model result is a set of probabilities that can be compared with geological facts and hypothesis; thus, we can point out possible discrepancies from other similar works and also improve the chance of a good estimation of past geological events.
Keywords: Performance Evaluation, Analytical Modeling, Stochastic Automata Networks


Indroduction
The present study describes a novel application of Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN) [1,2,3] to model a specific type of geological phenomenon. This is a chal- lenging subject, provided that most of the natural phenomena depend on a great number of factors to explain their evolution. Due to such a large number of natural variables, one of the most important steps in the modeling activity is the selection, discretization and grouping of the most significant variables to the phenomenon considered.

This study shows a first attempt to represent the evolution of a sedimentary basin using the SAN formalism. Pelotas basin, located in southernmost Brazil (Figure 1), was the basin chosen to attend this purpose. Considerable amounts of information are available for this marginal basin, including stratigraphic architec- ture (Figure 2), changes in sediment yield, and subsidence. Most of the information from Pelotas basin used in this paper is extracted from Contreras et al. [4].

This article is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the necessary background

on the geological phenomena, favouring the model comprehension; Section 3 con- cisely describes the SAN formalism; Section 4 is dedicated to describing the proposed SAN model for Pelotas basin; Section 5 presents the experiment conducted and the results achieved; and Section 6 is dedicated to discuss the model and confront the results with the expected from geological standpoint.

Geology Background
Sedimentary basins constitute large accumulations of sediments. The amounts and types of sediments depend on factors such as climate and relief, and for this reason, sedimentary basins constitute essential records of the climatic and tectonic history of the Earth.
The study of sedimentary basins is primarily based on drilling and seismic sur- veys, which provide information on the composition and arrangement of sedimentary rock strata. The configuration of strata results from the interplay between sediment supply and relative base level changes, which defines the accommodation space for those sediments. In marginal sedimentary basins, i.e., basins along a continental margin, the base level is determined by the relative sea level, which, in turn de- pends on the global (eustatic) sea level changes and on the vertical movement of the underlying crust (Figure 3). Crustal movement can be either upwards (uplift ) or downwards (subsidence).
Four genetic types of deposit can be distinguished as a function of relative sea level changes, as summarized in Figure 4 (a). These are named forced regression (FR), lowstand normal regression (LNR), highstand normal regression (HNR), and transgression (T ). Forced regressions occur whenever relative sea level falls. During these events, sediments prograde seawards and the shoreline advances with down- stepping (Figure 4 (b)). Normal regressions occur whenever sea level is rising but sedimentation rate outpaces the rate of sea-level rise, avoiding shoreline retreat. Normal regressions may either occur during a relative sea level lowstand or high- stand. During lowstands, there is an acceleration of sea level rise and the rate of progradation decreases with time while the rate of vertical accretion (known as aggradation) increases with time (Figure 4 (c)). Conversely, as sea level decelerates at the end of a sea-level rise trend, there is a decrease in the rate of aggradation with time and an increase in progradation (Figure 4 (c)). Finally, transgressions occur when the rate of sea level rise is the highest and the sediment supply is not enough to compensate for it. During transgressions, the shoreline retreats as the sea advances over the continent and sediments accumulate progressively landwards, in a configuration known as retrogradation (Figure 4 (d)).
Clearly, the simplified model in Figure 4 does not represent the whole complexity of processes that may affect the configuration of sedimentary strata such as variable sediment supply and shelf gradient. Nevertheless, it emphasizes the dominant role of relative-sea level changes and provides a clear picture of the main processes and possible stratigraphic architectures.
Contreras et al. [4] estimated subsidence rates and sediment flux using numer-

ical modeling (Figure 5). These estimates were obtained considering the eustatic (global) sea level curve proposed by Hardenbol et al. [8] re-calibrated to a more recent geological timescale [9], as plotted in Figure 6. Higher order, i.e., higher frequency, sea-level changes were excluded from the analysis because of the lower resolution of the seismo-stratigraphic data (2nd order depositional units, 3-50 Ma), their less defined amplitudes and partly disputed eustatic origin [10].

Stochastic Automata Networks
When a stochastic process has many states its representation by an ordinary Markov chain may be confuse or difficult to handle. In such cases, the use of a structured formalism as, for instance, Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN) [1,3] may cope the problem.
A first step when using SAN as a modeling tool is to identify structures within the process. Each structure is treated as an automaton, composed of states and tran- sitions. Every single transition is ruled by one or more events, which are classified as local or synchronizing. A local event operates over only one automaton, chang- ing its state by triggering a transition without interfering on the other automata

The upper curve corre- sponds to base-level (sea-level changes) and the lower curve corresponds to the rate of sea-level change. The corresponding arrangement of strata for forced regression, normal regression (both lowstand and highstand) and transgression are depicted respectively in (b), (c), and (d). Adapted from [6,7].

of the network. A synchronizing event operates over n ≥ 2 automata, triggering n simultaneous transitions, one per automaton. Each event in a SAN model has an occurrence rate, which can be constant or a function of other automata current states. Also, for each possible transition of a same event there is a choice or routing probability. Again, the event routing probability can be constant or functional.
A SAN model is defined by its Markovian descriptor, a compact algebraic expres- sion composed of tensor operations over the matrices representing each automaton on the network. This compact representation of SAN enables memory savings, since storing some small matrices (of the order of each automaton) requires less memory usage than storing the infinitesimal generator itself. In addition, the tensor format of SAN enables the use of specialized algorithms [2,12,13,14] which are more efficient

than those used for solving large Markov chains.
For readers interested in further details on SAN, such as the formalism origin, im- provements, classical and generalized tensor algebra, besides the material already re- ferred, the following works are suggested [15,3,16]. Those interested in further mod- eling examples using SAN can find extensive material in [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24].
Example: Heads or Tails
Heads or Tails is a coin-tossing game with a series of known variations. The one presented here has one coin and one player. At each coin flip, the player must guess which side will come with the face up. The player wins whenever his expectation is confirmed, otherwise he loses.
Figure 7 presents a possible SAN model for this problem. It has two automata: one representing the player’s guess (automaton P ), which is either heads or tails; and the other representing a tossing engine (automaton C ), which is capable of tossing the coin and computing the outcome.
Automaton P has two states: “H ” and “T ”. Routing probabilities πPH and
πPT indicate the player guesses, being the probability of choosing heads and tails,

respectively. Automaton C has four states: “H ” and “T ”, indicating the actual result of the coin-tossing; “PW ” (player wins) for the case the result matches the player’s guess and “PL” (player loses) otherwise. The coin has probabilities πCH and πCT of coming with the heads or tails side up, respectively, as the toss result.
The coin-tossing and the player’s guess are simultaneous, represented by a syn- chronizing event, e, which triggers transitions leading to “H ” or “T ” in both au- tomata. Such event can only happen when each automaton is in condition to attend it, which means automaton C must be either in “PW ” or “P L”.
As soon as the synchronizing event e happens, it follows a verification of whether the player has won or lost the match. Depending on the result, either of the local events on automaton C is triggered: event “lW” leads to state “PW ” (player wins), while event “lL” leads to state “PL” (player loses).
SAN Model for the Pelotas Basin Strata Configura- tion
This section presents a SAN model developed for predicting the types of stratal stacking patterns expected for Pelotas Basin along the past 130 Ma.
As seen on Section 2, there are four types of deposit respectively associated to forced regression (FR), lowstand normal regression (LNR), highstand normal re- gression (HNR) and transgression (T ). The first one occurs whenever the relative sea level falls. The other three distinguish from one another by the relative con- tribution of relative sea level rise rate and sediment supply rate. Note that the relative sea level is a function of the global (eustatic) sea level and crustal vertical movement. In our study case, there is no uplift and all the vertical movement is downwards, i.e. subsidence.
In this scenario it is possible to identify four important measures as the starting point for modeling, corresponding to the variation rates of: (1) eustatic sea level (ESL); (2) subsidence (S ); (3) relative sea level (RSL); and (4) sediment supply (SS ). Each of these four measures corresponds to one automaton in Figure 8, whose states were conceived based on a cluster of values achieved by Contreras et al. [4]. This figure also presents one automaton for time tracking and four other automata for restricting the model behavior. The model complete description is given by Figure 8 together with Table 4 and Table 3, being the first table the one responsible for providing the automata semantics and the last for listing the events and their

rates.

and 127 Ma, which comprises a time interval of 3 Ma. The state C130 is followed by the state C127, such that the frequency associated to this transition is of one departure every 3 Ma, which corresponds to the rate of this event: e130,127 = 0.3333 (see Table 3). State C127 comprises the period between 127 Ma and 124 Ma, giving an event rate of e127,124 = 0.3333, coincidentially the same as before. State C124 comprises the period between 124 Ma and 118 Ma, with an event rate of e124,118 = 0.1667, that is, the state C124 is left in a proportion of one departure every 6 Ma.
Additionally, each event of time passage (events of automaton Chronos) triggers synchronous transitions on automata M (ESL), M (S), M (RSL) and M (SS). In order to favor clarity, the M automata have the transitions leaving the DM states labeled by groupings (first column of Table 3). For instance, label m(ESL) is used to refer to transitions in automaton ESL due to any of these events: e118,113, e91,90, e51,48, e17,15, rst.
At Table 3, event e130,127 is assigned to labels m(ESL), m(S), m(RSL), m(SS).
3	0	1	0
Looking for these labels in the M automata one comprehends that the transition
from C130 to C127 happens simultaneously to the transitions leading from DM to M3 in automaton M (ESL), leading back to DM in automaton M (S), to M1 in automaton M (RSL) and leading back to DM in automaton M (SS).
In this new configuration, after synchronous transitions in Chronos and the M automata have taken place, only two kinds of events are possible: the up and down events. These events are also synchronizing ones, such that transitions in automaton M (XYZ ) are accompanied by transitions in automaton XYZ (where XYZ refers to the automata ESL, S, RSL and SS ), in the sense that the up events lead to higher

rates 4 in the XYZ automaton, while the down events force the rate to low down. Although both kinds of events are predicted in the model, it is expected that only one per automaton is enabled at a moment. The functions enabling and disabling the up and down events are the fupx and fdownx functions (where x assumes an index

in the set x = {1, 2, 3, 4}), which depend only on the Chronos current state. Some tests were executed in order to choose a rate for the up and down events and, as observed, setting these events rate to arround 1000 fits better to the results expected from Contreras et al. [4]. The transitions only cease when every M automaton reach state DM, disabling the up and down events and enabling once again the next event synchronizing a transition in Chronos witha transition in each of the M automata. Event rst, a short for reset, is the only one in the whole model that synchro- nizes transitions between all the automata, restoring the model to its starting point
configuration, back in 130 Ma.

Experiment and Results
It is usual to conduct a modeling activity in order to obtain probability measures for some given reality. In this study, the measures of interest are obtained by means of integration functions, which are mathematical expressions for selecting the exact information to inspect.
Here, the integration functions represent the four types of deposit or configura- tion strata: T, FR, LNR and HNR, as discussed in Section 2. These types of deposit are strongly dependent on the relative sea level rate and the sediment supply rate, represented respectively by the automata RSL and SS (see Figure 8). Direct de-

pendencies on the eustatic (global) sea level and subsidence, automata ESL and S, respectively, are subtle but yet taken into account, since they bring more realism to the model.
All possible configurations previously described are combined in order to build one function per configuration strata per Chronos state. As an example to be generalized to other states of Chronos, Table 4 presents the integration functions built for state C130.
Table 4
Integration functions for the Pelotas Basin model, considering state C130.


Considering the distribution of configuration strata along the past 130 Ma ob- tained by this modeling activity, the goal of this experiment is to validate the model by comparing the achieved results with those presented by Contreras et al. [4]. Fur- thermore, the way this model was developed, it is possible to predict the probability of each type of deposit within the same Chronos state.
Then, summarizing, there are basically four different types of deposit, as dis- cussed in Section 2: forced regression (FR), lowstand normal regression (LNR), highstand normal regression (HNR) and transgression (T ). Table 5 confronts infor- mation on these stratal patterns obtained by Contreras et al. [4] with the results achieved by the SAN model for Pelotas Basin (see Figure 8, Table 4 and Table 3). Observing Table 5 in detail, the first three columns respectively present the time period in millions of years, the relative sea level rate and the sediment supply rate. The fourth column presents Contreras et al. [4] estimates based on the interpretation of the sedimentary record. Under the “probabilities” grouping are the columns displaying the probabilities obtained by solving the SAN model for Pelotas Basin. In order to ease the analysis, the last column in this table provides a quick summary on this experiment expectations. Signal † indicates a mismatch between the estimate and the result obtained by solving the model with the specified integration functions
(as an example, see Table 4); signal C indicates a match.
Important to mention that among the existing tools for solving SAN mod-

els [25,26], SAN Lite-Solver [27] was the one chosen for this research. The time required for solving the model presented in this paper (see Figure 8, Table 4 and Table 3) is not really significant, the order of a few seconds, being irrelevant for this paper analysis.

Discussion

This article presents a novel modeling case to represent specific geological phenom- ena. More precisely, this paper seeks for predicting generic types of stratal stacking patterns for Pelotas Basin. The major goal here is to illustrate a potentially use- ful and previously unknown prediction tool to estimate statistics about a natural phenomenon.
As seen in Table 5, the values obtained by the experiment (columns under the “probabilities” grouping) were relatively close to the Contreras et al. [4] classifica- tion. Ten out of the thirteen time intervals defined by Contreras matched exactly. The observed discrepancies were expected in the sense that this is a humble (but not least interesting) first attempt on using SAN modeling in a knowledge area as complex as geology, with too many factors to consider. These discrepancies are particularly interesting given that geological prediction approaches are usually based on a very different kind of research following punctual and restrictive analysis, such as drilling and seismic surveys, instead of a systematic approach brought by a stochastic modeling effort.
The three values that did not match may be explained by factors such as the granularity of the model compared with the timescale of the geological events con- sidered. In the case of the mismatch for the time period comprised between 56 and 52 Ma, when Contreras et al. attribute a FR and our model predicts a LNR, we see that for the immediately following time period (52-51 Ma) we do expect a FR with 99.96% confidence. Note that 1 Ma is the minor time slice that we consider. The discrepancy in the 5-0 Ma time slot seems similar, since the model prediction for the 6-5 Ma time slot is the HNR situation estimated by Contreras et al. [4]. However, our prediction is a clear LNR situation (100%). Therefore, it is our belief that a granularity issue is causing the discrepancy as for the 56-52 Ma case. The last mismatch was found in the 33-31 Ma time slot. In this case our model returns probabilities of nearly 20% for LNR and 80% for TR, even though Contreras’ pre- diction clearly state a LNR situation. Maybe this discrepancy is related to a lack of detail in the model, but a further geological study is necessary to analyze the reasons of this case.
We believe that this paper research is valuable not only by the subject itself, but also by the challenge it represents. It is always difficult to work in a multidisciplinary endeavor, where collaborators must learn how to communicate. Thus, the natural next step in this research is to refine this model, enriching with data from alternative literature allied to the knowledge obtained from this preliminary work.
Nevertheless, the proposed model represents a contribution by itself, since it offers unusual complex modeling primitives as the automata M (ESL), M (S), M (RSL), and M (SS) used to represent a memory notion to the changes in the automata ESL, S, RSL, and SS, respectively, according to the passage of time expressed in automaton Chronos.
Finally, this practical application of the SAN modeling brings up new opportu- nities to the Stochastic Modeling area. Perhaps one of the most notable benefits

of using stochastic modeling to depict a natural phenomenon is that statistics gen- erated can help against major human error factors that may arise with classical geological analysis. Anyway, this is our bet for continuing doing such multidisci- plinary research.
