Abstract A two-tier model is used in cellular networks to improve the Quality of Service (QoS), namely to reduce the blocking probability of new calls and the forced termination probability of ongoing calls. One tier, the microcells, is used for slow or stationary users, and the other, the mac- rocell, is used for high speed users. In Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) cellular systems, soft handoffs are supported, which provides ways for further QoS improvement. In this paper, we introduce such a way; namely, a channel borrowing scheme used in conjunction with a First- In-First-Out (FIFO) queue in the macrocell tier. A multidimensional Markov chain to model the resulting system is established, and an iterative technique to find the steady-state probability distri- bution is utilized. This distribution is then used to find the performance measures of interest: new call blocking probability, and forced termination probability.

Handoff is the mechanism of transferring an ongoing call from the current cell to the neighbor cell as the Mobile Station (MS) moves through the coverage area of the cellular network. There are two important performance indices used in designing cellular communication systems. The first index is the blocking probability of a new call, which is the probability that a new call is denied due to the unavailability of free channels. The second index is the forced termination probability of handoff call, which is the probability that an ongoing call is ended abruptly while a handoff attempt is being made, again due to the unavailability of free channels. Typically, customers prefer having their new calls denied to having their ongoing ones ended. Suppose that the speed of MSs in a given cell

can be estimated. Then calls emanating from them can be clas- sified into three types: high speed, low speed, and stationary [1]. Usually, call is considered high speed if the MS moves at 36 km/h or higher, low speed if the motion is lower than 36 km/h and greater than 0 km/h, and stationary if the MS does not move [2].
For highly populated areas, cells with smaller sizes are pref- erable to those of larger sizes, due to the frequency reuse advantage of smaller cells [3]. However, this causes more forced terminations for high speed calls. Therefore, two-tier [2,4] cellular networks are used as a feasible solution.
A two-tier cellular network consists of a tier of cells with smaller size called microcells overlaid by a tier of cells with lar- ger size called macrocells, with each macrocell covering N microcells, as shown in Fig. 1. In two-tier cellular networks, high speed calls are assigned to macrocells, whereas stationary and low speed calls are assigned to microcells.
Handoff between cells in a two-tier cellular network occurs in three cases. The first case is when a call moves from a micro- cell to a macrocell (overflow), whether the macrocell is cover- ing the microcell or a neighbor macrocell. The second case occurs when a call moves from a microcell to a microcell, whether in the same macrocell or not. The third case occurs when a call moves from a macrocell to a macrocell.
Stationary and low speed calls can be overflowed from a microcell to a macrocell in two cases:

When a call cannot find a free channel in a microcell.
When a call becomes high speed.

A two-tier cellular network can reduce the forced termina- tion probability by two methods. The first method, called guard channels [10], is to reserve channels in the cell, either macrocell or microcell, exclusively for handoff calls, and the remaining channels are shared among new calls and handoff calls. The second method, queueing handoff calls [11], places in a queue requests for handoff calls that find no free channels in the destination cell.
There are two types of handoff: hard, used in Frequency- Division Multiple-Access (FDMA) and Time-Division Multi- ple-Access (TDMA) systems, and soft, used in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems [2]. In hard handoff the con- nection to the current cell is broken, then a connection to the new cell is made. This is known as break-before-make [5], where a MS is connected to only one Base Station (BS) at any given time. In soft handoff, which is the subject of this paper, where all cells use the same frequency [6], it is possible to make a connection to the new BS before the connection to





Figure 2 E-group and F-group in the overlapping zone between two cells.



the current BS is broken. This is known as make-before-break. That is, a MS call can be connected to two or more BSs at a time. For simplicity, we assume that each MS making a hand- off call can connect to at most two BSs. It should be noted that a CDMA cell, either microcell or macrocell, is divided into two regions, Handoff Region (HR), and Non-Handoff Region (NHR). In a HR of a two-tier cellular CDMA network, one BS, which has a higher receiving power than another BS, is se- lected to demodulate the received signal. The selected BS is called the controlling BS, and the other BS is called the non- controlling BS.
Stationary calls in a HR are divided into two groups: E-group and F-group . Let Pr,A be the received power at BS A of a signal transmitted by a stationary MS call in handoff with cell A and B. Also, let Pr,B be the received power at BS B of a signal transmitted by the MS call (Fig. 2). Then the E-group and the F-group can be defined as follows:

If Pr,A > Pr,B, that is, if BS is the controlling BS of the call, the call is in the E-group of cell A and the F-group of cell B.
If Pr,A < Pr,B, that is, if BS B is the controlling BS of the call, the call is in the F-group of cell A and the E-group of cell B.

In this paper, a handoff scheme based on the mobility of calls in a two-tier cellular CDMA network is proposed. This scheme is called a channel-borrowing handoff scheme. In this scheme, if there is a handoff call incoming to a cell with no free channels, a channel is borrowed from a call in the F-group of that cell, which corresponds to channel-borrowing from a call in the E-group of the current cell, and the channel is borrowed from the noncontrolling BS. If there are no channels in the F- group of the destination cell, the incoming handoff call is placed into a queue.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de- scribes the related works previously published in the literature. In Section 3, the system model is described. Section 4 analyzes the proposed model using Markov chain and compute perfor- mance measures of interest, and numerical results and analysis

are presented in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6 we conclude the work and propose a future work.

The arrival process of stationary new calls in a microcell is assumed to be Poisson with rate k(1). The arrival rate k(1)  k(1)  of stationary new calls in the HR (NHR) of a

two methods, while they reduce the forced termination prob-
ability, increase the new call blocking probability. This trade- off is inevitable in single tier systems. In [12], a combined guard channels/queueing approach is proposed. But then again, a single-tier system is assumed, and hence users’ mobil- ity difference is not taken into account. In [13], a model is proposed for a two-tier cellular network is proposed whereby high and low speed calls are taken into account. In this mod- el a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue is used in one of the tiers to reduce the new call blocking probability and the forced

However, the forced termination probability in this model can be further reduced by applying such a tech- nique as channel-borrowing, and the present work does just

Thus, the new call blocking probability for high speed call is p(2), which is given by (36). The forced termination probability for high speed call is p(2) , which is given by (41). However, the new call blocking probability for low speed call pbn_l is given by

Numerical results

In this section, we calculate, plot, and discuss the performance measures of interest: new call blocking probability and forced termination probability. We assume that every macrocell covers N = 7 microcells. We also assume that the low and high speeds of the mobile user are 3.6 and 36 km/h, respectively. Also, we assume Cmacro = 4, Cﬃﬃﬃ macro = 5, Q = 3, 1 = 180 s,

Shun Model C and one for our work, in order to show the im- pact of using channel borrowing on the system performance.

Fig. 6 shows the forced termination probability pfh_l of low speed calls vs. new high speed call arrival rate, in both the pro- posed model and model C in Shun [2]. It can be seen that the forced termination probability in the proposed model is lower than that of the Shun model C by an average of 0.1%. This improvement is admittedly insignificant. The performance measures of high speed calls are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respec- tively, with the sum of stationary and low speed new call arri- val rates fixed at 0.04. The improvement due to the channel borrowing scheme of the proposed models is made clear by plotting the same measure for both the proposed model and that of Shun model C.
Fig. 7 shows that the new call blocking probability p(2) of
high speed calls in the proposed model lower than that in the Shun model C by an average of 9%. Similarly, Fig. 8 shows that the forced termination probability p(2) of high speed calls in the proposed model is lower than that in the Shun model C by an average of 26%. The improvement may not seem signif- icant, but in view of the fact that call blocking and forced ter- mination are highly undesired by mobile users, any amount of improvement is badly sought.
We can see that the improvement in performance due to the channel borrowing scheme is more in the case of high speed calls that low speed calls. This can be attributed to the fact that low speed calls make less handoffs than high speed calls and thus benefit less from the channel borrowing scheme introduced in the proposed model. Recall that low speed calls can operate both in macrocells and microcells. In the former case, they understandably need to handoff less often because they reach the border of the cell slowly. In the latter case, they reach the border of the cell quickly, but then they can be overflowed to a macrocell, avoiding many future handoffs.

Conclusions and future work

In this paper, we consider CDMA cellular networks of two tiers, where users with different mobility behaviors are assigned to the proper tier. Namely, high speed users are always assigned to the higher tier (macrocells), even if the speed decreases during the call to the low level. By contrast, low speed users are initially assigned to the lower tier (micro- cells), but if during their movement they reach the edge of the current (micro)cell and fail to get handed over to the neigh- bor (micro)cell, they then are assigned to the current higher tier (macrocell). For such networks a channel borrowing handoff scheme aiming at improving the quality of service without deteriorating the throughput of the system is proposed. To analyze the performance of the scheme, The system is modeled as a Markov chain, and utilize an iterative method to find the steady-state probability distribution. For validation and com- parison purposes, numerical results have been obtained for both an example system using our scheme and an identical sys- tem not using the scheme. The results show that the scheme re- duces the blocking probability of low speed calls by an average of 12%, and of high speed call by an average of 9%. On the other hand, the results shown that the scheme reduces the forced termination probability of low speed calls by an average of 0.1%, and of high speed calls by an average of 26%.
A two-tier CDMA cellular networks, utilizing the channel- borrowing handoff scheme without any queue in both micro-
cell and macrocell is currently under investigation. Also, a two-tier CDMA cellular networks can be presented, utilizing the channel-borrowing handoff scheme with a FIFO queue in both macrocell and microcell.
