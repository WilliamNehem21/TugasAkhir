Adjustable robust optimization allows for some variables to depend upon the uncertain data after its realization. However, the uncertainty is often not revealed exactly. Incorporating inexactness of the revealed data in the construction of ellipsoidal uncertainty sets, we present an exact second-order cone program reformulation for robust linear optimization problems with inexact data and quadratically adjustable variables. This is achieved by establishing a generalization of the celebrated S-lemma for a separable quadratic inequality system with at most one non-homogeneous function. It allows us to reformulate the resulting separable quadratic constraints over an intersection of two ellipsoids in terms of second-order cone constraints. We illustrate our results via numerical experiments on adjustable robust lot-sizing problems with demand uncertainty, showing improvements over corresponding problems with aﬃnely adjustable variables as well as with exactly revealed data.





Introduction

Adjustable robust optimization (ARO) has proved to be a powerful deterministic methodology to handle dynamic decision-making prob- lems, where the decision-maker is able to adjust her strategy to in- formation revealed in stages (see Ben-Tal et al., 2009; Delage and Iancu, 2015). It allows for some decision variables to depend upon the uncertain data after realization. However, in many applications, the uncertainty is not revealed exactly, due to, for example, measure- ment error. The construction of uncertainty sets,that incorporates in-
dynamic decision-making problems of medicine and health sciences, such as the two-stage robust optimization models with time-dependent uncertainty sets that appear in radiation therapy planning problems (Nohadani and Roy, 2017). Here, inexactly revealed data can be incor- porated in the construction of the uncertainty sets, because a patient’s condition or health care needs can change during the course of a treat- ment (Eikelder et al., 2019; Nohadani and Roy, 2017), but estimates of their condition can be taken and considered mid-treatment.
In this paper, we consider the two-stage robust linear optimization problem with adjustable variables and inexactly revealed data:

exactness of revealed data, has been shown to give high quality so- lutions for practical dynamic decision-making problems. For example,
(𝐼𝑃 )	min

de Ruiter et al. (2017) demonstrated that for the multi-stage inventory production problem, ignoring inexactness of revealed demand can lead to violation of the robust constraints in up to 80% of simulations.

where 𝑐 ∈ ℝ𝑛, 𝐵 ∈ ℝ𝑝×𝑠,

Such a scheme has recently been developed for the case when the
adjustable decisions take on an Aﬃne Decision Rule (ADR), and the

Applications of the methods have included multi-stage-inventory prob- lems (Ben-Tal et al., 2009), planning and scheduling problems (Ning and You, 2017) and treatment-length optimization problems in radiation therapy (Eikelder et al., 2019). In particular, robust optimization tech- niques that employ inexactly revealed data are of great interest in

We then prove that the convex epigraphical set, which is hid- den in many known classes of fully homogeneous quadratic systems (Ben-Tal and Hertog, 2014; Dines, 1941; Polyak, 1998), is also hid- den in a separable quadratic inequality systems involving at most one non-homogeneous function.

appear in the reformulation of (𝐼𝑃 ). Consequently, we also deduce
a form of S-lemma for a simultaneously diagonalizable quadratic in-

We also note that suﬃcient conditions which guarantee epigraphi- cal convexity have been given for specially structured quadratic sys- tems, such as the ones that appear in extended trust-region problems (see Jeyakumar et al., 2009b; Jeyakumar and Li, 2013).

The quadratic decision rules, including a separable quadratic deci-
sion rule, were first introduced by Ben-Tal et al. (2009) and these rules were used to examine numerically tractable safe approximations to vari- ous classes of intractable adjustable robust optimization problems. They include classes of robust problems where an uncertainty set is allowed to be an intersection of ellipsoids. The interplay between the quadratic optimization and adjustable robust optimization in the case of quadratic decision rules was elegantly discussed in Bomze and Gabi (2021). These quadratic decision rules were also employed to study the links between copositive optimization and multi-stage robust optimization in Xu and Hanasusanto (2018). Recently, the parameterized separable quadratic rule (3) has been shown by the authors (Woolnough et al., 2021) to ad- mit exact second-order cone programming reformulations for adjustable robust linear optimization problems under single ellipsoidal uncertainty based on exact revealed data. More general nonlinear decision rules have also been examined for adjustable robust optimization problems in Ben-Tal et al. (2009) and Yanikoglu et al. (2019).

Generalized S-lemma

In this Section, we present generalizations of S-Lemma for systems involving more than two quadratic functions. We begin by fixing some
preliminaries. The notation ℝ𝑛 signifies the Euclidean space for each 𝑛 ∈
ℕ ∶= {1, 2, …} and 𝑆 𝑙 is the space of all real 𝑙 × 𝑙 symmetric matrices. As usual, the symbol 𝐼𝑛 stands for the identity (𝑛 × 𝑛) matrix, while ℝ+ ∶= [0, +∞) ⊂ ℝ. The inner product in ℝ𝑛 is defined by 𝑥, 𝑦 ∶= 𝑥𝑇 𝑦 for all
𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ ℝ𝑛. We use  𝑥  to denote the standard Euclidean norm of 𝑥. A
symmetric (𝑛 × 𝑛) matrix 𝐴 is said to be positive semi-definite, denoted by 𝐴 ⪰ 0, whenever 𝑥𝑇 𝐴𝑥 ≥ 0 for all 𝑥 ∈ ℝ𝑛. The notation 0𝑚×𝑛 denotes the matrix of all zeros of dimensions 𝑚 × 𝑛.
For 𝑧 ∈ ℝ𝑞 , consider the following quadratic functions:
𝑓 (𝑧) = 𝑧𝑇 𝑊 𝑧 + 𝑤𝑇 𝑧 + 𝛼 and 𝑔𝑖 (𝑧) = 𝑧𝑇 𝑊𝑖𝑧 + 𝑢𝑇 𝑧 + 𝛽𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑚,
where 𝑊 and 𝑊 are symmetric (𝑞 × 𝑞) matrices, 𝑤, 𝑢 ∈ ℝ𝑞 and 𝛼, 𝛽 ∈

reformulation of adjustable robust linear optimization with the pa- rameterized QDR and exact revealed data, called exact QDR, estab- lished by the authors recently in Woolnough et al. (2021) with the aid of S-lemma (Ben-Tal and Nemirovski, 2001), the present refor-
mulation for (𝐼𝑃 ) with the QDR and inexactly revealed data, called
inexact QDR, requires a generalization of S-lemma to handle uncer-
tainty sets involving the intersection of two ellipsoids and a non- convex and nonhomogeneous quadratic function. It is known that generalizations of S-lemma for non-convex quadratic systems involv- ing more than two quadratic functions are often not possible un- less the system enjoys some hidden convexity (see Example 2.1). For a survey of S-lemma and its generalizations, see Polik (2007), Jeyakumar et al. (2009a) and Derinkuyu and Pinar (2006).
(ii) Using the standard hyperplane separation arguments and the con- vexity of the associated epigraphical set, we first show that a general form of S-lemma holds for a non-homogeneous quadratic inequality
ℝ, 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑚. The epigraphical set 𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1, … , 𝑔𝑚 ) associated with the
functions 𝑓 and 𝑔1 , … , 𝑔𝑚 , is given by
𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1 , … , 𝑔𝑚 ) = {(𝑣1 , … , 𝑣𝑚 , 𝑟) ∶ 𝑣𝑖 ≥ 𝑔𝑖 (𝑧) and 𝑟 ≥ 𝑓 (𝑧)
for some 𝑧 ∈ ℝ𝑞 }.
Recall that the epigraphical set 𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1, … , 𝑔𝑚 ), which plays a key role later in establishing generalizations of the S-lemma for systems involv-

where 𝑣 = (𝑣1 , … , 𝑣𝑚 ) ∈ ℝ𝑚. The set 𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1 , … , 𝑔𝑚 ) is intrinsically re- lated to the epigraph of the optimal value function of (𝑄𝑃𝑣 ). In- deed, if the optimal value function of (𝑄𝑃𝑣 ) is 𝜙, that is, 𝜙(𝑣) =

whereas the case where 𝑚 = 2, and 𝑓, 𝑔1, 𝑔2 are homogeneous quadratic geneous quadratic functions is given in Dine’s theorem (Dines, 1941),
functions which satisfy a positive definite condition is given in Polyak’s convexity theorem (Polyak, 1998). An extension of Dine’s theorem may be found in Jeyakumar et al. (2009b).
In the case where 𝑓, 𝑔𝑖 are all homogeneous and the matrices
𝑊 , 𝑊1, … , 𝑊𝑚 are pairwise commutative (Polik, 2007) (for example,
when they are diagonal matrices), the joint range set reduces to a poly-
hedral set which is, in particular, convex.
On the other hand, if 𝑓, 𝑔𝑖 are nonhomogeneous quadratic func-
tions, then the epigraphical set, in general, is a nonconvex set. How-
ever, the convexity of the epigraphical set can be satisfied by many specially structured systems of non-homogeneous quadratic functions.
For instance, as shown in Jeyakumar and Li (2013), if 𝑓 (𝑧) = 𝑧𝑇 𝑊 𝑧 +
𝑤𝑇 𝑧 + 𝛼, 𝑔 (𝑧) = 𝑧 − 𝑧  2 − 𝛽 and 𝑔 (𝑧) = 𝑏𝑇 𝑧 − 𝛽 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑚 and if
𝑡 > 0. Thus, dividing by 𝑡 on both sides, we have 𝑓 (𝑧) +  𝑚  𝜆𝑘 𝑔𝑘 (𝑧) ≥
0 for all 𝑧 ∈ ℝ𝑞 , where 𝜆𝑘 = 𝜇𝑘 ∕𝑡. Then the statement (b) holds.  □
In passing observe that Lemma 2.1 includes the celebrated homo- geneous S-lemma and Farkas’ lemma for convex quadratic inequality
systems. Indeed, if 𝑓 and 𝑔1 are homogeneous quadratic functions, then
it is known by Dine’s theorem that the joint range 𝑅(𝑓, 𝑔1) is convex, and so, the epigraphical set 𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1) is also convex in this case. Thus, Lemma 2.1 reduces to the homogeneous S-lemma. Moreover, if 𝑓, 𝑔𝑖 ,
𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑚, are all convex quadratic functions, then clearly the epi-
graphical set 𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1, … , 𝑔𝑚 ) is also a convex set.
It is also worth noting that a robust separable quadratic inequality
over an intersection of ellipsoids of the form (2), that appears in the formulations of AROs with inexact data, requires a form of S-lemma for a separable quadratic inequality system involving both homogeneous and non-homogeneous functions with a total of at least three inequali- ties. Although the epigraphical convexity is known to be hidden in sev- eral structured quadratic inequality systems, the following simple one- dimensional example shows that the epigraphical convexity assumption (and also Lemma 2.1) may fail, in general, for a separable system of three inequalities with two non-homogeneous quadratic functions.

As we see later in this Section, the epigraphical convexity is also hid- den in certain systems of non-homogeneous separable quadratic func- tions. We first establish an abstract generalization of S-lemma under epigraphical convexity of a general non-homogeneous quadratic system.

𝑔1 (𝑧) ≤ 0, 𝑔2 (𝑧) ≤ 0 ⇒ 𝑧 ≤ −1 ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑧) = 𝑧2 − 𝑧 − 2 ≥ 0.
Lemma 2.1 fails because there does not exist 𝜆1, 𝜆2 ≥ 0 such that So, statement (a) of Lemma 2.1 holds, but statement (b) of
𝑓1 (𝑧) + 𝜆1 𝑔1 (𝑧) + 𝜆2 𝑔2 (𝑧) ≥ 0 for all 𝑧 ∈ ℝ.
To see this, suppose on the contrary that, for some 𝜆1 ≥ 0 and 𝜆2 ≥ 0,
𝑓1 (𝑧) + 𝜆1 𝑔1 (𝑧) + 𝜆2 𝑔2 (𝑧) = (1 − 𝜆2 )𝑧2 + (𝜆1 − 1)𝑧 + (𝜆2 − 2) ≥ 0
for all 𝑧 ∈ ℝ.
This gives us that 1 − 𝜆2 ≥ 0 and 𝜆2 − 2 ≥ 0, which is not possible.
Note  that  the  epigraphical  set  𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1 , 𝑔2 ) = {(𝑠1 , 𝑠2 , 𝑟) ∶ ∃ 𝑧 ∈

(−1, 0, 0) and 𝑦0 = (0, 1, −2). Then, 𝑥0 , 𝑦0 ∈ 𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1 , 𝑔2 ), because 𝑔1 (−1) =
−1, 𝑔2 (−1) = 0 and 𝑓 (−1) = 0; 𝑔1 (0) = 0, 𝑔2 (0) = 1 and 𝑓 (0) = −2. We now see that their mid point 1 (𝑥0 + 𝑦0 ) = (−1∕2, 1∕2, −1) ∉ 𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1 , 𝑔2 ). Oth- erwise, we have (−1∕2, 1∕2, −1) ∈ 𝑈 (𝑓, 𝑔1, 𝑔2), and so, there exists 𝑧 ∈ ℝ
such that
𝑧 ≤ −1∕2, 1 − 𝑧2 ≤ 1∕2 and 𝑧2 − 𝑧 − 2 ≤ −1.
The first two relations imply that 𝑧 ≤ − √2 . The last relation implies that

Then, from (a), int𝐶 ∩ 𝑈 = ∅ (Otherwise, there exists (𝛾1 , … , 𝛾𝑚 , 𝑟) ∈ 𝑈 with 𝛾𝑘 < 0 and 𝑟 < 0. This shows that there exists 𝑧 ∈ ℝ𝑞 such that 0 > 𝛾𝑘 ≥ 𝑔𝑘 (𝑧) and 0 > 𝑟 ≥ 𝑓 (𝑧).

Although this equivalence can be proved by verifying the convexity from the definition of a convex set, as done in many known cases (c.f Dines, 1941; Jeyakumar et al., 2009b; Jeyakumar and Li, 2018; Polik, 2007; Polyak, 1998), we give the details of the arguments here for the purpose of completeness.

Now, we show that the generalised S-lemma continues to hold for quadratic inequality system with a simultaneously diagonalizablity structure. The simultaneous diagonalizability property can be satisfied for quadratic systems that appear in several important quadratic opti- mization problems such as the classical trust region problems and some of their variants (Ben-Tal and Hertog, 2014; Jeyakumar and Li, 2018).

assume that 𝑑 = 𝑑̂ (here-on referred to as the “exact” approach).

Price of Robustness. We define the price of robustness 𝑃 𝑂𝑅 as the per-
solution (which is the optimal value 𝑐 produced by solving the problem centage difference between the realized cost achieved by the adjustable

that would be incurred in practice by utilizing the adjustable model, and likewise the optimal cost of the nominal problem is the lowest possi- ble cost achievable by having all uncertain information available before making any decisions.
Our definition of the price of robustness is equivalent to that em- ployed by Ben-Tal et al. (2004) in discussions of ADR solutions to multi- stage adjustable robust inventory production problems. We have chosen this definition due to its relevance to our experiments, as opposed to, for example, the definition provided by Bertsimas and Sim (2004) where it is defined as a trade-off between the probability of violating robust constraints and the effect on the resulting objective function, and only within the scope of Robust Optimization.
Our experiments consist of two parts:
Firstly, we compare the price of robustness of the two approaches by comparing their (realised) solutions to the nominal solution to
(LS0). For this case we choose 𝜃 = 1 for the exact approach, and both

experiment are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 1. We will not compare to the exact approach with an ADR, as this result has been examined in Woolnough et al. (2021).
Secondly, we compare the exact and inexact approaches (both 𝜃 = 1

that are infeasible for the problem. Also notice that the number of in-
feasible solutions increases as the network increases to a larger, more realistic size. This shows a clear advantage for real-world applications, which often contain varying degrees of uncertainty.

We first note that the QDR (both approaches) outperforms the ADR in all simulations, achieving a lower price of robustness. It can also be seen that the counterpart to infeasible solutions (see below, Infeasibil- ity Comparison) is a lower price of robustness, as would be expected. Interestingly, the infeasible solutions (also included in the below plots) never find a lower cost than the nominal solution (which is a possible

with deviation up to the estimation error.
Conclusion and outlook

We have shown that a second-order cone program reformulation holds for adjustable robust linear optimization problems with a param- eterized quadratic decision rule (QDR) and inexactly revealed data. We achieved this by first establishing a generalization of S-lemma which al- lowed us to transform the semi-infinite non-convex separable quadratic inequality constraint into a second-order cone constraint. We illustrated our results via numerical experiments on adjustable robust lot-sizing problems with demand uncertainty and showed that the inexactly re- vealed data approach with QDRs improves over the infeasibility of the exact QDR approach, whilst maintaining its better performance over an ADR approach in achieving a low price of robustness.
Our adjustable robust optimization approach with inexact data is likely to lead to applications in dynamic decision-making problems of medicine and health sciences, where the conventional static decisions that do not include adjustable (recourse) decisions are often practi- cally meaningless because a patient’s condition or health care needs can change during the course of a treatment (Eikelder et al., 2019; Nohadani and Roy, 2017), but estimates of their condition can be taken and con- sidered mid-treatment. In particular, our approach may be extended to two-stage robust optimization models with time-dependent uncertainty sets that appear in radiation therapy planning problems (Nohadani and Roy, 2017).
