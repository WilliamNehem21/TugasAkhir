The domain of differentiable functions

Abbas Edalat

Abstract
We construct a domain for differentiable real valued functions of a real variable. The classical C1 functions, equipped with its C1 norm, is embedded into the set of maximal elements of this domain, which is a countably based bounded complete continuous domain. The construction can be generalized to Ck functions and to real valued functions of several variables.
