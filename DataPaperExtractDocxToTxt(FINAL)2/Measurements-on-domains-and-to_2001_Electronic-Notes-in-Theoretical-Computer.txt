Measurements on domains and topology

G.M. Reed

Abstract
The concept of a measurement on a continuous partial order has been recently introduced by Keye Martin. Measurement provides a uniform degree of approximation for elements of the kernal, i.e., those elements with measure zero. Measurement also induces a Scott topology for elements “near” the kernal. The results beloware joint work with Keye Martin.
X is developable and T˙1 iff it is the kernel of a measurement on a continuous poset, X is developable T1 and choquet complete iff it is the kernal of a measurement on a continuous cpo.
For each developable T1-space X, there exists a developable T1-space M(X) with a poset order < such that (1) X is the kernal of a measurement. (2) the topology on M(X) is exactly the topology induced by the measurement. (3) If X is T˙2, then M(X) is a Moore space. (4) If X is a complete (or even semi-complete) Moore space then (M(X),<) is a cpo. (5) If X is the real line, then M(X) is a non-normal Moore space. (6) (MA + not CH) If X is a subspace of the real line and omega < card(X) < c, then M(X) is a normal nonmetrizable Moore space.
The countable ordinals with the order topology is the top of a Scott domain, and is a G˙delta set with respect to the Scott topology on the domain. [This answers several questions open questions in the area.]
Finally, we give a new recursion induction theorem for cpo’s using measurement theory.
