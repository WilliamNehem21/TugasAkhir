Abstract
Given a graph G and a vertex v ∈ G, the chromatic neighbourhood of v is the set of colours of v and its incident edges. An adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total colouring (AVDTC) of a graph G is a proper total colouring of G which every two adjacent vertices on G have different chromatic neighbourhood. It was conjectured in 2005 that the minimum number of colours that guarantees the existence of an AVDTC of a graph G with these colours, χ′′(G), is bounded from above by Δ(G) + 3 for any graph G. In this work we
prove the validity of this conjecture for hypercubes, lattice graphs and powers of cycles Ck when either (i) k = 2 and n ≥ 6, or (ii) n ≡ 0 (mod k + 1) through the construction of an explicit AVDTC which shows that χ′′(G)= Δ(G) + 2 for each of the preceding graph classes.
Keywords: Adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total colouring, adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total chromatic number, lattice graphs, hypercubes, powers of cycles.


Introduction
Given a graph G = (V, E), a total colouring of G is a colouring of vertices and edges of G which every two adjacent vertices of G have different colours, every two adjacent edges of G have different colours and every vertex has a colour different from the colours of its incident edges. A famous statement concerning total colourings is the Total Colouring Conjecture:

Conjecture 1.1 (TCC) Every simple graph G admits a total colouring using at least Δ(G)+1 and at most Δ(G)+2 colours.
The validity of the TCC is known for important classes of graphs, for instance bipartite graphs and most planar graphs. A particular kind of total colourings is the adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total colourings. This class of colourings was introduced by Zhang, Chen, Li, Yao, Lu and Wang in 2005 (see [9]) motivated by the adjacent-vertex-distinguishing proper edge colourings presented in [10] and the vertex-distinguishing proper edge colourings studied by Burris and Schelp in 1997, by Bazgan in 1999, and by Balister, Bolloba´s and Schelp in 2002 (see [1,2] and [3]). In order to explain the notion of an adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total colour- ing, we introduce the concept of chromatic neighbourhood of a vertex v, which is the set of colours assigned to v and all its incident edges. An adjacent-vertex- distinguishing total colouring (AVDTC) of a graph G is a total colouring of G which satisfies the property that every two adjacent vertices have different chro- matic neighbourhood. It is important to notice that if two adjacent vertices have different degrees, their chromatic neighbourhood are different for any total colour- ing. In this context, regular graphs are the most difficult graphs to be coloured with an AVDTC. A natural question to ask is what is the minimal number of colours that guarantees the existence of an AVDTC on G with these colours. The answer to this question is the adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total chromatic number χjj(G).
Zhang-Chen-Li-Yao-Lu-Wang [9] stated the following conjecture:
Conjecture 1.2 (AVDTC Conjecture, [9]) For any simple connected graph G
with order at least 2, we have
χjj(G) ≤ Δ(G)+ 3,
where Δ(G) stands for the maximum degree among the vertices of G.
The idea of the AVDTC conjecture is that, assuming that the TCC is true, it should be expected that adding at most one colour, one could obtain an AVDTC for the same graph using some nice strategy such as recolouring arguments.
In 2007, Wang proved that the AVDTC Conjecture holds for graphs G with Δ(G) = 3 (see [8]). Chen showed in 2008 that χjj(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 2 for bipartite graphs using Konig’s Theorem without showing an AVDTC construction (see [11]). Four years later, Coker and Johannson used the probabilistic method to show that the ADVTC Conjecture is true up toa constant, that is, χjj(G) ≤ Δ(G)+ O(1) (see [5]). In 2014, Papaioannou and Raftopoulou described an algorithmic procedure to prove the AVDTC Conjecture for 4-regular graphs (see [7]). This result was extended by Lu, Li, Luo and Miao for graphs G with Δ(G) = 4. Their approach relied on the polynomial method (see [6]).
In this paper we prove that the AVDTC conjecture [9] holds for k-th powers of cycles of length n (Ck) when either k = 2 and n ≥ 6, or n ≡ 0 (mod k + 1), for square grid lattice graphs and for hypercubes in any dimension. For all these graphs, we show the exact value χjj(G) = Δ(G) + 2 by constructing an explicit

AVDTC with Δ(G) + 2 colours.
We organize the paper in the following way: in Section 2 we introduce some definitions and notation concerning adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total colourings and we state our results. Section 3 is reserved to the proof of Theorem 2.1, where we show that χjj(C2) = 6 for every n ≥ 6. We remark that Theorem 2.1 in an
a	n
improvement of the upper bound obtained using the result of [7]. In Section 4 we
prove Theorem 2.3 constructing an AVDTC with 2k +2 colours for k-th powers of cycles of length n when n ≡ 0 (mod k + 1), and finally, in Section 5, we prove Theorem 2.5 showing that the d-dimensional hypercube has its adjacent-vertex- distinguishing total chromatic number equal to d + 2 and that d-dimensional square grid lattices have their adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total chromatic number equal to 2d + 2. Finally, in Section 6, we present our conclusions.
Notation and results
Adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total colouring on graphs
Let V = V (G) be the set of vertices and E = E(G) the set of edges of a graph G = (V, E). We will say that the vertices v and w are adjacent whenever they have a common incident edge ev,w in E, and we will denote it by v ∼ w.
A total colouring of G is a function c : V ∪ E → N that satisfies the following properties:
c(v) /= c(w), ∀ v ∼ w (vertex colouring condition);
c(ev,w) /= c(ex,y), whenever {v, w}∩ {x, y} /= ∅ (edge colouring condition);
c(ev,w) /= c(x), ∀ x ∈ {v, w},
that is, adjacent vertices have different colours, so do adjacent edges, and every vertex is coloured differently of its incident edges. Now, given a graph G = (V, E), a colouring c : V ∪ E → N on G, and a vertex v ∈ V , we define the chromatic neighbourhood of v with respect to c as the set
C(v) := {m ∈ N; m = c(v) or m = c(ev,w) for some w ∼ v} . 3
We will say that the vertices v and w are distinguishable whenever their chro- matic neighbourhood differ by at least one colour, that is, C(v) /= C(w). Further- more, if a colouring c : V ∪ E → N has the property that all adjacent vertices are distinguishable, then we will say that the colouring c is an adjacent-vertex- distinguishing total colouring of G, which we abbreviate as AVDTC.
The adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total chromatic number χjj(G) of G is defined as the minimum number of colours such that there exists an AVDTC of G with these colours, that is,
χjj(G) := min n∃ c : V ∪ E → {0, 1,...,m − 1} ; c is an AVDTC on G,.
a	m∈N

3 Observe that the sets C(·) defined above depend on the chosen colouring c; We will not explicit this dependence in the notation.

Powers of cycles
Let Cn be the cycle of length n. We can associate the vertex set of Cn to the group Zn = Z/nZ = {0, 1,...,n − 1}. In this structure, x and y are adjacent if and only if x = y ± 1 (mod n). Analogously, we define the k-th power of the cycle Cn as the graph Ck with vertex set Zn and edges ex,y for x, y ∈ Z/nZ with x = y ± j (mod n)

for some j ∈ {1, 2,..., k} . Notice that Ck
is a 2k-regular graph, that is, every

vertex in Ck has exactly 2k adjacent vertices (or incident edges).

Hypercubes
As we have seen in this section, one can associate Cn to the graph whose vertex set is the group Zn = {0, 1,...,n − 1} with x and y adjacent if and only if |x − y| ≡ 1 mod n. We define the 1-dimensional hypercube H1 as the two-vertex path (which we call C2) seen under this modular structure and recursively, we define the d- dimensional hypercube Hd as the graph whose vertex set is given by Zd and with
x = (x1,..., xd) ∼ y = (y1,..., yd) if and only if Σd	|xi − yi| = 1. This structure
will be useful in Section 5 where we will see Hd+1 as the cartesian product of Hd
and H1. Notice that Hd is a d-regular graph.
Lattice graphs
In the same way that we have done so far, we will define the d-dimensional square
grid Ld as the graph whose vertex set is Zd and with x = (x1,..., xd) ∼ y =
(y1,..., yd) if and only if Σd	|xi − yi| = 1. The subgraph Gd of Ld induced by
the vertex set Zd ⊂ Zd is the d-dimensional box of length n. Notice that Ld is
2d-regular but Gd is not. In order to obtain a regular graph with the same vertex set, one can define x = (x1,..., xd) ∼ y = (y1,..., yd) if and only if there exists
i ∈ {1,..., d} such that xi = yi ± 1 (mod n) and xj = yj, ∀j /= i. The resulting graph Td is the d-dimensional torus of length n. The graphs Ld , Gd and Td defined
n	n	n
above are called lattice graphs.
Results
All our results prove the AVDTC conjecture for power of cycles when either k =2 and n ≥ 6, or n ≡ 0 (mod k + 1), square grid lattice graphs and hypercubes, without the help of K¨onig’s Theorem, i.e., we exhibit an explicit AVDTC using the nice arithmetic properties of the finite cyclic groups ZN .
Our first result says that, for n ≥ 6, AVDTC conjecture is true if we consider G
as the second power of a cycle of length n. Moreover, we give an explicit formula
to χjj C2 .
Theorem 2.1 For each n ≥ 6, we have
χjj C2  = 6.

Remark 2.2 With the group structure defined before for second power of cycles, we establish the orientation on the edges of G which for every edge ei,j, we have 0 ≤ i < j < n − 1 and j − i ≤ 2, except for the edges en—1,0, en—1,1 and en—2,0.
Our second result extends the validity of Conjecture 1.2 for arbitrary powers of cycles Ck provided n is multiple of k + 1.
Theorem 2.3 If n ≡ 0 (mod k + 1), then
χjj Ck = 2k + 2.
Remark 2.4 When n /≡ 0 (mod k + 1), the colouring used to prove Theorem 2.3 does not help us (see Section 4). In order to make it useful, we do some modifications on it. This strategy was first used by Campos and de Mello in [4], in the context of total colouring (and n even), where K¨onig’s Theorem plays an important role. However, this colouring is not an AVDTC. By a recolouring argument, we prove the AVDTC Conjecture for k-th powers of cycles of length n whenever n is even and, n ≡ k − 1 (mod k + 1) or n ≡ k (mod k + 1). The remaining cases are open.
Theorem 2.5 If d ≥ 1, k > 1 and G ∈  Hd, Ld , Gd , Td }, then

χjj(G)= Δ(G)+ 2.
Zhang-Chen-Li-Yao-Lu-Wang theorem for the second power of a cycle


Now we present a proof for Theorem 2.1. We consider G = C2
throughout the

section. By Lemma 1.1. in [9], we have that χjj
 C2
n
≥ 6. Therefore, it is enough

to find an AVDTC of C2 with 6 colours. Indeed, let r = r(n) be the unique element of Z3 such that n ≡ r (mod 3). For each r we will exhibit an AVDTC cr : V ∪ E that satisfies this requirement. Before defining the colourings cr, we introduce an auxiliary function f : Z6 × Z6 → Z6 ∪ {⊥} whose image can be seen in the entrances of the 6 × 6 matrix F given by

⎛ F0,0 F0,1 F0,2 F0,3 F0,4 F0,5 ⎞
⎜ F1,0 F1,1 F1,2 F1,3 F1,4 F1,5 ⎟
⎛ ⊥ 5 4 ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⎞
⎜ 2 ⊥ 3 ⊥ 2 ⊥ ⎟



⎜ F3,0 F3,1 F3,2 F3,3 F3,4 F3,5 ⎟
⎜ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⎟

⎜ F	F
F	F	F
F	⎟	⎜ 3 0 ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⎟

⎜⎝  4,0
4,1
4,2	4,3
4,4
4,5 ⎟⎠	⎜⎝	⎟⎠



In order to facilitate the notation, the lines and the columns of the matrix are labelled from 0 to 5. We define the function f : Z6 × Z6 → Z6 ∪ {⊥} by
f (i, j)= Fi,j.

Here, the reader may assume that elements of Z6 are colours and ⊥ is a 7-th colour. Given the function f above, it is straightforward to verify the validity of the following proposition.
Proposition 3.1 Consider f : Z6 × Z6 → Z6 ∪ {⊥} deﬁned above. The following properties hold:
If i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2} and f (i, j)= ⊥, then i = j.
If (i1, j1) /= (i2, j2) and f (i1, j1)= f (i2, j2) /= ⊥, then
{(i1, j1), (i2, j2)}∈ {{(1, 4), (1, 0)} , {(2, 4), (0, 1)} , {(4, 0), (1, 2)} , {(4, 1), (2, 1)}} .
f (i, j) ∈/ {i, j}.
If i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2}, then f (i, j) ∈/ {i + 3,j + 3}.
For each i, j ∈ Z6, we have f (i, 1) /=4 and f (1, j) /= 4.
Now, we define the AVDTC colourings cr : V ∪ E → Z6 ∪ {⊥} that will be used to colour C2. We start with r = 0. Define
c (x)= ⎧⎨ x (mod 3),	if x ∈ V ;
⎩ f (c0(i), c0(j)), if x = ei,j ∈ E.
Now for each l ∈ {0, 1}, we use cl to define cl+1 in the following way:
⎧ c0(x),	if x ∈ V and x ≤ n − 2;
c1(x)=	4,	if x ∈ V and x = n − 1;
⎪⎪⎩ f (c1(i), c1(j)),	if x = ei,j ∈ E.
⎧⎪ c1(x),	if x ∈ V and, x ≤ n − 6 or x = n − 1;
c (x)= ⎪⎨ 4,	if x ∈ V and x = n − 5;
− m,	if x ∈ V and x = n − m for 2 ≤ m ≤ 4;
⎪⎪⎩ f (c2(i), c2(j)),	if x = ei,j ∈ E.
Our next lemma says that, for any r ∈ Z3, the colour ⊥ does not belong to the image of cr.

Lemma 3.2 For any n ∈ N we have c—1
(⊥)= ∅.

Proof. By the definition of cr, cr(i) ∈ Z6 for any i ∈ V and any r ∈ Z3. Therefore, we just need to verify that no edge e ∈ E is coloured with ⊥. We start with the case r = 0. Suppose that there exists ei,j ∈ E such that c0(ei,j) = ⊥, that is, f (i (mod 3),j (mod 3)) = ⊥. Thus, by property (i) in Proposition 3.1, we have that i ≡ j (mod 3), that is, 3 divides j − i. Recalling Remark 2.2, we conclude that (i, j) can only belong to the set {(n − 2, 0), (n − 1, 0), (n − 1, 1)}, which is a contradiction since n ≡ 0 (mod 3). Therefore, c—1(⊥) = ∅. Moreover, by the validity of the lemma for r = 0 and the definition of c1, in order to prove it for

r = 1, it is enough to consider the edges en—3,n—1, en—2,n—1, en—1,0 and en—1,1, which follows by the definition of f . The case r = 2 is similar.	2
In Lemma 3.2, we proved that for any n ∈ N, cr(n) is a colouring that assumes 6 possible values. Now, we state another lemma, which says that cr is a total colouring of C2, and we finally prove Theorem 2.1, showing that cr is indeed an AVDTC of
C2.
Lemma 3.3 For any n ∈ N, the function cr(n) is a total colouring of C2.
Proof. By property (iii) in Proposition 3.1, we must only show that cr is a vertex colouring and an edge colouring of C2. Indeed, suppose that cr(i)= cr(j) for some i, j ∈ C2 incident to the edge ei,j. By definitions of cr and f , cr(ei,j) = ⊥, which contradicts Lemma 3.2. Therefore, cr is a vertex colouring of C2. Similarly, suppose that cr(ei,j) = cr(ei,m) for some i, j, m ∈ C2. By property (ii) in Proposition 3.1, cr(i) = 1 and, {cr(j), cr(m)} ⊂ {{0, 4} , {2, 4}}. Now, using the definition of cr for each case of r ∈ Z3, it is straightforward to verify that both of these colourings on the vertices cr(j) and cr(m) imply a contradiction. Hence, cr is an edge colouring of C2.	2
Proof of Theorem 2.1. For each vertex i ∈ {0, 1,.  ,n − 1} we define Cr(i) the
subset of colours that do not appear on i neither on its incident edges, that is,
Cr(i)= ⎧⎨m ∈ Z6; c—1({m}) /= {i}∪  {ei,j}⎫⎬
⎩	j∼i	⎭
Once again, we start with the case r = 0. Recall that c0 colours the vertices of C2 with exactly 3 colours, which are 0, 1 and 2. Look at the sub-matrix of F associated to the colours 0, 1 and 2. Since |C0(i)| =1 for every i ∈ {0, 1,...,n − 1}, property
(iv) in Proposition 3.1 implies that C0(i) = {c0(i)+ 3}. Thus, if C0(i) = C0(j), then c0(i)= c0(j), which contradicts Lemma 3.3. Therefore, c0 is an AVDTC of C2. Now suppose that r = 1 and recall the definition of c1. Notice that the colouring c1 colours the vertices of C2 with the colours 0, 1 and 2, except the vertex n − 1 which is coloured with the colour 4. The addition of this fourth colour creates the colours f (1, 4),f (2, 4),f (4, 0) and f (4, 1) on the edges of n − 1 instead of f (1, 0) and f (2, 1). Thus, we obtain
⎧⎪ {c1(i)+ 3} , if 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 3;
C (i)= ⎪⎨ {0} ,	if i = n − 2;
{1} ,	if i = n − 1;
⎪⎪⎩ {2} ,	if i = 0.

Therefore, if C1(i)= C1(j), then c1(i)= c1(j) and i, j ∈ {1, 2,...,n − 3} and once
again we obtain a contradiction to Lemma 3.3. Hence, c1 is an AVDTC (see Fig. 1 for an illustration). The case r = 2 is similar.	2

Extending the result to larger powers of cycles
In this section we prove Theorem 2.3. The proof relies in some ideas taken from [4]. Here we denote by G = (V, E) the graph Ck, in particular V = Zn. If n > 2k, we say that an edge of the form ex,x+t ∈ E, t ∈ [k] 4 , is even (resp. odd) if and only if t is even (resp. odd). Let GP (GI ) be the spanning sub-graph of G whose edge set EP (EI ) is formed by all the even (odd) edges of G. To each even edge ex,y, with even distance 2t between x and y in Zn, we associate its central vertex x + t (mod n). Analogously, to each odd edge ex,y, with odd distance 2t + 1 between x and y in Zn, we associate its central edge ex+t(mod n),x+t+1(mod n). As in the previous section, we use finite cyclic groups to colour the graph G. In order to do that we
will need disjoint copies Zj  := {0j,..., (N − 1)j} of the groups ZN = {0,...,N − 1}.
Proof of Theorem 2.3. We start the proof defining a vertex colouring of G. Define c : V → Zk+1 by c(x) := x (mod k + 1). Now, we extend c to the domain V ∪ EP by inducing, to each even edge, the colour of its central vertex. Now, we define the
edge colouring cj : E(Cn) → Zj	by c (ex,(x+1)(mod n)) := (c(x))j. Again, we extend
cj to the domain EI by inducing, to each odd edge, the colour of its central edge.
We claim that c ∪ cj is an AVDTC of G. It is clear, since n ≡ 0 (mod k + 1), that
c ∪ cj is a total colouring of G. Furthermore, we can easily check that
⎧⎨ x + k+1 (mod k + 1),	if k is odd;
C(x)= ⎩	k	 j

Therefore, C(x)= C(y) implies x = y and it completes the proof of the claim.
Since the colouring c∪cj used 2k +2 colours, we have shown that χjj(G) ≤ 2k +2, and as before, by Lemma 1.1. in [9], we conclude that χjj(G)= Δ(G)+ 2.

On the adjacent-vertex-distinguishing total chro- matic number of hypercubes and lattice graphs
In this section we prove Theorem 2.5. We divide the proof in two propositions:
Proposition 5.1 If d ≥ 1, k > 1 and G ∈  Ld , Gd , Td }, then χjj(G)= 2d + 2.
	n	2k	a

Proposition 5.2 If d ≥ 1, then χjj Hd  = d + 2.
By Lemma 1.1. in [9], we have that χjj(G) ≥ Δ(G) + 2 for every G ∈
d	d	d }	a
N for G with exactly Δ(G) + 2 colours.
The idea is to colour all the vertices of G with only two colours (it is possible since these graphs are bipartite) and see that the number of colours needed to colour the edges increases as fast as the dimension does. Since its argument is more delicate, we leave the case of hypercubes to the end of this section.
The argument to obtain an AVDTC for the graphs Ld , Gd , Td , d ≥ 1 and
n	2k
k > 1, is simpler:
Proof of Proposition 5.1.	Since the graphs Ld , Gd , Td	are bipartite, we
n	2k
can colour all its vertices with the colours {0, 1}.	Now, given the set Ei =
{ex,y ∈ E(G): xj = yj, ∀j /= i and yi = xi + 1}, for each i ∈ {1,..., d}, we define the sets


and
E1 = {ex,y ∈ Ei : xi is even }

E2 = {ex,y ∈ Ei : xi is odd } .

We colour the edges in E1 with the colour i+1 and the edges on E2 with the
i	i
colour d + i + 1. Since this resulting colouring is an AVDTC of G, Proposition 5.1
is proved. For a illustrative proof, see Fig. 2.	2cyan

Finally, we adapt the idea above to colour the hypercubes.
Proof of Proposition 5.2. The proof is by induction. We will show that for every d ≥ 1, there exists a total colouring cd : V (Hd) ∪ E(Hd) → Zd+2 of Hd with the following properties:
cd(v) ∈ {0, 1} for every v ∈ Hd and cd(v) /= cd(w) for every w ∼ v;
|cd (E(Hd))| = d, that is, cd(e)= d, ∀ e ∈ E(Hd);

Cd (x)= {1 − cd(x)}, for all x ∈ V (Hd).
Notice that properties (i) and (iii) imply that cd is an AVDTC of Hd.
Firstly, consider the 1-dimensional hypercube H1 whose vertex set is V (H1) = 
{0, 1} and edge set is E(H1)= {e0,1} with the colouring c1 : V (H1) ∪ E(H1) → Z3
given by
c (x)= ⎧⎨ x, if x ∈ V (H1),
⎩ 2,  if x ∈ E(H1).
Thus, c1 is an AVDTC of H1 with the required properties above. Now, suppose that there exists d ∈ N and an AVDTC cd : V (Hd) ∪ E(Hd) → Zd+2 of Hd satisfying the properties above. We will obtain an AVDTC cd+1 : V (Hd+1) ∪ E(Hd+1) → Zd+3 of Hd+1 that also satisfies those properties. Indeed, take m = 2d and recall that Hd+1 is the cartesian product of Hd and H1. Hence, if we consider a copy Hjd of Hd and

label the vertices of Hd and Hjd by {v1, v2,..., vm} and {vj , vj ,..., vj
}, respectively,

1	2	m
then Hd+1 is just the graph obtained from Hd+1 and Hjd+1 after joining each pair

of vertices vi and vj
with an edge ei, i ∈ {1,..., m}. Now we use the induction

hypothesis and we colour Hd with a colouring satisfying the required properties above and use the same colouring on Hjd changing the colours of the vertices in a way that the first property still holds on Hd+1, that is, if we call c the resulting colouring on V (Hd+1), then c(vj) = 1 − c(vi), for every i ∈ {1,..., m}. Now we define the colouring cd+1 on Hd+1 by
⎧ c (x),	if x ∈ V (Hd+1),
cd+1(x)=	c (x),	if x ∈ E(Hd) ∪ E(Hjd),
⎪⎪⎩ d + 2,	if x ∈ {e1,..., em} .
Notice that, by the definition of cd+1, the first two properties hold. Moreover, since the chromatic neighbourhood of each vertex gains only the colour d + 2 due to the addition of the edges {e1,..., em}, the third property also holds. Therefore, cd+1 is an AVDTC of Hd+1.
2
Remark 5.3 If one verifies carefully the proof of Proposition 5.2, they can see that, for every d ≥ 2, the colouring cd associates exactly 2d—1 elements of Hd (vertices or edges) to each of the d + 2 colours (see Fig. 3).





Conclusion
Fig. 3. An AVDTC of H3 with 5 colours.

In this work we prove the validity of the AVDTC conjecture [9] for hypercubes, lattice graphs and powers of cycles Ck when either (i) k = 2 and n ≥ 6, or (ii) n ≡ 0 (mod k + 1), by constructing an explicit AVDTC that yields χjj(G)= Δ(G)+ 2, for each of these graph classes. For the later cases (i) and (ii), we remark that this AVDTC also presents explicit total colourings for r = 0 of Theorem 10, and r = k − 1 or r = k of Theorem 16 of [4]. For the lattice graphs, the same idea that we used to colour square grids can be used to colour other lattices such as hexagonal and triangular grids.
