Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) is gaining importance in the present COVID-19 crisis. TMIS as a technology, offers patients a range of remote medical services, incorporated into Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). The patient’s medical report is confidentially transmitted over an open channel in TMIS environments. An attacker may attempt to compromise the security, such as forgery, replay, and impersonation attacks. To ensure secure communication, various authentication solutions have been introduced for TMIS. Biometrics and Elliptic Curve Cryptography-based mutual authentication protocol was recommended by Sahoo et al. (2020) and is proved to have some loopholes in the protocol. We discovered, however, Sahoo et al. method is unable to prevent privileged insider attacks and insider attacks along with patient anonymity. Jongseok Ryu et al. recommended a ECC based three-factor mutual authentication protocol and ensures patient’s confidentiality for TMIS with proof of informal analysis. They have also performed formal security studies utilizing the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA), the Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic and Real-Or-Random (ROR) model. However, we have reviewed the Jongseok Ryu et al.’s proposal. Based on his attacker model, we have examined that this scheme is unsafe against Message Substitution Attacks, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, Session Key Disclosure attacks, Privileged Insider attacks, and Stolen verifier attacks. we suggest a technique to be safe from the above security threats.





Introduction

People have developed an interest in utilizing remote services to limit social interaction with others in the recent COVID-19 issue. They avoid going to hospitals and medical centers for fear of spreading the virus to patients who may have the disease. Most of the population found it challenging to go to hospitals and medical centers because of their sensitive health or other circumstances. As a result, there is a growing need for utilizing medical resources online, such as diagnosing patient health online, prescribing medicines, and monitoring patients’ health using wearable devices. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is em- ployed for providing medical benefits with the quick progress of inter- net and wireless communication technology. One of the technologies utilized in WBAN is the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS), which may deliver various medical services to patients in remote loca- tions through telecare servers [1,2]. TMIS is receiving greater attention in the COVID-19 situation than earlier in-person healthcare services. Pa- tients use wearable sensor devices in the TMIS environment to record their medical data, like heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure. Then, their medical report was sent to the registered mobile devices.
Patients can then send the medical data to telecare medical servers any- time. After receiving patient medical data, the telecare servers provide appropriate healthcare services with doctor’s suggestions available in remote access, such as medical monitoring, therapy, prescriptions, etc. Patients can use intelligent healthcare services, saving time and money. These advantages make TMIS more suitable for providing competent medical services than instead of the physical presence of patients in the recent COVID-19 circumstances. Despite having many benefits, as mentioned, TMIS has several security-related issues. The telecare server in TMIS is responsible for protecting patient privacy and medical data, including identities, passwords, and medical records available electron- ically. Only authorized patients should be given access to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of the patient data. Additionally, private pa- tients’ information is sent to the telecare medical server over a open channel, giving a chance for an attacker to carry out various attacks like man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and impersonation attacks. There- fore, key agreement techniques and secure mutual authentication are crucial challenges in TMIS contexts. To address TMIS security issues, numerous studies have recently been proposed [3,4]. An IoT-enabled device with mutual verification protocol for TMIS was designed by

Sahoo et al. [3]. Sahoo et al.’s technique uses biometric data, Ellip- tic Curve Cryptography, and symmetric key cryptosystem to secure the patient’s confidential data. They asserted that their proposed protocol could survive various security attacks such as oﬄine password guessing attacks, replay attacks, and smartcard Stolen attacks. We scrutinized that their proposed protocol is compromised with privileged insider attacks and insider attacks. In line, we investigated that their scheme is defenseless for patient anonymity and a password updating process. This research recommends a robust mutual authentication protocol with three-factor authentication for TMIS that uses a patient’s mobile com- munication device.

Research contribution

In this article, we have reviewed Jongseok Ryu’s authentication scheme for Telecare Medical Information System. We then demonstrated that Ryu’s proposal is vulnerable to Message substitution attacks, Man- in-the-middle attacks, Session Key Disclosure attacks, and privileged in- sider attacks described in Section 5 by performing the cryptanalysis on Ryu’s authentication scheme. We also proposed suggestions for improv- ing the protocol, which prevents the attacks mentioned above.

Related works

In the recent trend, numerous authentication methods were pro- posed for TMIS environments [2,5–9]. Using a smartcard for two-factor- based authentication and TMIS was proposed by Khan and Kumari
[10] in 2013. They claimed their system is safe from oﬄine password prediction attacks, replay attacks, and stolen verifier attacks. Their plan is defenseless to an oﬄine password guessing attack. To enhance Khan and Kumari’s system, Giri et al. [11] recommended a user authentica- tion scheme appertaining to RSA in 2014. Giri et al. asserted that their proposal defends numerous threats like guessing oﬄine password at- tacks, insider attacks, and replay attacks by performing informal secu- rity. Giri et al.’s technique is suffering from privileged insider attacks and guessing oﬄine passwords found by Amin and Biswas [12] in 2015. Later, they offered an enhanced RSA-based authentication method and AVISPA to have high security. However, Sutrala et al. [13] found that Amin and Biswas’s proposal failed to control oﬄine password guessing attacks, impersonation attacks and replay attacks. Later, they suggested an RSA-based verification scheme and key agreement scheme.
Authenticated key agreement approach in TMIS, utilizing ECC, was suggested by Zhang and Zhu [14] in 2015 and offers greater security having a minor key size compared to Asymmetric key cryptography like RSA. Zhang and Zhu claimed their safety against oﬄine and MITM pass- word guessing assault. According to Liu et al. [15], Zhang and Zhu’s pro- tocol cannot resist guessing oﬄine password attacks, including attacks using smartcards thefts. An ECC-based authentication technique was also presented in 2018 by Ostad-Sharif et al. [16]. Their system contains security weaknesses like key compromise impersonation and password guessing attacks, although being more effective than RSA [17]. These techniques [10–12,18–21] depend on the following factors like pass- word and smartcard, by which it is challenging to perform attacks using stolen smartcards or oﬄine password guessing attacks. Researchers rec- ommended a three-factor authentication technique to address the issues in the TMIS environment with two-factor authentication [3,22,23]. Lu et al. [22] in 2015, recommended an authentication protocol with a biometric technique for the TMIS architecture. They claimed their pro- posal is safe against multiple security assaults, like replay attacks and oﬄine password guessing attacks. Their proposal, however, is prone to impersonation attacks and oﬄine password guessing attacks [24]. In 2016, Ravanbakhsh and Nazari [25] proposed a session key agreement technique with an enhanced mutual authentication for TMIS. Unfortu- nately, Ostad-Sharif et al. [26] shows that Ravanbakhsh and Nazari’s method cannot guarantee forward secrecy and cannot defend against known session-specific temporary information attacks. Then, in 2018,
Qi and Chen [27] recommended mutual authentication technique adopt- ing biometrics features and Elliptic Curve Cryptography for TMIS. They proved that their proposal offers mutual authentication by employing BAN logic. However, there are security weaknesses in the Qi and Chen approach, like key compromise impersonation attacks along with oﬄine password guessing attacks [28]. Consequently, Lu et al. [22], Ravan- bakhsh and Nazari [25], Qi and Chen [27] continue to be unsuitable for TMIS situations. In 2019, Zeng et al. [29] exhibited an anonymous user authentication (E-AUA) proposal for both users and servers in a multiserver environment. In 2020, Shoban Mandal et al. [30] scruti- nized that Zeng et al.’s proposal is suffering from lost/stolen smart gate- way, oﬄine Password guessing assault involving a privileged insider at- tack and has proposed Certificateless-Signcryption-Based Three-Factor User Access Control Scheme, resistant to assaults mentioned above. In 2019, Shuai et al.’s protocol [31] presented a protected three-factor authentication protocol for online patient monitoring. In 2020 Jiaqing Mo et al. [32] scrutinized that Shuai et al.’s proposal is prone to of- fline dictionary guessing attacks and privileged insider attacks by per- forming the cryptanalysis. In addition, they also pointed out a flaw in their design, part of their proposal results password update phase and proposed countermeasures for the enhancement of Two verifica- tion Schemes for Healthcare Systems. Using Wireless Medical Sensor Networks, we can prevent all possible attacks. Fotouhi et al. [33] in 2020, proposed a secured scheme having perfect forward security, un- traceability, and resilience against numerous attacks, is secure against a variety of known attacks required for WBANs. The suggested tech- nique is resistant to known session-specific temporary information at- tacks as well as key compromise impersonation attempts. Taleb et al.
[34] in 2021, presented a analysis between leading wireless technologies
with proposed wireless technologies oriented for medical applications. Jiliang Li et al. [35] in 2021, to avail complete public channels in IoMT, introduced the provably secure and lightweight MAAKA (PSL-MAAKA) protocol. The hash operation and XOR operation are the main oper- ations in the verification stage and key agreement. This article uses the random oracle model to demonstrate the security of the protocol that is being given. In 2020, Xiong Li et al. [35] have proposed a strat- egy that offers user privacy and guards against sensor node imperson- ation attacks. Later, Muhammad Asad Saleem et al. [36] claimed that their scheme fails to prevent sensor node impersonation attacks and fails to provide user anonymity. Muhammad proposed a suitable so- lution for the problem mentioned above. In 2021, authors [37,38] pro- posed a robust anonymous verification and key agreement proposal with privacy-preserving for smart cities. In 2022, Tanveer et al. [5], proposed REAS-TMIS claiming that this protocol is resistant to all possible attacks. Madan et al. [39] has scrutinized the Tanveer et al.’s protocol and found that it is suffering from session key disclosure attacks, privileged insider attacks, and medical server impersonation attacks. Madan et al. has rec- ommended a mechanism to overcome the above mentioned attacks. In 2022, Many Authors, including Prateek et al. [40–45] recommended V2I authentication in vehicular ad-hoc networks, suggested implement- ing the Privacy-Preserving verification Protocol for Quantum Comput- ing. Using message authentication codes, several message authentica- tion proposals are also created in VANETs. The quantum cryptosystem [46,47], which combines quantum ciphering and conventional encryp- tion, utilizing laws of physics and quantum mechanics for safe trans- mission of data between the involved entities. A quantum key exchange or distribution technique [48,49] does not rely on the computationally diﬃcult behaviour of some mathematical problem. A subset of the enor- mously popular developing concept of IoT is called the Internet of Ve- hicles (IoV). In order to transform a vehicle into a smart vehicle, an extended vehicular adhoc network (VANET) is used, by giving them a on board unit (OBU), enabling them to communicate with other vehi- cles, Humans (customers or pedestrians), technology (internet, cloud, parking lots, traﬃc signals, etc.). Through messages or beacons, the ve- hicles can directly or indirectly communicate with each other over wire- less open channels. Open channels during communication allow for a

variety of attacks, including replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, fabrication, etc. To overcome these attacks, Bagga et al. [50] developed a novel remote access management system to address security concerns in smart transportation. Later, keeping in view the needs of smart de- vices in terms of storage cost, Yan et al. [51] designed a update protocol to optimize the storage cost to constant. Sahoo et al. [3] developed a three-factor authentication scheme for the TMIS environment in 2020 to solve security issues comparable to existing techniques. Their tech- nique proved resistant to insider attacks, oﬄine password guessing, and attacks using stolen smart cards. We scrutinized Sahoo et al.’s solution and found it defenseless against privileged insider attacks and insider attacks. Additionally, we discovered a weakness in the password update stage and cannot guarantee patient privacy. So, utilizing biometrics and ECC, we suggest a robust mutual authentication system for TMIS secu- rity. In Table 1, we exhibit the analysis of existing works to highlight the features and Limitations.

Brief review of Jongseok Ryu et al. scheme

We exhibit a review of Jongseok Ryu et al.’s [6] proposal. This pro- tocol executes different phases like the initialization phase, patient reg- istration phase, telecare server registration phase, login phase, authen- tication phase, and password update phase. The notations used in this article are summarized in Table 2.

Initialization section

In the initialization section, 𝑅𝐶 chooses an elliptic curve 𝐸𝑝(𝑟, 𝑠), a plane curve over a finite field 𝐹𝑝. Following that, a base point P is considered on 𝐸𝑝(𝑟, 𝑠) and also a private key 𝑘𝑟𝑐 is selected by RC. The following 𝐸𝑝(𝑟, 𝑠), 𝑃 , ℎ(∙), ℎ𝑏(∙) are the parameters which are then pub- lished by 𝑅𝐶.

Later, User 𝑈𝑖 calculates 𝐻𝐼𝐷𝑖 = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑖  ∥ 𝑅𝑁𝑢), 𝐻𝑃 𝑊𝑖  = ℎ(𝑃 𝑊𝑖  ∥ ℎ𝑏(𝐵𝐼𝑖)), and 𝐺𝑃 𝑊𝑖  = (𝐻𝑃𝑊𝑖  ⊕ 𝑅𝑁𝑢) and transfers the (𝐻𝐼𝐷𝑖, 𝐺𝑃 𝑊𝑖) message to Registration Center through a secured communication path. Registration Center calculates 𝑈𝑅𝑖 = ℎ(𝐻𝐼𝐷𝑖 ∥ 𝑘𝑟𝑐 ) and 𝐵𝑖 = 𝑈𝑅𝑖 ⊕ 𝐺𝑃 𝑊𝑖. Afterwards, Registration Center safely keeps 𝐻𝐼𝐷𝑖 in the RC server and transfers 𝐵𝑖 to User 𝑈𝑖. User
𝑈𝑖 calculates 𝑅𝑃 𝑊𝑖 = ℎ(𝐼𝐷𝑖 ∥ 𝑃 𝑊𝑖 ∥ ℎ𝑏(𝐵𝐼𝑖)), 𝐴1 = 𝑅𝑁𝑢 ⊕ 𝑅𝑃 𝑊𝑖, 𝐴2 =
ℎ(𝐻𝐼𝐷𝑖  ∥ 𝐻𝑃 𝑊𝑖  ∥ 𝑅𝑃 𝑊𝑖  ∥ 𝑅𝑁𝑢), and 𝐴3  = 𝐵𝑖 ⊕ 𝑅𝑁𝑢  = 𝑈𝑅𝑖 ⊕ 𝐻𝑃𝑊𝑖. Later, these computed entities (𝐴1, 𝐴2, 𝐴3) are stored by 𝑈𝑖 into the memory of mobile device 𝑀𝐷𝑖.

Telecare medical server registration
To provide medical facilities to the users 𝑈𝑖, 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 should get reg- istered in RC. As part of registration, 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 chooses 𝑆𝐼𝐷𝑗 , an identity and 𝑅𝑁𝑠𝑗 , a random number. Later, 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 computes the pseudo-identity
𝑃 𝑆𝐼𝐷 = 𝑆𝐼𝐷 ⊕ 𝑅𝑁  and transfers 𝑃 𝑆𝐼𝐷 , 𝑅𝑁  to Registration Cen-

𝑆𝐼𝐷𝑗 = 𝑃 𝑆𝐼𝐷𝑗 ⊕ 𝑅𝑁𝑠𝑗  and keeps 𝑆𝐼𝐷𝑗  to RC database. Later, Reg- istration Center extracts 𝐻𝐼𝐷𝑖 from its database and calculates 𝑘𝑠𝑗 = ℎ(𝑆𝐼𝐷𝑗 ∥ 𝑘𝑟𝑐 ), 𝑝𝑘𝑠𝑗 = 𝑘𝑠𝑗 ∙ 𝑃 , 𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖 = ℎ(𝐻𝐼𝐷𝑖 ∥ 𝑝𝑘𝑠𝑗 ), 𝑈𝑅𝑖 = ℎ(𝐻𝐼𝐷𝑖 ∥

lic to all and transfers the parameters (𝑘𝑠𝑗 , 𝑇 𝐼𝐷𝑖, 𝑉𝑖𝑗 ) to 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 . 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 is de-



fined 𝑘𝑠𝑗 as a private key. Later, 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 computes 𝑆 𝑉𝑖𝑗 = 𝑉𝑖𝑗 ⊕ ℎ(𝑆𝐼𝐷𝑗 ∥

The Authentication between 𝑈𝑖 and 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 is performed by 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 , utilizing the following procedure. 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 checks the condition whether Δ𝑇 ≥ |𝑇 ∗ − 𝑇1 |. If the time is valid, 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 computes 𝑆2 = 𝑘𝑠𝑗 ∙ 𝑆1 and
𝑇 𝐼 𝐷𝑖 = ℎ(𝐻 𝐼 𝐷𝑖 ∥ 𝑝𝑘𝑠𝑗 ) = 𝑃 𝐼𝐷𝑖 ⊕ ℎ(𝑃 𝑆𝐼𝐷𝑗 ∥ 𝑆2 ). Thereafter, 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 re-

Adversary model

To perform security protocol analysis, we apply the “Dolev-Yao (DY) model” [56] in this research work. According to the DY model, an at- tacker can use an insecure channel to intercept, change, and delete the transmitted message. Below is a definition of an Attacker’s capabilities.
An Attacker may use forgery, impersonation, MITM Attack, etc. [57].

We take into account the “Canetti–Krawczyk (CK) model” [60], hav- ing a stronger hypothesis compared to the DY model. Using the CK ap- proach, an attacker can compromise sensitive information, including the secret session key, master key, and private key credentials.

Message substitution attack

Under the CK Model, the Attacker can get the private key 𝐾𝑟𝑐 of RC. User sends the message (𝑃 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑀𝑖, 𝑆1 , 𝑇1 ) to 𝑇 𝑆𝑗 through insecure channel. we assume that Attacker gets the message (𝑃 𝐼𝐷𝑖 , 𝑀𝑖, 𝑆1 , 𝑇1 )

Proposal for enhancement

In the Adversary Model” Canetti–Krawczyk (CK) model [60], there is a chance for the adversary to pull out sensitive information, includ- ing the secret session key, private key, master key credentials. From the attacker model, it is clearly understood that the intruder will try to ab- stract the credentials to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. If the attacker abstracts any clue related to credentials, the attacker can easily get the user credentials and create vulnerabilities by



accessing the Remote server. To prevent the attacker from abstracting the credentials, we employ the ECC based cryptosystem. In this cryp-
tosystem, ECC based point multiplication is used. From Sender 𝐴1, the
private key of sender (𝑃 𝑟𝐴 ) is point multiplied with the public key of the receiver (𝑃 𝑢𝐵 ), which results in generation of two coordinates (𝐴𝑥, 𝐴𝑦 )
on the other side of the receiver, resulting in (𝐵𝑥, 𝐵𝑦 ). If the verification with the help of a generator function. The same set of operations occur results on both sides as (𝐴1 = 𝐵1) and if the result has a matching, it
means that attacker is unable to guess the credentials and failed to per- form attacks. If there is a mismatch, it means that attacker has modified the data.
To witness this solution, we can follow the below steps:

Step 1: We consider the encryption from sender 𝐴1 with a private key of A as 𝐴1 = (𝑃 𝑟𝐴 ∙ 𝑃 𝑢𝐵 ) and this can be evaluated as 𝐴1 =
𝑃 𝑟𝐴 ∙ (𝑃 𝑟𝐵 ∙ 𝐺), which generates two coordinates (𝐴𝑥, 𝐴𝑦 ).
Step 2: We consider the encryption from receiver 𝐵1 with a private key of B as 𝐵1 = (𝑃 𝑟𝐵 ∙ 𝑃 𝑢𝐴 ) and this can be written as 𝐵1 = 𝑃 𝑟𝐵 ∙ (𝑃 𝑟𝐴 ∙ 𝐺), which generates two coordinates (𝐵𝑥, 𝐵𝑦 ).
sender(𝐴1) and receiver (𝐵1), then the verification should result Step 3: When the computations are evaluated correctly on both the in (𝐴1) = 𝐵1). And if there is a match, then it indicates that the
attacker is unable to guess the credentials required to perform the attacks.

rent protocol we can assume that 𝐴 = (𝑃 𝑟𝐴 ∙ 𝑃 𝑢𝐵 ), which generates two Note: By implementing the above-mentioned solution in the cur- points on the curve as (𝐴𝑥, 𝐴𝑦 ) and we get 𝑆1 = 𝑛1 ∙ 𝑝 and then based on this value we get 𝑀1 = ℎ(𝑈𝐼𝐷𝑖 ∥ 𝑆 ∗ ∥ 𝑉𝑖𝑗 ∥ 𝐴𝑥 ∥ 𝑇1 ). In 𝑀1 , If the attacker is unable to guess the exact value of 𝐴𝑥 , then there is no pos-
sibility for the attacker to compute the exact coordinates to perform an
attack, and the same thing is applicable on the receiver side as well.

Concluding remarks

In the current paper, we initially reviewed Jongseok Ryu et al.’s re- cently published Three Factor Mutual Authentication Protocol for TMIS based on ECC. Later, we have shown that their proposal is defenseless to session key disclosure attack, MITM attack, Message Substitution attack, stolen verifier attack and privileged insider attack which results in inse- curity to the application. In this paper, we have projected the loopholes by performing the cryptanalysis on the Jongseok Ryu et al. proposal, and we have also addressed the suggestions for the improvement of the protocol. We are proposing an authentication protocol to prevent the above mentioned security threats in the near future.
