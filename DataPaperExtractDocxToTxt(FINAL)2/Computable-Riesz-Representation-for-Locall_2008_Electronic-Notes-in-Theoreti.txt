Introduction
Measure and integration can be introduced in two ways: by starting either from a measure and introducing integration as a derived concept or from a “continuous” linear real valued operator, an abstract integral, on a space of functions and con- sidering measure as a derived concept [3,14]. Fundamental theorems relating these two approaches are, for example, the Daniell-Stone theorem [1] or various versions

of the Riesz representation theorem [6,4,3,15]. In this article we study the com- putational content of one of these theorems, the Riesz representation theorem for locally compact Hausdorff spaces [3]. For this purpose we use the representation approach (TTE), which has turned out to be particulary natural and flexible among the various models for studying computability in Analysis and related fields [21].
There are only few publications on computable measure theory in the framework of TTE [20,13,23,19,24,19,25,26,12,18]. In the following four cases the “dual” space is studied:
A computable version of the Daniell-Stone theorem, which characterizes a com- putable abstract integral on Stone vector lettices of functions f : X → R by a computable measure space, has been proved in [26].
A computable version of the Riesz representation theorem that characterizes the continuous functionals on C[0; 1] by functions of bounded variation has been proved in [12].
A computable version of the Riesz representation theorem for computable Hilbert spaces that characterizes the dual space of l2 by itself has been proved in [2].
In this article we prove a computable correspondence between the positive func- tionals on the space K(X) of the continuous functions with compact support on a computable Hausdorff space X and the Borel measures on X.
These four theorems differ by the structure considered on the basic set X: (i) a set X without structure, (ii) the real interval [0; 1], (iii) the natural numbers, (iv) a Hausdorff space. In all the cases the operators on the space of functions are in some sense continuous. Finally, the characterization is by means of (i) “computable measure spaces”, (ii) functions of bounded variation, (iii) the function space itself,
(iv) “computable Borel measures”. In (ii) instead of measures functions of bounded variation are considered for (Riemann-Stieltjes) integration. Functions of bounded variation correspond to real-valued measures (μ(I) can be negative). But neither such measures nor their relation to the functions of bounded variation have been studied in computable analysis. Computable Borel measures have been studied in [20,13,19,18]. But their relation to the computable measure spaces considered in [23,24,25,26] is not yet known.
In this article we prove a computable version of the following theorem [3,15].
Theorem 1.1 (Riesz representation) Let X be a locally compact σ-compact Hausdorff space. Then for every positive linear functional I : K(X) → R on the space of the continuous real functions with compact support there is a (unique) reg- ular Borel measure μ on X such that
(1) I(f ) = ∫ f dμ for all f ∈ K(X) .

We introduce “effective” locally compact Hausdorff spaces and prove that there
are computable operators mapping I to μ and vice versa such that (1) holds true. In Section 2 we summarize concepts from Computable Analysis, which we will use in

this article. Computability on locally compact Hausdorff spaces has been introduced in [9]. The definitions and some results are put together in Section 3. In TTE, computability is defined relative to given representations. In Section 4 we introduce natural representations of the space of positive linear operators I : K(X) → R and of the regular Borel measures on the given topological space X. Finally in Section 5 we prove that with respect to these representations the functions I '→ μ and μ '→ I
such that I(f ) = ∫ f dμ are computable.

Computable Analysis
In this article we use the framework of TTE (Type-2 theory of effectivity), see [21] for more details. A partial function from X to Y is denoted by f : ⊆ X → Y . We assume that Σ is a fixed finite alphabet containing the symbols 0 and 1 and consider computable functions on finite and infinite sequences of symbols Σ∗ and Σω , respectively, which can be defined, for example, by Type-2 machines, i.e., Turing machines reading from and writing on finite or infinite tapes. We use the “wrapping function” ι : Σ∗ → Σ∗, ι(a1a2 ... ak) := 110a10a20 ... ak011 for coding words such that ι(u) and ι(v) cannot overlap properly unless u = v. We consider standard functions for finite or countable tupling on Σ∗ and Σω denoted by ⟨·⟩ . By “ ” we denote the subword (infix) relation.
We use the concept of multi-functions. A multi-valued partial function, or multi- function for short, from A to B is a triple f = (A, B, Rf ) such that Rf ⊆A × B (the graph of f ). Usually we will denote a multi-function f from A to B by f : ⊆A ⇒ B. For X⊆A let f [X] := {b ∈ B | (∃a ∈ X)(a, b) ∈ Rf } and for a ∈ A define f (a) := f [{a}]. Notice that f is well-defined by the values f (a)⊆B for all a ∈ A. We define dom(f ) := {a ∈ A | f (a) /= ∅}. In the applications we have in mind, for a multi-function f : ⊆A ⇒ B, f (a) is interpreted as the set of all results which are “acceptable” on input a ∈ A. Any concrete computation will produce on input a ∈ dom(f ) some element b ∈ f (a), but usually there is no method to select a specific one. In accordance with this interpretation the “functional” composition g ◦ f : ⊆ A ⇒ D of f : ⊆ A ⇒ B and g : ⊆ C ⇒ D is defined by dom(g ◦ f ) :=
{a ∈ A | a ∈ dom(f ) and f (a)⊆dom(g)} and g ◦ f (a) := g[f (a)] (in contrast to “non-deterministic” or “relational” composition gf defined by g f (a) := g[f (a)] for all a ∈ A).
Notations ν : ⊆ Σ∗ → M and representations δ : ⊆ Σω → M are used for introducing relative continuity and computability on “abstract” sets M . For a representation δ : ⊆ Σω → M , if δ(p) = x then the point x ∈ M can be identified by the “name” p ∈ Σω .
For naming systems γi : ⊆Yi → Mi (i = 0,..., k), a function h : ⊆Y1×.. .×Yk →
Y0 is a (γ1,..., γk, γ0)-realization of f : ⊆M1 ×...×Mk ⇒ M0, if γ0 ◦h(p1,..., pk) ∈
f (γ1(p1),..., γk(pk)) whenever f (γ1(p1),..., γk(pk) exists. The multi-function f is (γ1,..., γk, γ0)-continuous (–computable), if it has a continuous (computable) (γ1,..., γk, γ0)-realization.
For naming systems γ : ⊆ Y → M and γ' : ⊆ Y ' → M' (Y, Y ' ∈ {Σ∗, Σω}), let

γ ≤t γ' (t-reducible) and γ ≤ γ' (reducible) iff the identity id : a '→ a (a ∈ M ) is (γ, γ')-continuous and (γ, γ')-computable, respectively. Define t-equivalence and equivalence as follows: γ ≡t γ' ⇐⇒ (γ ≤t γ' and γ' ≤t γ) and γ ≡ γ' ⇐⇒ (γ ≤ γ' and γ' ≤ γ), respectively. A set X⊆M is γ-r.e. iff there is a Type-2 machine such that for all p ∈ dom(γ): the machine halts on input p iff γ(p) ∈ M .
If the representations of the sets under consideration are fixed, we will say sim- ply “computable” instead of “(γ, δ)-computable” etc. Two representations induce the same continuity or computability iff they are t-equivalent or equivalent, respec- tively. If multi-functions on represented sets have realizations, then their composi- tion is realized by the composition of the realizations. In particular, the computable multi-functions on represented sets are closed under composition. Much more gener- ally, the computable multi-functions on represented sets are closed under flowchart programming with indirect addressing [22]. This result allows convenient informal construction of new computable functions on multi-represented sets from given ones.
Let νN and νQ be standard notations of the natural numbers and the rational numbers, respectively. let ρ be the Cauchy representation of the real numbers.
For any two representations γ : ⊆ Σω → M and δ : ⊆ Σω → N there is a canonical representation [γ → δ] of the set of (γ, δ)-continuous (total) functions
f : M → N [21, Definition 3.3.13] which can be characrerized up to equivalence as follows [21, Theorem 3.3.14]: For every representation δ˜ of the of (γ, δ)-continuous (total) functions f : M → N , the function

(2)
eval : (F, x) '→ F (x) is (δ˜, γ, δ)-computable ⇐⇒
δ˜ ≤ [γ → δ] .

Computable Topology
For the basic concepts of topology the reader is referred, for example, to [5] or the corresonding sections in [3] and [15]. The definitions and results on computability in this section are from [9,7].
On a second countable T0-space, that is, a topological space with countable base
such that every point x ∈ X can be identified by its (open) neighbourhoods, we introduce computability by means of a notation of a base.
Definition 3.1 [computable T0-space [7]] A computable T0-space is a tuple X = (X, τ, β, ν) such that (X, τ ) is a topological T0-space, β is a base of τ (U /= ∅ for all U ∈ β) and ν : ⊆ Σ∗ → β is a notation of the base with recursive domain and computable intersection, i.e., there is an r.e. set B⊆(dom(ν))3 with

ν(u) ∩ ν(v) = 
(u,v,w)∈B
ν(w) .

In [8] computable T0-spaces are called “computable T0-spaces with computable intersection” and the relation to the similar “computable topological spaces” from
[21] is discussed.
In the following we assume that (X, τ ) is a Hausdorff space (that is, for any
x /= y there are disjoint open sets U, V ∈ τ such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V ) and that

the topology is locally compact (that is, for every point x there is some U ∈ τ such that x ∈ U and the closure U of U is compact). On the set X, the set βf of the finite unions of base elements, the topology τ , the set τc of the closed subsets of X and the set Cp(X) of compact subsets of X we introduce computability via the following naming systems.
Definition 3.2 [some standard representations [7,9]] Define
the representation δ : ⊆ Σω → X by
δ(p) = x, iff {u | x ∈ ν(u)} = {u | ι(u)  p} .
the notation νf : ⊆ Σ∗ → βf by νf (w) :=	{ν(u) | ι(u)  w},
the representation θ : ⊆ Σω → τ by θ(p) :=	{ν(u) | ι(u)  p},
the representation ψ : ⊆ Σω → τc by ψ(p) := X \ θ(p),
the representation κ : ⊆ Σω → Cp(X) by
κ(p) = K, iff {u | K⊆νf (u)} = {u | ι(u)  p} .
Notice that in i. and v., a name p ∈ Σω is a list of all u such that x ∈ ν(u) and K⊆νf (u), respectively, while in iii. and iv. a name p must list only sufficiently many base elements. The reperesentations δ and κ are topologically admissible [21], θ and ψ are admissible representations of natural limit spaces [16,17].
In the following let X = (X, τ, β, ν) be a computable Hausdorff computably locally compact computable T0-space defined as follows.
Definition 3.3 [[9]] A computable T0-space X = (X, τ, β, ν) is called
computable Hausdorff, iff there is an r.e. set H⊆dom(ν) × dom(ν) such that ν(u) ∩ ν(v) = ∅ for all (u, v) ∈ H, and for all x /= y there is some (u, v) ∈ H such that x ∈ ν(u) and y ∈ ν(v),

computably locally compact, iff U is compact for all U ∈ β and the function
U '→ U is (ν, κ)-computable.

Notice that V is compact for all V ∈ βf . The following results are from [9]:
− intersection is (θ, θ, θ)-computable on τ ,
− νf ≤ θ, 

− V '→ V  for V ∈ βf is (νf , κ)-computable,
− κ ≤ ψ, 
− x ∈ U is (δ, θ)-r.e. ,
− K⊆U	is (κ, θ)-r.e. .
For A⊆X let χA : X → R be the characteristic function of A. For f : X → R
let supp(f ) := {x | f (x) /= 0} be the the support of f . Let K(X) be the set of all continuous functions with compact support. For compact K, open U and f ∈ K(X) such that range(f )⊆[0; 1] we define
K ≺ f : ⇐⇒ χK ≤ f, and f ≺ U : ⇐⇒ supp(f )⊆U . 
Obviously, f ≤ χU if f ≺ U .

For a locally compact Hausdorff space with countable base, for every compact set K and every open set U such that K⊆U there are some V ∈ βf and continuous f : X → R such that K⊆V ⊆V ⊆U and K ≺ f ≺ U (Urysohn theorem) [3,5]. We need a computable version.
Lemma 3.4 (i) The multifunction (K, U ) |⇒ V mapping each compact K and each open U such that K⊆U to some V ∈ βf such that K⊆V ⊆V ⊆U is (κ, θ, νf )-computable.
(ii) (computable Urysohn) The multifunction (K, U ) |⇒ f mapping each compact K and each open U such that K⊆U to some f ∈ K(R) such that K ≺ f ≺ U is (κ, θ, [δ → ρ])-computable.
Proof: i. This has been proved in [9].
ii. In [9] it is also shown that every computably locally compact computably Hausdorff computable T0-space is computably T3. The computable Urysohn theorem for such spaces has been proved in [7].	 


The Representations of Functions, Functionals and Measures.
Computable Analysis studies, which functions are computable with respect to given representations. Since almost all representations of a set are completely useless the investigations are concentrated on “effective” representations, that is, representa- tions which are related to some given algebraic or topological structure on the set. In many cases TTE can explain why some representations are useful or “natural” (admissible representations [11,10,21,16]).
In our situation we have a bijection I ↔ μ and try to ﬁnd reasonable or “natural”
representations such that the function and its inverse become computable. Such a problem may have many solutions. For example, the real function x '→ 3x and its inverse are (ρ, ρ)-computable as well as (ρ<, ρ<)-computable.
We still assume that X = (X, τ, β, ν) is a computable Hausdorff computably locally compact computable T0-space. For a computable version of the Riesz repre- sentation theorem we need representations of the set K(X) of continuous functions f : X → R with compact support, of the set LP of linear positive functionals on K(X) and of the set RBM of regular Borel measures.
We consider the representations from Definition 3.2. Since δ and ρ are admissible representations for the topologies τ and τR (the standard topology on the real numbers), respectively, a function f : X → R is continuous, iff it is (δ, ρ)-continuous by Theorem 3.2.11 in [21]. For the (δ, ρ)-continuous functions we have the canonical representation [δ → ρ] which is tailor-made for computing the evaluation (f, x) → f (x) [21, Lemma 3.3.14].
Let δˆ be the restriction of [δ → ρ] to K(X), the continuous functions with com- pact support. The representation [δˆ → ρ] of the set of (δˆ, ρ)-continuous operators is tailor-made for evaluation (I, h) '→ I(h). But in general range([δˆ → ρ]) does not

contain all positive linear functionals I : K(X) → R.
Example 4.1 Consider the space X := (R, τR, J˜, νJ ) where νJ is a canonical nota- tion of the set J˜ of open intervals with rational end-points, which is a computably locally compact and computably Hausdorff computable T0-space. Let I(h) :=  h dλ (λ the Lebesgue measure) be the usual Riemann integral. Then I is positive and linear on K(R).
Suppose that Riemann integration I is (δˆ, ρ)-continuous, hence ([δ → ρ], ρ)- continuous on the set K(R). Since δ ≡ ρ (δ from Definition 3.2), [δ → ρ] ≡ [ρ → ρ]. By [21, Lemma 6.1.7], [ρ → ρ] ≡ δco where δco(p) = f iff p is a list of all pairs (u, v) ∈ Σ∗ × Σ∗ such that f [νJ (u)]⊆νJ (v) (compact-open representation). There- fore, Riemann integration is (δco, ρ)-continuous on K(R). Since the representation δco is admissible with respect to the compact-open topology on C(R, R) [21], in- tegration must be continuous on the subset K(R) of C(R, R), in particular in the “point” f , f (x) = 0 for all x. Since I(f ) = 0, f must have an open neighborhood U in the compact-open topology such that I[U ]⊆(0; 1). Since the finite intersections of subbase elements {f ∈ C(R, R) | f [νJ (u)]⊆νJ (v)} form a basis, there are open rational intervals I1, J1,..., Ik, Jk, such that 0 ∈ J1 ∩ ... ∩ Jk and I(g) ∈ (0; 1) whenever g ∈ K(R) and g[Im]⊆Jm for 1 ≤ m ≤ k. But there is some g ∈ K(R) such that g[Im]⊆Jm for 1 ≤ m ≤ k and I(g) =  g dλ > 1.
Therefore, Riemann integration I is a linear positive operator on K(R) which is not (δˆ, ρ)-continuous, hence not in range([δˆ → ρ]).	 

We solve the problem by adding to each [δ → ρ]-name of f ∈ K(R) information about its support.
Definition 4.2 Define the representation δK of K(X) by
δK(p) = f ⇐⇒ (∃w, q) (p = ⟨w, q⟩, supp(f )⊆νf (w) and [δ → ρ](q) = f ) .
Lemma 4.3 Every positive linear operator I : K(X) → R is in the range of
[δK → ρ].
Proof: We will show this in the proof of Theorem 5.1 below.	 

In Theorem 1.1 the space must be σ-compact, that is, a countable union of compact sets. In our case X is σ-compact since X =  {U | U ∈ β}. The set of Borel sets B(X) is the smallest σ-algebra containing the set τ of open sets. A measure on B(X) is called a Borel measure.
Definition 4.4 [regular Borel measure [3]] A Borel measure μ : B(X) → R on a Hausdorff space is regular, iff
μ(K) < ∞ for all compact K,
μ(U ) = sup{μ(K) | K compact,  K⊆U} for all open U ∈ τ ,
μ(A) = inf{μ(U ) | A⊆U, U open} for all A ∈ B(X). Let M be the set of all regular Borel measures on X.

We need an appropriate representation of M such that a name p of a measure μ supplies sufficient information for computing the positive linear operator f '→ f dμ for f ∈ K(R) represented by δK. By Definition 4.4.iii a regular Borel measure is uniquely defined by its values μ(U ) for open sets U .
Since μ(U ) = sup{μ(V ) | V ∈ βf , V ⊆U}, the measure is defined already by its values on the countable set βf . In [20] a representation of the probability measures on the unit interval is defined by names, which for every rational open interval approximate it measure from below. This information and the fact that the prob- ability measure of the whole space, the compact unit interval, is 1 allows to show that (μ, f ) '→ f dμ for continuous f becomes computable. Since our space is only locally compact we need a list of arbitrarily big open sets with known measure.

Definition 4.5 [representation of measures] Define a representation δM of the reg- ular Borel measures on X as follows: δM(p) = μ, iff there are q ∈ Σω and ri, si ∈ Σω for i ∈ N such that
p = ⟨q, r0, s0, r1, s1,.. .⟩,
q is a list of all ⟨u, v⟩ such that νQ(u) < μ(νf (v)),

(∀w)(∃i) νf (w) ⊆ θ(ri) and
μ ◦ θ(ri) = ρ(si).

For every compact set K there is some w such that K⊆νf (w). Therefore, if p ∈ dom(δM), then for every compact K there is some i such that K⊆θ(ri). In general the sets νf (w) as well as their closures νf (w) have non-computable measures even if μ corresponds to a computable operator I (Theorem 1.1).

Example 4.6 Consider the space X := (R, τR, J˜, νJ ) from Example 4.1. We de- fine a measure μ on the Borel subsets. Let a1, a2,... be an computable one-one enumeration of an r.e. set A⊆N, which is not recursive. Then the real number xA =  i≥1 2−ai is not computable [21]. Let Y := {0, 1}∪ {2−1, 2−2,.. .}∪ {1 + 
2−1, 1+ 2−2,.. .}. Define μ({y}) for y ∈ Y by
μ({0}) := μ({1}) := 1 − xA,
μ({2−i}) := μ({1+ 2−i}) := 2−ai	(i ≥ 1)
and let μ(B) =  {μ({y}) | y ∈ B ∩ Y } for every Borel subset B of R. Then μ((0; 1)) = xA and μ([0; 1]) = 2 − xA, which are non-computable real numbers. We observe that for rational numbers a < b, μ((a; b)) is ρ<-computable (ρ<(p) = x iff p is a list of all a ∈, Q such that a < x [21]) but computable if and only if a /∈ {0, 1}. It remains to show that integration I : f '→ f dμ is (δK, ρ)-computable. By Theorem 5.1 below it suffices to show that μ is δM-computable. By the above observation, a computable δM-name of μ can be constructed straightforwardly. 

The Main Theorem
We can now formulate our main theorem by which a measure μ can be computed from I and vice versa such that I(f ) =  f dμ for all f ∈ K(X). Since our space X is σ-compact, by Theorem 1.1, the classical Riesz representation theorem, the operators S and T in the following theorem are well-defined.
Theorem 5.1 (computable Riesz representation)  (i) The operator S : I '→
μ for positive linear I such that I(f ) =	f dμ is ([δK → ρ], δM)-computable.
(ii) The Operator T : μ '→ I such that I(f ) =	f dμ for f ∈ K(X) is
(δM, [δK → ρ])-computable.
