Introduction

Dopamine receptors are responsible for several functions such as fine motor control, emotion, learning, cognition, pleasure, sensa- tion, motivation, memory and modulation of neuroendocrine behaviour, movements etc., [1]. Some changes in the role of dopaminergic receptor actions are generated many diseases like parkinsonism, psychomotor, schizophrenia, neurodegeneration, drug abuse, delusions and hallucinations etc., [2]. These receptors are mainly divided into D1-5. They belong to the class of G- protein-coupled-receptors [3,4]. Here, D1 and D5 receptors are known as D1 family associates, whereas D2, D3 and D4 receptors are known as D2 family associates [5]. Both families coupled with G-protein and retard the adenylyl cyclase [6,7]. With the knowl- edge of some evidence state that the possibility of the existence of D6 and D7 dopamine receptors, but such a type of receptor has not been sturdily documented. Generally, these receptors bind to the plasma membrane as a homodimer, heterodimers or higher- order oligomers etc., [8]. It has been targeted for different psy- chotic illnesses and also be considered in some non-psychotic disorders [9]. Drugs used to treat the psychotic problem are known as antipsychotic agents (or neuroleptic) is majorly classified into two types. Earlier antipsychotic drugs are called as typical or classical

antipsychotic agents, whereas; currently available drugs are recog- nised as a second generation or atypical antipsychotic agents. Both the type of the antipsychotic agent is having a tendency to obstruct receptors in brain’s dopamine pathways [10]. Most of the antipsychotic agents are having substantial side effects, such as dysphoria, parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, galactorrhea, seda- tion, irritability, hyperprolactinaemia, sexual functioning disorder and symptoms of ADHD, depression, narcolepsy, anxiety, improved appetite, obesity threat, paranoia, aggression, psychomotor agita- tion, diabetes mellitus (Type 2), akathisia, extrapyramidal symp- toms and menstrual trouble [11]. Therefore, identification of a novel antagonist of dopamine receptor is needed to treat nervous diseases effectively. In recent years, there has been an immense awareness among the scientists toward the design of new drugs, which consumes less time, highly potent and lower cost to prepare an effective drug molecule against various health problems. Rapid and high throughput method of drug discovery is an only way to improve the therapeutic value of drugs in the animal model. Molecular docking is a one among the method to measure the bio- logical activity of the proposed molecule with the targeted recep- tor rapidly using Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD). With the support of MVD, we found a bunch of novel compounds known as potent dopamine pathway inhibitors and bearing least side effect due to the presence of trusted thiadiazole and phenothiazine nucleus as part of the molecular structure. This study stated that easy way for the synthesis of novel Azo dye/Schiff bases/Chalcone

derivatives and their antipsychotic activity by using virtual dock- ing and a metallic bar test. The synthesised compound structure was characterised by FT-IR, 1H NMR, mass spectroscopy and ele- mental analysis.

Materials and method

Molecular docking

Virtual screening has been playing an important role in drug discovery processes which deal with a quick search of chemical structures likely to have more chemical binding to the drug target (protein or enzyme) from large libraries. MVD is a powerful dock- ing tool used to detect the binding ability lies between the ligand and receptor. Before we start the docking process, the human dopamine D2 receptor template was collected from the protein bank as mentioned in Fig. 1. A setup of 26 different ligands was built in ChemDraw (Table 1), and the 2D structure was converted to the 3D structure using molegro virtual software [12]. The best 3D structure of ligand was selected from energy minimization through molecular objective functions and modeller score in MVD [13,14]. The properties of each ligand such as absorption, dis- tribution, metabolism and excretion were also studied. The best conformation was selected and used to predict the strength of the bond between the receptor and ligand. The result reveals that around 10 compounds (Table 2) out of 26 are capable of making a perfect binding to the active site of the receptor amino acid. It also helped us to find out the order of prioritising molecules to synthe- sise from the bunch of the molecule based on moledock score, rerank score and hydrogen bond binding energy with DA. The docking study pathway was presented in Fig. 2.

Chemistry

The raw materials and solvents were purchased from Ranbaxy, Sigma-Alrich, Ranchem companies. The melting points of prepared analogues were recorded in open capillary tube method on an Elec- trothermal 9100 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Functional group of synthesised compound was confirmed by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) between
the ranges from 4000 cm—1 to 400 cm—1. The number of proton
present in the analogues was recorded on the Bruker 1H NMR spec- troscopy from chemical shift (d) and the molecular mass of the compound was analysed by the Shimadzu mass spectroscopy. The element analysis was performed on Perkin Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyser.

Synthesis of 4-(Phenylamino)benzoic acid (Scheme-I)
Aniline (0.1 mol, 9.3 ml), para chloro benzoic acid (0.1 mol, 15.6 g), potassium carbonate (0.01 mol, 1.38 g) and 0.63 g of cop- per wire were dissolved in 30 ml of N, N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) contained round bottom flask of about 250 ml capacity. The mixture was allowed to agitate for 30 min at 20–25 °C. The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser and heated at 80 °C for 4 h with occasional shaking. The crude 4-(Phenylamino) benzoic acid
was filtered, washed with little cold water and crystallized from ethanol.

Synthesis of 10H-Phenothiazine 3-carboxylic acid
An ethanolic solution of 4-(Phenylamino) benzoic acid (0.01 mol, 2.13 g) was added dropwise to a mixture of sulphur (0.01 mol, 0.32 g) and iodine (0.01 mol, 1.26 g). Shake the mixture until it became a solution. Placed the solution in a round bottom flask of about 250 capacities and fitted with the reflux condenser. The mix- ture was subjected to reflux on a water bath around 3 h with occa- sional shaking. The crude 10H-Phenothiazine 3-carboxylic acid was separated with a vacuum pump, washed with a small portion of cold water and re-crystallized from ethanol.

Synthesis of 5-(10-(3-(N,N-Dimethylamino)propyl-10H- phenothiazine-3-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-amine
10H-Phenothiazine 3-carboxylic acid (0.01 mol, 2.43 g) and thiosemicarbazide (0.01 mol, 0.75 g) were dissolved in 60 ml of phosphorus oxychloride with the stirring duration of 10 min. The contents were placed in a distillation flask fitted with the reflux condenser. The flask was heated on a water bath for around 4 h. The reflux was detached from reflux condenser and added drop- wise 3-Chloro-N, N-dimethyl propanamine (0.01 mol, 1.21 ml), sodium hydride (0.01 mol, 0.24 g) in DMF. Again, the reaction mix- ture was warmed for 3 h in a water bath. The hot solution was cooled to room temperature and separated crude product was

X-ray crystallography

X-ray crystallography is a tool used to investigate the three- dimensional picture of the atomic and molecular structure of a

(10—8 cm). The beam of X-ray strikes a crystal and causes the crystal by using X-ray light, which has wavelengths of 1 angstrom diffraction of light into specific directions, fed into the computer
and using a mathematical equation to calculate the position of every atom in the crystallized molecule.


Results

Molecular docking

Each ligand potency has been identified from moldock score (Table 3), rerank score (Table 4) and hydrogen bonding score (Table 5) after successful interaction with DA. The potent anti- psychotic agents are perfectly docked to a hydrophobic and the hydrophilic center of the target (DA) and were exhibiting excellent score as compared to standard drugs. The key amino-acids respon- sible for the binding site of DA were found to be Asp 123, Lue110, Asp 111, Asp 109, Asn 112, Thr 66, Asn 70 Lys 76, Glu 74, Arg 79, Asn 75 and Glu 84 residues etc., Each compound had shown a sig- nificant affinity towards DA due to the formation of a salt bridge between the ligand and some hydrophobic amino acid residue (Asp111 and Asp123), hydrogen bond formation with hydrophilic
amino acid (Asn112, Glu74) and p-p interaction with some
hydrophobic amino acid residue (Phe67). Here, compound GC8 and GC2 had exhibited admirable moldock score as compared to other derivatives due to presence of electron releasing groups such as OH, OCH3 and N(CH3)2 etc., The overall decreasing order of dopamine-inhibiting action of the entire synthesised analogues

was found to GC8 > GC2 > GC1 > GC7 > GC3 > GC5 > GC4 > GC9 >
GC6 > GC10. The interaction of each ligand and DA was shown in Fig. 5.

X-ray crystallography determination and refinement

Diffraction data of the compound GC8 were collected from 8031 reflections using X calibur CCD diffractometer equipped with area detector and graphite monochromator (k = 0.71835). The dimen-

Biological evaluation

Catalepsy test

Catalepsy is defined as the inability of an animal to correct its abnormal posture after a particular period of time [23]. It can accurately predict by haloperidol-induced catalepsy metallic bar test [24]. To test the catalepsy, Wistar rats of either sex with an average weight of 200–225 g were selected, grouped (standard, test and control) and placed into different cages. Before starting the experiment protocol has been approved by the institutional
animal ethics committee at GIET School of pharmacy, Rajah- mundry, India (GSP/PY/04/2015). Each group maintained six ani- mals under standard lab conditions. Haloperidol was administered 1 mg/kg, IP route to induce catalepsy in standard group of animals. Synthesised compounds (7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) were also given simultaneously to test group of animals. The animal front paws had been placed on a metallic bar, which elevated at 10 cm above the base of the cage. If the animal main- tained abnormal posture more than 30 s called as catalepsy. The response observed at the various intervals like 0, 30, 60, 120,
180 and 240 min etc.,

4.2. Catalepsy score

The cataleptic score of test, standard and control batch of Wis- ter rats had taken at the interval of 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min. The score is significantly increased with the standard and test com- pounds in between 60 min and 120 min and the highest catalepsy
score was achieved after 120 min of administration of standard and test compounds. This evidence proves that our test compounds were the severely block the dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum effectively to show anti-psychotic activity.

docking and haloperidol-induced catalepsy metallic bar test. Most of the compounds were perfectly docked to a hydrophobic and hydrophilic centre of the human dopamine D2 receptor with the support of key amino-acids like Asp 123, Leu110, Asp 111, Asp 109, Asn 112, Thr 66, Asn 70 Lys 76, Glu 74, Arg 79, Asn 75 and Glu 84 etc., these amino acid residues are allowing the molecules to bind firmly with human dopamine D2 receptor by forming a salt
bridge, hydrogen bond and p-p interaction with the ligand. There-
fore, the binding energy of each ligand lies between the ranges of 09.19985–0.533093 kcal/moles (Table 4). In addition to that each compound had been shown an excellent anti-psychotic activity in a haloperidol-induced catalepsy metallic bar test. The results found are firmly similar to docking study. Among the various ana- logues, compound GC8 and GC2 were bound more effectively to the receptor through electron donating groups such as OH, OCH3 and N (CH3)2 present in the part of the molecular structure and offered excellent antipsychotic activity. Therefore, there is a need for fur- ther study of the above-mentioned compounds for the develop- ment of the novel atypical antipsychotic agent.
