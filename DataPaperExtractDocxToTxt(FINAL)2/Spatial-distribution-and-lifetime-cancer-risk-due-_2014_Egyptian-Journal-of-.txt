The spatial distribution of natural radioactivity due to uranium, thorium and potassium was investigated in soils from the undisturbed areas in Yelagiri Hills, Tamilnadu, India by Isodose map. The radiological hazards due to natural radionuclides content such as representative level index (RLI), activity utilization index (AUI), excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) and internal radiation hazards (Hin) of the soil samples in this area were calculated. The calculated radiological hazard parameters are compared with different countries of
the world. The calculated range of ELCR is 0.326 × 10—3 to 1.067 × 10—3 with an average of 0.700 × 10—3 for soils. This average value of ELCR is more twice than the world average (0.290 × 10—3). A correlation analysis was made between measured dose rate and individual radionuclides, in order to delineate the contribution of the respective nuclides toward the
dose rate. The U/Th concentration ratio in surface soil samples ranged from 0.05 to 1.72 with an average of 0.43 which is more higher (80%) than the world average of 0.26. The application of cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), coupled with Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, were utilized to analyze the data, identify and clarify between the radiological parameters to know the existing relations. The CA and PCA results showed that the former method yielded three distinctive groups of the soil variables

Introduction

The radioactivity level from the natural radionuclides is termed as background radiation which will depend on the amount of the radioactive materials in the environment. The background radiation can be high if the environment is polluted either from man-made or natural activities. Mate- rials from the deposit may be brought to the surface soil through processes such as weathering of rocks and soil for- mation. They can also leach into the groundwater system, contaminate it, and lead to pollution far away from the source.
Natural radioactivity arises mainly from the primordial radionuclides, such as 40K and the radionuclides from 238U
condition. The ability of hydrogenous migration falls in the order U > Ra > Th. Uranium is able to remain in soluble state for a long time and gets migrated by flow of streams or river to a long distance. Horizontal transfer of uranium and thorium is dominated by interchange of sorption and desorption [5]. Un- fortunately rapid increasing of population and usage of fertil- izers for agriculture day by day contaminate the soils. Due to
one of the main tourism places in Tamilnadu, point and nonpoint pollution sources are dominated in study area. Hence it is necessary to determine the concentration levels of the 238U and 232Th as well as 40K in the soil from Yelagiri hills, Tamil- nadu, India and to analyze the spatial distribution of natural radionuclides by Isodose map with statistical approach.

and 232Th series and their decay products, which are present		

at trace levels in all ground formations [1]. Monitoring the release of gamma radiation from natural radionuclides is important to protect the humans from lung cancer. The main sources of gamma radiations are due to two major radionu- clide chains: uraniumeradium and thorium. A geological and geographical condition of the study area determine the radioactivity and the associated external exposure due to gamma radiation at different levels in the soils of each region in the world [2e4].
The data will offer useful and necessary information in the monitoring of environmental contamination which will pro- vide appropriate and better protection guidelines to the public.
The distribution of radionuclide concentration reflects migration  of  uranium  and  thorium  under  surface  soil
Previous work

In an earlier work, activity concentration of natural radionu- clide that in different locations of Yelagiri Hills is reported by Ravisankar et al. [4]. They indicated that average activity concentration of 232Th in that study was 1.19 times higher than world median value while the activity of 238U and 40K was found to be lower and also major gamma radiation exposure to humans in Yelagiri Hills due to enrichment of 232Th content in soils [4]. The present work is a continuation of the previous research work in Yelagiri Hills, Tamilnadu to study the spatial distribution of natural radionuclide and the application of Multivariate statistical method to analyze the data, identify and clarify between the radiological parameters to know the existing relations.

Geology of study area

Yelagiri is a hill station/village in Vellore district of Tamilnadu,
through thick reserve forests. Mangalam, a small village, is at the base of this hill. There are other trekking options that include smaller peaks like Javadi Hills, Palamathi Hills etc.

India, situated off the VaniyambadieTirupattur road. Located at		

an altitude of 1410 m above Mean Sea Level and spread across 30 km2, the Yelagiri village (also spelled Elagiri at times) is sur- rounded by orchards, rose-gardens, and green valleys. Yelagiri comprises of 14 hamlets and a number of temples spread over a couple of hills. The highest point in Yelagiri is the Swamimalai Hill, standing at 4338 ft: Swamimalai is a popular destination for trekkers. The hill provides a good number of trekking trails
Materials and methods

Sampling methodology

The soil profiles were sampled using an automatic core driller. Cores extruded and sectioned at 10 cm diameter and 25 cm depth were used to take soil samples [6]. The soil samples

were determined using a 3 × 3 NaI (Tl) gamma ray system. The concentrations of natural radioactivity in soil samples The detector was shielded by 15 cm thick lead on all sides
including the top to reduce background due to cosmic ray component by almost 98%. The inner sides of the lead shielding are lined by 2 mm thick cadmium and 1 mm thick copper to cut off lead X-rays and cadmium X-rays respec- tively. This graded lining shield further reduces the back- ground especially in the low energy region. Standard sources of the primordial radionuclides obtained from IAEA in the same geometry and having the same density, as that of the prepared soil samples, were used to determine the efficiency of the detector for various energies in the prescribed geom-

sampling site should be taken to a field boundary, a road, a tree, a building or other obstruction. The sample collected at different locations of Yelagiri Hills, Tamilnadu is shown in
Fig. 1. For each soil sample collected, an area of 1 m × 1 m was
marked and carefully cleared of debris to a few centimeters
depth. The collected samples were then placed in labeled polythene bags and transferred to the laboratory for prepa- ration and analysis. These samples were mixed together thoroughly, in order to obtain a representative sample of that area.

Sample preparation

In the laboratory, the soil samples were sieved by a 2 mm mesh to remove larger objects and then ground using mortar and pestle to fine powder in order to have the same matrix as the reference sample. After that, the samples were dried in an
oven at a temperature around 105◦C for two hours until con-
stant weights were attained and then placed in desiccators to
avoid moisture absorption. The homogenized sample was packed in a standard 250 ml airtight PVC plastic container and sealed using silicon and plastic tapes air tight. The samples were left for a minimum of 28 days for radioactive secular equilibrium between 222Rn-radon gas and its decay products (214Pb, 214Bi, and 226Ra), from the 238U decay series to be ac- quired [7].
(Tl) crystal and using the gamma ray spectrometer and
multichannel analyzer, count spectra were obtained for each of the soil sample. Each radionuclide can be detected in either direct or indirect way. The radioisotope 40K emits gamma ray with an energy of 1.461 MeV. Hence the deter- mination of 40K is considered as direct. The determination of 238U depends on the detection of the 214Bi radionuclide which is a member of the 238U decay series emitting an energy of 1.764 MeV. Therefore, the detection of 238U is indirect. The determination 232Th concentration is indirect as referred to the 208Tl radionuclide with an energy of 2.615 MeV, origi-

4 weeks (>7 half life’s of 222Rn) before counting by gamma ray
spectrometry in order to ensure that the daughter products of 226Ra up to 210Pb and 228Th up to 208Pb achieve equilibrium with their respective parent radionuclides. All the soil sam- ples were subjected to gamma ray spectral analysis with a counting time of 20,000 s.

Multivariate statistical analysis

Multivariate statistical analysis (Pearson’s correlation anal- ysis, Cluster analysis and Factor analysis) has been carried out to find out the interrelation among the parameters obtained from natural radionuclides. In this work main statistical software ‘Statistical program for the Social Science (SPSS/PC)’ was used for statistical analysis.

Spatial distribution of radioactivity

The Spatial distribution of radioactivity from soils due to naturally occurring radionuclides (238U, 232Th and 40K) is studied in Yelagiri Hills, Tamilnadu using isodose map which is made by SURFER (software version 8).

Results and discussions

238U, 232Th and 40K activities

The results for the activity concentrations of natural radio- nuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K in soil samples of different loca- tions of Yelagiri Hills, Tamilnadu are reported in Table 1. The
activity concentrations of 238U, 232Th and 40K range from ≤2.17 to 53.23 Bq kg—1, 13.54e114.75 Bq kg—1 and 261.11e2207.3 Bq kg—1, respectively. Except for 4 locations the obtained results for 238U have lower values of activity con-
(35 Bq kg—1 for 238U) of this radionuclide in the soil [5]. Simi- centrations, when compared with worldwide average value larly except 9 locations, the obtained results for 232Th have
worldwide average value (30 Bq kg—1 for 232Th, respectively) of higher values of activity concentrations, when compared with this radionuclide in the soil [5]. Except for one location, the
median values (400 Bq kg—1). The lowest value, of obtained results for 40K have higher value than the worldwide
261.11 Bq kg—1 of 40K, was found in the soil sample from the
2207.3 (Bq kg—1) in the soil sample from the Pavender bend of Pallakanvoor village of Yelagiri Hills and the high value of Yelagiri. The average activity concentration of 232Th and 40K in
the present study is 1.38 and 2.86 times higher than world median value while the activity of 238U is found to be lower.


Representative level index (RLI)

The level of gamma radioactivity associated with different concentrations of some specific radionuclides is known as the representative level index [8e12] which is given as [12]

232Th, 238U and 40K in Bq kg—1, respectively. The calculated RLI where ATh, AU and AK are the average activity concentration of values for the samples under investigation are given in Table
1. The representative level index varies from 0.60 to 1.91 with an average of 1.29. It is clear that the Yelagiri soil samples slightly exceed the upper limit for RLI which is unity [12] and it indicates that the soil samples are upgraded in the study area. Fig. 2 shows the sample location Id and representative level index (RLI). The comparison of RLI with different countries of the world is given in Table 2.

Activity utilization index (AUI)

In order to facilitate the calculation of dose rates in air from different combinations of the three radionuclides in soils and by applying the appropriate conversion factors, an activity utilization index (AUI) is constructed that is given by the following expression [13]
The AGDE values are presented in Table 1. As can be seen, the average value does not, exceed the permissible recommended limits, indicating that the hazardous effects of these radia- tions are negligible. The obtained value of AGDE for the studied samples ranges from 294.34 to 948.10 with an average
of 621.39 mSv y—1. In literature, the world average value for AGDE was found to be 300 mSv y—1 for soils [17]. However, obtained average value is more than twice the world average
value for soil. Fig. 4 shows the sample location Id and annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGDE).



Excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR)

Excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) is calculated using the following equation and presented in Table 1 [13]

mass (Bq kg—1) of 232Th, 238U, and 40K in the building materials where CTh, CU and CK are actual values of the activities per unit considered; fTh (0.604), fU (0.462) and fK (0.041) are the frac-
tional contributions to the total dose rate in air due to gamma radiation from the actual concentrations of these radionu- clides. In the NEA [9] Report, typical activities per unit mass of
232Th, 238U, and 40K in soils CTh, CU and CK are referred to be 50,
50 and 500 Bq kg—1, respectively. The activity utilization of the soil samples is calculated using equation (2). The calculated
values vary from 0.235 (Thiruvalluvar bend) to 1.773 (Kaari bend) with an average of 0.857. This value shows that AUI < 2, which corresponds to an annual effective dose < 0.3 mSv/y [14]. This indicates that Yelagiri soil samples can be used as one of the safe building material. Fig. 3 shows the sample location Id and activity utilization index (AUI).

Annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGDE)

In the same context, the activity bone marrow and the bone surface cells are considered as the organs of interest by UNSCEAR [15]. Therefore, the annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGDE) due to the specific activities of 238U, 232Th and 40K was calculated using the following formula [16]
were reported in earlier work [4]. For stochastic effects, ICRP
of ELCR is 0.326 × 10—3 to 1.067 × 10—3 with an average of 60 uses values of 0.05 for the public [18]. The calculated range 0.700 × 10—3 for soils. This average value of ELCR is more twice
than the world average (0.290 × 10—3) [6]. Fig. 5 shows the
sample location Id and Excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR).

Internal radiation hazard indices (Hin)

In addition to the external exposure, radon and its short-lived products are also dangerous to the respiratory organs. The internal hazard index (Hin) is used to control the internal exposure to 222Rn and its radioactive progeny [19]. The inter- nal exposure to radon and its daughter products is quantified by the internal hazard index (Hin), which was calculated using the following formula [19].


Statistical analyses of the data

The univariate statistics was applied to obtain data and com- plete discussion is given in earlier work [4]. The simplicity of the univariate statistical analysis is obvious and likewise the fallacy of reductionism could be apparent [20]. In order to avoid this problem, multivariate analysis such as Pearson’s corre- lation and cluster analysis are used to explain the correlation amongst a large number of variables in terms of a small

The calculated internal radiation hazard indices (Hin) of soil samples are given in Table 1.This Hin values varies from
0.218 to 0.818 with average of 0.528. The recommended value of internal radiation hazard indices is less than 1. Therefore, these areas may not pose radiological risks to the in- habitants owing to harmful effects of ionizing radiation from the natural radionuclides in soil. Fig. 3 shows the sample location Id and internal radiation hazard indices (Hin). The comparison of Hin with different countries of the world is given in Table 2.
analysis is to achieve great efficiency of data compression from the original data, and to gain some information useful in the interpretation of the environmental geochemical origin. This method can also help to simplify and organize large data sets to provide meaningful insight [23] and can help to indicate natural associations between samples and/or variables [24] thus highlighting the information not available at first glance. This multivariate treatment of environmental data is widely and successfully used to interpret relationships among variables so that the environmental system could be managed

strength of association between pairs of variables through calculation of the linear Pearson correlation coefficient. Re- sults for Pearson correlation coefficients between all the studied radioactive variables for Yelagiri soil samples are shown in Table 3.
The high good positive correlation coefficient was observed between 232Th and 238U because uranium and thorium decay series occur together in nature [26]. But very weak negative correlation coefficient was observed between 40K and 238U, 232Th since 40K origins are in different decay series. And also Representative level index (RLI), Annual gonadal dose equiv- alent (AGDE), Excess lifetime cancer (ELCR) and internal haz- ard indices (Hin) have high good positive correlation coefficients with 238U, 232Th and 40K which indicates that the radiological parameters exist due to high concentration of radionuclides.

6.2.	Factor analysis














[25]. In this work, radioactive measurements acquired by the spectrometric gamma technique were subjected to qualitative and quantitative statistical analyses in order to draw a valid conclusion regarding the nature and significance of the dis- tribution of radioactive elements in soil samples of Yelagiri hills of Tamilnadu, India. The main statistical software in use was SPSS 16.0. The activity concentrations of natural radio- nuclides 238U, 232Th, 40K and obtained radiological data are taken for analysis.

Pearson’s correlation coefficients analysis of radioactive variables

Correlation analysis has been carried out, as a bivariation statistics in order to determine the mutual relationships and
Factor analysis was carried out on the data set (8 variables as in the above analyses) to assess the relationship as per the procedure given in [13]. The rotated factor 1 and factor 2 values are reported in Table 4. Factor analysis yielded two factors with eigen value < 1, explaining 94.47% of the total variance. From rotate space of component-1 and component- 2 the first factor accounted for 57.47% of the total variance and mainly characterized by high positive loading of concentra- tions of 232Th, 40K. Factor-2 accounted for 37% of the total variance, which mainly consists of positive loading of 238U.
From the overall factor analysis, it is seen that 232Th, 40K in- crease the radioactivity in the soils. Fig. 6 gives a Graphical representation of factor component 1 and component 2.

6.3.	Cluster analysis

Cluster Analysis (CA) is a multivariate technique, whose pri- mary purpose is to classify the objects of the system into categories or clusters based on their similarities, and the objective is to find an optimal grouping for which the obser- vations or objects within each cluster are similar, but the clusters are dissimilar from each other. The dendrogram visually displays the order in which parameters or variables combine to form clusters with similar properties. The most similar objects are first grouped, and these initial groups are

emerged according to their similarities. Similarity is a mea- sure of distance between clusters relative to the largest dis- tance between any two individual variables. 100% similarity means the clusters were zero distance apart in their sample measurements, while the similarity of 0% means the cluster areas are disparate as the least similar region.
In this work cluster analysis is performed using average linkage method, to calculate the Euclidean distance between the variables. The derived dendrogram is shown in Fig. 7. In this dendrogram, all 8 parameters are grouped into three statistically significant clusters. Cluster-I consists of all measured radiological parameters except AGDE and uranium and thorium; cluster-II consists of only Annual Gonadal Dose Equivalent (AGDE) which is linked with uranium. Finally cluster-III consists of K with high Euclidean distance. All the clusters are formed on the basis of existing similarities. From cluster-I and Cluster-II the total level of the radioactivity mainly depends on 232Th and 40K concentrations. But Annual gonadal dose equivalent in Yelagiri Hills is due to the content of uranium.

Spatial distribution of gamma radiation levels

238U and 232Th activity ratios

The calculated U/Th and Th/U ratio values of each locations are given in Table 5 The majority of locations fall on straight
line with a slope 5.074 corresponding to Th/U ratio which is higher than the reported global Th/U ratio of 3.5 [27]. This greater value indicates that uranium is in equilibrium with its daughter [28]. Compared to the reported intercept of 0.3 mg/kg obtained by nationwide survey carried by an intercept of
6.5 mg/kg in present study indicates higher thorium content in the soil [29].

Correlation studies between the activity concentration and the measured dose rate

In order to find the existence of these radioactive nuclides together at a particular place, correlation studies were per- formed between combination of radionuclides like 238U and 232Th and 238U and 40K. A very poor correlation observed be- tween individual activity concentration of radionuclides which indicate individual results for any one of the radionu- clide is not a good predictor of the concentration of the other [29]. Therefore an attempt was made to delineate the contri- bution of individual radionuclides toward the measured gamma dose rate in the study area irrespective of the cosmic radiation. Correlation studies were performed between the measured dose rates with the respective radionuclide activity concentration. A nearly good correlation existed between 232Th (0.665) and 40K (0.537) with the measured absorbed dose rate as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Since the study area has thorium and potassium enriched soils and major portion of dose is contributed to 232Th and 40K series, a poor correlation existed between 238U (0.184) with the measured dose rate as

shown in Fig. 8. Hence gamma dose is negligible due to 238U series. The present 238U, 232Th and 40K activities in the surface soils are due to both natural and anthropogenic activities in the study area.

Gamma isodose map

The terrestrial gamma dose rates at each sampling locations are plotted using SURFER (software version 8). Fig. 11 shows the 3D plot of the gamma dose map of different locations of the study area with absorbed dose rate. The Enhanced activity areas are indicated with higher peaks with red color regions in the plotted map.

Conclusion

The concentration of 232Th and 40K in the soil samples of Yelagiri hills is more that 238U which is less than the world average.
The obtained Th/U concentration ratio of 5.074 is higher compared to global ratio of 3.5 and the average U/Th concentration ratio of 0.43 which is higher than the world average of 0.26
The spatial distribution of radioactivity due to natural terrestrial radionuclides of 238U, 232Th, and 40K were studied by isodose map for surface soil samples and enhanced activity areas are indicated with higher peak regions in plotted map.
The average value (0.700 × 10—3) of ELCR is more twice than the world average value average (0.290 × 10—3).
The values of internal hazard index determined in the
soil samples is less than the recommended limit.
Methods of multivariate data analysis have proved to be a suitable tool for the interpretation of soil samples.
