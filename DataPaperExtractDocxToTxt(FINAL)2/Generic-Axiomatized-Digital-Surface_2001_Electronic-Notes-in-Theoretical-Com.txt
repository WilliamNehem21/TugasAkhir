Abstract
In digital topology, Euclidean n-space Rn is usually modeled either by the set of points of a discrete grid, or by the set of n-cells in a convex cell complex whose union is Rn. For commonly used grids and complexes in the cases n = 2 and 3, certain pairs of adjacency relations (κ, λ) on the grid points or n-cells (such as (4,8) and (8,4) on Z2) are known to be “good pairs”. For these pairs of relations (κ, λ), many results of digital topology concerning a set of grid points or n-cells and its complement (such as Rosenfeld’s digital Jordan curve theorem) have versions in which κ-adjacency is used to define connectedness on the set and λ-adjacency is used to define connectedness on its complement. At present, results of 2D and 3D digital topology are usually proved for one good pair of adjacency relations at a time
— so for each result there are different (but analogous) theorems for different good pairs of adjacency relations. In this paper we take the first steps in developing an alternative approach to digital topology based on very general axiomatic definitions of “well-behaved digital spaces”. This approach gives the possibility of stating and proving results of digital topology as single theorems which apply to all spaces of the appropriate dimensionality that satisfy our axioms. Specifically, this paper introduces the notion of a generic axiomatized digital surface-structure (gads) — a general, axiomatically defined, type of discrete structure that models subsets of the Euclidean plane and of other surfaces. Instances of this notion include gads corresponding to all of the good pairs of adjacency relations that have previously been used (by ourselves or others) in digital topology on planar grids and boundary surfaces. We define basic concepts for a gads (such as homotopy of paths and the intersection number of two paths), give a discrete definition of planar gads (which are gads that model subsets of the Euclidean plane) and present some fundamental results including a Jordan curve theorem for planar gads.

Introduction
In digital topology, Euclidean n-space Rn is usually modeled either by the set of points of a discrete grid, or by the set of n-cells in a convex cell complex whose union is Rn. Connectedness in Euclidean n-space is usually modeled by graph-theoretic notions of connectedness derived from adjacency relations defined on the grid points or n-cells.
For commonly used grids and complexes in the cases n = 2 and 3, certain pairs of adjacency relations (κ, λ) on the grid points or n-cells are known to be “good pairs”. For these pairs of relations (κ, λ), many results of digital topology concerning a set of grid points or n-cells and its complement have versions in which κ-adjacency is used to define connectedness on the set and λ-adjacency is used to define connectedness on its complement.
For example, (4, 8) and (8, 4) are good pairs of adjacency relations on Z2. Thus Rosenfeld’s digital Jordan curve theorem [10] is valid when one of 4- and 8-adjacency is used to define the sense in which a digital simple closed curve is connected and the other of the two adjacency relations is used to define connected components ofthe digital curve’s complement. The theorem is not valid ifthe same one of4- or 8-adjacency is used for both purposes: (4, 4) and (8, 8) are not good pairs on Z2.
Some adjacency relations form good pairs with themselves. An example of such a good pair is the pair (6, 6) on the grid points of a 2D hexagonal grid. (The grid points are the centers of the hexagons in a tiling of the Euclidean plane by regular hexagons, and two points are 6-adjacent ifthey are the centers of hexagons that share an edge.) Another example is the good pair (κ2, κ2) on Z2, where κ2 is Khalimsky’s adjacency relation [6] on Z2, which is defined as follows: Say that a point of Z2 is pure if its coordinates are both even or both odd, and mixed otherwise. Then two points of Z2 are κ2-adjacent ifthey are 4-adjacent, or ifthey are pure points and are 8-adjacent.
In three dimensions, (6, 26), (26, 6), (6, 18), (18, 6) are good pairs of adja- cency relations on Z3. A different example of a good pair on Z3 is (κ3, κ3), where κ3 is the 3D analog of κ2: Two points of Z3 are κ3-adjacent ifthey are 6- adjacent, or ifthey are 26-adjacent and at least one ofthe two is a pure point, where a pure point is a point whose coordinates are all odd or all even. (12, 12), (12, 18) and (18, 12) are good pairs ofadjacency relations 6 on the points ofa 3D face-centered cubic grid (e.g., on {(x, y, z) ∈ Z3 | x + y + z ≡ 0(mod 2)}) and (14, 14) is a good pair on the points of a 3D body-centered cubic grid (e.g., on {(x, y, z) ∈ Z3 | x ≡ y ≡ z(mod 2)}).
At present, results of 2D and 3D digital topology are usually proved for one good pair of adjacency relations at a time, and the details of the proof 

6 If α is an irreflexive symmetric binary relation on the set G of all points of a Cartesian or non-Cartesian grid, then α is referred to as the k-adjacency relation on G, and is denoted by the positive integer k, if for all p ∈ G the set {q ∈ G | p α q} contains just k points and they are all strictly closer to p (in Euclidean distance) than is any other point of G \ {p}.


may be significantly different for different good pairs. In the case of 3D grids, even ifwe consider only the nine good pairs ofadjacency relations mentioned above, a result such as a digital Jordan surface theorem would be expected to have nine different versions with nine separate proofs!
This state of affairs seems to us to be unsatisfactory. We have begun to consider an alternative approach to digital topology, in which “well-behaved” digital spaces are defined axiomatically, using axioms that are general enough to admit digital spaces which correspond to the good pairs of adjacency re- lations mentioned above. This approach allows a result of 2D or 3D digital topology to be proved as a single theorem for all well-behaved spaces that sat- isfy appropriate hypotheses. (Our Jordan curve theorem, Theorem 4.7 below, illustrates this.)
In this paper we confine our attention to digital spaces that model subsets ofthe Euclidean plane and other surfaces, and give an axiomatic definition of a very general class ofsuch spaces, which includes spaces corresponding to all of the good pairs of adjacency relations that have been used in the literature on 2D digital topology (both in the plane and on boundary surfaces). A space that satisfies our axiomatic definition is called a gads. As will be seen in Section 2.5, a substantial part of the mathematical framework used in our definition ofa gads has previously been used by the third author [4,5].
As first steps in the development of digital topology for these spaces, we define the intersection number of two paths on a gads, and outline a proof that the number is invariant under homotopic deformation of the two paths. This is mostly a generalization, to arbitrary gads, ofdefinitions and theorems given by the first author and Malgouyres in [1,2,3]. We also give a (discrete) definition of planar gads, which model subsets of the Euclidean plane, and present a Jordan curve theorem for such gads. In contrast to some earlier work by the second author (e.g., [7,8,9]), this paper does not use any arguments that are based on polyhedral continuous analogs ofdigital spaces, but uses only discrete arguments.

GADS and pGADS
Basic Concepts and Notations
For any set P we denote by P{2} the set of all unordered pairs of distinct elements of P (equivalently, the set of all subsets of P with exactly two el- ements). Let P be any set and let ρ ⊆ P{2}. 7 Two elements a and b of P [respectively, two subsets A and B of P ] are said to be ρ-adjacent if {a, b}∈ ρ [respectively, if there exist a ∈ A and b ∈ B with {a, b} ∈ ρ]. If x ∈ P we denote by Nρ(x) the set of elements of P which are ρ-adjacent to x; these elements are also called the ρ-neighbors of x. We call Nρ(x) the punctured

7 ρ can be viewed as a binary, symmetric and irreflexive relation on P , and (P, ρ) as an undirected simple graph.


ρ-neighborhood of x.
A ρ-path from a ∈ P to b ∈ P is a finite sequence (x0,..., xl) of one or more elements of P such that x0 = a, xl = b and, for all i ∈ {0,...,l − 1},
{xi, xi+1} ∈ ρ. The nonnegative integer l is the length of the path. A ρ-path of length 0 is called a one-point path. For all integers m, n, 0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ l, the subsequence (xm,..., xn) of (x0,..., xl) is called an interval or segment of the path. For all i ∈ {1,..., l} we say that the elements xi−1 and xi are consecutive on the path, and also that xi−1 precedes xi and xi follows xi−1 on the path. Note that consecutive elements ofa ρ-path can never be equal.
A ρ-path (x0,..., xl) is said to be simple if xi /= xj for all distinct i and j in {0,..., l}. It is said to be closed if x0 = xl, so that x0 follows xl−1. It is called a ρ-cycle ifit is closed and xi /= xj for all distinct i and j in {1,..., l}. One-point paths are the simplest ρ-cycles. Two ρ-cycles c1 = (x0,..., xl) and c2 = (y0,..., yl) are said to be equivalent if there exists an integer k, 0 ≤ k ≤ l − 1, such that xi = y(i+k) mod l for all i ∈ {0,..., l}.
If S ⊆ P , two elements a and b of S are said to be ρ-connected in S ifthere exists a ρ-path from a to b that consists only ofpoints in S. ρ-connectedness in S is an equivalence relation on S; its equivalence classes are called the ρ-components of S. The set S is said to be ρ-connected if there is just one ρ-component of S.
Given two sequences c1 = (x0,..., xm) and c2 = (y0,..., yn) such that xm = y0, we denote by c1.c2 the sequence (x0,..., xm, y1,..., yn), which we call the catenation of c1 and c2. Whenever we use the notation c1.c2, we are also implicitly saying that the last element of c1 is the same as the first element of c2. It is clear that if c1 and c2 are ρ-paths oflengths l1 and l2, then c1.c2 is a ρ-path oflength l1 + l2.
For any sequence c = (x0,..., xm), the reverse of c, denoted by c−1, is the sequence (y0,..., ym) such that yk = xm−k for all k ∈ {0,..., m}. It is clear that if c is a ρ-path oflength l then so is c−1.
A simple closed ρ-curve is a nonempty finite ρ-connected set C such that each element of C has exactly two ρ-neighbors in C. (Note that a simple closed ρ-curve must have at least three elements.) A ρ-cycle c oflength |C| that con- tains every element ofa simple closed ρ-curve C is called a ρ-parameterization of C. Note that if c and c' are ρ-parameterizations ofa simple closed ρ-curve C, then c' is equivalent to c or to c−1.
If x and y are ρ-adjacent elements of a simple closed ρ-curve C, then we may say that x and y are ρ-consecutive on C. If x and y are distinct elements of a simple closed ρ-curve C that are not ρ-consecutive on C, then each of the two ρ-components of C \{x, y} is called a ρ-cut-interval (of C) associated with x and y.

Definition of a gads
Definition 2.1 (2D digital complex) A 2D digital complex is an ordered triple (V, π, L), where
V is a set whose elements are called vertices or spels,
π ⊆ V {2}, and the pairs of vertices in π are called proto-edges,
L is a set of simple closed π-curves whose members are called loops, and the following four conditions hold:
V is π-connected and contains more than one vertex.
For any two distinct loops L1 and L2, L1 ∩L2 is either empty, or consists of a single vertex, or is a proto-edge.
No proto-edge is included in more than two loops.
Each vertex belongs to only a finite number of proto-edges.
When specifying a 2D digital complex whose vertex set is the set of points ofa grid in Rn, a positive integer k (such as 4, 8 or 6) may be used to denote the set ofall unordered pairs of k-adjacent vertices. We write L2×2 to denote the set of all unit lattice squares in Z2. The triple (Z2, 4, L2×2) is a simple example ofa 2D digital complex.
Definition 2.2 (GADS) A generic axiomatized digital surface-structure, or gads, is a pair G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) where (V, π, L) is a 2D digital complex (whose vertices, proto-edges and loops are also referred to as vertices, proto- edges and loops of G) and where κ and λ are subsets of V {2} that satisfy Axioms 1, 2 and 3 below. The pairs of vertices in κ and λ are called κ-edges and λ-edges, respectively. (V, π, L) is called the underlying complex of G.
Axiom 1 Every proto-edge is both a κ-edge and a λ-edge: π ⊆ κ ∩ λ. Axiom 2 For all e ∈ (κ ∪ λ) \ π, some loop contains both vertices of e. Axiom 3 If x, y ∈ L ∈ L, but x and y are not π-consecutive on L, then
{x, y} is a λ-edge if and only if L \ {x, y} is not κ-connected.
{x, y} is a κ-edge if and only if L \ {x, y} is not λ-connected.
Regarding Axiom 2, note that if e ∈ (κ ∪ λ) \ π (i.e., e is a κ- or λ-edge that is not a proto-edge) then there can only be one loop that contains both vertices of e, by condition (ii) in the definition ofa 2D digital complex.
As illustrations of Axiom 3, observe that both ((Z2, 4, L2×2), (4, 8)) and ((Z2, 4, L2×2), (8, 4)) satisfy Axiom 3, but ((Z2, 4, L2×2), (4, 4)) violates the “if” parts of the axiom, while ((Z2, 4, L2×2), (8, 8)) violates the “only if” parts of the axiom.
A gads is said to be finite if it has finitely many vertices; otherwise it is said to be infinite. The set ofall gads can be ordered as follows:
Definition 2.3 (⊆ order, subGADS) Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) and G' =

((V ', π', L'), (κ', λ')) be gads such that
V ⊆ V ', π ⊆ π' and L⊆ L'.
For all L ∈ L, κ ∩ L{2} = κ' ∩ L{2} and λ ∩ L{2} = λ' ∩ L{2}.
Then we write G ⊆ G' and say that G is a subGADS of G'. We also refer to G as the subGADS of G' induced by (V, π, L). We write G Ç G' to mean G ⊆ G' and G /= G'. We write G < G' to mean G Ç G' and L /= L'.
The following simple but important property of gads is an immediate consequence ofthe symmetry ofAxioms 1, 2 and 3 with respect to κ and λ:
Property 2.4 If ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) is a gads then ((V, π, L), (λ, κ)) is also a gads. So any statement which is true of every gads ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) remains true when κ is replaced by λ and λ by κ.

Interior Vertices and pgads
We are particularly interested in those gads that model a surface without boundary. The next definition gives a name for any such gads.
Definition 2.5 (pGADS) A pgads is a gads in which every proto-edge is included in two loops. (The p in pgads stands for pseudomanifold.)
A finite pgads models a closed surface. A pgads that models the Eu- clidean plane must be infinite.
A vertex v ofa gads G is called an interior vertex of G ifevery proto-edge of G that contains v is included in two loops of G. It follows that a gads G is a pgads ifand only ifevery vertex of G is an interior vertex.
Below are pictures ofsome pgads.
Example 2.6 Z2 with the 4- and 8-adjacency relations


G = ((Z2, 4, L2×2), (4, 8))
Example 2.7 Z2 with Khalimsky’s adjacency relation

G = ((Z2, 4, L2×2), (κ2, κ2)), where κ2 consists of all un- ordered pairs of 4-adjacent points and all unordered pairs of8-adjacent pure points.

Strong Connectedness and Singularities
Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be a gads. Two loops L and L' of G are said to be adjacent if L ∩ L' is a proto-edge of G. A subset L' of L is said to be strongly connected if for any two loops L and L' in L', there exists a sequence L0,..., Ln ofloops in L' such that L0 = L, Ln = L' and, for all i ∈ {0,...,n − 1}, Li and Li+1 are adjacent. G is said to be strongly connected if L is strongly connected. (So whether or not G is strongly connected depends only on the underlying complex of G.)
A vertex x of G is said to be a singularity of G if the set of all loops of G that contain x is not strongly connected. Vertices that are not singularities are said to be nonsingular. Again, whether or not x is a singularity of G depends only on the underlying complex of G.
Even a strongly connected pgads may have a singularity. For example, the pgads obtained from the torus-like pgads ofExample 2.9 above by identifying the vertices a, b and c has a singularity at a = b = c but is strongly connected.

Relationship to the Mathematical Framework of [4,5]
Here we briefly discuss the relationship between our concept of a gads and digital structures previously studied by the third author in [4,5].
If ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) is a gads, then, in the terminology of [5], (V, π) is a digital space, π is the proto-adjacency of that space, and each of κ and λ is a spel-adjacency ofthe space. The principal new ingredients in our concept ofa gads are the set ofloops L and Axioms 2 and 3. In a gads ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) with the property that every simple closed π-path oflength 4 is a loop ofthe gads, the “if” parts of Axiom 3 make {κ, λ} a normal pair ofspel-adjacencies.
An important difference between our theory and that of [4,5] is that our theory is restricted to spaces that model subsets of surfaces (though only because ofcondition (iii) in the definition ofa 2D digital complex).

Homotopic Paths and Simple Connectedness
In this section G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) is a gads, ρ satisfies π ⊆ ρ ⊆ κ ∪ λ, and X is a ρ-connected subset of V . (We are mainly interested in the cases where ρ = κ, λ or π.)
Loosely speaking, two ρ-paths in X with the same initial and the same final vertices are said to be ρ-homotopic within X in G ifone ofthe paths can be transformed into the other by a sequence of small local deformations within
X. The initial and final vertices of the path must remain fixed throughout the deformation process. The next two definitions make this notion precise.
Definition 3.1 (elementary G-deformation) Two finite vertex sequences c and c' of G with the same initial and the same final vertices are said to be the same up to an elementary G-deformation if there exist vertex sequences c1, c2, γ and γ' such that c = c1.γ.c2, c' = c1.γ'.c2, and either there is a proto-edge
{x, y} for which one of γ and γ' is (x) and the other is (x, y, x), or there is a loop of G that contains all of the vertices in γ and γ'.
Definition 3.2 (homotopic ρ-paths) Two ρ-paths c and c' in X with the same initial and the same final vertices are ρ-homotopic within X in G if there exists a sequence of ρ-paths c0,..., cn in X such that c0 = c, cn = c' and, for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, ci and ci+1 are the same up to an elementary G-deformation. Two ρ-paths with the same initial and the same final vertices are said to be ρ-homotopic in G if they are ρ-homotopic within V in G.
The next proposition states a useful characterization of ρ-homotopy that is based on a more restrictive kind of local deformation than was considered above, which allows only the insertion or removal of either a “ρ-back-and- forth” or a cycle that parameterizes a simple closed ρ-curve in a loop of G.
Definition 3.3 (minimal ρ-deformation) Two ρ-paths c and c' with the same initial and the same final vertices are said to be the same up to a minimal ρ-deformation in G if there exist ρ-paths c1, c2 and γ such that one of c and c' is c1.γ.c2, the other of c and c' is c1.c2, and either γ = (x, y, x) for some ρ-edge {x, y} or γ is a ρ-parameterization of a simple closed ρ-curve whose vertices are contained in a single loop of G.
This concept of deformation is particularly simple when ρ = π, because a simple closed π-curve whose vertices are contained in a single loop of G must in fact be a loop of G, since a loop of G is a simple closed π-curve.
Proposition 3.4 Two ρ-paths c and c' in X with the same initial and the same final vertices are ρ-homotopic within X in G if and only if there is a sequence of ρ-paths c0,..., cn in X such that c0 = c, cn = c' and, for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, ci and ci+1 are the same up to a minimal ρ-deformation in G.
The proof of this proposition is not particularly difficult, and we leave it to the interested reader.
Definition 3.5 (reducible closed path) Let c = (x0,..., xn) be a closed

ρ-path in X (so xn = x0). Then c is said to be ρ-reducible within X in G if c and the one-point path (x0) are ρ-homotopic within X in G. We say c is ρ-reducible in G if c is ρ-reducible within V in G.
Definition 3.6 (simple connectedness) The set X is said to be ρ-simply connected in G if every closed ρ-path in X is ρ-reducible within X in G. The gads G is said to be simply connected if V is π-simply connected in G.
Whether or not a gads is simply connected depends only on its underlying complex. If G is simply connected then V is ρ-simply connected in G for any ρ such that π ⊆ ρ ⊆ κ ∪ λ. This is because π ⊆ ρ ⊆ κ ∪ λ implies that for any ρ-path c there is a π-path c' such that c and c' are ρ-homotopic in G, and π ⊆ ρ implies that a π-reducible π-path is also a ρ-reducible ρ-path.
The final result in this section gives a useful sufficient condition for a gads
to have no singularities:
Proposition 3.7 Let G be a gads that is both simply connected and strongly connected. Then G has no singularities.
Proof: Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) and suppose x is a singularity of G. Then there exist two nonempty sets of loops of G, α1 = {L1,..., Li} and α2 =
{Li+1,..., Ll}, such that {L1,..., Ll} is the set of all loops of G that contain
x, and such that L ∩ L' = {x} for all L in α1 and L' in α2.
For any π-path c = (c0, c1,..., cn), let ν(c, x) be the number of pairs (ci, ci+1) for which ci belongs to a loop in α1 and ci+1 = x, minus the number of pairs (ci, ci+1) for which ci = x and ci+1 belongs to a loop in α1. It is easy to verify that if c' and c'' are two π-paths which are the same up to a minimal π-deformation in G then ν(c', x) = ν(c'', x). So, since G is simply connected, ν(c, x) = 0 for every closed π-path c (by Proposition 3.4).
Now let y be a π-neighbor of x that belongs to a loop in α1, and let z be a π-neighbor of x that belongs to a loop in α2. Since G is strongly connected, there must be a π-path c' from z to y that does not contain x. But the closed π-path c = (x, z).c'.(y, x) would satisfy ν(c, x) = 1, a contradiction. ✷

Planar GADS and a Jordan Curve Theorem
In this section we define a class of gads that are discrete models ofsubsets of the Euclidean plane. The definition depends on two concepts which we now present:
Definition 4.1 (Euler number of a GADS) Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be a finite gads. Then the integer |V |− |π| + |L| is called the Euler number of G, and is denoted by χ(G).
Note that the Euler number of a gads depends only on the underlying complex, and that it is not defined for an infinite gads.
Definition 4.2 (limit of an increasing GADS sequence) For all i ∈ N


let Gi = ((Vi, πi, Li), (κ i, λi)) b e a gad s and let G0 ⊆ G1 ⊆ G2 ⊆ .. ..

Then

i∈N
Gi denotes ((

i∈ N
Vi,

i∈N
πi,

i∈N
Li), ( 

i∈N
κi, 

i∈N
λi)), which is

a gads if each element of
i∈N Vi is contained in only finitely many distinct

members of
i∈N πi.

We are now in a position to define a planar gads. Whether or not a gads is planar depends only on its underlying complex, as can be deduced quite easily from the following definition.
Definition 4.3 (planar GADS) A pgads PG is said to be planar if PG =

 
i∈N
Gi for some infinite sequence of finite gads G0 < G1 < G2 < . . . such

that Gi is strongly connected and χ(Gi)=1 for all i ∈ N. A gads G is said to
be planar if there exists a planar pgads PG such that G ⊆ PG.
It is evident that all planar pgads are infinite and strongly connected. A somewhat less obvious property of planar pgads is that they are all simply connected. This follows quite easily from:
Proposition 4.4 Let G be a strongly connected gads and let G' be a finite
gads such that G' < G and χ(G')= 1. Then G' is simply connected.
Sketch of proof: Let G' = ((V ', π', L'), (κ', λ')). In the case where L' = ∅,
|V '|− |π'| = χ(G') = 1 and so (V ', π') is a tree. In this case the result is easily proved by induction on the number ofproto-edges. To prove the result in the case where G' has at least one loop, we use induction on the number ofloops. [The induction step is based on the easily established fact that, since G' < G and G is strongly connected, there must exist a proto-edge e of G' that belongs to just one loop of G', L say. Readily, G' is simply connected ifthe subGADS of G induced by (V ', π' \ {e}, L' \ {L}) is simply connected.] ✷
Corollary 4.5 A planar pgads is simply connected.
Proof: Let PG = ((V ∗, π∗, L∗), (κ∗, λ∗)) be a planar pgads, and suppose c∗ is a π∗-path that is not π∗-reducible in PG. By the definition ofa planar pgads, there exists a gads G' = ((V ', π', L'), (κ', λ')) which satisfies the hypotheses of the above proposition when G = PG, such that c∗ is a π'-path of G'. Since c∗ is not π∗-reducible in PG, c∗ is not π'-reducible in G', which contradicts the proposition. ✷
As a consequence ofthis corollary and Proposition 3.7, we deduce:
Proposition 4.6 A planar pgads has no singularities.
The next theorem is our main result concerning planar gads. It general- izes Rosenfeld’s digital Jordan curve theorem [10] (for Z2 with (4,8) or (8,4) adjacencies) to every planar gads. We will outline a proofofthis theorem in Section 8.
Theorem 4.7 (Jordan curve theorem) Let PG = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be a planar gads. Let C be a simple closed κ-curve that is not included in any loop of PG, and which consists entirely of interior points of PG. Then V \ C


has exactly two λ-components, and, for each vertex x ∈ C, Nλ(x) intersects both λ-components of V \ C.

Let L1 and L2 be adjacent loops of a gads G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) and let
{x, y} = L1 ∩ L2. Then π-parameterizations c1 of L1 and c2 of L2 are said to be coherent if x precedes y in one of c1 and c2 but x follows y in the other of c1 and c2. A coherent π-orientation of a set of loops L' ⊆ L is a function Ω with domain L' such that:
For each loop L in L', Ω(L) isa π-parameterization of L.
For all pairs of adjacent loops L and L' in L', the π-parameterizations Ω(L) and Ω(L') of L and L' are coherent.
Two coherent π-orientations Ω1 and Ω2 of L' are said to be equivalent if, for every L in L', Ω1(L) and Ω2(L) are equivalent π-parameterizations of L.
A coherent orientation of G is a coherent π-orientation of the set L of all loops of G. The gads G is said to be orientable ifit has a coherent orientation. Evidently, if G' and G are gads such that G' ⊆ G and G is orientable, then G' is also orientable. Note that whether or not a gads is orientable depends only on its underlying complex. It is easy to verify that the four pgads shown in the diagrams ofSection 2.3 are all examples oforientable gads.
The Cycle 𝒩Ω,y(x) Around a Nonsingular Interior Vertex x of a gads
Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be a (not necessarily orientable) gads, and let x be a nonsingular interior vertex of G.
A loop-circuit of G is a sequence (L0,..., Ll−1) ofloops of G such that, for all i ∈ {0,...,l − 1}, Li is adjacent to L(i+1) mod l. A loop-circuit of G at x is a loop-circuit of G that is an enumeration of the set of loops of G that contain x (with each of those loops occurring just once). Thus if (L0,..., Ll−1) is a loop-circuit of G at x then, for each i ∈ {0,...l − 1}, Li ∩ L(i+1) mod l is a proto-edge of G that contains x (by condition (ii) in the definition of a 2D digital complex).
The set of loops of G that contain x is strongly connected (since x is nonsingular in G), and it is easy to show that each loop in the set is adjacent to exactly two others (since x is an interior vertex of G). Therefore a loop- circuit of G at x exists.
A coherent local orientation of G at x is a coherent π-orientation of the loops of G that contain x. Let Λ = (L0,..., Ll−1) be a loop-circuit of G at x. Then the coherent local orientation of G at x induced by Λ, denoted by ΩΛ, is defined as follows. For 0 ≤ i ≤ l − 1 let ci be a π-parameterization of Li that begins and ends at x, in which the second vertex is the vertex of Li ∩

L(i−1) mod l \{x}, and the second-last vertex is the vertex of Li∩L(i+1) mod l \{x}. Then ΩΛ is defined by ΩΛ(Li)= ci for 0 ≤ i ≤ l − 1.
x	x
Now let Ω'x be any coherent local orientation of G at x. Then Ω'x(L0) is
equivalent either to ΩΛ(L0) or to (ΩΛ(L0))−1. It is readily confirmed that Ω'
x	x	x
must be equivalent to ΩΛ in the former case and to ΩΛ−1 in the latter case.
x	x
For any vertex v of G, the punctured loop neighborhood of v in G, denoted by NL(v), is defined to be the union of all the loops of G which contain v, minus the vertex v itself.
Let Ωx be a coherent local orientation of G at x. For each vertex y of
NL(x), we now define a π-cycle 𝒩Ωx,y (x) with the following properties:
The vertices of 𝒩Ωx,y (x) are exactly the vertices of NL(x).
𝒩Ωx,y (x) begins and ends at y.
Let Λ = (L0,..., Ll−1) be a loop-circuit of G at x such that ΩΛ is equivalent to Ωx. For i ∈ {0,...,l − 1} let pi be the π-path obtained from ΩΛ(Li) by removing its first and last vertices (both ofwhich are the vertex x). Then we define 𝒩Ωx,y (x) to be the π-cycle that is equivalent to the π-cycle p0.p1	pl−1
and which begins and ends at y. It is readily confirmed that this π-cycle is
independent ofour choice ofthe loop-circuit Λ (provided that ΩΛ is equivalent to Ωx). If G is orientable, and Ω is a coherent orientation of G, then we write
𝒩Ω,y(x)for 𝒩Ωx,y (x), where Ωx is the coherent local orientation of G at x that is given by the restriction ofΩ to the loops of G that contain x. The definition of 𝒩Ω,y(x) is illustrated by Figure 1.

Simply Connected gads are Orientable
In this section we outline a proofofthe following result:
Proposition 5.1 Let G be a gads that is a subGADS of a simply connected
gads. Then G is orientable.
Sketch of proof: Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be a subGADS of the simply connected gads G' = ((V ', π', L'), (κ', λ')). Suppose G is not orientable. It is not hard to show that this implies G has a loop-circuit (L0,..., Ll−1) whose

set of loops is not π-orientable, such that no two L’s are equal and, for all
i, j ∈ {0,...,l − 1}, Li is not adjacent to Lj unless j = (i ± 1) mod l.

The idea now is to construct a π'-path in 
Li that cannot be π'-

reducible in G'
0≤i≤l−1
, and so contradict the simple connectedness of
G'. For i ∈

{0,...,l − 1}, let ai, bi ∈ V be vertices such that {ai, bi} is the π-edge that is
shared by Li and L(i+1) mod l, and such that, for i ∈ {1,...,l − 1}, ai−1 and ai belong to the same π-component of Li \{bi−1, bi}. (It is possible that ai−1 = ai or bi−1 = bi.) Then it is straightforward to verify that, since {L0,..., Ll−1} is not π-orientable, al−1 and b0 must belong to the same π-component of L0\{bl−1, a0}. For i ∈ {1,..., l−1}, let ci be the simple π-path in Li\{bi−1, bi} from ai−1 to ai. Also, let cl be the simple π-path in L0 \ {bl−1, a0} from al−1 to b0. Let γ be the π-path c1.c2	cl.(b0, a0).
Define the parity ofa π'-path (x0,.	, xn) to be 0 or 1 according to whether
an even or an odd number of terms in its sequence of π'-edges ({xi, xi+1} | 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1) lie in the set {{ai, bi} | 0 ≤ i ≤ l − 1}. It is readily confirmed that π'-paths which are the same up to a minimal π'-deformation in G' have the same parity. But γ has parity 1 whereas a one-point path has parity 0. Hence γ is not π'-reducible in G', a contradiction. ✷
Since every planar pgads is simply connected (Corollary 4.5), a special case ofthe above proposition is:
Corollary 5.2 Every planar gads is orientable.

The Structure of Loops in a GADS
Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be a gads and let L be an arbitrary loop of G. In this section we present some properties that κ ∩ L{2} and λ ∩ L{2} must have. These properties will be used in the next section.
Theorem 6.1 Let C be a simple closed (κ ∩ λ)-curve in the loop L. Then C
has one of the following properties:
For all distinct x, y ∈ C, {x, y}∈ κ.
For all distinct x, y ∈ C, {x, y}∈ λ.
One way to prove this is to use the following lemma, whose proof we leave to the reader. Assertion (ii) ofthis lemma is illustrated by Figure 2.
Lemma 6.2 Let C be a simple closed (κ ∩ λ)-curve in the loop L. Then:
Assertions (a) and (b) of Axiom 3 hold with C in place of L whenever
x, y ∈ C but x and y are not (κ ∩ λ)-consecutive on C.
Let ρ = κ or λ and let a, b ∈ C be two vertices which are ρ-adjacent but not (κ∩λ)-consecutive on C. Let I1 and I2 be the two (κ∩λ)-cut-intervals of C associated with a and b. Then if x ∈ I1 and y ∈ I2 are ρ-adjacent, we have {x, a}∈ ρ, {x, b}∈ ρ, {y, a}∈ ρ and {y, b}∈ ρ.

Sketch of proof of Theorem 6.1: Let x be a vertex on C that belongs to a (λ \ κ)- or (κ \ λ)-edge of C{2}. (If no such x exists then |C| = 3 by Lemma 6.2(i), and the theorem holds.) We first show that if a and b are vertices of C then it is impossible for {x, a}∈ κ \ λ and {x, b}∈ λ \ κ to both be true. This can be established by induction on the size of the (κ ∩ λ)-cut- interval of C associated with a and b that does not contain x, using Lemma 6.2. (We begin by verifying that {x, a} ∈ κ \ λ and {x, b} ∈ λ \ κ cannot both be true if a and b are (κ ∩ λ)-consecutive on C; otherwise we could deduce a contradiction of Lemma 6.2.) Next, we deduce from Lemma 6.2 that, if y is a (κ ∩ λ)-neighbor of x on C and {x, a} ∈ κ \ λ for some a ∈ C, then either y is also a vertex of a (κ \ λ)-edge in C{2}, or else there is a vertex a', in the (κ ∩ λ)-cut-interval of C associated with x and a that contains y, such that
{x, a'}∈ κ\ λ. It follows from this (by induction on the size of the (κ∩λ)-cut- interval of C associated with x and a that contains y) that if {x, a} ∈ κ \ λ for some a ∈ C, then each (κ ∩ λ)-neighbor y of x on C is also a vertex of a (κ \ λ)-edge in C{2} — whence (by induction) every vertex of C is a vertex of a (κ \ λ)-edge in C{2}. This would imply that no vertex of C is a vertex of a (λ \ κ)-edge in C{2}, so that there are no (λ \ κ)-edges in C{2}, whence (by Lemma 6.2(i)) every pair of vertices of C are κ-adjacent. Symmetrically, if x is a vertex of a (λ \ κ)-edge in C{2} then all pairs of vertices of C are λ-adjacent. ✷
Any loop of G can be “subdivided” into simple closed (κ ∩ λ)-curves, and by Axiom 3 two vertices of the loop cannot be κ- or λ-adjacent unless one of the simple closed (κ ∩ λ)-curves contains both vertices. (Figure 3 shows a loop that can be subdivided into three simple closed (κ ∩ λ)-curves.) So the following lemma is a straightforward consequence of Theorem 6.1:
Lemma 6.3 Let (ρ, ρ) = (κ, λ) or (λ, κ), and let C be any simple closed ρ- curve included in the loop L such that |C| /= 3. Then C is a simple closed (κ ∩ λ)-curve. Moreover, {x, y}∈ ρ˜ for all x, y ∈ C.
The reader can verify that Theorem 6.1 and Lemma 6.3 hold in Figure 3.
The final result of this section implies that for any ρ satisfying π ⊆ ρ ⊆ κ ∪ λ, a ρ-parameterization of a simple closed ρ-curve whose vertices are contained in a loop L must be a subsequence ofa π-parameterization of L — loosely speaking, it must proceed in a single direction around L, and cannot

reverse direction at some vertex.
Lemma 6.4 Let ρ satisfy π ⊆ ρ ⊆ κ ∪ λ. Let C be a simple closed ρ- curve whose vertices are contained in the loop L. Let x and y be two vertices of C which are ρ-consecutive in C but not π-consecutive in L. Then either C \ {x, y}⊆ I1 or C \ {x, y}⊆ I2 where I1 and I2 are the two π-cut-intervals of L associated with the vertices x and y.
Proof: If |C| = 3 the result is immediate. If |C| > 3 then, by Lemma 6.3, C is a simple closed (κ ∩ λ)-curve and therefore {x, y} ∈ κ ∩ λ, so the result follows from Axiom 3. ✷

The Intersection Number
Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be an orientable gads and let Ω be a coherent orientation of G. In this section we define an intersection number ofa (κ ∪ λ)- path p with a closed (κ ∪ λ)-path c, which we denote by IΩ . The intersection number is defined only ifevery common vertex ofthe two paths is a nonsingular interior vertex of G. Loosely speaking, it is the number of times the path p crosses from the right of the closed path c to its left, minus the number of times p crosses c from left to right.
Our intersection number is a generalization to gads of the intersection number between paths of surfels in digital boundaries that was defined and used in [1,2], except that we only define the intersection number when one of the two paths is closed. 8 Our main result about the intersection number (Theorem 7.7) is that in an orientable gads the intersection number of a λ- path with a closed κ-path is invariant under λ-homotopic deformations of the λ-path, assuming that all vertices ofthe closed κ-path are nonsingular interior vertices of G. As we shall see in the next section, this fact can be used to prove our Jordan curve theorem for planar gads (Theorem 4.7 above).
The definition ofthe intersection number is based on the idea that, for each three-vertex segment (x0, x1, x2) ofa (κ ∪λ)-path in which x1 is a nonsingular interior vertex of G, we can partition the set NL(x1) \{x0, x2} into a “left” side and a “right” side with respect to the segment (x0, x1, x2), using the π-cycle

8 It is quite easy to extend our definition to two paths that are not closed.


𝒩Ω,x0 (x1) defined in Section 5.2. The details of this are given in the next definition. Note that since {x0, x1}, {x1, x2} ∈ κ ∪ λ, Axiom 2 implies that x0, x2 ∈ NL(x1), so that x2 lies on the π-cycle 𝒩Ω,x0 (x1).
Definition 7.1 Let (x0, x1, x2) be a segment of a (κ ∪ λ)-path, where x1 is a nonsingular interior vertex of G, and let 𝒩Ω,x0 (x1) = (v0,..., vn), so that v0 = vn = x0. Let h ∈ {0,..., n} be the integer such that vh = x2. Then we define RΩ(x0, x1, x2)= {vi | 0 < i < h} and LΩ(x0, x1, x2)= {vi | h < i < n}.
Let c = (x0,..., xl) be a closed (κ ∪ λ)-path. If xi is a nonsingular interior vertex of G, we write Rightc (i) and Leftc (i) for RΩ(x(i−1) mod l, xi, x(i+1) mod l)
and LΩ(x(i−1) mod l, xi, x(i+1) mod l), respectively. Now let {y, z} be a (κ ∪ λ)-
edge. If one of y and z is not an interior vertex of G or is a singularity of G,

and that vertex is also a vertex of c, then Wc
is undefined. Otherwise, we

define Wc
= Σl−1 Wc
(i), where:

(y,z)
i=0	(y,z)

Wc	(i)= −0.5 if y = xi and z ∈ Rightc (i), or if z = xi and y ∈ Leftc (i).

Wc
(i)= +0.5 if y = xi and z ∈ Leftc (i), or if z = xi and y ∈ Rightc (i).

(i) = 0 otherwise.

Definition 7.2 (intersection number) Let p = (y0,..., yh) be a (κ ∪ λ)- path, and c a closed (κ ∪ λ)-path, such that every common vertex of c and p
is a nonsingular interior vertex of G. Then the intersection number of p with
c, denoted by IΩ , is defined to be Σh−1 Wc	.

The next two lemmas state fundamental properties of the intersection num- ber that follow without much difficulty from this definition.
Lemma 7.3 Let c be a closed (κ ∪ λ)-path, and let p', p1 and p2 be (κ ∪ λ)- paths such that p' = p1.p2. Suppose further that every common vertex of c and
p' is a nonsingular interior vertex of G. Then IΩ ' = IΩ  + IΩ .

c,p2

Lemma 7.4 If c1 and c2 are closed (κ ∪ λ)-paths and every common vertex

of c1 and c2 is a nonsingular interior vertex of G, then IΩ
c2,c1 .

The next Lemma can be proved using Lemma 6.4: It is a consequence of Axiom 3 and the fact that a λ-parameterization of a simple closed λ-curve that lies in a loop of G must proceed in a single direction around that loop.
Lemma 7.5 Let C be a simple closed λ-curve whose vertices all lie in a single loop of G. Let c = (x0,..., xl) be a λ-parameterization of C. Then C has one of the following two properties:
For each i such that xi is a nonsingular interior vertex of G,
Nκ(xi) \ C ⊆ Rightc (i), and
Nκ(xi) ∩ C \ {x(i−1) mod l, x(i+1) mod l}⊆ Leftc (i).
For each i such that xi is a nonsingular interior vertex of G,
Nκ(xi) \ C ⊆ Leftc (i), and
Nκ(xi) ∩ C \ {x(i−1) mod l, x(i+1) mod l}⊆ Rightc (i).

This lemma can be used to prove the following important result:
Proposition 7.6 Let c be a λ-parameterization of a simple closed λ-curve whose vertices all lie in a single loop of G, and let c' be a closed κ-path such that every common vertex of c and c' is a nonsingular interior vertex of G. Then IΩ ' = 0.
Sketch of proof: Let c = (x0,..., xl), let C be the simple closed λ-curve parameterized by c, and let c' = (y0,..., yh). (Thus xl = x0 and yh = y0.) For

all j such that yj and yj+1 both lie on C, Wc
= 0. (Indeed, Wc
j  j+1
(i) = 

0 except possibly at the two values of i in 0,...,l− 1 for which xi ∈ {yj, yj+1}.

c
(yj,yj+1)
(i) = 0 for both of those values of i if yj and yj+1 are λ-consecutive

on C, and by Lemma 7.5 Wc
j  j+1
(i) is +0.5 for one value of i and −0.5 for

the other if yj and yj+1 are not λ-consecutive on C.) Lemma 7.5 also implies

c
(yj,yj+1)
has one nonzero value (±0.5) for all j such that yj ∈ C and

yj+1 ∈/ C, and has the opposite nonzero value for all j such that yj ∈/ C and
yj+1 ∈ C. Since c' is a closed λ-curve, there are exactly as many values of j in 0,...,h − 1 for which yj ∈ C and yj+1 ∈/ C as there are values of j for which
yj ∈/ C and yj+1 ∈ C. Hence IΩ ' = Σh−1 Wc	= 0. ✷

Using this proposition and Proposition 3.4, we now prove:
Theorem 7.7 Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be an orientable gads, and let Ω be a coherent orientation of G. Let c be a closed κ-path all of whose vertices are nonsingular interior vertices of G, and let p and q be two λ-paths which are

λ-homotopic in G. Then IΩ
Ω
c,q

Corollary 7.8 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 7.7, IΩ ' =0 for any closed
λ-path c' that is λ-reducible in G.
Proof of Theorem 7.7: By Proposition 3.4, it is sufficient to prove Theo- rem 7.7 when p and q are the same up to a minimal λ-deformation in G. There are two cases. First suppose p = p1.(x, y, x).p2 and q = p1.p2, where {x, y}∈ λ.

Then (by Lemma 7.3) IΩ

Note that, by Property 2.4, this theorem, Lemma 7.5 and Proposition 7.6 all remain true when κ is replaced by λ and λ by κ.
A Proof of the Jordan Curve Theorem
As an application of the intersection number, we now outline a proof of the Jordan curve theorem for planar gads (Theorem 4.7 above). Since a planar pgads is orientable (Corollary 5.2), has no singularities (Proposition 4.6), and

is simply connected (Corollary 4.5), this theorem follows from the following more general result:
Theorem 8.1 Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be a gads that is a subGADS of an orientable pgads G' = ((V ', π', L'), (κ', λ')) which has no singularities. Let c be a κ-parameterization of a simple closed κ-curve C of G such that
C is not included in any loop of G.
Every vertex in C is an interior vertex of G.
c is κ'-reducible in G'.
Then V \ C has exactly two λ-components, and, for each vertex x ∈ C, Nλ(x)
intersects both λ-components of V \ C.
It is perhaps worth mentioning that in this theorem the hypothesis that G' is orientable is not really necessary, but is included because we wish to give a proofofthe theorem that uses the intersection number (which is only defined in orientable gads).
Regarding condition (ii), note that an interior vertex v of G cannot be a vertex of a (π' \ π)-edge, and cannot be a singularity of G, for in both cases v would be a singularity of G', contrary to the hypothesis that G' has no singularities.
A first step in proving Theorem 8.1 is to prove:
Lemma 8.2 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 8.1, let Ω be a coherent ori- entation of G', and let c = (x0,..., xl), so that xl = x0.  Then, for all
i ∈ {0,..., l}, each of the sets Leftc (i) \ C and Rightc (i) \ C is nonempty
Ω	Ω
and λ-connected, and contains at least one vertex in Nλ(x).
Note that Leftc (i) and Rightc (i) are sets ofvertices of G, since the vertices
Ω	Ω
of c are interior vertices of G. This lemma can be proved using Theorem 6.1.
(Subdivide the loops of G into simple closed (κ ∩ λ)-curves.) We omit the details here. Using this lemma, it is not hard to prove the following result:
Proposition 8.3 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 8.1, V \ C has at least two λ-components.
Proof: Suppose V \ C is λ-connected. Since V ' is π'-connected (by condition
(i) in the definition ofa 2D digital complex), for each vertex of V ' \C there is a shortest π'-path from that vertex to a vertex in C, and the second-last vertex on such a path must be in V \ C because all vertices of C are interior vertices of G. So the fact that V \ C is λ-connected implies V ' \ C is λ'-connected.
Let Ω be a coherent orientation of G', let c = (x0,..., xl) (so that xl = x0), and pick i ∈ {0,..., l}. By Lemma 8.2 there exist vertices y ∈ Leftc (i) ∩ Nλ(xi) \ C and z ∈ Rightc (i) ∩ Nλ(xi) \ C. As V ' \ C is λ'-connected, there is a λ'-path α in V ' \ C from y to z. The closed λ'-path α' = α.(z, xi, y) satisfies

IΩ ' = 1. But c is κ'-reducible in G', so IΩ
= 0 by Theorem 7.7 (with κ

c,α
α',c

replaced by λ' and λ by κ') and, by Lemma 7.4, IΩ ' = 0, a contradiction. ✷


The next proposition will be used to prove that the set V \C in Theorem 8.1 cannot have more than two λ-components. For any set ρ of unordered pairs of vertices of a gads, we say that a set A of vertices of the gads is a ρ-arc if A is a singleton set, or if A is a finite ρ-connected set with the following property: There are two (and only two) elements of A that each have just one ρ-neighbor in A, and all other elements of A have exactly two ρ-neighbors in
A. Note that if C is any simple closed ρ-curve and p ∈ C then C − {p} is a ρ-arc. Each element of a ρ-arc A that does not have two ρ-neighbors in A is called an extremity of A.
Proposition 8.4 Let G = ((V, π, L), (κ, λ)) be a gads. Let A be a κ-arc such that every vertex in A is an interior vertex of G and no vertex in A is a singularity of G. Then V \ A is λ-connected.
Sketch of proof: Our first step is to prove that NL(x) \ A is nonempty and λ-connected if x is an extremity of A. This assertion, like Lemma 8.2, can be proved using Theorem 6.1. Again, we omit the details.
Having established this assertion, we prove the proposition by induction on |A|. When |A| = 1, the result follows from the assertion, since V is π- connected. Assume the result holds when |A| = k, and suppose |A| = k + 1. Let x be an extremity of A, and let A' = A\{x}. Let v be any vertex in V \A. By the induction hypothesis v is λ-connected in V \A' to x, and hence to some vertex of Nλ(x) \ A'. A shortest λ-path in V \ A' from v to Nλ(x) \ A' does not pass through x. Hence v is λ-connected even in V \ A to some vertex of Nλ(x) \ A' ⊆ NL(x) \ A. Since v is an arbitrary vertex in V \ A and NL(x) \ A is λ-connected (by the above assertion), V \ A is λ-connected. ✷
Proof of Theorem 8.1: From Proposition 8.3 we know that V \ C has at least two λ-components. Now let x be a vertex of C, and let A be the κ-arc C \ {x}. Let v be any vertex in V \ C. By Proposition 8.4, v is λ-connected in V \ A to x, and hence to some vertex in Nλ(x) \ A. A shortest λ-path in V \ A from v to Nλ(x) \ A does not pass through x, so v is λ-connected even in V \ C to some vertex in Nλ(x) \ A. Since this applies to any vertex v in V \ C, every λ-component of V \ C intersects Nλ(x) \ A.
Moreover, since Nλ(x) \ A ⊆ NL(x) \ C, we can deduce that V \ C has no more λ-components than NL(x) \ C. But if c = (x0,..., xl), so that xl = x0, and i is the integer in {0,...,l − 1} such that x = xi, then NL(x) \ C = (Leftc (i) ∪ Rightc (i)) \ C does not have more than two λ-components, by
Ω	Ω
Lemma 8.2. Hence V \ C cannot have more than two λ-components. ✷


Concluding Remarks
A new approach to 2D digital topology (including the digital topology of boundary surfaces), based on an axiomatization of the spaces being studied, has been presented. A space that satisfies our axioms is called a gads. In-

stances of this very general concept include gads corresponding to all of the good pairs ofadjacency relations that have previously been used (by ourselves or others) in digital topology on planar grids and boundary surfaces.
Some results that have been established in the literature for certain specific digital spaces have been generalized to gads (e.g., a homotopy invariance theorem for intersection numbers of digital paths, and a digital Jordan curve theorem). There are many other results of digital topology for which this could be done, such as results about simple points and boundary tracking. The problem ofdeveloping a 3D version ofthis theory seems more challenging.
