Abstract
The closure operations on Z × Z introduced and studied in the paper generalize the Khalimsky topology, which is commonly used as a basic topological structure in digital topology nowadays. By proving a digital analogy of the Jordan curve theorem for these closure operations, we show that they are also suitable for solving problems of digital topology. We mention some advantages of the closure operations studied over the Khalimsky topology.


Introduction
Topological structures which are more general than the usual topology occur in many branches of mathematics and are utilized in numerous applications. Especially, closure operations fulfilling only some of the Kuratowski closure axioms proved to provide a suitable framework for various approaches to dig- ital topology - see [16]. The closure operations employed in the present paper are obtained from the Kuratowski closure operations by omitting the axioms of idempotency and additivity (but retaining the axiom of monotony). We will use the advantage of the closure spaces over the usual topological spaces which consists in a better behaviour of connectedness with respect to quotient maps.
The paper is a continuation of the work [15] where closure operations associated with α-ary relations (α > 1 an ordinal) were studied with a special emphasis upon those defined on the set of integers Z. For the convenience of the reader, the relevant material from [15] is repeated without proofs, which

makes our exposition self-contained. For each natural number n > 1 we define a closure operation on Z × Z which is obtained as a product of two copies of a closure operation on Z associated with a special n-ary relation on Z. In the particular case n = 2 we get the Khalimsky topology. The closure operations defined are studied and, as the main result, an analogy of the Jordan curve theorem is formulated and proved for them. (Recall that the classical Jordan curve theorem states that a simple closed curve in the real plane separates the
plane into precisely two components). It means that these closure operations can be used, as an alternative to the Khalimsky topology, for solving problems of computer graphics and computer image processing. We also demonstrate that using them has some advantages over using the Khalimsky topology.

Preliminaries
By a closure operation u on a set X we mean a map u: exp X → exp X fulfilling u∅ = ∅, A ⊆ X ⇒ A ⊆ uA, and A ⊆ B ⊆ X ⇒ uA ⊆ uB. Such closure operations were studied by E. Cˇech in [1] (who called them topologies). A pair (X, u), where X is a set and u is a closure operation on X, is called a closure space. Given a pair u, v of closure operations on a set X, we put u ≤ v if uA ⊆ vA for each A ⊆ X. Clearly, ≤ is a partial order on the set of all closure operations on X. A closure operation u on a set X is called additive
or idempotent if A, B ⊆ X ⇒ u(A ∪ B) = uA ∪ uB or A ⊆ X ⇒ uuA = uA
respectively. A closure operation u on a set X which is both additive and idempotent is called a Kuratowski closure operation or briefly a topology and the pair (X, u) is called a topological space. According to [13], given a cardinal n > 1, a closure operation u on a set X and the closure space (X, u) are called an Sn-closure operation and an Sn-space respectively if the following condition is satisfied:
A ⊆ X ⇒ uA =  {uB; B ⊆ A, card B < n}.
S2-closure operations and S2-spaces are called quasi-discrete in [2]. S2- topological spaces are often called Alexandroff spaces - see e.g. [8]. Of course, any S2-closure operation is additive, and any Sm-closure operation is an Sn-
closure operation whenever m, n are cardinals with 1 < m < n. Since any closure operation on a set X is obviously an Sn-closure operation for each cardinal n with n > card X, there exists a least cardinal n such that u is an Sn-closure operation. Such a cardinal is then an important invariant of
the closure operation u. Evidently, if n ≤ ℵ0, then any additive Sn-closure operation is an S2-closure operation.
We will work with some basic topological concepts naturally extended from topological spaces to closure ones. Given a closure space (X, u), a subset A ⊆ X is called closed if uA = A, and it is called open if X − A is closed. A closure space (X, u) is said to be a subspace of a closure space (Y, v) if
X ⊆ Y and uA = vA ∩ X for each subset A ⊆ X. We will speak briefly about a subspace X of (Y, v). A closure space (X, u) is said to be connected

if ∅ and X are the only subsets of X which are both closed and open. A subset X ⊆ Y is considered to be connected in a closure space (Y, v) if the subspace X of (Y, v) is connected. A maximal connected subset of a closure space is called a component of this space. All the basic properties of connected sets and components in topological spaces (see e.g. [3]) are preserved also in closure spaces. A closure space (X, u) is said to be a T0-space if for any points x, y ∈ X from x ∈ u{y} and y ∈ u{x} it follows that x = y, and it is called a T 1 -space if each singleteon subset of X is closed or open. Given closure spaces
2
(X, u) and (Y, v), a map ϕ : X → Y is said to be a continuous map of (X, u)
into (Y, v) if f (uA) ⊆ vf(A) for each subset A ⊆ X. If, moreover, ϕ is a bijection and ϕ−1 : Y → X is a continuous map of (Y, v) into (X, u), then ϕ is called a homeomorphism of (X, u) onto (Y, v). We say that closure spaces (X, u) and (Y, v) (and the closure operations u and v) are homeomorphic if there exists a homeomorphism of (X, u) onto (Y, v).
If (Xj, uj), j ∈ J, is a system of closure spaces , then the closure operation
v on	j∈J Xj generated by the projections prj :	j∈J Xj → Xj, j ∈ J (i.e.,
the greatest - with respect to ≤ - closure operation v on	j∈J Xj such that
all projec tions prj : (	j∈J Xj, v) → (X j, uj), j ∈ J, are continuous) is given

by vA =
j∈J ujprj(A) whenever A ⊆
j∈J Xj .

Let (X, u), (Y, v) be closure spaces and let f : (X, u) → (Y, v) be a sur-
jective map. Then f is a quotient map (i.e., v is the least - with respect to ≤
- closure operation on Y such that the map f : (X, u) → (Y, v) is continuous) if and only if vB = f (uf−1(B)) for any B ⊆ Y .
Clearly, if (X, u), (Y, v) are closure spaces, f : (X, u) → (Y, v) is a contin- uous map and B is a closed subset of (Y, v), then f−1(B) is closed in (X, u). For quotient maps the following stronger statement obviously holds:
Lemma 1.1 Let (X, u), (Y, v) be closure spaces, f : (X, u) → (Y, v) a quo- tient map and B ⊆ Y a subset. Then B is closed in (Y, v) if and only if f−1(B) is closed in (X, u).
We will need the following
Lemma 1.2 Let (X, u), (Y, v) be closure spaces, let v be idempotent and let f : (X, u) → (Y, v) be a continuous surjection. Then f is a quotient map if and only if f (uf−1(B)) is closed in (Y, v) for each B ⊆ Y .
Proof. If f  :  (X, u)  →  (Y, v) is a quotient map, then f (uf−1(B))
= vB and, as v is idempotent, f (uf−1(B)) is closed in (Y, v) for each B ⊆ Y . Conversely, let f (uf−1(B)) be closed in (Y, v) whenever B ⊆ Y .  Since B ⊆ f (uf−1(B)), we get vB ⊆ f (uf−1(B)). As the inverse inclusion clearly holds (because f is continuous), we have f (uf−1(B)) = vB.  Therefore, f : (X, u) → (Y, v) is a quotient map.	✷
Corollary 1.3 Let (X, u), (Y, v) be closure spaces, let v be idempotent and let f : (X, u) → (Y, v) be a quotient map. Then the restriction f | f−1(B) : f−1(B) → B is a quotient map for each subset B of (Y, v).

Proof. Let B be a subset of (Y, v). Clearly, f | f−1(B) : f−1(B) → B is a continuous surjection. Let C ⊆ B be an arbitrary subset. As f | f−1(C) = vC and v is idempotent, f (uf−1(C)) is closed in (Y, v) and we clearly have f (uf−1(C) ∩f−1(B)) = f (uf−1(C)) ∩B. Consequently, f (uf−1(C) ∩f−1(B)) is closed in the subspace B of (Y, v) (because, given a subspace T of a closure
space (Z, w) and a subset A ⊆ Z, A ∩ T is closed in the subspace T whenever
A is closed in (Z, w)). Thus, by Lemma 1.2, f | f−1(B) is a quotient map. ✷
As usual, given a map f : X → Y , a ﬁbre of f is any set f−1(y) with y ∈ Y . If all fibres of f are connected, then we say that f has connected fibres. For closure spaces, the following analogy of a theorem known for topological spaces is valid:
Proposition 1.4 Let (X, u), (Y, v) be closure spaces, let v be idempotent and let f : (X, u) → (Y, v) be a quotient map having connected ﬁbres. Then (X, u) is connected if and only if (Y, v) is connected.
Proof. If (X, u) is connected, then (Y, v) is connected because f is continuous. Let (Y, v) be connected. Let X = X1 ∪ X2 where X1, X2 are disjoint closed subsets of (X, u). Put Yi = f (Xi) for i = 1, 2. As f has connected fibres, Y1 ∩ Y2 = ∅ (because for each connected subset C ⊆ X we clearly have C ∩ X1 = ∅ or C ∩ X2 = ∅) and thus Xi = f−1(Yi) for i = 1, 2. Since f is a quotient map, we have Y1 ∪ Y2 = Y and, by Lemma 1.1, Y1 and Y2 are closed. Therefore, Y1 or Y2 is empty, hence X1 or X2 is empty. Consequently, (X, u) is connected.	✷
Corollary 1.5 Let (X, u), (Y, v) be closure spaces, let v be idempotent and let f : (X, u) → (Y, v) be a quotient map having connected ﬁbres. Then a subset B ⊆ Y is connected in (Y, v) if and only if f−1(B) is connected in (X, u).
Proof. The statement follows from Corollary 1.3 and Proposition 1.4.   ✷
Remark 1.6 Recall that for topological spaces (and topological quotient maps) the Proposition 1.4 and Corollary 1.5 are not valid in general. They are valid provided that B is open or closed (see e.g. [3]).
From now on, n will denote a natural number with n > 1. As natural num- bers are understand to be finite cardinals, we always have n = {0, 1, ..., n− 1}. Given a set X, we denote by Xn the set of all maps of n into X, i.e., ordered n-touples (xi| i < n) consisting of elements of X. Ordered n-touples will be sometimes referred to as finite sequences. Any subset R ⊆ Xn is called an
n-ary relation on X and the pair (X, R) is called an n-ary relational system. An n-ary relation on a set X is said to be reflexive if it contains all constant
n-touples consisting of elements of the set X. Given n-ary relational systems (X, R) and (Y, S), a map ϕ : X → Y is called a homomorphism of (X, R) into (Y, S) if the implication (xi| i < n) ∈ R ⇒ (ϕ(xi)| i < n) ∈ S is valid. If Rj is an n-ary relation on a set Xj for each j ∈ J, then the product of the system Rj,


j ∈ J, is the n-ary relation 
 j∈J

Rj on the cartesian product 


j∈J

Xj gener-

ated by the projections prj :	j∈J Xj → Xj, j ∈ J (i.e., the greatest - with

respect to the set inclusion - n-ary relation R on
j∈J Xj such that all pro-

 jections prj : (	j∈J Xj, R) →  (Xj, Rj), j ∈ J, are homomorphisms). Clearly,
j∈J Rj = {(xi| i < n) ∈ (	j∈J Xj)n; (prj(xi)| i < n) ∈ Rj for each j ∈ J}.
Analogously to the cartesian product of sets, also the product of a pair R, S
of n-ary relations will be usually denoted by R × S.
Let (X, R), (Y, S) be n-ary relational systems and f : (X, R) → (Y, S) a surjective map. Then f is a quotient map (i.e., S is the least - with respect to the set inclusion - n-ary relation on Y  such that f : (X, R) → (Y, S) is a homomorphism) if and only if, whenever (yi| i < n) ∈ Y n, we have
(yi| i < n) ∈ S ⇔ ∀i < n ∃xi ∈ f−1(yi) : (xi| i < n) ∈ R. It is obvious that
relational systems are quotient-productive, i.e., if (Xi, Ri), (Yi, Si) are n-ary relational systems a nd fi : (X i, Ri) → (Y, Si) is a quotient map for each i ∈ I,

then also the map
i∈I fi :
i∈I (Xi, Ri) →
i∈I (Yi, Si) is quotient.

Closure operations associated with relations
Most results and definitions of this paragraph are taken from [15] (where all proofs not presented here can be found).  Let X be a set and R an n-ary
relation on X. Then we define a map uR: exp X → exp X as follows:
uRA = A ∪ {x ∈ X; there exist (xi| i < n) ∈ R and i0, 0 < i0 < n, such that x = xi0 and xi ∈ A for all i < i0}.
Clearly, uR is a closure operation on X. It can be shown that uR is idem- potent if and only if (X, uR) is an Alexandroff topological space. Of course, uR is not additive in general, but, on the othere hand, the union of a system of closed subsets of (X, uR) is a closed subset of (X, uR).
Obviously, we have:
Proposition 2.1 For any n-ary relation R on a set X, (X, uR) is an Sn- space.
We will need the following assertion:
Proposition 2.2 Let (X, R), (Y, S) be n-ary relational systems and let f : (X, R) → (Y, S) be a quotient map. Then f : (X, uR) → (Y, uS) is a quotient map.
Proof. Let B ⊆ Y , y ∈ Y and suppose that y ∈ uSB. Then there exist (yi| i < n) ∈ S and a natural number i0, 0 < i0 < n, such that y = yi0 and yi ∈ B for all i < i0. Further, for each i < n there exists xi ∈ f−1(yi) such that (xi| i < n) ∈ R. Now we have y = f (xi0 ) and xi0 ∈ uR{xi| i < i0} ⊆ uRf−1(B). Hence y ∈ f (uRf−1(B)).
Conversely, suppose that y ∈ f (uRf−1(B)). Then there is x ∈ uRf−1(B) such that f (x) = y. Next, there exist (xi| i < n) ∈ R and a natural number


i0, 0 < i0 < n, such that x = xi and xi ∈ f−1(B) for each i < i0. Since (f (xi)| i < n) ∈ S, we have y = f (xi0 ) ∈ uS{f (xi); i < i0} ⊆ uSB (because
{f (xi); i < i0}⊆ B). Thus, vB = f (uf−1(B)) and the proof is complete.  ✷
Definition 2.3 An n-ary relation R on a set X is said to be terse provided that it is reflexive and fulfils the following condition:
If (xi| i < n) ∈ R, (yi| i < n) ∈ R, and there are natural numbers i0, i1 < n, i0 /= i1, such that x0 = yi0 and x1 = yi1 , then (xi| i < n) = (yi| i < n).
Thus, an n-ary relation R is terse if and only if R is reflexive and any nonconstant n-touple (xi| i < n) ∈ R is injective and is the only n-touple belonging to R which contains the elements x0 and x1. So, a binary relation is terse if and only if it is reflexive and antisymmetric.
Proposition 2.4 Let R be a terse n-ary relation on a set X. Then (X, uR) is a T0-space and R is a minimal element (with respect to the set inclusion) of the set of all reflexive α-ary relations S on X fulﬁlling uR = uS.
Proposition 2.5 For terse n-ary relations the correspondence R '→ uR is one-to-one.
Definition 2.6 A closure operation u on a set X and the closure space (X, u) are called an S∗-closure operation and and S∗-space respectively if there is a
n	n
terse n-ary relation R on X such that u = uR. This (unique) relation R will
be denoted by Ru.
Clearly, the (relational) product of a system of terse n-ary relations is a terse n-ary relation. This fact, together with Proposition 2.5, enables us to define:
Definition 2.7 Let (Xj, uj), j ∈ J, be a system of S∗-spaces. By the product

of this system we understand the S∗-space (
n
j∈J Xj, uR) where R =
j∈J Ruj .

The product of a pair (X, u), (Y, v) of S∗-spaces will be denoted by (X, u)×
(Y, v).
Remark 2.8 Let (Xj, uj), j ∈ J, be a system of S∗-spaces and let v be the

closure operation on
n
j∈J Xj generated by the projections prj :
j∈J Xj →

Xj, j ∈ J. If (
j∈J Xj, u) is the product of the system defined in 2.7, then it

can easily be seen that u ≤ v. The equality u = v is valid, in general, only for
n = 2.
Definition 2.9 Let R be an n-ary relation on a set X and let p be a natural number with 1 < p ≤ n. An ordered p-touple (yi| i < p) of points of X is called a connected element in (X, uR) if there is an n-touple (xi| i < n) ∈ R such that yi = xi for all i < p or yi = xp−1−i for all i < p.
Clearly, each connected element is a connected set.	We will need the following observation which immediately follows from Definition 2.9:


Lemma 2.10 Let (yi| i < p) be a connected element in (X, uR) and let (xi| i < n) ∈ R be an n-touple with yi = xi for all i < p or yi = xp−1−i for all i < p. If i0 < p is a natural number, then either (yi0−i| i ≤ i0) or (yi| i0 ≤ i < p) is a connected element in (X, uR) with the ﬁrst member yi0 and the last one x0.
Definition 2.11 Let R be an n-ary relation on a set X. A finite nonempty sequence C = (xi| i < m) of points of X is called a path in (X, uR) if, whenever m > 1, there is a finite increasing sequence (jk| k < p) of natural numbers with j0 = 0 and jp−1 = m − 1 such that (xj| jk ≤ j ≤ jk+1) is a connected element in (X, uR) for each natural number k < p − 1.
Clearly, each path is a connected set and each connected element is a path. If (xi| i < m) is a path, then also its inversion, i.e., the sequence (yi| i < m) where yi = xm−1−i for all i < m, is a path. Further, if (xi| i < m), (yi| i < p) are paths such that xm−1 = y0, then also their union, i.e., the sequence (zi| i < m + p − 1) where zi = xi for all i < n and zi = yi−m+1 for all i with m ≤ i < p, is a path.
Theorem 2.12 Let R be an n-ary relation on a set X and A ⊆ X be a subset. Then A is connected in (X, uR) if and only if any two points of A can be joined by a path in (X, uR) contained in A.
Lemma 2.13 Let (X0, R0), (X1, R1) be reflexive n-ary relational systems and let (yj| i < pj) be a connected element in (Xj, uR ) for each j = 0, 1. Then
i	j
{y0; i < p0}× {y1; i < p1} is a connected set in (X0, uR ) × (X1, uR ).
i	i	0	1
Proof. For each j = 0, 1, there is an n-touple (xj| i < n) ∈ Rj such that

j = xj
for all i < pj or yj
j pj−1−i
for all i < pj. Let y ∈ {y0; i < p0}× 

{y1; i < p1} be an arbitrary element. Then there are natural numbers i0, i1
with i0 < p0, i1 < p1 such that y = (y0 , y1 ). By Lemma 2.10, (y0	| i ≤ i0)
i0	i1	i0−i
or (y0| i0 ≤ i < p0) is a connected element in (X0, uR ) with the first member
i	0
y0 and the last one x0. Denote this connected element by (z0| i < q0) and put
i0	0	i
C0 = ((z0, y1 )| i < q0). As (X1, R1) is reflexive, C0 is a connected element in
i	i1
(X0, uR ) × (X1, uR ) whose last member equals (x0, y1 ). Further, by Lemma
0	1	0	i1
2.10, (y1	| i ≤ i1) or (y1| i1 ≤ i < p1) is a connected element in (X1, uR ) with
i1−i	i	1
the first member y1 and the last one x1. Denote this connected element by
(z1| i < q1) and put C1 = ((z0	, z1)| i < q1). As (X0, R0) is reflexive, C1 is a
i	q0−1	i
connected element in (X0, uR )×(X1, uR ) whose first member equals (x0, y1 ).
0	1	0	i1
Now, the union of the connected elements C1 and C2 is a connected element
in (X0, uR ) × (X1, uR ) with the first member (y0 , y1 ) = y and the last one
0	1	i0	i1
(x0, x1). We have shown that any point y ∈ {y0; i < p0}× {y1; i < p1} can
0	1	i	i
be joined with the point (x0, x1) ∈ {y0; i < p0}× {y1; i < p1} by a path
0	0	i	i
contained in {y0; i < p0}× {y1; i < p1}. Now the statement follows from
i	i
Theorem 2.12.	✷
Lemma 2.14 Let (X0, R0), (X1, R1) be reflexive n-ary relational systems and let Cj = (xj| i < pj) be a path in (Xj, uR ) for each j = 0, 1. Then {x0; i < 
i	j	i
p0}× {x1; i < p1} is a connected set in (X0, uR ) × (X1, uR ).
i	0	1

Proof. If C0 or C1 contains only one member, then the assertion is trivial because (X0, R0) and (X1, R1) are reflexive. So, suppose that both C0 and C1 contain more than one member. By Definition 2.11., for each j = 0, 1 there is a finite increasing sequence (ij | k < qj) of natural numbers with

ij = 0 and ij	= pj − 1 such that (xj| ij ≤ i ≤ ij
) is a connected

0	qj−1	i	k	k+1
element in (Xj, uRj ) for each natural number k < qj − 1. For each j = 0, 1,

putting Cj = {xj; ij
≤ i ≤ ij	}, we get {xj; i < pj} = 
Cj. Thus,

k	i	k
k+1	i
k<qj−1	k

{x0; i < p0}× {x1; i < p1} =
(C0 × C1 ) where C0
× C1

i	i	k0<q0−1
k1<q1−1	k0	k1
k0	k1

is connected in (X0, uR0 ) × (X1, uR1 ) for any k0 < q0 − 1 and any k1 < q1 − 1
by Lemma 2.13. Thus, whenever k0 < q0 − 1, (C0 × C1 | k1 < qm−1 − 1) is
a finite sequence of connected sets such that any two consecutive members of

it have nonempty intersection. Therefore, the set Dk0
= 
k1<q1− 1
0 × C1 )

is a connected set. We have {x0; i < p0}× {x1; i < p1} =
Dk .

i	i	k0<q0−1	0
This proves the statement because any two consecutive members of the finite
sequence (Dk0 | k0 < q0 − 1) have nonempty intersection.	✷
Theorem 2.15 Let (X0, R0), (X1, R1) be reflexive n-ary relational systems and let Yj ⊆ Xj be a subset for each j = 0, 1. Then Yj is connected in (Xj, uRj ) for each j = 0, 1 if and only if Y0 × Y1 is connected in (X0, uR0 ) × (X1, uR1 ).
Proof. Let Yj be connected in (Xj, uRj ) for each j = 0, 1 and let (x0, x1), (y0, y1) ∈ Y0 × Y1 be arbitrary points. Then, for each j = 0, 1, there is a path (zj| i < pj) in (X0, uR ) × (X1, uR ) joining the points xj and yj which
i	0	1
is contained in Yj.	As {z0; i < p0} × {z1; i < p1} contains the points
i	i
(x0, x1), (y0, y1) and is connected in (X0, uR0 ) × (X1, uR1 ) by Lemma 2.14,
there is a path in (X0, uR0 ) × (X1, uR1 ) joining the points (x0, x1) and (y0, y1)
which is contained in {z0; i < p0}× {z1; i < p1}. Thus, Y0 × Y1 is connected
i	i
in (X0, uR ) × (X1, uR ) because {z0| i < p0}× {z1| i < p1}⊆ Y0 × Y1.
0	1	i	i
Conversely, let Y0 × Y1 be connected in (X0, uR0 ) × (X1, uR1 ) and let v denote the closure operation on X0 × X1 generated by the projections prj : X0 × X1 → Xj, j = 0, 1. By Remark 2.8, u ≤ v. Thus, as the projections prj : (X0 × X1, v) → (Xj, uRj ), j = 0, 1, are continuous, also the projections prj : (X0, uR0 )×(X1, uR1 ) → (Xj, uRj ), j = 0, 1, are continuous. Consequently, Yj = prj(Y0 × Y1) is connected in (Xj, uRj ) for each j = 0, 1.	✷
n-ary digital plane
We denote by Z the set of integers and define an n-ary relation Rn on Z as follows:
Rn = {(xi| i < n) ∈ Zn; (xi| i < n) is constant or there exists an odd number l ∈ Z fulfilling either xi = l(n − 1) + i for all i < n or xi = l(n − 1) − i for all i < n}.
The relation Rn is demonstrated on the following picture where the non- constant n-touples of Rn are represented as arrows (oriented from the first to the last members of the sequences):



...	✲✛
✲✛	✲✛
...

-3(n-1)  -2(n-1)	-(n-1)	0	n-1	2(n-1)	3(n-1)

∗
It is evident that Rn is terse so that uRn is an S -closure operation on
Z. Instead of uRn we will write briefly un. The closure operation u2 coincides with the Khalimsky topology on Z generated by the subbase {{2k− 1, 2k, 2k +

1}; k ∈ Z} - cf.  [8].  The relation R−1
is nothing else than the so-called

specialization order of u2. Clearly, un is additive if and only if n = 2.
By [15], we have:
Proposition 3.1 (Z, un) is a connected S∗-space in which the points l(n− 1), l ∈ Z odd, are open, while all the other points are closed (so that un is a T 1 -closure operation).

Let R˜n be the n-ary relation on Z given as follows:
R˜n = {(xi| i < n) ∈ Zn; (xi| i < n) is a constant n-touple or xn−1 ∈ Z is an even number with either xi = xn−1 −1 for all i < n−1 or xi = xn−1 +1 for all i < n − 1}.
Further, let fn : Z → Z be the surjection defined by
fn(l(n − 1)) = l for each even number l ∈ Z,
fn(l(n − 1) + i)  =  l for each odd number l  ∈ Z and each i  ∈ Z with
|i| < n−1.
Theorem 3.2 fn : (Z, Rn) → (Z, R˜n) it a quotient map.
Proof. Let (yi| i < n) ∈ R˜n. If (yi| i < n) is constant, say yi = y for all i < n, we can choose an arbitrary element x ∈ f−1(y). Then, putting xi = x for all i < n, we get (xi| i < n) ∈ Rn. Let (yi| i < n) be not constant. Then yn−1 ∈ Z is even and yi = yn−1 − 1 for all i < n − 1 or yi = yn−1 + 1 for all i < n − 1. Suppose that yi = yn−1 − 1 for all i < n − 1 and put xi = (yn−1 − 1)(n − 1) + i for all i < n. Then (xi| i < n) ∈ Rn and we have f−1(yn−1) = {yn−1(n − 1)} = {xn−1}, and xi ∈ {(yn−1 − 1)(n − 1) + i; i < 
n} ⊆ f−1(yn−1 − 1) = f−1(yi) for any i < n − 1.  Further, suppose that
n	n
yi = yn−1 + 1 for all i < n − 1 and put xi = (yn−1 + 1)(n − 1) − i. Again,
(xi| i < n) ∈ Rn and we have f−1(yn−1) = {yn−1(n − 1)} = {xn−1}, and
xi ∈ {(yn−1 + 1)(n − 1) − i; i < n} ⊆ f−1(yn−1 + 1) = f−1(yi) for any
n	n
i < n − 1.
Conversely, let (yi| i < n) ∈ Zn and for each i < n let there exist xi ∈ f−1(yi) such that (xi| i < n) ∈ Rn. If (yi| i < n) is constant, then clearly (yi| i < n) ∈ R˜n. Let (yi| i < n) be not constant. Then there exists an even number l with xn−1 = l(n − 1). Thus, yn−1 = l. Since xi = (l − 1)(n − 1) + i for all i < n − 1 or xi = (l + 1)(n − 1) − i for all i < n − 1, we have yi = l − 1 for all i < n − 1 or yi = l + 1 for all i < n − 1. Therefore, (yi| i < n) ∈ R˜n. The proof is complete.	✷



Theorem 3.3 u e
n
= u2.

Proof. Let A ⊆ Z and x ∈ u e
n
A. If x ∈ A, then x ∈ u2A. Suppose that

x ∈/ A. Then there exist (xi| i < n) ∈ R˜n and i0, 0 < i0 < n, such that
x = xi0 and xi ∈ A for all i < i0. Since xn−1 is even and xn−2 = xn−1 − 1 or
xn−2 = xn−1 + 1, we have xn−2R2xn−1. As clearly i0 = n − 1, we get x ∈ u2A.

We have shown that u e
n
≤ u2.

Conversely, let x ∈ u2A. If x ∈ A, then x ∈ u e A. Suppose that x ∈/ A.
Then there exists y ∈ A such that x ∈ u2{y}. Consequently, yR2x and thus x
is even and y = x − 1 or y = x + 1. Now, putting xi = y for all i < n − 1 and
xn−1 = x, we get (xi| i < n) ∈ R˜n and xi ∈ A for each i < n − 1. Therefore

x ∈ u e
n
A. We have shown that u2 ≤ u e
which completes the proof.	✷

Corollary 3.4 fn : (Z, un) → (Z, u2) is a quotient map.
Proof. The statement follows from Theorems 3.2, 3.3 and Proposition 2.2.✷

We put (Z2, vn) = (Z, un) × (Z, un), so that vn = uR

×Rn
.  The closure

space (Z2, vn) will be called the n-ary digital plane.  Clearly, the product (Z, u2)×(Z, u2) coincides with the usual topological product and so the binary digital plane coincides with the Khalimsky plane (cf. [8]). As a consequence of 3.1 we get:
Proposition 3.5 (Z2, vn) is a connected S∗-space in which a point z = (z1, z2)
∈ Z2 is open if and only if z1 = k(n − 1) and z2 = l(n − 1) where k, l ∈ Z are odd, and it is closed if and only if z1 /= k(n − 1) for all odd numbers k ∈ Z and z2 /= l(n − 1) for all odd numbers l ∈ Z.
We denote by Fn : (Z2, vn) → (Z2, v2) the map Fn = fn × fn. Clearly, if
k, l ∈ Z, then F−1 equals the singleton {(k(n − 1), l(n − 1))} whenever k, l
are even, the ”square” {(x, y) ∈ Z2; |x − k| < n − 1, |y − l| < n − 1} of (2n − 3)2 points whenever k, l are odd, the ”abscissa” {(x, y) ∈ Z2; |x − k| < n − 1, y = l} of 2n − 3 points whenever k is odd and l is even, and the ”abscissa” {(x, y) ∈ Z2; x = k, |y − l| < n − 1} of 2n − 3 points whenever k is even and l is odd.
Theorem 3.6 Fn : (Z2, vn) → (Z2, v2) is a quotient map with connected ﬁ- bres.
Proof. Fn is a quotient map because of Theorems 3.2, 3.3, Proposition 2.2, Definition 2.7 and the fact that relational systems are quotient-productive. Let (x, y) ∈ Z2 be a point. Then F−1(x, y) = f−1(x) × f−1(y) and both the
n	n	n
sets f−1(x) and f−1(y) are connected in (Z, vn) (as each of them is a singleton
n	n
or the union of two connected elements in (Z, vn) having a common member). Thus, F−1(x, y) is connected in (Z2, vn) by Theorem 2.15.	✷
Let J ⊆ Z2 be a subset and z ∈ J a point. Then we put
Jz = {(zi| i < n) ∈ Rn × Rn; (zi| i < n) is a non-constant n-touple with z ∈ {zi; i < n}⊆ J}.

Definition 3.7 A simple closed curve in (Z2, vn) is a finite connected set
J ⊆ Z2 that satisfies the following two conditions:
For any point z ∈ J there exists an n-touple (zi| i < n) ∈ Jz with
z0 = (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)), k, l ∈ Z.
If z ∈ J is a point with z = (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)), k, l ∈ Z, then card Jz = 2.
For n > 2, simple closed curves in the n-ary digital plane are precisely circles in the following graph whose vertices are points of Z2 (but only the points (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)), k, l ∈ Z, are marked out and thus, on any edge connecting a pair of points there are another (n − 2) points):

Note that for n = 2 the condition (1) of 3.7 is always satisfied and the simple closed curves with at least four points coincide with the COTS-Jordan curves from [4]. So, by [4] we have
Theorem 3.8 Any simple closed curve J in (Z2, v2) having at liest four points separates (Z2, v2) into precisely two components (i.e., the subspace Z2 − J of (Z2, v2) consists of precisely two components).
Corollary 1.5 and Theorems 3.6 and 3.8 result in
Theorem 3.9 Let J ⊆ Z2 be a set such that Fn(J) is a simple closed curve in (Z2, vn) having at least four points. If F−1(Fn(J)) = J, then J separates
(Z2, vn) into precisely two components.
The sets J from Theorem 3.9 need not be simple closed curves in (Z2, vn) in general and so this Theorem is not a satisfactory analogy of the classical Jordan curve theorem. In what follows we will give a criterion under which a given simple closed curve in the space (Z2, vn) separates this space into precisely two components.
Definition 3.10 A simple closed curve J in (Z2, vn) is said to be a Jordan curve provided that for any point z ∈ J with z = (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)), k, l ∈ Z odd, from {((xi, yi)| i < n), ((x' , y')| i < n)} = Jz it follows that |xn−1 −

n−1
| = |yn−1 − y'

| = 2(n − 1).


Clearly, if (zi| i < n) ∈ Rn × Rn and z = (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) ∈ Z2 where k, l ∈ Z are odd, then from z ∈ {zi; i < n} it follows that z = z0. Thus, the condition in Definition 3.10 means that J can turn only at the points (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) for which k, l ∈ Z are even. It immediately follows that Fn(J) has at least six points for any Jordan curve J in (Z2, vn).  For n > 2, Jordan curves are nothing else than circles in the following graph whose vertices are points of Z2 (but only the points (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) for even k, l ∈ Z are marked out and thus, on any edge connecting a pair of points there are another 2n − 1 points):

Theorem 3.11 Let J be a simple closed curve in (Z2, vn) and let for any k, l ∈ Z from (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) ∈ J it follows that k or l is even. Then J is a Jordan curve in (Z2, vn) which separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components.
Proof. Clearly, J is a Jordan curve in (Z2, vn), Fn(J) is a Jordan curve in (Z2, v2) having at least eight points and F−1(Fn(J)) = J. Thus, the statement follows from Corollary 1.5 and Theorems 3.6 and 3.8.	✷
The Jordan curves from Theorem 3.11 are said to be rectangular because they are just the circles in the following graph:

Definition 3.12 Let n > 2 and let k, l ∈ Z be odd numbers. Then we set:
A1(k, l) = F−1({(k − 1,l − 1), (k, l − 1), (k + 1,l − 1)}),
A2(k, l) = F−1({(k − 1,l + 1), (k, l + 1), (k + 1,l + 1)}),
B1(k, l) = F−1({(k − 1,l − 1), (k − 1, l), (k − 1,l + 1)}),
B2(k, l) = F−1({(k + 1,l − 1), (k + 1, l), (k + 1,l + 1)}),
∆1(k, l) = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; |x − k(n − 1)| < n − 1,y = l(n − 1) − x + k(n − 1)},


∆2(k, l) = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; |x − k(n − 1)| < n − 1,y = l(n − 1) + x − k(n − 1)},
T1(k, l) = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; |x − k(n − 1)| < n − 1, (l − 1)(n − 1) < y < l(n − 1) −
x + k(n − 1)},
T2(k, l) = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; |x − k(n − 1)| < n − 1, l(n − 1) + x − k(n − 1) < y <
(l + 1)(n − 1)},
T3(k, l) = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; |x − k(n − 1)| < n − 1, (l − 1)(n − 1) < y < l(n − 1) +
x − k(n − 1)},
T4(k, l) = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; |x − k(n − 1)| < n − 1, l(n − 1) − x + k(n − 1) < y <
(l + 1)(n − 1)}.
Graphically, the sets A1(k, l), A2(k, l), B1(k, l) and B2(k, l) are the lower, upper, left and right sides of the square F−1(k, l) respectively which do not meet this square. The sets ∆1(k, l) and ∆2(k, l) are the increasing and decreas- ing diagonals of the square F−1 (which are contained in the square). Finally, T1(k, l) and T4(k, l) are the left lower and right upper triangles respectively
obtained by separating the square F−1 by the decreasing diagonal ∆1(k, l)
(which are included in the square but do not meet the diagonal). Similarly,
T2(k, l) and T3(k, l) are the left upper and right lower triangles respectively
obtained by separating the square F−1 by the increasing diagonal ∆2(k, l)
(which are included in the square but do not meet the diagonal).
Lemma 3.13 Let n > 2 and let k, l be odd numbers. Then each of the ten sets introduced in Denotation 3.12 is connected in (Z2, vn).
Proof. The sets A1(k, l), A2(k, l), B1(k, l) and B2(k, l) are inverse images under Fn of connected sets in (Z2, v2). Thus, they are connected by Corollary
1.5 and Theorem 3.6. It is evident that also the sets ∆1(k, l) and ∆2(k, l) are
connected because each of them is the union of a pair of connected elements having a common member. Now, consider the set T1(k, l). Then, for each x ∈ Z with (k − 1)(n − 1) < x < k(n − 1), the set Cx = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; (l − 1)(n − 1) < y < l(n − 1) − x + k(n − 1)} is connected (as it is formed by
a connected element in the case x = k(n − 1) − 1 or is a union of a pair of connected elements having a common member otherwise). Similarly, for each y ∈ Z with (l − 1)(n − 1) < y < l(n − 1), the set Dy = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; (k − 1)(n − 1) < x < l(n − 1) − y + k(n − 1)} is connected (as it is formed by a connected element in the case y = l(n − 1) − 1 or is a union of
a pair of connected elements having a common member otherwise). Clearly,
T1(k, l) =  {Cx; (k − 1)(n − 1) < x < k(n − 1)}∪  {Dy; (l − 1)(n − 1) <
y < l(n − 1)}. For each natural number i < n − 2 put C' = C(k−1)(n−1)+1+i,
D' = D(l−1)(n−1)+1+i and Ei = C' ∪ D'. Then (C'| i < n − 2) = (Cx| (k −
i	i	i	i
1)(n − 1) < x < k(n − 1)) and (D'| i < n − 2) = (Dy| (l − 1)(n − 1) <
y < l(n − 1)).  Thus, T1(k, l) =	i<n−2 Ei where Ei is a connected set for
each i < n − 2 (because C' ∩ D' = {(x(k−1)(n−1)+1+i, y(l−1)(n−1)+1+i)}). Since
i	i
D' ∩C' = {(x(k−1)(n−1)+1, y(l−1)(n−1)+1+i)} for each i < n−2, we have Ei ∩E0 /=
i	0
∅ for each i < n−2. Consequently, T1(k, l) is connected in (Z2, vn). For T2(k, l), T3(k, l) and T4(k, l) the proofs are analogous.	✷


We will need the following, quite obvious statement:
Lemma 3.14 Let J be a simple closed curve in (Z2, v2) having at liest four points and let k, l ∈ Z be odd numbers with (k, l) ∈ J. If (k − 1,l − 1) ∈ J and (k + 1,l + 1) ∈ J, then the points (k − 1, l) and (k, l + 1) belong to one component of Z2 − J while the points (k, l − 1) and (k + 1, l) belong to the other. Similarly, if (k − 1,l + 1) ∈ J and (k + 1,l − 1) ∈ J, then the points (k, l − 1) and (k − 1, l) belong to one component of Z2 − J while the points (k, l + 1) and (k + 1, l) belong to the other.
Theorem 3.15 Let J be a Jordan curve in (Z2, vn) satisfying the condition that, whenever there are odd numbers k, l ∈ Z such that (k(n−1), l(n−1)) ∈ J, J contains just two of the four points ((k ± 1)(n − 1), (l ± 1)(n − 1)). Then J separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components.
Proof. Clearly, the condition from Theorem 3.15 is necessary and sufficient for Fn(J) to be a simple closed curve in (Z2, v2) (having at least six points). For n = 2 the statement immediately follows from Theorem 3.8. Suppose that n > 2. If (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) ∈/ J whenever k, l ∈ Z are odd, then J is rectangular and the statement follows from Theorem 3.11. So, let there be odd numbers k, l ∈ Z with (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) ∈ J and put J' = F−1(Fn(J)). By Corollary 1.5 and Theorems 3.6 and 3.8, J' separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components and J ⊆ J', J /= J'. Clearly, J contains just one of the sets
∆1(k, l), ∆2(k, l). We will assume, without loss of generality, that ∆1(k, l) ⊆
J.  Then F−1(k − 1,l + 1) ∪ F−1(k + 1,l − 1) ⊆ J, thus (k − 1,l + 1) ∈
n	n
Fn(J) and (k + 1,l − 1) ∈ Fn(J). Clearly, for any (x, y) ∈ ∆1(k, l) we have
F−1(Fn(x, y)) = T1(k, l)∪∆1(k, l)∪T4(k, l). The condition from Theorem 3.15 implies that F−1(k−1, l−1)∩J = ∅ and F−1(k+1, l+1)∩J = ∅. Consequently,
n	n
F−1(k, l− 1) ∩J = F−1(k, l +1) ∩J = F−1(k− 1, l) ∩J = F−1(k +1, l) ∩J = ∅.
n	n	n	n
Put z1 = (k(n − 1) − 1, (l − 1)(n − 1)) and z2 = (k(n − 1)+ 1, (l + 1)(n − 1)).
Then z1 ∈ F−1(k, l − 1) and z2 ∈ F−1(k, l + 1), hence z1 ∈/ J' and z2 ∈/ J'. Let
n	n
E1, E2 be the components of Z2 − J with z1 ∈ E1 and z2 ∈ E2. By Corollary 1.5, Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 3.14, E1 and E2 are different. Clearly, we have z1 ∈ vnT1(k, l) and z2 ∈ vnT4(k, l). Thus, as T1(k, l) and T4(k, l) are connected by Lemma 3.13, the sets E1 ∪ T1(k, l) and E2 ∪ T4(k, l) are connected in the subspace Z2−J1 of (Z2, vn) where J1 = J'−(T1(k, l)∪T4(k, l)). Obviously, E1∪ T1(k, l) and E2 ∪T4(k, l) are disjoint and E1 ∪T1(k, l) ∪E2 ∪T4(k, l) = Z2 −J1. As Z2 −J1 is not connected (because Fn(Z2 −J1) = Z2 −Fn(J1) = Z2 −Fn(J) is not connected), the sets E1 ∪ T1(k, l) and E2 ∪ T4(k, l) are components of Z2 − J1. Consequently, J1 separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components. Now, if there are odd numbers k1, l1 ∈ Z such that (k1(n − 1), l1(n − 1)) ∈ J, in the next step we repeat the previous considerations for k1, l1 and J1 instead
of k, l and J. By this way we obtain a set J2 which separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components. After a finite number m of steps we will get a set Jm which separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components and contains no point (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) with k, l ∈ Z odd. Clearly, Jm = J which proves the


statement.	✷
The Jordan curves J in (Z2, vn) satisfying the condition from Theorem
3.15 are said to be without acutes. Thus, every rectangular Jordan curve is without acutes.
Whenever n > 2, each Jordan curve J in (Z2, vn) clearly satisfies card J ≥ 6(n − 1). The shortest Jordan curves J in (Z2, vn), i.e., those satisfying card J = 6(n − 1), are said to be elementary. Of course, if J is an elementary Jordan curve in (Z2, vn), then there are odd numbers k, l ∈ Z such that J is the union of one of the sets A1(k, l), A2(k, l), one of the sets B1(k, l), B2(k, l), and one of the sets ∆1(k, l), ∆1(k, l).
Theorem 3.16 Let n > 2 and let J be an elementary Jordan curve in
(Z2, vn). Then J separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components.
Proof. We will suppose, without loss of generality, that J = A1(k, l) ∪ B1(k, l) ∪ ∆1(k, l). Put J' = A1(k, l) ∪ B1(k, l) ∪ A2(k, l) ∪ B2(k, l). Then Fn(J') = {(x, y) ∈ Z2; max{|x − k|, |y − l|} = 1} is a simple closed curve in (Z2, v2) with card Fn(J') = 8. Thus, Fn(J') separates (Z2, v2) into pre- cisely two components by Theorem 3.8. As J' = F−1(Fn(J')), J' sepa- rates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components by Corollary 1.5 and Theorem
3.6. Clearly, one of these components is the set C = F−1(k, l) = T1(k, l) ∪ T4(k, l) ∪ ∆1(k, l), hence the other is the set Z2 − (C ∪ J'). By Lemma 3.13, T1(k, l) is connected in (Z2, vn) and thus it is connected also in the subspace Z2 − J of (Z2, vn) because T1(k, l) ⊆ Z2 − J. We have Z2 − (J ∪ T1(k, l)) = (Z2 − (C ∪ J')) ∪ (A2(k, l) − {z1}) ∪ (B2(k, l) − {z2}) ∪ T4(k, l)
where {z1} = F−1(k − 1,l + 1) and {z2} = F−1(k + 1,l − 1).  Clearly,
n	n
Z2−(C∪J') ⊆ Z2−J and (A2(k, l)−{z1})∪(B2(k, l)−{z2}) ⊆ vn(Z2−(C∪J')).
Thus, (Z2−(C∪J'))∪(A2(k, l)−{z1})∪(B2(k, l)−{z2}) is connected in Z2−J.
Let z0 = ((k + 1)(n− 1), l(n− 1) + 1). Then z0 ∈ (B2(k, l) − {z2}) ∩ vnT4(k, l). Consequently, as T4(k, l) is connected in Z2 − J by Lemma 3.13, the set Z2 − (J ∪T1(k, l)) is connected in Z2 −J too. As any path in (Z2, vn) connect- ing a point of T1(k, l) with another one of Z2 − (J ∪ T1(k, l)) clearly contains a point of J, the sets Z2 − (J ∪ T1(k, l)) and T1(k, l) are components of the subspace Z2 − J of (Z2, vn).	✷
Lemma 3.17 Let n > 2 and let k, l ∈ Z be odd numbers. Put A = T1(k, l) ∪ F−1({(k − 1, l), (k − 1,l + 1)}) ∪ ∆1(k, l) and W = T4(k − 2, l) ∪ F−1(k − 2,l +

B ⊇ A be a connected set in (Z2, vn) such that B ∩ F−1({(k − 1,l − 1), (k, l −

then B − A is a connected set in (Z2, vn).
Proof. Note that A and W are disjoint. The sets F−1(k − 2,l + 1), F−1(k −
n	n
1,l+2), F−1(k, l+1) and F−1(k+1, l) are connected because Fn has connected
n	n
fibres. By Lemma 3.13, also the sets T4(k − 2, l), T3(k − 1,l − 1), T1(k, l + 2)


and T4(k, l) are connected. We clearly have ((k− 1)(n− 1) − 1, (l +1)(n− 1)) ∈ F−1(k − 2,l + 1) ∩vnT4(k − 2, l) ∩vnT3(k − 1,l − 1), ((k − 1)(n− 1), (l + 1)(n− 1)+ 1) ∈ F−1(k − 1,l + 2) ∩vnT3(k − 1,l − 1) ∩vnT1(k, l + 2), ((k − 1)(n− 1) +

F−1(k, l + 1) ∩ vnT4(k, l). Consequently, W is a connected set. Further, we clearly have ((k − 1)(n − 1) − 1, (l − 1)(n − 1) + 1) ∈ vnT4(k − 2, l) ⊆ vnW . Therefore, W ∪ {((k − 1)(n − 1) − 1, (l − 1)(n − 1) + 1)} is connected. As F−1(k + 1,l + 1) ∈ vnF−1(k, l + 1) ∈ vnW , also W ∪F−1(k + 1, l) is connected.

We will show that for any path connecting two different points of B − A which is contained in B and meets A there is a path connecting these points which is contained in B − A. To this end, let C = (zi| i < m) be a path
contained in B such that z0, zm−1 ∈ B − A and {zi; i < m}∩ A /= ∅. Then there is a finite increasing sequence (jk| k < p) of natural numbers with j0 = 0 and jp−1 = m − 1 such that (zj| jk ≤ j ≤ jk+1) is a connected element for each k < p − 1.  Let k1 < p − 1 be the least natural number having the
property that the connected element Ck1 = (zi| jk1 ≤ i ≤ jk1+1) meets A and let k2 < p − 1 be the greatest natural number having the property that the

connected element Ck2 = (zi| jk2 ≤ i ≤ jk2+1) meets A. Then zjk
∈ B − A,

zjk +1 ∈ B − A and both Ck1 and Ck2 meet A − T1(k, l).
First, suppose that Ck1 ∩ ∆1(k, l) = ∅ = Ck2 ∩ ∆1(k, l). Then it is evident
that Ck1 ∈ Rn × Rn, Ck1 ∩ A = {zjk +1 } and zjk +1−1 ∈ W ∪ E where E = ∅ if

((k−1)(n−1)−1, (l−1)(n−1)+1) ∈/ B and E = {((k−1)(n−1)−1, (l−1)(n−

inversion of Ck
by C− , we get C− ∈ Rn × Rn, Ck ∩ A = {zj } and zj
+1 ∈

2	k2	k2	2	k2	k2
W ∪ E. Thus, C' = (zi| jk ≤ i < jk +1) and C' = (zi| jk < i ≤ jk +1) are
k1	1	1	k2	2	2
connected elements contained in B − A. As W ∪ E is connected, there is a

path C' connecting zj
−1 and zj
+1 which is contained in W ∪ E ⊆ B − A.

Consequently, the union C
of the paths Ck1 , C
and Ck2 is a path connecting

Next, let Ck1 ∩ ∆1(k, l) /= ∅ or Ck2 ∩ ∆1(k, l) /= ∅.	We can suppose, without loss of generality, that Ck1 ∩ ∆1(k, l) /= ∅ (because otherwise we

can replace C by its inversion).  Then zjk
∈ W ∪ G ∪ H where G = ∅ if

F−1(k + 1,l + 1) ∩ B = ∅ and G = F−1(k + 1,l + 1) if F−1(k + 1,l + 1) ⊆ B,

and H = ∅ if F−1(k + 1, l) ∩B = ∅ and H = F−1(k + 1, l) if F−1(k + 1, l) ⊆ B.

which is contained in W ∪ E ∪ G ∪ H ⊆ B − A. Hence, the union C

the paths C'

B−A. Now, the union of the paths (zi| i ≤ jk ), C'' and (zi| jk +1 ≤ i ≤ m) is

a path connecting z0 and zm−1 which is contained in B − A. Finally, suppose
that Ck2 ∩ ∆1(k, l) /= ∅. Then zjk2+1 ∈ W ∪ G ∪ H, thus there is a path


C' connecting zj	and zj	which is contained in W ∪ G ∪ H ⊆ B − A.

Therefore, the union of the paths (zi| i ≤ jk1 ), C and (zi| jk2+1 ≤ i < m)

Remark 3.18 Of course, statements analogical to Lemma 3.17 are valid also for A = T4(k, l) ∪ F−1({(k + 1,l − 1), (k + 1, l)}) ∪ ∆1(k, l), A = T2(k, l) ∪
F−1({(k−1,l−1), (k−1, l)})∪∆2(k, l), and A = T3(k, l)∪F−1({(k +1, l), (k +

The following digital analogy of the classical Jordan curve theorem shows that, for any n > 1, the n-ary digital plane provides a structure suitable for solving problems of digital image processing:
Theorem 3.19 Let J be a Jordan curve in (Z2, vn). Then J separates (Z2, vn)
into precisely two components.
Proof. For n = 2 the statement follows from Theorem 3.8. Let n > 2. If
J is without acutes or elementary, then the statement follows from Theorem
3.15 or 3.16 respectively. Suppose that J is neither without acutes nor ele- mentary. Then there are odd numbers k1, l1 ∈ Z such that ∆1(k1, l1) ⊆ J or
∆2(k1, l1) ⊆ J. We will suppose, without loss of generality, that ∆1(k1, l1) ⊆ J (so that J ∩ ∆2(k1, l1) = ∅). Clearly, J contains at least one of the sets A1(k1, l1), A2(k1, l1), B1(k1, l1), B2(k1, l1).  We will suppose, without loss of generality, that B1(k1, l1) ⊆ J.  Obviously, A2(k1, l1) is not a subset of J and, as J is not elementary, neither A1(k1, l1) is a subset of J.  Put J1 = (J − (B1(k1, l1) ∪ ∆1(k1, l1))) ∪ A1(k1, l1). Clearly, J1 is a Jordan curve in (Z2, vn). Now, if J1 is neither withou acutes nor elementary, there are odd numbers k2, l2 ∈ Z such that ∆1(k2, l2) ⊆ J or ∆2(k2, l2) ⊆ J.  In the next step, we apply the previous considerations to J1 and (k2, l2) to ob- tain a new Jordan curve J2 = (J1 − (B1(k2, l2) ∪ ∆1(k2, l2))) ∪ A1(k2, l2),
and so on. After a finite number m of steps we get a Jordan curve Jm = (Jm−1 − (B1(km, lm) ∪ ∆1(km, lm))) ∪ A1(km, lm) which is without acutes or elementary.
By Theorem 3.15 or 3.16, Jm separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two compo- nents. Denote these components by Dm and Em. As T1(km, lm) is connected (by Lemma 3.13) and T1(km, lm) ∩ Jm = ∅, T1(km, lm) is contained in just one of the components Dm, Em. We will suppose, without loss of generality, that T1(km, lm) ⊆ Em. Clearly, we have Jm−1 = (Jm − A1(km, lm)) ∪ B1(km, lm) ∪ F−1(km+1, lm−1). Put Dm−1 = Dm∪F−1(km, lm−1)∪T1(km, lm) and Em−1 =
n	n
Em − (T1(km, lm) ∪ F−1({(km − 1, lm), (km − 1, lm + 1)}) ∪ ∆1(km, lm)). Then
Dm−1 ∩Em−1 = ∅ and Dm−1 ∪Em−1 = Z2 −Jm−1. Evidently, T2(km, lm − 2) ⊆ Dm or T4(km, lm − 1) ⊆ Dm. We will suppose, without loss of generality, that T2(km, lm −2) ⊆ Dm. Then (km(n−1)−1, (lm −1)(n−1)) ∈ vnT2(km, lm −2) ⊆ vnDm and (km(n − 1) − 1, (lm − 1)(n − 1)) ∈ F−1(km, lm − 1). As Fn has con- nected fibres, F−1(km, lm − 1) is connected and thus Dm ∪ F−1(km, lm − 1)
n	n


is connected too. Further, T1(km, lm) is connected by Lemma 3.13 and hence T1(km, lm) ∪F−1(km, lm − 1) is connected (because (km(n− 1) − 1, (lm − 1)(n− 1)) ∈ vnT1(km, lm)). Consequently, Dm−1 is connected. From Lemma 3.17 it follows that also Em−1 is connected.
Let (zi| i < n) ∈ Rn×Rn be an n-touple with z0 ∈ Dm−1 and zi0 ∈ Em−1 for some i0, 0 < i0 < n. If z0 ∈ Dm, then there is i1, 0 < i1 < i0, such that zi1 ∈ Jm − A1(km, lm) ⊆ Jm−1 because Dm is closed in Z2 − Jm and any n-touple of Rn×Rn whose first member does not belong to A1(km, lm) can meet A1(km, lm) in the last member only. Let z0 ∈/ Dm, i.e., let z0 ∈ F−1(km, lm−1)∪T1(km, lm). Then z0 ∈ {(x, y) ∈ Z2; (km − 1)(n− 1) < x < km − 1, y = lm − 1}∪ {(x, y) ∈ Z2; x = km(n−1), (lm −1)(n−1) < y < lm −1}. Thus, there is i1, 0 < i1 < i0,
such that zi1 ∈ ∆1(km, lm) ⊆ Jm−1. Consequently, Dm−1 is closed in Z −Jm−1.
2
Similarly, let (zi| i < n) ∈ Rn × Rn be an n-touple with z0 ∈ Em−1 and
zi0 ∈ Dm−1 for some i0, 0 < i0 < n. If zi0 ∈ Dm, then there is i1, 0 < i1 < i0,
such that zi1 ∈ Jm − A1(km, lm) ⊆ Jm−1 because Dm is closed in Z − Jm and
2
any n-touple of Rn × Rn whose first member does not belong to A1(km, lm)
can meet A1(km, lm) in the last member only.  Let zi0 ∈/ Dm.  Then z0 ∈
{(x, y) ∈ Z2; x = km(n − 1), lm(n − 1) < y < (lm + 1)(n − 1) − 1}∪ {(x, y) ∈ Z2; km(n − 1) < x < (km + 1)(n − 1) − 1, y = lm(n − 1)}. But then there is i1, 0 < i1 < i0, such that zi1 ∈ ∆1(km, lm) ⊆ Jm−1. Consequently, Dm−1 is closed in Z2 − Jm−1.
As both Dm−1 and Em−1 are closed in Z2 − Jm−1, they are components of Z2 − Jm−1, i.e., Jm−1 separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components. If m > 1, in the next step we apply the previous considerations to Jm−1 instead of Jm and show that Jm−2 separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components Dm−2 and Em−2. Afer m steps we get a set J0 which separates (Z2, vn) into precisely two components D0 and E0.  As obviously J0 = J, the proof is
complete.	✷
If n > 2, then Jordan curves in the n-ary digital plane can turn (at the points (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) with k, l ∈ Z even) at all angles pπ , p = 1, 2, 3. But this is not true for n = 2 because COTS-Jordan curves in the Khalimsky plane cannot turn at the acute π (and at the so-called mixed points of Z2, i.e., the points one coordinate of which is even and the second is odd, they can never turn). So, it can be useful to work with an n-ary digital plane where n > 2. Especially, for n = 3 the graph placed after Definition 3.10 has the following form:

Example 3.20 Consider the following (digital picture of a) triangle:
E =(4,4)
.
.	.
.	.
.	.
.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.
(0,0)= A B	C D =(0,0)
While in the ternary digital plane the triangle ADE is a Jordan curve, in the Khalimsky plane it is not even a COTS-Jordan curve. In order that this triangle be a COTS-Jordan curve in the Khalimsky plane, we have to delete the points A,B,C and D (and then it will become even a Jordan curve). But this will lead to a deformation of the triangle.
Theorem 3.21 Let J be a Jordan curve in (Z2, v2) and let D, E be the components of Z2 − J. Then both D ∪ J and E ∪ J are connected subsets of (Z2, v2).
Proof. First, suppose that J is rectangular. Then there is a point z = (k(n − 1)+1, l(n−1)) with k, l ∈ Z even such that z ∈ J. Put A1 = {(k(n−1)+1, (l+ 1)(n− 1) − i); 0 ≤ i < n− 1} and A2 = {(k(n− 1)+ 1, (l − 1)(n− 1) + i); 0 ≤
i < n − 1}. Clearly, A1 and A2 are contained in different components of Z2 −J. We can suppose, without loss of generality, that A1 ⊆ D and A2 ⊆ E. As we obviously have z ∈ vnA1 ∪ vnA2, D ∪ {z} and E ∪ {z} are connected. Consequently, D ∪ J and E ∪ J are connected.
Further, suppose that J is not rectangular. Then there is a point z = (k(n − 1), l(n − 1)) with k, l ∈ Z odd such that z ∈ J. Put z1 = (k(n − 1) − 1, l(n − 1)) and z2 = (k(n − 1) + 1, l(n − 1)). Clearly, z1 and z2 belong to different components of Z2 − J. We can suppose, without loss of generality, that z1 ∈ D and z2 ∈ E. Obviously, we have {z1, z2}⊆ vn{z} and thus D∪{z} and E ∪ {z} are connected. Consequently, D ∪ J and E ∪ J are connected.
The proof is complete.	✷
Remark 3.22 If J is a COTS-Jordan curve in (Z2, v2) and D, E are the components of Z2 − J, then D ∪ {z} and E ∪ {z} are connected subsets of (Z2, v2) for each point z ∈ J. For a Jordan curve J in (Z2, vn), n > 2, thit is not true in general (it is true, however, whenever J is rectangular). Indeed, if n > 2 and J is an elementary Jordan curve in (Z2, vn) such that, say, ∆1(k, l) ⊆ J and ((k − 1)(n − 1), (k + 1)(n − 1)) ∈ J where k, l ∈ Z are odd numbers, and if D is the finite component of Z2 − J and z = ((k − 1)(n− 1), (k + 1)(n− 1)), then D ∪ {z} is not connected.
As a concluding remark let us note that the n-ary digital planes with n > 2 can be useful also in the cases when we want to work with a topological struc- ture of Z2 that is more ”continuous” than the Alexandroff topology provided by the Khalimsky topology.
