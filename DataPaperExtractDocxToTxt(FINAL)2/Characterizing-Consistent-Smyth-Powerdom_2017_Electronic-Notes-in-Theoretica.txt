In this paper, we introduce FS-∧↑-domains, and show that the category with FS-∧↑-domains as objects and Scott continuous functions as morphisms is a Cartesian closed category. Moreover, we characterize the consistent Smyth powerdomain over a Lawson compact domain by means of FS-∧↑-domain.

Introduction
In Domain theory, powerdomains are very important structures, which play an im- portant role in modeling the semantics of nondeterministic programming languages ([4,5,6,7,9,11,12,13,14,15]). For example, the Smyth powerdomain is the free defla- tionary semilattice over a continuous dcpo, where the deflationary binary operator is exactly the Scott continuous meet operator [14]. However, in many interesting domains, such as L-domains, the meet operator is not total but a partial one: two elements have a meet (or a greatest lower bound) if they are consistent, i.e., they have an upper bound. In this case, the partial meet operator is called a consistent meet, denoted by ∧↑. So a question arises: can we construct a new free algebra over

a continuous dcpo on which the binary operator is exactly the Scott continuous con- sistent meet? In [16], we show by methods of topology and order theory that the consistent Smyth powerdomain over a continuous dcpo exists and is a continuous dcpo-∧↑-semilattice. Moreover, if a continuous dcpo is Lawson compact, then its consistent Smyth powerdomain is a Lawson compact L-domain. This is a difference between the consistent Smyth powerdomain and the classical one, because the clas- sical Smyth powerdomain over a Lawson compact domain is a bounded complete domain.
Note that classical powerdomains, such as the Smyth powerdomain and the Hoare powerdomain, can be characterized by means of some FS-domains given of the basic functions in the structure of powerdomains respectively. In [8], Huth, Jung and Keimel introduced a new concept: linear FS-lattice, which is a complete lattice and there exists a directed family of finitely separated linear functions which can approximate id, where a function is linear if it preserves all suprema. They proved that the Hoare powerdomain H(L) over a pointed domain L is characterized by a distributive linear FS-lattice. In [10], Meng and Kou introduced F S∧-domains and proved that the Smyth powerdomain S(L) over a Lawson compact domain L is characterized by F S∧-domains. So for purely mathematical purposes, we have reasons to believe that there exists a kind of FS-domains to characterize the consistent Smyth powerdomain over a Lawson compact continuous domain.
In this paper we first use the partial Scott continuous binary operator ∧↑ to con- struct a finitely separated domain: FS-∧↑-domain, which is a dcpo-∧↑-semilattice and there exists a directed family of finitely separated ∧↑-semilattice homomor- phisms which can approximate idL. We have obtained the following conclusions:
The category with FS-∧↑-domains as objects and Scott continuous functions as morphisms is a cartesian closed category.
The consistent Smyth powerdomain SC(L) over a Lawson compact continuous domain L is an FS-∧↑-domain.
Moreover, we characterize consistent Smyth powerdomains by means of FS-∧↑- domains.
Next, we collect some basic notions needed in this paper. The reader can also consult [1,3]. A poset L is called a directed complete poset (a dcpo, for short) if any directed set of L has a sup in L. For x, y ∈ L, x is called to be way below y (denoted by x   y) if for any directed set D, y ≤ ∨D implies that there is some d ∈ D with x ≤ d. A poset L is called continuous if for all x ∈ L, x = ∨↑↓x, i.e., the set ↓x = {a ∈ L : a  x} is directed and x = ∨{a ∈ L : a  x}, where the arrow in the symbol ∨↑ is to emphasize the directedness of ↓x. Specially, a dcpo which is continuous as a poset will be called a (continuous) domain. For a subset A of L, let ↑A = {x ∈ L : ∃a ∈ A, a ≤ x}, ↓A = {x ∈ L : ∃a ∈ A, x ≤ a}. We use ↑a (resp. ↓a) instead of ↑{a} (resp. ↓{a}) when A = {a}. A is called an upper (resp. a lower) set if A = ↑A (resp. A = ↓A). An element k ∈ L is called compact if k  k. The subset of all compact elements is denoted by K(L). A dcpo L is called algebraic if for all x ∈ L, x = ∨↑(↓x ∩ K(L)).
Definition 1.1 Let L be a poset.

A subset A of L is called consistent if A has an upper bound in L, i.e.,
A ⊆ ↓x for some x ∈ L.
L is called a consistent meet-semilattice (or ∧↑-semilattice) if x ∧ y exists for all consistent x, y ∈ L. To emphasize the fact that x and y are consistent, we will write x ∧↑ y instead of x ∧ y. Moreover, if L is a (continuous) dcpo, then L is called a (continuous) dcpo-∧↑-semilattice.
L is called an L-domain if L is a domain and every consistent subset of L
has an inf, i.e., ↓x is a complete lattice for all x ∈ L.
Let L be a poset. We call the topology generated by the complements L\↑x of principal filters as subbasic open sets the lower topology and denote it by ω(L). If (L, ≤) is a dcpo, we define the Scott topology (denoted by σ(L)), which has as its topology of closed sets all directed complete lower sets, i.e., lower sets closed under directed sups. The Lawson topology λ(L) is generated by taking the join of σ(L) and ω(L) as subbasic. If L is a ∧↑-semilattice, then the partial operator
∧↑ : L × L→L is Scott continuous.
A ∧↑-semilattice homomorphism f between dcpo-∧↑-semilattices (P, ∧↑) and (E, ∧↑) is a Scott continuous function from P to E such that f (a∧↑ b)= f (a) ∧↑ f (b) whenever a, b are consistent in P . Note that the function is Scott continuous and conditionally multiplicative (or cm for short in [2]), that is, each ∧↑-semilattice homomorphism is a Scott continuous cm function.
Categories of FS-∧↑-domains
For dcpos L and P , let [L−→P ] denote all Scott continuous functions from L to P with the pointwise order. For dcpo-∧↑-semilattices D and E, let [D−→∧↑ E] denote the function space of ∧↑-semilattice homomorphisms from D to E with the pointwise order.
Definition 2.1 [3]A dcpo L is called an FS-domain if idL is approximated directly by a family of ﬁnitely separating functions, where a Scott continuous function f : L−→L is called ﬁnitely separated if there exists a ﬁnite set Mf such that for each x ∈ L, there exists m ∈ Mf such that f (x) ≤ m ≤ x.
Definition 2.2 A dcpo L is called an FS-∧↑-domain if it is a ∧↑-semilattice and there exists a directed family of ﬁnitely separated ∧↑-semilattice homomorphisms which can approximate idL.
In other words, an FS-∧↑-domain is a continuous dcpo-∧↑-semilattice which id is approximated by a directed family of finitely separated Scott continuous functions preserving existing finite infs. Obviously, every FS-∧↑-domain is an FS-domain. Then we have
Proposition 2.3 Each FS-∧↑-domain is a Lawson compact L-domain.
Next, we show that the category with FS-∧↑-domains as objects and Scott continuous functions as morphisms is a cartesian closed category.
Theorem 2.4 Let D and E be dcpo-∧↑-semilattices, then [D−→∧↑ E] is a dcpo-∧↑-

semilattice.

Proof. Firstly, [D−→∧↑ E] is a dcpo. For any directed set {fj ∈ [D−→∧↑ E]: j ∈ J} and x ∈ D, set f (x) =  j∈J fj(x). It is obvious that f is Scott continuous. If x, y ∈ D are consistent, then f (x),f (y) are also consistent in E. Then

f (x ∧↑ y)= _ fj(x ∧↑ y)= _(fj(x) ∧↑ fj(y))
j∈J	j∈J
= ( _ fj(x)) ∧↑ ( _ fj(y)) = f (x) ∧↑ f (y).
j∈J	j∈J

So f is also Scott continuous and a ∧↑-semilattice homomorphism. Hence [D−→∧↑ E] is a dcpo.
Secondly, [D−→∧↑ E] isa ∧↑-semilattice. If f, g ∈ [D−→∧↑ E] are consistent, then f (x), g(x) are consistent for any x ∈ D. Then f (x) ∧↑ g(x) exists. Let (f ∧↑ g)(x)= f (x) ∧↑ g(x). For a directed set {xk ∈ D : k ∈ K}, we have

(f ∧↑ g)( _ (xk)) = f ( _ (xk)) ∧↑ g( _ (xk))

k∈K
k∈K
k∈K

= _ f (xk) ∧↑ _ g(xk)= _ [f (xk) ∧↑ g(xk)]

k∈K
k∈K
k∈K

= _ [(f ∧↑ g)(xk)].
k∈K

Then f ∧↑ g is Scott continuous.
For a pair of consistent points x, y in D, f (x ∧↑ y) and g(x ∧↑ y) are consistent in E. Then
(f ∧↑ g)(x ∧↑ y)
= f (x ∧↑ y) ∧↑ g(x ∧↑ y)
= (f (x) ∧↑ f (y)) ∧↑ (g(x) ∧↑ g(y))
= (f (x) ∧↑ g(x)) ∧↑ (f (y) ∧↑ g(y))
= (f ∧↑ g)(x) ∧↑ (f ∧↑ g)(y).

That is, f ∧↑ g is a ∧↑-semilattice homomorphism. So [D−→∧↑ E] is a ∧↑- semilattices.
Finally, by the Scott continuity of the operation ∧↑, we obtain the following conclusion. If the sup of the directed set {fj ∈ [D−→∧↑ E] : j ∈ J} and g ∈ [D−→∧↑ E] are consistent, then for x ∈ D,


[g ∧↑ ( _ ƒj)](x)= g(x) ∧↑ ( _(ƒj(x))
j∈J	j∈J
= _[g(x) ∧↑ ƒj(x)] = _[(g ∧↑ ƒj)(x)]

j∈J
= [ _(g ∧↑ ƒj)](x).
j∈J
j∈J

So ∧↑ : [D−→∧↑ E] × [D−→∧↑ E]−→[D−→∧↑ E] is Scott continuous.
We have obtained that [D−→∧↑ E] is a dcpo-∧↑-semilattice.	2
Theorem 2.5 Let D and E be FS-∧↑-domains, then [D−→∧↑ E] and [D−→E] are
FS-∧↑-domains.

Proof. Suppose that D and E are approximate identities for D and E respectively. Then we claim that the family

D⊗ E = {δ ⊗ ϵ : δ ∈ D,ϵ ∈ E}


defined by

ƒ '→ ϵ2ƒδ2

for ƒ ∈ [D−→∧↑ E] is an approximate identity for [D−→∧↑ E] and δ ⊗ ϵ is finitely separating. The proof is similar with the case of FS-domains.
It suffices to show that δ ⊗ϵ ∈ [D−→∧↑ E]−→∧↑ [D−→∧↑ E]. Firstly, it is obvious that δ ⊗ ϵ is Scott continuous. Secondly, for a pair of consistent points ƒ, g ∈ [D−→∧↑ E], we have (δ ⊗ ϵ)(ƒ ), (δ ⊗ ϵ)(g) are consistent and for any x ∈ D

[(δ ⊗ ϵ)(ƒ ∧↑ g)](x)= [ϵ2(ƒ ∧↑ g)δ2](x)
= ϵ2[ƒδ2(x) ∧↑ gδ2(x)] = ϵ2ƒδ2(x) ∧↑ ϵ2gδ2(x)
= [ϵ2ƒδ2 ∧↑ ϵ2gδ2](x)= [(δ ⊗ ϵ)(ƒ ) ∧↑ (δ ⊗ ϵ)(g)](x).
So we conclude that δ ⊗ ϵ is a ∧↑-semilattice homomorphism. Then [D−→∧↑ E] is an FS-∧↑-domain. Similarly, [D−→E] is also an FS-∧↑-domain.	2
Note that usually the category with FS-∧↑-domains as objects and ∧↑- semilattice homomorphisms as morphisms is not a cartesian closed category. How- ever, if the category considers Scott continuous functions as morphisms, then from the preceding paragraph we have the following conclusion:
Theorem 2.6 The category with FS-∧↑-domains as objects and Scott continuous functions as morphisms is a cartesian closed category.

Characterize consistent Smyth powerdomains by FS-
∧↑-domains
In the following paragraph, we will relate FS-∧↑-domain and consistent Smyth powerdomain with the functions: ∧↑-semilattice homomorphisms. We characterize consistent Smyth powerdomains SC(L) over a Lawson compact continuous domain L by means of FS-∧↑-domains.
Definition 3.1 [16] A consistent deflationary semilattice is a continuous dcpo L with a Scott continuous binary partial operator ∧↑ deﬁned only for consistent pairs of points that satisfy three equations for commutativity x∧↑ y = y ∧↑ x, associativity x∧↑ (y ∧↑ z)= (x∧↑ y) ∧↑ z, and idempotency x∧↑ x = x together with the inequality x ≥ x ∧↑ y for any x, y, z ∈ L. The free consistent deflationary semilattice over a domain L is called the consistent Smyth powerdomain over L.
Definition 3.2 [16] Let L be a poset and F a nonempty subset of L. Two elements x and y in F are called linearly connected in F provided there exists a consistent path in ↑F from x to y, i.e. ﬁnitely many x0, x1,..., xn in ↑F such that x = x0 † x1 † ... † xn = y, denoted by x ∼F y. F is called linearly connected if any two elements of F are linearly connected in F.
Let L be a continuous domain and let

BC(L)= {F ⊆fin L : F /= ∅ and F is linearly connected}.

Let SC(L) be the family generated by ↑BC(L) = {↑F : F ∈ BC(L)} as a basis, i.e., for all A ∈ SC(L), A =	↑{↑F : F ∈ BC(L) & ↑F   A}, then SC(L) is a continuous dcpo-∧↑-semilattice in [16].
Theorem 3.3 [16] Let L be a continuous domain. The embedding j of L into SC(L) is given by j(x)= ↑x for x ∈ L. If P is a dcpo-∧↑-semilattice and ƒ : L−→P a Scott continuous function, then there exists uniquely a ∧↑-homomorphism ƒ¯ such that ƒ¯j = ƒ. Thus, SC(L) is isomorphic to the consistent Smyth powerdomain over L.
Definition 3.4 The relation in a continuous dcpo-∧↑-semilattice D is called consistent  -multiplication if for consistent elements a, b ∈ D, x   a, b implies x  a ∧↑ b.
For a continuous L-domain L, L is distributive with ∨ and ∧↑ if it holds the following statements: for any consistent points x, y, z, x∧↑ (y∨z)= (x∧↑ y)∨(x∧↑ z).
Definition 3.5 Let L be a poset. An element m ∈ L is a minimal upper bound (or mub for short) for a subset A if m is an upper bound for A that is minimal in the set of all upper bounds of A.
Lemma 3.6 Let D be an algebraic Lawson compact L-domain with the consistent
 -multiplicative property. If D is distributive with ∨ and ∧↑, then D is an FS-∧↑- domain.

Proof. Let D = {(x ⇒ x) ∈ D→D : x  x}, where (x ⇒ x) is the one-step function defined by
(x ⇒ x)(z)= ⎧⎨ x,	z ∈ ↑x,
⎩ 0↓z, otherwise.
For any finite compact element subset K = {x1, ..., xn} ⊆ K(D) for n ∈ N and
∅ /= G ⊆ K, define MG ⊆fin mub(G): for any m ∈ MG, there is x ∈ ∩xi∈G↑xi such that m  x. By compactness of D, there is a finite set MG ⊆ mub{xi : xi ∈ G} such that mub{xi : xi ∈ G}⊆ m∈MG ↑m.
Set
Lc(K)= {∧↑	{xi} : ∅ /= G ⊆ K, ∩x ∈G↑xi /= ∅},
i
MLc(K) =  {m ∈ MG : ∅ /= G ⊆ Lc(K), ∩xi∈G↑xi /= ∅},
G
K∗ = Lc(K) ∪ ML (K),
K1 = K∗, K2 = K∗, ..., Kn+1 = K∗,
1	n
F(K)=   Kn.
n∈N
By the distributive property, the set F(K) is finite. Let us define the mapping
ƒK : D→D as follows: for x ∈ D,
ƒ (x)= ⎧⎨ m,  x ∈ ↑m \ ↑(↑m ∩ F(K)), m ∈ F(K),
⎩ 0↓x, otherwise.
If G1 = G2, m1, m2 ∈ MG1 and m1 /= m2, then ↑m1 \ ↑(↑m1 ∩ F(K)) ∩ ↑m2 \
↑(↑m2 ∩ F(K)) = ∅. Otherwise, there is x ∈ ↑m1 \ ↑(↑m1 ∩ F(K)) ∩ ↑m2 \ ↑(↑m2 ∩ F(K)). But m1 /= m2. This is a contradiction with which D is an L-domain. If G1 /= G2 and mi ∈ MGi for i = 1, 2, then ↑m1 \↑(↑m1 ∩F(K)) ∩ ↑m2 \↑(↑m2 ∩F(K)) = ∅. Otherwise, there is x ∈ ↑m1 \ ↑(↑m1 ∩ F(K)) ∩ ↑m2 \ ↑(↑m2 ∩ F(K)). Then x ∈
↑(m1 ∨↓x m2), a contradiction. On the other hand, suppose m1 ∈ MG1 , m2 ∈ MG2 and G1 /= G2. If a ∈ ↑m1 \ ↑(↑m1 ∩ F(K)) and b ∈ ↑m2 \ ↑(↑m2 ∩ F(K)) and ƒK(a) /= ƒK(b). We must have a /= b. Otherwise, a ∈ ↑(m1∨↓am2), but ƒK(a)= m1. This is a contradiction with the definition of ƒK. If G1 = G2, m1, m2 ∈ MG1 and m1 /= m2, then a /= b because D is a L-domain. Then ƒK is well defined.
It’s obvious that ƒK is monotone with finite range and ƒK ≤ idD. For any
d ∈ D, if d = 0↓d and d /∈ ↓m for any m ∈ F(K), then ƒ−1(↑d) = ↑d; if there is
K
−1 ↑	↑
ƒ−1(↑d) = ∅. All cases show that ƒ−1(↑d) is a Scott open set of D. Then ƒK is
K	K
Scott continuous.
It is easy to show that {ƒK : K ⊆ K(D), |K| ⊆fin N} is a directed set approxi- mated to idD. For any x ∈ D, we know sup{ƒK(x): K ⊆ K(D), |K| ⊆fin N} ≤ x. If x /≤ sup{ƒK(x) : K ⊆ K(D), |K| ⊆fin N}, then there is u   x but u /≤ sup{ƒK(x) : K ⊆ K(D), |K| ⊆fin N}. By u  x, there is some compact element v such that u   v   x. By (v⇒v)(x) = v and (v⇒v) ≤ sup{ƒK : K ⊆

K(D), |K| ⊆fin N}, then u ≤ v ≤ sup{ƒK(x): K ⊆ K(D), |K| ⊆fin N}, a contra- diction.
To show that {ƒK : K ⊆ K(D), |K| ⊆fin N} is the approximate identity over D, it is sufficient to prove that these functions are also ∧↑-homomorphisms. Suppose that a and b are consistent witnessed by c. Let a ∧↑ b = x and let
a ∈ ↑m1 \ ↑(↑m1 ∩ F(K)),



and
b ∈ ↑m2 \ ↑(↑m2 ∩ F(K))

x ∈ ↑m0 \ ↑(↑m0 ∩ F(K)),

where mi ∈ MG for i = 0, 1, 2. Then ƒK(a) ∧↑ ƒK(b) exists. By m0  x ≤ a and m0   x ≤ b, if G0 = G1 = G2, then m1 = m0 and m2 = m0, and then m0 = m1 ∧↑ m2. Otherwise, we obtain m0 ∨↓a m1  a and m0 ∨↓a m1 ∈ F(K), but a ∈ ↑m1 \ ↑(↑m1 ∩ F(K)). Then m0 ≤ m1. Similarly, m0 ≤ m2. Thus, we have m0 ≤ m1 ∧↑ m2. On the other hand, by  -multiplicative property, m1 ∧↑ m2  a ∧↑ b = x. By the definition of ƒK, we conclude m0 = m1 ∧↑ m2. Hence, ƒK(a ∧↑ b)= m0 = m1 ∧↑ m2 = ƒK(a) ∧↑ ƒK(b).	2
Theorem 3.7 Let D be a Lawson compact L-domain with consistent - multiplicative property. If D is distributive with ∨ and ∧↑, then D is an FS-∧↑- domain.
Proof. For any finite subset X = {x1, ..., xn} ⊆ D, Y = {y1, ..., yn} ⊆ D and
yi  xi for any n ∈ N and I = {1,  , n}, set


Lc(X)= {∧↑
{xi} : F ∈ Φ(I)= Φ(ΨX )},

Uc(X)= {∨↓x{xi : i ∈ F} : F ∈ Φ(ΨLC (X)), ∃x ∈ D, s.t., {xi : i ∈ F}⊆ ↓x}, X∗ = Lc(X) ∪ Uc(X),
X1 = X∗, X2 = X∗, ..., Xn+1 = X∗,

F(X)=   Xn,
n∈N
where Φ(I)= {F ⊆ I : ∩i∈F ↑xi /= ∅}, Φk(I)= {F ∈ Φ(I): |F | = k}, MI = max{i ∈ I : ∃F ∈ Φ(I), s.t., |F | = i},
and let ΨX = I, and
ΨL (X) = {i↓(i + k(2)), ..., i↓(i + k(2)), ..., i↓(i + k(e+1))↓...↓(i + k(e+1)):1 ≤ i ≤ n},

where
k(2) = min{k : ↑xi ∩ ↑xi+k /= ∅, 0 ≤ k ≤ n − i}, k(2) = max{k : ↑xi ∩ ↑xi+k /= ∅, 0 ≤ k ≤ n − i}

and i↓(i + k(2)) means that xi ∧↑ x	exists, and
i+k(2)

e = max{|E| : ↑xi ∩ (  ↑xi+k) /= ∅, 0 ≤ k ≤ n − i},
k∈E

{(i + k(e+1)), ..., (i + k(e+1))} = max{E : ↑xi ∩ (   ↑xi+k) /= ∅, 0 ≤ k ≤ n − i},

k∈E

i↓(i + k(e+1))↓...↓(i + k(e+1)) denotes that ∧↑{x ,x

i+k(e+1)

the definition of Ψ, we know that |ΨLc(X)| ≤ (Lc(X))!. Then ΨLc(X) is finite. Similarly, for some Xk, the set ΨXk is finite.
Let us define ME ⊆fin mub{yi : i ∈ E} for a finite set E: for any m ∈ ME, there is x ∈ ∩i∈E↑xi such that m  x. By compactness of D, there is a finite set ME ⊆ mub{yi : i ∈ E} such that mub{xi : i ∈ E}⊆  m∈ME ↑m.
Let ma = ∧↑	{yi}, if a = ∧↑	{xi} for F ∈ Φ(ΨX  ). Let ma = ∨↓x{yi : i ∈

a = ∨↓x{xi : i ∈ F}.
) and

By the distributive property and compactness of D, the set {ma : a ∈ F(X)} is finite. Let us define a mapping ƒI : D→D as follows: for x ∈ D,
ƒ (x)= ⎧⎨ ma, x ∈ (↑ma ∩ ↑a) \ ↑(↑a ∩ F(X)), a ∈ F(X),
⎩ 0↓x, otherwise.
Then {ƒI : I ⊆fin N} is an approximate identity over D.	2
In [16], we show that the consistent Smyth powerdomain over a Lawson compact continuous domain is a Lawson compact continuous L-domain.
Theorem 3.8 [16] If L is a Lawson compact continuous domain, then the consis- tent Smyth powerdomain SC(L) is a Lawson compact continuous L-domain satisﬁed the consistent  -multiplicative property and the distributive property with ∨ and
∧↑.	2
By Theorem 3.7 and Theorem 3.8, we have the following conclusion:
Theorem 3.9 If L is a Lawson compact continuous domain, then the consistent Smyth powerdomain SC(L) over L is an FS-∧↑-domain.
