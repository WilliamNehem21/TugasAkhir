In this paper, a new kind of sets called Dα-open sets are introduced and studied in a to- pological spaces. The class of all Dα-open sets is strictly between the class of all α-open sets and g-open sets. Also, as applications we introduce and study Dα-continuous, Dα-open, and Dα-closed functions between topological spaces. Finally, some properties of Dα-closed and strongly Dα-closed graphs are investigated.

Introduction and preliminaries

Generalized open sets play a very important role in General Topology, and they are now the research topics of many to- pologies worldwide. Indeed a significant theme in General
Topology and Real Analysis is the study of variously modified forms of continuity, separation axioms, etc. by utilizing gen- eralized open sets. One of the most well-known notions and also inspiration source are the notion of α-open [1] sets intro- duced by Njåstad in 1965 and generalized closed (g-closed) subset of a topological space [2] introduced by Levine in 1970.

Since then, many mathematicians turned their attention to the generalization of various concepts in General Topology by con- sidering α-open sets [3–10] and generalized closed sets [11–13]. In 1982 Dunham [14] used the generalized closed sets to define a new closure operator, and thus a new topology τ*, on the space, and examined some of the properties of this new to- pology. Throughout the present paper (X,  ), (Y,  ) and (Z, ν) denote topological spaces (briefly X, Y and Z) and no separa- tion axioms are assumed on the spaces unless explicitly stated. For a subset A of a space (X, τ), Cl(A) and Int(A) denote the closure and the interior of A, respectively. Since we require the following known definitions, notations, and some properties, we recall in this section.

Definition 1.1. Let (X, τ) be a topological space and A ⊆ X. Then

A is α-open [1] if A  Int(Cl(Int(A)) and α-closed [1] if
Cl(Int(Cl(A))  A .
A is generalized closed (briefly g-closed) [2] if Cl(A) ⊆ U
whenever A ⊆ U and U is open in X.
A is generalized open(briefly g-open) [2] if X\A is g-closed.

The α-closure of a subset A of X [3] is the intersection of all α-closed sets containing A and is denoted by Clα(A). The α-interior of a subset A of X [3] is the union of all α-open sets contained in A and is denoted by Intα(A). The intersection of all g-closed sets containing A [14] is called the g-closure of A and denoted by Cl*(A), and the g-interior of A [15] is the union of all g-open sets contained in A and is denoted by Int*(A).
We need the following notations:

αO(X) (resp. αC(X)) denotes the family of all α-open sets (resp.
α-closed sets) in (X, τ).
GO(X) (resp. GC(X)) denotes the family of all generalized open sets (resp. generalized closed sets) in (X, τ).


Definition 1.4. A topological space (X, τ) is said to be:

α-T1 [9] (resp. g-T1 [22]) if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist α-open (resp. g-open) set U in X containing x but not y and an α-open (resp. g-open) set V in X containing y but not x.
α-T2 [8] (resp. g-T2 [22]) if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist α-open (resp. g-open) sets U and V in X containing x and y, respectively, such that U ∩ V = ϕ.
Lemma 1.5. Let A ⊆ X, then

X \ Cl*(A)  Int*(X \ A) .
X \ Int*(A)  Cl*(X \ A) .

Lemma 1.6. A function f : (X,  )  (Y,  ) has a closed graph [19] if for each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U ∈ O(X, x) and V ∈ O(Y, y) such that f(U) ∩ V = ϕ.

Lemma 1.7. The graph G(f) is strongly closed [23] if and only if for each point (x, y) G( f ), there exist open sets U ⊂ X and V ⊂ Y containing x and y, respectively, such that f (U)  Cl(V)  .


Dα-closed sets

In this section we introduce Dα-closed sets and investigate some of their basic properties.

Definition 2.1. A subset A of a space X is called Dα-closed if
Cl*(Int(Cl*(A)))  A .

The collection of all Dα-closed sets in X is denoted by DαC(X).

O(X, x)  {U | x U O(X,  )} , O(X, x)  {U | x U  }
C(X, x)  {U | x U C(X,  )} .
and
Lemma 2.2. If there exists an g-closed set F such that
Cl*(Int(F))  A  F , then A is Dα-closed.



Definition 1.2. A function f : X → Y is said to be:

α-continuous [16] (resp. g-continuous [17]) if the inverse image of each open set in Y is α-open (resp. g-open) in X.
α-open [16] (resp. α-closed [16]) if the image of each open (resp. closed ) set in X is α-open (resp. α-closed) in Y.
g-open [18] (resp. g-closed [18]) if the image of each open (resp. closed) set in X is g-open (resp. g-closed) in Y.

Definition 1.3. Let f : X → Y be a function:

The subset {(x, f(x)) | x  X} of the product space X × Y is called the graph of f [19] and is usually denoted by G(f).
a closed graph [19] if its graph G(f) is closed sets in the product space X × Y.
a strongly closed graph [20] if for each point (x, y) G( f ),
there exist open sets U ⊂ X and V ⊂ Y containing x and
y, respectively, such that (U  Cl(V))  G( f )   .
	a strongly α-closed graph [21] if for each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ) , there exist U O(X, x) and V ∈ O(Y, y) such that (U  Cl(V))  G( f )   .
Proof. Since F is g-closed, Cl*(F) = F. Therefore, Cl*(Int(Cl*(A))) 
Cl*(Int(Cl*(F)))  Cl*(Int(F))  A . Hence A is Dα-closed.

Remark 2.3. The converse of above lemma is not true as shown in the following example.

Example 2.4. Let (X, τ) be a topological space, where X = {a, b, c} and   {, {a}, {a, b}, X}. Then FX  {, {c}, {b, c}, X}, GC(X) 
{, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X} , GO(X)  {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, X}, DC(X)  {,
{b}, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X} , DO(X)  {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, {a, c}, X}. There- fore {c}  DC(X) and {a, c} GC(X) but Cl*(Int{a, c})  {a, c} 
{c}  {a, c} .

Theorem 2.5. Let (X, τ) be a topological space. Then

Every α-closed subset of (X, τ) is Dα-closed.
Every g-closed subset of (X, τ) is Dα-closed.

Proof. (i) Since closed set is g-closed, Cl*(A)  Cl(A) [14]. Now, suppose A is α-closed in X, then Cl(Int(Cl(A)))  A. There- fore, Cl*(Int(Cl*(A)))  Cl(Int(Cl(A)))  A . Hence A is Dα-closed in X.

(ii) Suppose A is g-closed. Then Cl*(A) = A [14]. There- fore, Int(Cl*(A))  Cl*(A). Then Cl*(Int(Cl*(A)))  Cl*(Cl*(A))  Cl*(A)  A [14]. Hence A is Dα-closed.

Remark 2.6. The converse of above theorem is not true as
Theorem 2.14. Let A and B be subsets of X. Then the follow- ing results hold.

A  ClD(A)  Cl (A), ClD(A)  Cl*(A) .
ClD()   and ClD(X)  X .

shown in the following example.

Dα-closed set need not be α-closed. (see Example 2.7 below)
Dα-closed set need not be g-closed. (see Example 2.7 below)

Example 2.7. Let (X, τ) be a topological space, where X  {a, b, c}
If A ⊆ B, Then ClD(A)  ClD(B).
ClD(ClD(A))  ClD(A).
ClD(A)  ClD(B)  ClD(A  B) .
ClD(A  B)  ClD(A)  ClD(B) .

Proof. (i) Follows From Theorem 2.5 (i) and (ii), respectively.
(ii) and (iii) are obvious.
If A ⊆ F, F ∈ DαC(X), then from (iii) and Theorem 2.13,
ClD(A)  ClD(F)  F . Again  ClD(ClD(A))  ClD(F)  F. Therefore

and   {, {a, b}, X}. Then FX  C(X)  {, {c}, X}, O(X)  {, {a,		

{a, c}, {b, c}, X} . Therefore {a}  DC(X), but {a} C(X) and
{a} GC(X) .

From the above discussions we have the following diagram
ClD(ClD(A))  {F : A  F, F  DC(X)}  ClD(A).
and (vi) follows from (iii).

Remark 2.15. The equality in the statements (v) of the above theorem need not be true as seen from Example 2.7, where A = {a}, B = {b}, and A  B  {a, b}. Then one can have that, ClD(A)  {a} ; ClD(B)  {b}; ClD(A  B)  X; ClD(A)  ClD(B)  {a, b}.

in which the converses of implications need not be true.					


-closed set  D-closed set  g-closed set

Theorem 2.8. Arbitrary intersection of Dα-closed sets is
Dα-closed.

Proof. Let {Fi : i ∈ Λ} be a collection of Dα-closed sets in X. Then Cl*(Int(Cl*(Fi )))  Fi for each i. Since ∩ Fi ⊆ Fi for each i, Cl*(Fi )  Cl*(Fi ) for each i. Hence Cl*(Fi )  Cl*(Fi ), i  .
Further more the equality in the statements (iv) of the above theorem need not be true as shown in the following example.

Example 2.16. Let (X, τ) be a topological space, where X = {a,
b, c} and   {, {b}, {c}, {b, c}, X}. Then FX  GC(X)  DC(X) 
{, {a}, {a, b}, {a, c}, X} , GO(X)  {, {b}, {c}, {b, c}, X}. Let A = {a},
B = {b}, and A ∩ B = ϕ. Then one can have that, ClD(A)  {a};
ClD(B)  {a, b} ; ClD(A  B)   ; ClD(A)  ClD(B)  {a}.

Therefore Cl*(Int(Cl*(Fi )))  Cl*(Int(Cl*(Fi )))  Cl*(Int(Cl*(Fi ))) 
Cl*(Int(Cl*(Fi )))  Fi . Hence ∩Fi is Dα-closed.		
Dα-open sets

Remark 2.9. The union of two Dα-closed sets need not to be Dα-closed as shown in Example 2.7, where both
{a} and {b} are Dα-closed sets but  {a}  {b}  {a, b} is not
Dα-closed.

Corollary 2.10. If a subset A is Dα-closed and B is α-closed, then
A ∩ B is Dα-closed.
Proof. Follows from Theorem 2.5 (i) and Theorem 2.8. Corollary 2.11. If a subset A is Dα-closed and F is g-closed, then
A ∩ F is Dα-closed.

Proof. Follows from Theorem 2.5 (ii) and Theorem 2.8.

Definition 2.12. Let A be a subset of a space X. The Dα- closure of A, denoted by ClD(A), is the intersection of all Dα-closed sets in X containing A. That is ClD(A)  {F : A  F and F  DC(X)} .

Theorem 2.13. Let A be a subset of X. Then A is Dα-closed set in X if and only if ClD(A)  A.

Proof. Suppose A is Dα-closed set in X. By Definition 2.12,
ClD(A)  A . Conversely, suppose ClD(A)  A. By Theorem 2.8 A

In this section we introduce Dα-open sets and investigate some of their basic properties.

Definition 3.1. A subset A of a space X is called an Dα-open if X \ A is Dα-closed. Let DαO(X) denote the collection of all an Dα-open sets in X.

Lemma 3.2. Let A ⊆ X, then

X \ Cl*(X \ A)  Int*(A) .
X \ Int*(X \ A)  Cl*(A) .

Proof. Obvious.

Theorem 3.3. A subset A of a space X is Dα-open if and only if A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))).

Proof. Let A be Dα-open set. Then X \ A is Dα-closed and Cl*(Int(Cl*(X \ A)))  X \ A . By Lemma 3.2 A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). Conversely, suppose A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). Then X \ Int*(Cl(Int* (A)))  X \ A . Hence (Int*(Cl(Int*(X \ A))))  X \ A. This shows that X \ A is Dα-closed. Thus A is Dα-open.

Lemma 3.4. If there exists g-open set V such that V  A  Int*

Proof. Since V is g-open, X \ V is g-closed and X \ Int*(Cl(V))
 X \ A  X \ V . Therefore From Lemma 3.2  Cl*(Int(X \ V))
 X \ A  X \ V . From Lemma 2.2 we have X \ A is Dα-closed. Hence A is Dα-open.

Remark 3.5. The converse of Lemma 3.4 need not to be true as seen from Example 2.4, where {a, b}  DO(X) and
{b} GO(X) but {b}  {a, b}  {b} .

Theorem 3.6. Let (X, τ) be a topological space. Then

Every α-open subset of (X, τ) is Dα-open.
Every g-open subset of (X, τ) is Dα-open.

Proof. From Theorem 2.5, the proof is obvious.
If A ⊆ B, then IntD(A)  IntD(B).
IntD(IntD(A))  IntD(A) .
IntD(A)  IntD(B)  IntD(A  B).
IntD(A  B)  IntD(A)  IntD(B).

Proof. Obvious.

Remark 3.16. The equality in the statements (v) of Theorem

Theorem 3.17. Let x ∈ X. Then x ClD(A) if and only if U ∩ A ≠ ϕ
for every Dα-open set U containing x.

Proof. Let x ClD(A) and there exists Dα-open set U contain- ing x such that U ∩ A = ϕ. Then A  X \ U and X\U is Dα- closed. Therefore  ClD(A)  ClD(X \ U)  X \ U. This  implies x ClD(A), which is a contradiction. Conversely, assume that U ∩ A ≠ ϕ for every Dα-open set U containing x and x ClD(A). Then there exists Dα-closed subset F containing A such that

x F . Hence x ∈ X \ F and X \ F is Dα-open. Therefore A ⊆ F,
(X \ F)  A   This is a contradiction to our assumption.



Corollary 3.10. If a subset A is Dα-open and B is α-open, then
A ∪ B is Dα-open.
Proof. Follows from Theorem 3.6 (i) and Theorem 3.8. Corollary 3.11. If a subset A is Dα-open and U is g-open, then
A ∪ U is Dα-open.

Proof. Follows from Theorem 3.6 (ii) and Theorem 3.8.

Definition 3.12. Let A be a subset of a space X. The Dα- interior of A is denoted by IntD(A), is the union of all an Dα-open sets in X contained in A. That is IntD(A)  {U : U  A,
Lemma 3.18. Let A be any subset of (X, τ). Then

A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))) is Dα-open;
A  Cl*(Int(Cl*(A))) is Dα-closed.

Proof.

Int*(Cl(Int*(A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))))))  Int*(Cl(Int*(A)  Int*(Cl
(Int*(A)))))  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))) .	This	implies	that
A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))  A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))))))
 Int*(Cl(Int*(A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))))) . Therefore A  Int*(Cl

Proof. Obvious.
A  Cl*(Int(Cl*(A))) is Dα-closed.

Theorem 3.14. Let A be a subset of X. Then A is Dα-open if and only if IntD(A)  A .

Proof. Follows from Theorem 2.13 and Lemma 3.13.
Proof.

Let B  IntD(A). Clearly B is Dα-open and B ⊆ A. Since B is Dα-open, B  Int*(Cl(Int*(B)))  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). This proves that B  A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). By Lemma 3.18,

A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))) is Dα-open. By the definition of IntD(A), A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))  B . Then it follows that B  A  Int*(Cl(Int*(A))) . Therefore  IntD(A)  A  Int*(Cl

Proof. (i)→(ii) Since V ⊂ Y containing f(x) is open, then f 1(V)  DO(X). Set W  f 1(V) which contains x, therefore f(W) ⊂ V.
(ii)→(i) Let V ⊂ Y be open, and let x  f 1(V), then f(x) ∈ V and
thus there exists Wx  DO(X) such that x ∈ Wx and f(Wx) ⊂ V.

→(iv) Let A  X and F be a closed set in Y containing f(A). Then by (iii), f 1(F) is Dα-closed set containing A. It follows that
ClD(A)  ClD( f 1(F))  f 1(F) and hence f (ClD(A))  F . Therefore
f (ClD(A))  Cl( f (A)) .
→(v) Let B  Y and A  f 1(B). Then by assumption, f (ClD(A))  Cl( f (A))  Cl(B) . This implies that ClD(A)  f 1 (Cl(B)) . Hence ClD( f 1(B))  f 1(Cl(B)).
→(vi) Let B  Y. By assumption, ClD( f 1(Y \ B))  f 1
(Cl(Y \ B)) . This implies that, ClD(X \ f 1(B))  f 1(Y \ Int(B)) and hence X \ IntD( f 1(B))  X \ f 1(Int(B)). By taking complement on both sides we get f 1(Int(B))  IntD( f 1(B)).
→(i) Let U be any open set in Y. Then Int(U) = U. By as-

P(X). Since {z} is open in Y, f 1({z})  {c}  DO(X), but {c} O(X). Therefore f is Dα-continuous but not α-continuous.
(ii) Let (X,τ) and (Y,σ) be the topological spaces in (i) and f : X → Y be a function defined by f(a) = x, f(b) = f(c) = z. Since {z} is open in Y, f 1({z})  {b, c}  DO(X), but {b, c} GO(X). There-
fore f is Dα-continuous but not g-continuous.

From the above discussions we have the following diagram in which the converses of implications need not be true.

-continuity  D-continuity  g-continuity

Theorem 4.5. Let f : X → Y be a function. Then the following are equivalent:

f is Dα-continuous.
For each x ∈ X and each open set V ⊂ Y containing f(x), there exists Dα-open set W ⊂ X containing x such that f(W) ⊂ V.
The inverse image of each closed set in Y is Dα-closed in X.
Proof. Obvious.

Remark 4.7. Composition of two Dα-continuous functions need not be Dα-continuous as seen from the following example.

Example 4.8. Let X  {a, b, c} associated with the topology  
{, {b}, {a, b}, X} , Y  {x, y, z} associated with the topology
  {, {x}, Y} and Z  {p, q, r} associated with the topology
  {, {r}, Z} and f : (X,  )  (Y,  ) by f(a) = y, f(b) = x, f(c) = z. Define g : (Y,  )  (Z, ) by g(x)  g(y)  p, g(z) = r. One can have that FX  {, {c}, {a, c}, X}, GC(X)  {, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X}, GO(X)
 {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, X} , DC(X)  {, {a}, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X}, DO(X)

DC(Y)  DO(Y)  P(X). Clearly, f and g are Dα-continuous. {r} is open in Z. But (gof )1({r})  f 1(g1({r}))  f 1({z})  {c}, which is not Dα-open in X. Therefore gof is not Dα-continuous.


Dα-open functions and Dα-closed functions

In this section we introduce Dα-open functions and Dα-closed functions and investigate some of their basic properties.

egyptian journal of basic and applied sciences 3 (2016) 26–34	31
Definition 5.1. A function f : X → Y is said to be Dα-open (resp.	Corollary 5.8. If f : X → Y is Dα-open, then f 1(ClD(B))  Cl( f 1(B))

Dα-closed) if the image of each open (resp. closed) set in X is
Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed) in Y. Theorem 5.2.
Every α-open function is Dα-open.
Every g-open function is Dα-open.

Proof. It is obvious from Theorem 3.6. Remark 5.3.
Dα-open function need not be α-open. (see Example 5.4 below)
Dα-open function set need not be g-open. (see Example 5.5 below)
Example 5.4. (i) Let X = {x,y,z} associated with the topology
  {, {x}, X} and Y = {a,b,c} associated with the topology
  {, {a, b}, {c}, Y} . Let f : (X,  )  (Y,  ) be a function defined by f(x) = a, f(y) = b and f(z) = c. One can have that FY  O(Y) 
{, {a, b}, {c}, Y} , GC(Y) = GO(Y) = DαC(Y) = DαO(Y) = P(X). Since
{x} is open in X, f ({x})  {a}  DO(Y), but {a} O(Y). There- fore f is Dα-open function but not α-open.
Example 5.5. (ii) Let X = {x,y,z} associated with the topology
  {, {y}, {x, y}, X} and Y = {a, b, c} associated with the topol- ogy   {, {a}, Y}. Let f : (X,  )  (Y,  ) be a function defined by
f(x) = b, f(y) = c and f(z) = a. One can have that FY  {, {b, c}, Y},
GC(Y)  {, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, Y} , GO(Y)  {, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,
b}, {a, c}, Y} , DC(Y)  DO(Y)  P(X). Since {x,y} is open in X,
f ({x, y})  {b, c}  DO(Y), but {b, c} GO(Y). Therefore f is Dα- open function but not g-open.

From the above discussions we have the following diagram in which the converses of implications need not be true.

-open function  D-open function  g-open function

Theorem 5.6. Let f : X → Y be a function. The following state- ments are equivalent.

f is Dα-open.
For each x ∈ X and each neighborhood U of x, there exists
Dα-open set W ⊆ Y containing f(x) such that W ⊆ f(U).

Proof. (i)→(ii) Let x ∈ X and U is a neighborhood of x, then there exists an open set V ⊆ X such that x ∈ V ⊆ U. Set W = f(V). Since f is Dα-open, f (V)  W  DO(Y) and so f (x)  W  f (U).
(ii)→(i) Obvious.

Theorem 5.7. Let f : X → Y be Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed) func- tion and W ⊆ Y. If A ⊆ X is a closed (resp. open) set containing f 1(W) , then there exists Dα-closed (resp. Dα-open) set H ⊆ Y containing W such that f 1(H)  A.

Proof. Let  H  Y \ f (X \ A).  Since  f 1(W)  A,  we  have f (X \ A)  Y \ W . Since f is Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed), then H is Dα-closed (resp. Dα-open) set and f 1(H)  X \ f 1( f (X \ A))  X \ (X \ A)  A .
for each set B ⊂ Y.

Proof. Since Cl( f 1(B)) is closed in X containing f 1(B) for a set B ⊆ Y. By Theorem 5.7, there exists Dα-closed set H ⊆ Y, B ⊆ H such that  f 1(H)  Cl( f 1(B)). Thus, f 1(ClD(B))  f 1(ClD(H))  f 1(H)  Cl( f 1(B)) .

Theorem 5.9. A function f : X → Y is Dα-open if and only if
f (Int(A))  IntD( f (A)) for every subset A of X.

Proof. Suppose f : X → Y is Dα-open function and A ⊆ X. Then Int(A) is open set in X and f (Int(A)) is Dα-open set contained in f(A). Therefore  f (Int(A))  IntD( f (A)). Conversely, let be f (Int(A))  IntD( f (A)) for every subset A of X and U is open set in X. Then Int(U) = U, f (U)  IntD( f (U)). Hence f (U)  IntD( f (U)). By Theorem 3.14 f(U) is Dα-open.

Theorem 5.10. For any bijective function f : (X,  )  (Y,  ) the following statements are equivalent.

f 1 is Dα-continuous function.
f is Dα-open function.
f is Dα-closed function.

Proof. (i)→(ii) Let U be an open set in X. Then X \ U is closed in X. Since f 1 is Dα-continuous, ( f 1 )1(X \ U) is Dα-closed in
Y. That is f (X \ U)  Y \ f (U) is Dα-closed in Y. This implies f(U) is Dα-open in Y. Hence f is Dα-open function.
(ii)→ (iii) Let F be a closed set in X. Then X \ F is open in X.
Since  f  is  Dα-open, f(X \ F)  is  Dα-open  in  Y. That  is f (X \ F)  Y \ f (F) is Dα-open in Y. This implies f(F) is Dα- closed in Y. Hence f is Dα-closed function.
(iii)→ (i) Let F be closed set in X. Since f is Dα-closed func-
tion, f(F) is Dα-closed in Y. That is ( f 1 )1(F) is Dα-closed in Y. Hence f 1 is Dα-continuous function.

Remark 5.11. Composition of two Dα-open functions need not be Dα-open as seen from the following example.

Example 5.12. Let X = {x, y, z} associated with the topology
  {, {x, y}, {z}, X} , Y = {p, q, r} associated with the topology
  {, {p}, Y} and Z = {a,b,c} associated with the topology,  
{, {b}, {a, b}, Z} . Define  f : (X,  )  (Y,  ) by f(x) = p, f(y) = q,
f(z) = r and g : (Y,  )  (Z, ) by g(p) = b, g(q) = a, g(r) = c. One can have that; FY  {, {q, r}, Y} , GC(Y)  {, {q}, {r}, {p, q}, {p, r},
{q, r}, Y} , GO(Y)  {, {p}, {q}, {r}, {p, q}, {p, r}, Y}, DC(Y)  DO(Y)
 P(X) and FZ  {, {c}, {a, c}, Z}, GC(Z)  {, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, Z},
GO(Z)  {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, Z} ,	DC(Z)  {, {a}, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, Z},
DO(Z)  {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, {b, c}, Z} . Clearly, f and g are Dα-open
function. {z} is open in X. But gof ({z})  g( f ({z}))  g({r})  {c} which is not Dα-open in Z. Therefore gof is not Dα-open function.


Dα-closed graph and strongly Dα-closed

In this section we introduce Dα-closed graph and strongly
Dα-closed and investigate some of their basic properties.

Definition 6.1. A function f : X → Y has Dα-closed graph if for each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U  DO(X, x) and V GO(Y, y) such that (U  Cl*(V))  G( f )   .

Remark 6.2. Evidently every closed graph is Dα-closed. That the converse is not true is seen from the following example.

Example 6.3. Let X = {a, b, c} associated with the topology
Remark 6.7. The converse of the above theorem is not true as seen from Example 2.7.

Theorem 6.8. Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is g-T1.

Proof. Let y1, y2(y1  y2 )  Y . The subjectivity of f gives the ex- istence of an element xo ∈ X such that f(xo) = y2. Now (xo, y1 ) (X  Y) \ G( f ) . The Dα-closeness  of  G(f)  provides

  {, {a, b}, X}
and Y = {x, y, z} associated with the topology
U1  DO(X, xo ) , V1 GO(Y, y1 ) such that  f (U1 )  Cl*(V1 )  .

  {, {x}, {x, y}, Y} . Let f : (X,  )  (Y,  ) be a function defined
by f(a) = f(c) = x, f(b) = y. One can have that FX  {, {c}, X} ,
GC(X)  {, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X} , GO(X)  {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, X}, DO
Now  xo U1  f (xo )  y2  f (U1 ). This and the fact that f (U1 )  Cl*(V1 )   guarantee that y2 V1. Again from the sub- jectivity of f gives a x1 ∈ X such that f(x1) = y1. Now

(X)  {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X}
and	FY  {, {z}, {y, z}, Y} ,
(x1, y2 ) (X  Y) \ G( f ) and the Dα-closedness of G(f) provides

GC(Y)  {, {z}, {x, z}, {y, z}, Y} , GO(Y)  {, {x}, {y}, {x, y}, Y}. Since	U2  DO(X, x1 ) , V2 GO(Y, y2 ) such that  f (U2 )  Cl*(V2 )   .

{a, c}  DO(X, c)
and  {y} GO(Y, y)
but  {a, c} O(X)
and
Now x1 U2  f (x1 )  y1  f (U2 ) so that y1 V2. Thus we obtain

{y} O(Y) . Therefore G(f) is Dα-closed but not closed.

Theorem 6.4. Let  f : (X,  )  (Y,  ) be a function and

f is Dα-closed graph;
For each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U  DO(X, x)
and V GO(Y, y) such that f (U)  Cl*(V)  .
For each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U  DO(X, x)
and V  DO(Y, y) such that (U  ClD(V))  G( f )  .
For each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U  DO(X, x)
and V  DO(Y, y) such that f (U)  ClD(V)   . Then
(i)⇔ (ii)
sets V1, V2 GO(Y) such that y1 ∈ V1 but y2 V1 while y2 ∈ V2 but
y1 V2 . Hence Y is g-T1.

Corollary 6.9. Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T1.

Proof. Follows From Theorems 6.6 (i) and 6.8.

Theorem 6.10. Let f : X → Y be any injective with G(f) Dα-closed. Then X is Dα-T1.

Proof. Let  x1, x2(x1  x2 )  X. The injectivity of f implies

(i)→ (iii)
f (x1 )  f (x2 )
whence one obtains that  (x1, f (x2 )) (X  Y) \

(ii)→ (iv)
(i)→ (iv)
G( f ) . The Dα-closedness of G(f) provides U1  DO(X, x1 ), V1 GO(Y, f (x2 ))  such  that  f (U1 )  Cl*(V1 )  .  Therefore f (x2 )  f (U1 ) and a fortiori x2 U1. Again (x2, f (x1 )) (X  Y) \

Proof. (i)→(ii) Suppose f is Dα-closed graph. Then for each
G( f )
and Dα-closedness of G(f) as before gives U2  DO(X,

(x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ) , there exists U  DO(X, x) and V GO(Y, y) such that (U  Cl*(V))  G( f )   . This implies that for each f (x)  f (U) and y ∈ Cl*(V). Since y ≠ f(x), f (U)  Cl*(V)  .
(ii)→(i)  Let  (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ).  Then  there  exists
U  DO(X, x) and V GO(Y, y) such that f (U)  Cl  *(V)  . This implies that f(x) ≠ y for each x ∈ U and y ∈ Cl*(V). There- fore (U  Cl*(V))  G( f )   .
→(iii) Suppose f is Dα-closed graph. Then for each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ) , there exists U  DO(X, x) and V GO(Y, y) such that (U  Cl*(V))  G( f )   . Since g-open set is Dα- open, ClD(V)  Cl*(V). Therefore (U  ClD(V))  G( f )  .
x2 ) , V2 GO(Y, f (x1 )) with f (U2 )  Cl*(V2 )   , which guaran- tees that f (x1 )  f (U2 ) and so x1 U2. Therefore, we obtain sets U1 and U2  DO(X) such that x1 ∈ U1 but x2 U1 while x2 ∈ U2
but x1 U2. Hence X is Dα-T1.

Corollary 6.11. Let f : X → Y be any bijection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then both X and Y are Dα-T1.
Proof. It readily follows from Corollary 6.9 and Theorem 6.10. Definition 6.12. A topological space (X, τ) is said to be Dα-T2 if

	

→(iv)  Let  (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ).  Then  there  exists
U  DO(X, x) and V GO(Y, y) such that f (U)  Cl*(V)   . Since ClD(V)  Cl*(V), f (U)  ClD(V)  f (U)  Cl*(V)   .
(i)→(iv) From (ii).

Definition 6.5. A topological space (X,τ) is said to be Dα-T1 if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist Dα- open U in X containing x but not y and an Dα-open V in X containing y but not x.

Theorem 6.6.

Every α-T1 space is Dα-T1.
Every g-T1 space is Dα-T1.

Proof. It is obvious from Theorem 3.6.
for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist Dα-
open sets U and V in X containing x and y, respectively, such that U ∩ V = ϕ.

Theorem 6.13.

Every α-T2 space is Dα-T2.
Every g-T2 space is Dα-T2.

Proof. Obvious.

Remark 6.14. The converse of the above theorem is not true as seen from Example 2.7.

Theorem 6.15. Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is g-T2.

egyptian journal of basic and applied sciences 3 (2016) 26–34	33



Proof. Let y1, y2(y1  y2 )  Y . The subjectivity of f gives a x1 ∈ X such that f(x1) = y1. Now (x1, y2 ) (X  Y) \ G( f ). The Dα- closedness of G(f) provides U  DO(X, x1 ), V GO(Y, y2 ) such that f (U)  Cl*(V)   . Now x1 U  f (x1 )  y1  f (U). This and the fact that f (U)  Cl*(V)   guarantee that y1 Cl*(V). This mean that there exists W GO(Y, y1 ) such that W ∩ V = ϕ. Hence
Y is g-T2.

Corollary 6.16. Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T2.

Proof. Follows from Theorems 6.13 (ii) and 6.15.

Definition 6.17. A function f : X → Y has a strongly Dα-closed graph if for each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U  DO(X, x) and V ∈ O(Y, y) such that (U  Cl(V))  G( f )   .

Corollary 6.18. A strongly Dα-closed graph is Dα-closed. That the converse is not true is seen from Example 6.3, where
{y} GO(Y, y) but {y} O(Y). Therefore G(f) is Dα-closed but
not strongly Dα-closed.

Remark 6.19. Evidently every strongly α-closed graph (resp. strongly closed graph) is strongly Dα-closed graph. That the converse is not true is seen from the following example.

Example 6.20. Let X = {a, b, c} associated with the topology
  {, {a, b}, X} and Y = {x, y, z} associated with the topology
  {, {x, y}, {z}, Y} . Let f :(X,  )  (Y,  ) be a function defined
by f(a) = f(c) = x, f(b) = y. One can have that FX  {, {c}, X},
GC X  {, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X} , GO X  {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, X}, O X
 {, {a, b}, X} , DO X  {, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X}. Since


Theorem 6.23. If f : X → Y is Dα-continuous function and Y is
T2. Then G(f) is strongly Dα-closed.

Proof. Let (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ). Since Y is T2, there exists a set V ∈ O(Y, y) such that f (x) Cl(V). But Cl(V) is closed. Now  Y \ Cl(V) O(Y, f (x)).  By  Theorem  4.5  there  exists
U  DO(X, x)  such  that  f (U)  Y \ Cl(V).  Consequently,
f (U)  Cl(V)   and therefore G(f) is strongly Dα-closed.

Theorem 6.24. Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly
Dα-closed. Then Y is T1 and α-T1.

Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.8 and T1-ness always guarantees α-T1-ness. Hence Y is α-T1.

Corollary 6.25. Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly
Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T1.

Proof. Follows From Theorems 6.6 (i) and 6.24.

Theorem 6.26. Let f : X → Y be any injective with G(f) strongly
Dα-closed. Then X is Dα-T1.

Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.10.

Corollary 6.27. Let f : X → Y be any bijection with G(f) strongly
Dα-closed. Then both X and Y are Dα-T1.
Proof. It readily follows from Corollary 6.25 and Theorem 6.26. Theorem 6.28. Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly
Dα-closed. Then Y is T2 and α-T2.

{a, c}  DO(X, c)
and  {z} O(Y, z)
but  {a, c} O(X)
(resp.
Proof. Similar to the proof Theorem 6.15 and T2-ness always

{a, c} O(X) ). Therefore G(f) is strongly Dα-closed but not strongly α-closed (resp. strongly closed).

Theorem 6.21. For a function f :(X,  )  (Y,  ), the following properties are equivalent:

f has strongly Dα-closed graph.
For each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U  DO(X, x)
and V ∈ O(Y, y) such that f (U)  Cl(V)   .
guarantees α-T2-ness. Hence Y is α-T2.

Corollary 6.29. Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly
Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T2.

Proof. Follows From Theorems 6.13 (i) and 6.28.


R E F E R E N C E S 

For each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U  DO(X, x)		
and V O(Y, y) such that (U  Cl (V))  G( f )   .

For each (x, y) (X  Y) \ G( f ), there exist U  DO(X, x)
and V O(Y, y) such that f (U)  Cl (V)   .

Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.4.

Theorem 6.22. If f : X → Y is a function with a strongly Dα- closed graph, then for each x ∈ X, f (x)  {Cl ( f (U)) : U  DO(X, x)} .

Proof. Suppose the theorem is false. Then there exists a y ≠ f(x) such that  y {Cl ( f (U)) : U  DO(X, x)}. This implies that y Cl ( f (U)) for every U  DO(X, x). So V ∩ f(U) ≠ ϕ for every V O(Y, y) . This, in its turn, indicates that Cl (V)  f (U)  V  f (U)   , which contradicts the hypothesis that f is a func- tion with Dα-closed graph. Hence the theorem holds.
