Abstract
This paper intends to contribute with a new fuzzy modal logic to model and reason about transition systems involving uncertainty in behaviours. Our formalism supports fuzziness at transitions and on the proposition symbols assignment levels.
Against of other approaches in the literature, our bisimulation and bisimilarity notions generalise the anal- ogous standard notions of classic modal logic and of process algebras. Moreover, the outcome of our logic is also fuzzy, with the semantic interpretation of connectives supported by the G¨odel algebra.
Keywords: bisimulation; simulation; fuzzy transition systems;modal logic;G¨odel algebra


Introduction
For 50 years, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic have been an area of active research (cf. [13]). Fuzzy automata [17], fuzzy Markov processes [1], fuzzy petri nets [25,16], fuzzy reactive frames [24] and fuzzy discrete event systems [22] are some of the formalisms that have been considering to model computational systems that deal with uncertainty and fuzzy sets. In this work, we will focus on fuzzy transition systems or fuzzy labelled transition systems, which are a generalisation of transition

systems or labelled transition systems (widely used in computer science) with [0, 1]- weights on the transitions [26,27,15].
It is well known that bisimulations and simulations are a worth way of com- paring two transition systems. They have been considered in several frameworks, such as fuzzy automata [7,8] fuzzy Markov process [9], fuzzy discrete systems [22], weighted labelled transition system [26,27,15]. All of them have special motivations and, consequently, different formulations. For example, in [26,6,5] bisimulations are defined as equivalence relations. There are other approaches that focus on hori- zontal and vertical bisimulations [15] and some other which define bisimulations as fuzzy relations [7].
In the literature, there are several logics to reason about fuzzy transition systems (or better about state transition systems with assertions on the states). As in the classical case, such logics are variants of modal logic. Among these approaches, both the accessibility and the proposition symbols used to represent assertions on the states can be crisp or fuzzy. For example in [10,11] the propositions are considered crisp and many-valued accessibility relations evaluated in finite Heyting algebras. Bou et al. in [4] adopted the truth support of finite integral commutative residu- ated lattices. In some research works the truth lattice is a chain ([3,23]), where any multi-valued relation can be expressed as a decreasing family of crispy modal rela- tions which is indexed by the support of the respective lattice. The reference [21], presents a multi-valued logic over the G¨odel algebra assuming crisp frames. There are many other ways to define weighted accessibility relation like the approaches used in [20,19]. Addressing many-valued dynamic logic in [14] where J. Hughes et al. introduced a propositional dynamic logic over the continuum truth [0, 1]-lattice with the standard fuzzy residues. On the other hand, C. Liau [18] introduced a many-valued dynamic logic over the specific continuum truth [0, 1]-lattice. This approach is quite different from [14] as it has parametrized the implication.
In this work, we consider the uncertain and the boolean reasoning based on the G¨odel algebra, considering the fuzziness both in the accessibility relation and in the logic. As far as we know there is no research work that focuses on bisimulation and simulation for (full) fuzzy modal logic. We define bisimulation and simulation for fuzzy models using the ideas from the work already done in bisimulation and simulation for fuzzy transition systems [26,27,15] and fuzzy modal logic [12].
Our work is close to the work in [27]. However there are two important aspects that distinguish both approaches: (i) against of what is done there, our logic is a “full” fuzzy modal logic, in the sense that the value of a formula is not bivalent, it is a value in [0, 1], and (ii) our bisimulation notion generalises the analogous concept for standard labelled transition systems (cf. Theorem 4.9). Although in [27], closed sets are used to define bisimulation and simulation, which is similar but not exactly the same as the sets that we have defined (cf. corollary 4.14) as U = E—1[E[U ]] and Uj = E[E—1[Uj]].
The work in [12] also closely resembles our paper in the sense of defining the fuzzy model but they have not defined bisimulations and simulations for fuzzy modal logic. They have defined fuzzy propositions the same way as we do but unlike our

definition of fuzzy accessibility relation, they have defined relations to be reflexive, symmetric and t-norm transitive. Moreover, they define logic using Lukasiewicz’s logic as the underlying algebra while we use the Godel algebra.
Outline of the paper. The remaining of the paper is organised as follows: Sec- tion 2 recalls the standard modal logic, and some properties relevant for this work. Then, in Section 3 we define a fuzzy modal logic based in a G¨odel algebra and in Section 4 are introduced notions of bisimulation and of simulation for this logic. Then, in Section 5 we proved the existence of a bisimilarity which is the largest bisimulation relation (also an equivalence relation) defined on a fuzzy model. Fi- nally, the modal invariance property for this framework is proved in Section 6. We conclude the paper in Section 7 with some consideration about the future work.
Classic Modal Logic
The long tradition in the study of logic is reasoning the scenarios that involve change; since the age of Aristotle. This family of logics which is known as Modal logics represents a classic topic in Logic and Philosophy. The developments of Kripke semantics in the 60’s, based on relational structures, constituted a very important tool to reason about state-based systems. This section briefly reviews the basic definition of propositional modal logic and some of its main results.
Given a set of (atomic) propositional symbols Prop, the Prop-formulas are de- fined by the grammar
ϕ ::= p | 3ϕ| 2ϕ| ∼ ϕ| ϕ ∨ ϕ| ϕ ∧ ϕ
where p ∈ Prop. The Kripke models are state transition structures, with proposi- tions assigned to set of states. Formally, a Prop-model is a tuple M = W , V , R where
W is a non-empty set.
V : Prop → P(W ) is a function.
R ⊆ W × W is binary relation.
The modal satisfaction of a Prop-formula ϕ at a state w in a model M is recur- sively defined as follows:
M, w |= p iff w ∈ V (p)
M, w |= 3ϕ iff there is a wj ∈ W such that (w, wj) ∈ R and M, wj |= ϕ
M, w |= 2ϕ iff for any wj ∈ W such that (w, wj) ∈ R we have M, wj |= ϕ
M, w |=∼ ϕ iff it is false that M, w |= ϕ
M, w |= ϕ ∧ ϕj iff M, w |= ϕ and M, w |= ϕj
M, w |= ϕ ∨ ϕj iff M, w |= ϕ or M, w |= ϕj
Modal logic has been used to reason about statements such as “it is possible”, “it is known” etc. Bisimulation is an important notion in modal logic that relates the states in (Kripke) models with the same behaviour.

Definition 2.1 [Simulation and Bisimulation] A simulation between two models M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) is a non empty relation E ⊆ S × Sj such that whenever s E sj:
Atoms: for any p ∈ Prop, V (p) ⊆ V j(p)
Zig: If s R v then, there exists a vj ∈ Mj such that sj Rj vj and v E vj .
A bisimulation between two models M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) is a non empty simulation relation E ⊆ S × Sj such that whenever s E sj:
Atoms: for any p ∈ Prop, V j(p) ⊆ V (p)
Zag: If sj R vj then there is a v ∈ M such that s R v and v E vj.
It is well known that if two states are bisimilar then they satisfy the same formulas (Modal Invariance). Moreover, the converse also holds for the models with finite image (Hennessy-Milner Theorem). These results can be found in [2].

Fuzzy Modal Logic
Kripke semantics for modal logic consist of graphs labelled with propositional sym- bols on each edge. Hence, they can be used to model many situations, such as network science, graph theory, epistemic logic and also for reasoning about time, beliefs, computational systems, etc. However, there are situations where we cannot say that a transition exists (edges in graphs) or not; the best we can do is to assign a degree of certainty to its existence. This leads to fuzzy state transitions.
Definition 3.1 [Fuzzy Frame and Fuzzy Model] A fuzzy frame is a pair F = (S, R) where
S is a finite non empty set of states;
R : S × S → [0, 1] is the fuzzy accessibility function. A fuzzy model is a tuple M = (S, R, V ) where
(S, R) is a fuzzy frame;
V : S × Prop → [0, 1] is a (fuzzy valuation) function.
An example of a fuzzy frame is presented in Figure 1. We are going to define a fuzzy modal logic based on the G¨odel algebra. The definition of G¨odel algebra is as follows:
Definition 3.2 [G¨odel algebra] The G¨odel algebra is the structure G = ([0, 1], max, min,I, 0, 1,N ), where max , min are the usual maximum and minimum operations, respectively and


I(x, y) =	1	if x ≤ y
y	otherwise
N (x)=	1	if x =0 
0	if x > 0



Fig. 1. Fuzzy Frame example
Definition 3.3 [Formulas] For a given set of propositional symbols Prop, we de- fined the set of Prop-formulas Fm(Prop), by the following grammar:
ϕ := T|⊥| p | ∼ ϕ | ϕ ∧ φ | ϕ ∨ φ | ϕ → φ | 3ϕ | 2ϕ
The satisfaction relation is defined as a function on [0, 1] i.e. it is considered as a fuzzy relation.
Definition 3.4 [Satisfaction] The satisfaction relation in a fuzzy model M consists of a function
|=: S × Fm(Prop) → [0, 1] recursively defined as follows:
(M, s |= T)=1 
(M, s |= ⊥)=0 
(M, s |= p)= V (s, p), for p ∈ Prop and s ∈ S
(M, s |= ϕ ∧ ϕj)= min (M, s |= ϕ), (M, s |= ϕj)
(M, s |= ϕ ∨ ϕj)= max (M, s |= ϕ), (M, s |= ϕj)
(M, s |= ϕ → ϕj)= I((M, s |= ϕ), (M, s |= ϕj))
(M, s |=∼ ϕ)= N (M, s |= ϕ)
(M, s |= 3ϕ)= max min R(s, u), (M, u |= ϕ) |u ∈ S
(M, s |= 2ϕ)= min  I(R(s, u), (M, u |= ϕ))|u ∈ S}

Example 3.5 Consider the fuzzy frame (S , R) in Figure 1. The labels on the transitions mean the value of the relation between such pairs; for example R(s2, s1) = 0.2. Moreover, when there is no transition that means that the value is 0; for example R(s2, s4) = 0. Let us assume M = (S , R , V ), Prop = {p}, V (s3, p)= 0.8 and V (s1, p)= 0.7. Then,

(M, s2 |= 3p) = max min R(s2, s3), (M, s3 |= p) ; min R(s2, s1), (M, s1 |= p)
= max  min(0.6, 0.8); min 0.2, 0.7 }
= max{0.6; 0.2} = 0.6
(M, s2 |= 2p) = min I R(s2, s3), (M, s3 |= p) ; I R(s2, s1), (M, s1 |= p)
= min  I(0.6, 0.8); I(0.2, 0.7 }
= min{1; 1} =1 

Simulation and bisimulation
In this section, we propose definitions of simulation and bisimulation for fuzzy models which are a generalisation of the classical ones. This is altogether a new approach in which we compare two models which have different fuzzy accessibility relations and fuzzy valuation functions.
Definition 4.1 Let E ⊆ S × Sj, U ⊆ S and Uj ⊆ Sj. Then,
E[U ] := {sj ∈ Sj : uE sj for some u ∈ U} E—1[U ] := {s ∈ S : sE uj for some uj ∈ Uj}
Definition 4.2 [Simulation] Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models and E ⊆ S × Sj. We say that E is a simulation from M to Mj if for every w ∈ S and wj ∈ Sj such that w E wj we have
Atoms for any p ∈ Prop, V (w, p) ≤ V j(wj, p)

Fzig For any u ∈ S, R(w, u) ≤	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(wj, uj)

Moreover, we say that E is a simulation from the fuzzy frame (S, R) to (Sj, Rj) if the Fzig condition holds.

Example 4.3 Consider the fuzzy models M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) in Figure 2(a) where
S = {s1, s2, s3, s4}, Sj = {sj , sj },E = {(s1, sj ), (s2, sj ), (s3, sj ), (s4, sj )}, Prop = {p}.

1	2
and ∀ p ∈ Prop,
1	2	2	1

V (s2, p) ≤ V j(sj , p); V (s1, p) ≤ V j(sj , p); V (s3, p) ≤ V j(sj , p); V (s4, p) ≤ V j(sj , p).
2	1	2	1
The labels on transitions mean the value of relations between pairs, for example
R(s3.s4)= 0.4; Rj(sj , sj )= 0.6 etc.
2	1
It is easy to see that the relation E ⊆ S × Sj represented by the dashed lines is a
simulation relation from M to Mj.
In fact, the atomic conditions hold by assumption. To check the Fzig condition we have to check for each pair in E.

Simulation 2.
Fig. 2. Simulation Examples
Let us show for s2 E sj . For that, we have to show that


∀u ∈ S, R(s2, u) ≤	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(sj , uj).

Since, the transitions from s2 that are different from 0 are only (s2, s3) and (s2, s1). So, we show the Fzig condition for only u = s1 and u = s3.
(u = s1) ;	R(s2, s1)= 0.2 ≤	max	Rj(sj , uj)= Rj(sj , sj )= 0.6
u′∈ E[{u}]	2	2	1
(u = s3) ;	R(s2, s3)= 0.6 ≤	max	Rj(sj , uj)= Rj(sj , sj )= 0.7
u′∈ E[{u}]	2	2	2
The remaining cases can be checked in a similar way.
Example 4.4 Consider the fuzzy frames F = (S, R) and Fj = (Sj, Rj) in Figure 2(b) where

S = {s1, s2}, Sj = {sj , sj , sj , sj },E = {(s1, sj ), (s2 , sj ), (s2 , sj ), (s2 , sj )}.
1	2	3	4	1	4	2	3
It is easy to see that the relation E ⊆ S × Sj represented by the dashed lines is a

simulation relation from frame F to Fj.
To check the Fzig condition we have to check for each pair in E. Let us check for the case (s1, sj ).
Clearly,
R(s1, s2)= 0.3 ≤ max{Rj(sj , sj ), Rj(sj , sj ), Rj(sj , sj )} = max{0.7, 0.4, 0.9} = 0.9.

The Fzig condition can also be checked for the pairs (s2 , sj ), (s2 , sj ) and (s2 , sj ).
4	2	3
Definition 4.5 [Bisimulation] Let M = (S, R, V ), Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models and E ⊆ S × Sj. We say that E is a bisimulation from M to Mj if for every w ∈ S and wj ∈ Sj such that w E wj we have
Atoms for any p ∈ Prop, V (w, p)= V j(wj, p)

Fzig for any u ∈ S, R(w, u) ≤	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(wj, uj)

Fzag for any uj ∈ Sj, Rj(wj, uj) ≤	max
u∈E−1[{u′}]
R(w, u)

Moreover, we say that E is a bisimulation from the fuzzy frame (S, R) to (Sj, Rj) if the Fzig and Fzag conditions hold.
As in the standard case, a bisimulation is a binary relation such that itself and its inverse are simulations 5 .
Lemma 4.6 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models and
E ⊆ S × Sj. Then,
E is a bisimulation from M to Mj iff E and E—1 are simulations from M to Mj
and Mj to M, respectively.
Proof. (⇒) Suppose that E is a bisimulation relation. Then clearly, E is a simu- lation relation.
To show that E—1 is a simulation relation we need to note that the Fzag condition for E gives the Fzig condition for E—1 and the atomic condition holds trivially. Thus, E and E—1 are simulations from M to Mj and Mj to M , respectively.
(⇐) Suppose that E and E—1 are simulation relations from M to Mj and from Mj to M , respectively. Similar to the above, both of these conditions imply the Fzig and Fzag condition for E. Also, the atomic conditions together give the atomic condition for E. Hence, E is a bisimulation relation from M to Mj.	2
Example 4.7 Consider the fuzzy frames F = (S, R) and Fj = (Sj, Rj) given in Figure 3(a) where
S = {s1, s2, s3, s4}, Sj = {sj , sj },E = {(s1, sj ), (s2, sj ), (s3, sj ), (s4, sj )}
1	2	1	2	2	1
We will check the Fzig and the Fzag conditions for the specific pair (s2, sj ). So,
5 The inverse of a relation E, is the relation E−1 := {(a, b): (b, a) ∈ E}.



Bisimulation 1

we have to check
∀ u ∈ S , R(s2, u) ≤	max Rj(sj , uj) and ∀ uj ∈ Sj , Rj(sj , uj) ≤	max

R(s2, u)

u′∈E[{u}]	2	2	u∈E−1[{u}]
[Fzig] The transitions from s2 which are different from 0 are only (s2, s1) and (s2, s3). So we check for u = s1, s3.
(u = s1) : R(s2, s1)= 0.6 ≤	max	Rj(sj , uj)= Rj(sj , sj )= 0.6
u′∈ E[{s1}]	2	2	1
(u = s3) : R(s2, s3)= 0.7 ≤	max	Rj(sj , uj)= Rj(sj , sj )= 0.7
u′∈ E[{s3}]	2	2	2
[Fzag] The transitions from sj which are different from 0 are only (sj , sj ) and
2	2	2
(sj , sj ). So we check for uj = sj , sj .
2	1	1	2
(uj = sj ) : Rj(sj , sj )= 0.6 ≤	max	R(2, u)= R(s2, s1)= 0.6

For the remaining pairs in E, the Fzig and Fzag conditions can be proved in a similar way.

Example 4.8 Consider the fuzzy models M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) represented by Figure 3(b) where

S = {s1, s2}, Sj = {sj , sj , sj , sj },E := {(s1, sj ), (s2, sj ), (s2, sj ), (s2, sj )},Prop = {p}

V j(sj , p); V (s2, p)= V j(sj , p)
3	4
It is easay to see that E is a bisimulation relation from M to Mj. We just check
Fzig and Fzag for the pair (s1, sj ).So,

∀ u ∈ S , R(s1, u) ≤	max Rj(sj , uj) and  ∀ uj ∈ Sj , Rj(sj , uj) ≤	max
R(s1, u)

u′∈E[{u}]	1	1	u∈E−1[{u}]
[Fzig] The transitions from s1 which are different from 0 are only (s1, s2). So, we check for u = s2.

(u = s2) ;R(s1, s2)	=	0.9	≤	max
u′∈E[{s2}]
Rj(sj , uj)	=

max{Rj(sj , sj ), Rj(sj , sj ), Rj(sj , sj )} = 0.9
1	2	1	3	1	4
[Fzag] We need to check for uj = sj ; uj = sj ; uj = sj .

(uj = sj ) ; Rj(sj , sj )= 0.7 ≤	max	R(s1, u)= R(s1, s2)= 0.9

(uj = sj ) ; R(sj , sj )= 0.6 ≤	max	R(s1, u)= R(s1, s2)= 0.9

4	1	4
u∈ E−1[{s′ }]

The remaining cases can be checked in a similar way.
The following theorem shows that our notion is a generalization of the classical (crisp) case. This is one of the most important differences from our notion of bisimulation and the one proposed in [5,6,26,27].
Theorem 4.9 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two classical models and E ⊆ S × Sj. Let Mf = (S , Rf ,V f ) and Mjf = (Sj, Rjf ,V jf ) be the natural corresponding fuzzy models, i.e. the functions Rf and Rjf are deﬁned as

f	 1	sR t


jf	j  j
  1	sjRjtj



and the function V jf : Sj × Prop → [0, 1] and V f : S × Prop → [0, 1] are deﬁned as


jf	j
  1	sj ∈ V j(p)

f	  1	s ∈ V (p)


Then the following are equivalent

E is a bismulation from M to Mj.
E is a bisimulation from fuzzy models Mf to Mjf .
Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii) Suppose that E is a bisimulation from M to Mj. Let w ∈ S and
wj ∈ Sj such that w E wj.
The atomic condition is trivial as the fuzzy valuations are defined. To prove the Fzig condition, let u ∈ S.
If Rf (w, u) = 0 then Fzig condition automatically holds.
If Rf (w, u) = 1, then w R u. Then by (classical) zig condition there exist a
uj ∈ Sj such that wj Rj uj and u E uj.
Whenever Rf (w, u) = 1 then there exist a uj ∈ Sj such that Rjf (wj, uj)=1 and
uj ∈ E[{u}].

Thus,	max
u′∈E[{u}]
Rjf (wj, uj)= 1.

Therefore, Rf (w, u) ≤	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rjf (wj, uj). Similarly we can prove the Fzag condi-

tion.
⇒ (i) Suppose that E is a bisimulation from Mf to Mjf . Let w ∈ S and wj ∈ Sj
such that w E wj.
The atomic condition is trivial as the fuzzy valuations are defined.
To prove the (classical) zig condition, let u ∈ S such that w R u. Hence Rf (w, u)= 1.

By the Fzig condition	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rjf (wj, uj)= 1.

Since we are assuming Sj to be finite, there is a uj ∈ E[{u}] such that Rjf (wj, uj)= 1.
This means that there is
uj ∈ Sj such that wj Rj uj and u E uj. Therefore, zig condition holds. Similarly for zag condition.	2
The following theorem states that given two bisimilar states if the value of the transition from one is non-empty then the value of the transition from the other is also non-empty.
Theorem 4.10 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models and E ⊆ S ×Sj a bisimulation from M to Mj. Let w ∈ S and wj ∈ Sj such that w E wj. Then,
for  any  u  ∈  S,  if  R(w, u)  /=  0  then  there  exists  uj  ∈
E[{u}] such that Rj(wj, uj) /= 0.
for any uj  ∈  Sj,  if Rj(wj, uj)  /=  0  then  there exists u  ∈
E—1[{uj}] such that R(w, u) /= 0.

Proof. (i) Let u ∈ S such that R(w, u) /= 0. As, w E wj,	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(wj, uj) > 0 (by

Fzig condition). This implies that there is a uj ∈ E[{u}] such that Rj(wj, uj) /= 0.
(ii) The proof is similar (using Fzag condition).	2
The following two lemmas state alternative (set-based) conditions for a relation to

be a bisimulation (cf. Theorem 4.13).
Lemma 4.11 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models and
E ⊆ S×Sj. Then for any w ∈ S and wj ∈ Sj the following conditions are equivalent:

for any u ∈ S, R(w, u) ≤	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(wj, uj)

for any U ⊆ S, max R( w, u) ≤	max
Rj(wj, uj)

u∈U
u′∈ E[U ]

Proof. (ii) ⇒ (i) Just take U = {u}⊆ S in condition (ii).
(i) ⇒ (ii) Let U  ⊆ S.	Since for any u ∈ U E[{u}] ⊆ E[U ]; we have

max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(wj, uj) ≤  max
u′∈E[U ]
Rj(wj, uj).

Hence, by the above inequation and (i), we have that for any u ∈ U, R(w, u) ≤

max
u′∈E[U ]
Rj(wj, uj).

As U is arbitrary, for any U ⊆ S, max R( w, u) ≤  max
Rj(wj, uj).	2

u∈U
u′∈ E[U ]

Lemma 4.12 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models and
E ⊆ S×Sj. Then for any w ∈ S and wj ∈ Sj the following conditions are equivalent:

for any uj ∈ Sj, Rj(wj, uj) ≤	max
u∈E−1[{u′}]
R(w, u)

for any Uj ⊆ Sj, max Rj(wj, uj) ≤	max
R(w, u)

u′∈U′	u∈E−1[U′]
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of the previous lemma.	2
As a consequence of the previous lemmas we have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.13 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy modals and
E ⊆ S × Sj. Then the following are equivalent
E is a bisimulation from M to Mj
for any (w, wj) ∈ E the following conditions hold,
for any p ∈ Prop, V (w, p)= V j(wj, p)


for any U ⊆ S, max R( w, u) ≤	max
Rj(wj, uj)

u∈U
u′∈ E[U ]

for any Uj ⊆ Sj, max Rj(wj, uj) ≤	max
R(w, u).

u′∈U′	u∈E−1[U′]
Proof. The result is directly entailed by Lemma 4.10 and Lemma 4.11.	2
Corollary 4.14 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models and
E ⊆ S × Sj. Then the following are equivalent
E is a bisimulation from M to Mj
for any (w, wj) ∈ E the following conditions hold,
for any p ∈ Prop,V (w, p)= V (wj, p)

for any U ⊆ S such that U = E—1[E[U ]], max
u′∈E[U ]
Rj(wj, uj)= maxR(w, u)
u∈U

for	any	Uj	⊆	Sj such that Uj	=	E[E—1[Uj]], max Rj(wj, uj)	=
u′∈U′

max
u∈E−1[U′]
R(w, u)

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii) Let U ⊆ S such that U = E—1[E[U ]].
On one hand, by the equivalent condition of Fzig in Lemma 4.11, we have


maxR(w, u) ≤  max
Rj(wj, uj)	(2)

u∈U
u′∈E[U ]

On the other hand, by the equivalent condition of Fzag in Lemma 4.12,we have


∀ Uj ⊆ Sj, max Rj(wj, uj) ≤	max
R(w, u)	(3)

u′∈U′	u∈E−1[U′]
In particular, for Uj = E[U ] in (2), we get


max
u′∈E[U ]
Rj(wj, uj) ≤	max
u∈E−1[E[U ]]
R(w, u)	(4)



Combining equation (1) and (3) we get:  max
u′∈E[U ]
Rj(wj, uj)= maxR(w, u).
u∈U

Similarly, we can prove the other conditions of (ii) by using Lemma 4.10 and also clearly, the atoms condition hold.
(ii) ⇒ (i) Let (w, wj) ∈ E and U ⊆ S. Consider U0 = E—1[E[U ]].
It is easy to see that U ⊆ U0, E[U ]= E[U0] and U0 = E—1[E[U0]]. Then,
max R(w, u) ≤ max R(w, u)

u∈U
u∈U0
=  max
u′∈E[U0]
= max
u′∈E[U ]
Rj(wj, uj) (by hypothesis)
Rj(wj, uj)

The proof of the other condition in Theorem 4.13 is similar. Hence, E is a bisimulation from M to Mj.	2

Bisimilarity
This section establishes some properties of bisimulations on fuzzy models, making the analogy with the well known results of standard bisimulation. As happens in the classic settings, these results figure out the usual ingredients to introduce a notion of fuzzy bisimilarity — the largest bisimulation.
With this aim, we start observing that the diagonal relation is a bisimulation and that bisimulations are closed under unions and compositions.
Theorem 5.1 Let M = (S , R , V ), Mj = (Sj , Rj ,V j) and Mjj = (Sjj , Rjj ,V jj) be fuzzy models. Then, the following properties hold

The diagonal relation Δs ⊆ S × S := {(s, s)|s ∈ S} is a bisimulation (from M
to itself);
If E and F are bisimulations from model M to Mj, then E ∪ F is also a bisimulation from M to Mj;
If E is a bisimulation from M to Mj and Ej is a bisimulation from Mj to Mjj, then E ◦ Ej is a bisimulation from M to Mjj.
If E is a bisimulation from M to Mj, then E—1 is a bisimulation from Mj to
M.
Proof. (i) The proof is direct since the (Fzig), (Fzag) and (atom) trivially holds at equal points.
Let us suppose s (E ∪ F ) sj. Then s E sj or s F sj. Suppose that s E sj.
Then, the (atom) property for (E ∪ F ) is assured by the (atom) property of E. By (Fzig) condition of E (As, E is a bisimulation) and E ⊆ (E ∪ F );	∀  u ∈

S, R(s, u) ≤	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(sj, uj) ≤	max
u′∈ E∪F [{u}]
Rj(sj, uj).

Therefore (Fzig) condition holds for (E ∪ F ). The condition (Fzag) can be proved in a similar way.
Let us assume w (E ◦ Ej) wjj. Then by the definition there exists ; wj ∈ Sj such that w E wjand wj Ej wjj.
Atom condition for (E ◦ Ej) is assured by the (Atom) conditions of E and Ej; we have
∀ p ∈ Prop,V (w, p)= V j(wj, p)= V jj(wjj, p).
Now we prove the (Fzig) condition for (E ◦ Ej). As, E is a bisimulation relation by (Fzig) condition of E, we have


∀ u ∈ S, R(w, u) ≤	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(wj, uj)	(5)

and by (Fzig) condition of Ej,


∀ vj ∈ Sj, Rj(wj, vj) ≤	max
v′′∈ E′[{v′}]
Rjj(wjj, vjj)	(6)

in particular,


∀ uj ∈ E[{u}], Rj(wj, uj) ≤	max
v′′∈ E′[{E{u}}]
Rjj(wjj, vjj).	(7)



Hence,

max
u′∈ E[{u}]

Rj(wj, uj) ≤	max
v′′∈ E′[{E{u}}]

Rjj(wjj, vjj).	(8)

Using (5) and (8) we get the (Fzig) condition for (E ◦ Ej) : 


∀ u ∈ S, R(w, u) ≤	max
v′′∈ E′[{E{u}}]
Rjj(wjj, vjj)	(9)

By similar way we can prove the (Fzag) condition for (E ◦ Ej).
Suppose that E is bisimulation relation. We are going to prove that E—1 :=
{(sj, s) : (s, sj) ∈ E} ⊆ Sj × S is a bisimulation relation. Let (s, sj) ∈ E, then the Fzig condition of E is given by


∀ u ∈ S,  R(s, u) ≤	max
u′∈ E[{u}]
Rj(sj, uj)	(10)

Note that the Fzig condition of E (for the pair (s, sj)) is exactly same as the Fzag condition for E—1 (for the pair (sj, s)). Similarly, the Fzag condition of E is given by,

∀ vj ∈ Sj,  Rj(sj, vj) ≤	max
v∈ E−1[{v′}]
R(s, v)	(11)

Note that the Fzag condition of E (for the pair (s, sj)) coincides with the Fzig condition for E—1 (for the pair (sj, s)) and the atom condition for E—1 is assured by the atom condition of E.
2
We have now all the ingredients to characterise a bisimilarity notion for fuzzy mod- els.
Definition 5.2 [Bisimilarity] Let M	=  (S, R, V ) be a fuzzy model.	The
bisimilarity on M is the relation:
∼S :=	{E ⊆ S × S | E is a bisimulation relation from M to itself}
Theorem 5.3 Let ∼S the bisimilarity relation deﬁned on a fuzzy model M. Then
∼S is a bisimulation from M to itself;
∼S is an equivalence relation on S.
Proof. Property (i) is a direct consequence of (ii) of Theorem 5.1. In order to prove (ii) we just have to observe that reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry of ∼S are consequence of (i) and (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 5.1, respectively.	2
We observe that these results are crucial for the further development of this frame- work. In particular, the equivalence relation structure opens the door for new theoretical developments, including minimization and conductive proof methods.
Modal Invariance
The importance of Invariance in Modal logic is well known. Here we show that invariance by bisimulation also holds in Fuzzy modal logic.
Theorem 6.1 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models, and E ⊆ S × Sj a bisimulation from M to Mj. Then, for any formula φ ∈ F m(Prop) and for any two states w ∈ S, wj ∈ S, such that w E wj,
(M, w |= φ)= (Mj, wj |= φ)

Proof. We prove this result by induction on the structure of formulas.
For the invariance of the formula T, (M, w |= T)=1= (Mj, wj |= T) and similarly we can prove for the formula ⊥.
Invariance of atomic propositional symbols p ∈ Prop, is a direct consequence of (Atoms) property,
(M, w |= p)= V (w, p)= V j(wj, p)= (Mj, wj |= p).
For the invariance of formulas ∼ φ, we observe that
  1	(M, w |= φ)=0	I.H.  1	(Mj, wj |= φ)=0	j	j


For the invariance of formulas φ ∧ ϕ, we observe that
(M, w |= φ ∧ ϕ)	=	min (M, w |= φ), (M, w |= ϕ)} }
and the proof for the invariance of formulas φ ∨ ϕ can be proved similarly. For the invariance of formulas φ → ϕ;
(M, w |= φ → ϕ)=	1	if (M, w |= φ) ≤ (M, w |= ϕ) (M, w |= ϕ)	otherwise
and by I.H. this is equivalent to
  1	if (Mj, wj |= φ) ≤ (Mj, wj |= ϕ)

Hence, (M, w |= φ → ϕ)= (Mj, wj |= φ → ϕ).
For the invariance of formulas 3φ, we observe that By (Fzig) condition we have


∀u ∈ S, R(w, u) ≤	max	Rj(wj, uj)= Rj(wj, uj ) for some uj
∈ Sj	(12)

u′∈ E[{u}]	u	u
Since for every u ∈ S; uj ∈ E[{u}] iff u E uj . By I. H., we have (M, u |= φ) = 

(Mj, uj
|= φ) and, by (12),
∀u ∈ S, min{R(w, u), (u |= φ)}≤ min{Rj(wj, uj ), (uj

|= φ)}	(13)

u	u


and, in particular,
max(min{R(w, u), (u |= φ)}) ≤  max (min{Rj(wj, uj ), (uj

|= φ)})	(14)

u∈S
u′ :u∈S	u	u



Since {uj
: u ∈ S} ⊆ {uj : uj ∈ Sj} we have max{uj
: u ∈ S} ≤ max{uj : uj ∈ Sj}

and by (14)
max(min{R(w, u), (u |= φ)}) ≤ max(min{Rj(wj, uj), (uj |= φ)})	(15)

u∈S
u′∈S′

i.e. (M, w |= 3φ) ≤ (Mj, wj |= 3φ). Similarly we can prove (M, w |= 3φ) ≥
(Mj, wj |= 3φ) by using Fzag condition.
For the invariance of formulas  φ, since w E wj we have by (Fzig) condition


∀u ∈ S, R(w, u) ≤	max	Rj(wj, uj)= Rj(wj, uj ) for some uj
∈ Sj	(16)

u′∈ E[{u}]	u	u
Since for every u ∈ S, uj ∈ E[{u}] iff u ∈ S, u E uj . Hence, by I.H.


(M, u |= φ)= (Mj, uj
|= φ).	(17)

It follows from the definition of I that x0 ≤ x1 implies I(x0, y) ≥ I(x1, y). Then, from (16) and (17) we have
∀u ∈ S, I R(w, u), (u |= φ) ≥ I Rj(wj, uj ), (uj |= φ) 
and in particular
min(I R(w, u), (u |= φ) ) ≥ min (I Rj(wj, uj ), (uj |= φ) ).	(18)
Since {uj : u ∈ S} ⊆ {uj : uj ∈ Sj}, we have min{uj : u ∈ S} ≥ min{uj : uj ∈ Sj}
and hence
min(I R(w, u), (u |= φ) ) ≥ min (I Rj(wj, uj), (uj |= φ) ).	(19)

Therefore (M, w |=  φ) ≥ (Mj, wj |=  φ). The proof for (M, w |=  φ) ≤ (Mj, wj |=
 φ) is analogous.	2
As a straightforward consequence we have the following result.
Corollary 6.2 Let M = (S, R, V ) and Mj = (Sj, Rj,V j) be two fuzzy models, and E ⊆ S × Sj a bisimulation relation from M to Mj. For any two states w ∈ S and wj ∈ S such that w E wj we have,
maxR(w, u)= maxRj(wj, uj)

u∈S
u′∈S′

Proof. Since w E wj, we have by Theorem 6.1 that
(M, w |= 3T)= (Mj, wj |= 3T)
i.e.
max(min{R(w, u), (u |= T)})= max(min{R(wj, uj), (uj |= T)})

u∈S
u′∈S′

By satisfaction definition, this is the same as
max(min{R(w, u), 1})= max(min{R(wj, uj), 1})

u∈S
u′∈S′

and since R(w, u) ≤ 1, Rj(wj, uj) ≤ 1, we have:
maxR(w, u)= maxRj(wj, uj)	2

7	Conclusion
u∈S
u′∈S′

This paper proposed a new bisimulation notion for fuzzy models, i.e. fuzzy transition systems with a fuzzy valuation. Moreover, based on these models we introduced a fuzzy modal logic, supporting the interpretation of connectives by a G¨odel algebra. Then we pursued an analogy with the standard treatment of bisimulation relation, by establishing some standard results for the proposed bisimulation notion. This includes the existence of the bisimilarity equivalence in Theorem 5.3. Finally, we were able to prove the modal invariance of fuzzy modal logic with respect to the proposed bisimulation as in Theorem 6.1. A core motivation for this research was to set up a theory that actually generalises the standard modal logic. Against of other bisimulations proposed in the literature for fuzzy transition systems (eg. [5,6,26,27], our bisimulation relation, in fact, generalises the bisimulation notion proposed for modal logic and process algebras as in Theorem 4.9.
There are a number of lines of open research that emerges from this starting paper. First, there is a natural follow up to be done in this work, including the study of the Hennessy-Milner Theorem (the converse implication of the invariance theorem) and the establishment of a standard translation to first-order logic. Next, it was our intention to generalise these results to other variants of our logic based on fuzzy algebras other than the G¨odel. This would follow the parametric strategy adopted by the authors in [19].
