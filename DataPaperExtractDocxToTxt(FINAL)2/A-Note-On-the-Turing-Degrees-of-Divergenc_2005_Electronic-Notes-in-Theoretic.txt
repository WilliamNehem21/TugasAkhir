Abstract
The Turing degree of a real number is defined as the Turing degree of its binary expansion. In this note we apply the double witnesses technique recently developed by Downey, Wu and Zheng [2] and show that there exists a ∆0-Turing degree which contains no divergence bounded computable real numbers. This extends the result of [2] that not every ∆0-Turing degree contains a d-c.e. real.
Keywords: Turing degree of reals, divergence bounded computable reals.


Introduction
The computability of real numbers was introduced by Turing [11] by means of decimal expansions. Namely, a real number x is computable if it has a computable decimal expansion, i.e., x = n∈N f (n) · 10−n for a computable function f : N → {0, 1, ··· , 9}. This notion is independent of the represen- tations of the reals as shown by Robinson [9] and others. Concretely, a real
x ∈ [0; 1] is computable iff the Dedekind cut Lx := {r ∈ Q : r < x} is a computable set; iff x has a computable binary expansion, i.e., there is a com- putable set A such that x = xA :=   n∈A 2−(n+1); and iff there is a computable

sequence (xs) of rational numbers which converges to x effectively in the sense that |xs − xs+1| ≤ 2−s for all s, and so on. Similarly, the Turing degree of a real number and the Turing reducibility between real numbers can be nat- urally defined based on binary expansion, Dedekind cut or Cauchy sequence representations of the reals, respectively and it is not difficult to see that they are equivalent (see e.g., [5]). For example, xA is Turing reducible to xB (de- noted by xA ≤T xB) if A ≤T B and xA ≡T xB if xA ≤T xB & xB ≤T xA. In addition, the Turing degree of a real x is defined as the class of all reals which are Turing equivalent to x, namely, degT (x) := {y ∈ R : y ≡T x}.
Especially, the degree of a computable real number consists of all computable
reals. On the other hand, Ho [6] shows that a real number is Turing reducible to 0', the Turing degree of the halting problem, if and only if it is computably approximable, where the computably approximable reals are simply the lim- its of computable sequences of rational numbers (see [1]). The Turing degree of a computably approximable real is also called ∆0-Turing degree or simply
∆0-degree.
Between the classes of computable and computably approximable real numbers there are a lot of interesting classes of real numbers introduced in literatures ([1,7,12]). For example, x is left (right) computable if it is the limit of an increasing (decreasing) computable sequence of rational numbers. The left computable reals are also called computably enumerable (c.e., for short) (see [3,4]) because their left Dedekind cuts are c.e. sets of rational numbers. x is d-c.e. if it is the difference of two c.e. reals. The class of d-c.e. real numbers (denoted by WC) is a very interesting class. Ambos-Spies, Weihrauch and the first author showed in [1] that the class WC is the arithmetical closure
of the c.e. reals and hence is a field and that x is d-c.e. if and only if there is a computable sequence (xs) of rational numbers which converges to x weakly effectively in the sense that the sum  s∈N |xs − xs+1| is bounded.
Since any c.e. real has a c.e. left Dedekind cut, the Turing degree of any
c.e. real is c.e., although not every c.e. real has a c.e. binary expansion as observed by Jockusch (see [10]). On the other hand, every non-computable
c.e. degree contains a non-c.e. real. For the d-c.e. reals, the situation is a little bit complicated. The case for the d-c.e. reals is different. The first author shows in [13] that there is a d-c.e. real whose Turing degree is not even ω-c.e. Here a set A ⊆ N is ω-c.e. if there are a computable function h and a computable sequence (As) of finite sets which converges to A such that
|{s ∈ N : n ∈ As∆As+1}| ≤ h(n) for all n. A Turing degree is called ω-c.e. if
it contains an ω-c.e. set. Recently, Downey, Wu and the first author showed in [2] that any ω-c.e. Turing degree contains at least a d-c.e. real, but there exists a ∆0-Turing degree which does not contain any d-c.e. real.


In this paper, we explore the Turing degrees of another class of reals, namely, the divergence bounded computable reals which were introduced by the authors together with Gengler and von Braunmu¨hl in [7]. A real number
x is called divergence bounded computable (dbc, for short) if there are a total
computable function h and a computable sequence (xs) of rational numbers which converges to x h-bounded effectively in the sense that there are at most h(n) non-overlapping 2−n-jumps (i, j) for all n. Here an index pair (i, j) is a 2−n-jump of the sequence (xs) if |xi − xj| ≥ 2−n. It is shown that, every
d-c.e. real is dbc but there is computably approximable real which is not dbc, i.e., the class of all dbc reals (denoted by DBC) is strictly between the classes of d-c.e. and computably approximable reals. Like WC, the class DBC is also a field. Furthermore, the class DBC is also closed under total computable real functions while WC is not so. Actually, DBC is the closure of WC under computable total real functions (see [8]). We will show in this paper that, even the Turing degrees of dbc reals does not exhaust all the ∆2-Turing degrees.

Main Result
This section gives a construction which shows that not every ∆0-degree con- tains a divergence bounded computable real. The construction is another interesting example of the “double witnesses” technique introduced in [2].
In the following, the use function of computable functionals Φ and Ψ are denoted by the lower case ϕ and ψ, respectively. W.l.o.g. we assume that n ≤ ϕe,s(n) ≤ s for all n and s, where ϕe,s(n) denotes the use function of Φe for the input n up to stage s. We identify a set A with its characteristic function. That is, A(n) = 1 ⇐⇒ n ∈ A and A(n) = 0 ⇐⇒ n ∈/ A for all n. For convenience, we write A(n)(m) := A(n)A(m).
Theorem 2.1 There exists a ∆0-degree which contains no divergence bounded
computable reals.
Proof. We will construct a computable sequence (As) of finite subsets of natural numbers which converges to A such that A is not Turing equivalent to any divergence bounded computable real. To this end, let (be, he, Φe, Ψe) be an effective enumeration of all tuples of computable functions be :⊆ N → D, he :⊆ N → N, and computable functionals Φe, Ψe. For any e, s ∈ N, if be(s) is defined, then let Be,s be a finite set of natural numbers such that be(s) = xBe,s . Thus, the set A has to satisfy all the following requirements.

R  :	be and he are total and (be(s)) con- =⇒ A /= ΦBe ∨ B

/= ΨA.

The sequence (As) is constructed in stages such that As is the approximation of A at the end of stage s and A = lims→∞ As. We define a length function l as follows:
l(e, s) := max{x : As T x = ΦBe,s T x & Be,s T ϕe,s(x) = ΨAs T ϕe,s(x)},
e,s	e,s
where ϕe is the use function of the functional Φe. Thus, to satisfy a require- ment Re, it suffices to guarantee that l(e, s) is bounded from above, if the premisses of Re hold.
Now let’s describe the strategy to satisfy a single requirement Re. We first choose a witness ne large enough. At the beginning, let A(ne − 1)(ne) = 00, i.e., both ne − 1 and ne are not in A. Then we wait for a stage s such that l(e, s) > ne.  If there does not exist such s at all, then l(e, s) ≤ ne for all s and we are done. Otherwise, suppose that s1 is the first stage such that

l(e, s ) > n . In this case, both computations ΦBe,s1 (n ) and ΦBe,s1 (n
— 1)

1	e	e,s1	e	e,s1	e
halt and hence ϕe,s1 (ne − 1) and ϕe,s1 (ne) are defined. Furthermore, the initial

segment ΨAs1
T ϕe,s1
(ne) is defined too. Let me
:= ψe,s1
(ϕe,s1
(ne)). Assume

w.l.o.g. that ne < me. If he,s1 (me) is also defined, then we put ne − 1 into
A (the number ne remains out of A) to destroy the agreement. That is, we define As1+1(ne − 1)(ne) = 10. Then we wait for a new stage s2 > s1 such that l(e, s2) > ne holds again. If no such a stage exists, then we are done again. Otherwise, we put ne into A, i.e., let As2+1(ne − 1)(ne) := 11. If there exists another stage s3 > s2 such that l(e, s3) > ne, then we take both ne − 1 and ne out of A, i.e., let As3+1(ne − 1)(ne) := 00. In this case, the set As3 +1 is recovered to that of stage s1, i.e., As3+1 = As1 . This closes a cycle in which the values A(ne − 1)(n2) change in the order of 00 → 10 → 11 → 00. This process will continue as long as the number of 2−me -jumps of the sequence (xBe,s ) (i.e., the sequence (be(s)) ) does not exceed he(me) yet.
Thus, we achieve a temporary disagreement between A and ΦBe by chang- ing the values A(ne −1)(ne) whenever the length of agreement goes beyond the witness ne. After that, if the agreement becomes bigger than ne again, then the corresponding value ΦBe (ne − 1)(ne) has to be changed too and this forces the
initial segment Be T ϕe(ne) to be changed, say, Be,s T ϕe,s(ne) /= Be,t T ϕe,t(ne).
There are two possibilities now.
Case 1. This corresponds to a 2−me -jump, i.e., |xBe,s − xBe,t | ≥ 2−me . If the sequence (be(s)) converges he-bounded effectively, then (be(s)) has at most he(me) non-overlapping 2−me -jumps. Thus, this can happen at most he(me) times
Case 2. The change of the initial segment Be T ϕe(ne) does not lead to a 2−me -jump. That is, |xBe,s − xBe,t | = 2−m < 2−me for a natural number m > me. In this case, there exists a (least) natural number n < me such that Be,s(n) /= Be,t(n) because Be,s T me /= Be,t T me (remember that me ≥ ϕe(ne)).


In this case, as binary word, Be,s has one of the following forms


form 1 := 0 . w 1 0 ··· 0 ··· 0 v
form 2 := 0 . w 0 1 ··· 1 ··· 1 v
↑	↑	↑
(positions :	n	me	m )


for some w, v ∈ {0, 1}∗ and Be,t takes another one. Here n, me and m indicate the corresponding positions. This implies that, if the sequence (xBe(s)) does not have 2−me -jumps after some stage s any more, then the initial segment Be,s T me can have only two possible forms: 0.w10 ··· 0 or 0.w01 ··· 1. Corre-
spondingly, the combination ΦBe,s (n − 1)(n ) can have at most two possibil-
e,s	e	e
ities too. However, in every circle described above, A(ne − 1)(ne) takes three different forms, i.e., 00, 10 and 11. In other words, we can always achieve a disagreement A /= ΦB at some stage and hence the requirement Re is satisfied
eventually.
To satisfy all requirements simultaneously, we apply a finite injury priority construction. In this case, Re has higher priority than Ri if e < i. To preserve the requirement Re from the disturbance by lower priority Ri, the initial seg- ment A T ψeϕe(ne) should be preserved. To this end, only the elements which
are larger than ψeϕe(ne) are allowed to be appointed as witnesses of Ri for
i > e afterward. me := ψe(ϕe(ne)) is called a restriction of Re. A requirement
Re being initialized means that ne and me (if any) are set to be undefined.
The following is a formal construction of the sequence (As). Stage 0: Let A0 := ∅ and all requirements Re are initialized.
Stage s + 1: A requirement Re requires attention if the following conditions
hold.
the witness ne,s is defined such that ne,s < l(e, s) holds (in this case the restriction me,s := ψe,s(ϕe,s(ne,s)) is defined too);
he,s(me,s) is defined and the sequence (be(t))t≤s does not make more than
he,s(me,s) non-overlapping 2−me,s -jumps so far.
If no requirement requires attention at this stage, then choose a least e such that ne is currently not defined and let ne,s+1 := s + 2 (remember the convention that ϕe,s(n) ≤ s for all n, e). Otherwise, suppose that Re is the re- quirement of highest priority (i.e., of the least index) which requires attention. Then we define

 01,	if As(ne − 1)(ne) = 00;
As+1(ne − 1)(ne) :=  11,    if As(ne − 1)(ne) = 01;
 00,	if As(ne − 1)(ne) = 11.
In addition, all requirements Ri of lower priority (i.e., i > e) are initialized. In this case, we say that Re receives attention.
This completes the construction.
To show that the constructed sequence (As) converges to a set A which satisfies all requirements Re, it suffices to prove the following claim.
Claim 2.2 For any e ∈ N, the requirement Re receives attention ﬁnitely many times and is eventually satisﬁed.
Proof of Claim: The claim can be proved by an induction on e. Assume that, for any i < e, the requirements Ri receive attention only finitely many times and are satisfied eventually. Let s0 be the first stage such that no requirement Ri for i < e requires and receives attention after stage s0 any more. By the minimality of s0, Re is initialized at stage s0. By construction, there is a stage s1 > s0 at which the witness ne,s1 is defined. This witness will not be changed any more, i.e., ne,s1 = ne,s for all s ≥ s1, because Re will never be initialized after stage s1 again. For convenience, let ne := ne,s1 .
If Re does not require attention after stage s1, then either the length l(e, s)
does not go beyond ne, or l(e, s) > ne for some s but either he(me) (for me := ψe,s(ϕe,s(ne))) is not defined or the sequence (be(s))s has already more 2−me -jumps than he(me). In any of these cases, Re is satisfied.
Otherwise, suppose that Re requires and receives attention after stage s1 at stages t0 + 1, t1 + 1, t2 + 1, ·· ·. Thus, both me := ψe,t0 (ϕe,t0 (ne)) and he(me) := he,t0 (me) are defined.  At stage t0 + 1, all requirements Ri for i > e are initialized. If a witness ni for Ri is appointed later, then we have ni > t0 + 1 > me. This implies that the initial segment As T me will not be changed after stage t0 + 1 except the elements ne − 1 and ne. Furthermore, since A(ne − 1)(ne) changes always in the order 00 → 10 → 11 → 00, we can prove by a simple induction on n that Ati T me = At3n+i T me for all n ∈ N and i = 0, 1, 2. This implies obviously that


ΨAti T ϕ
(n ) = ΨAt3n+i T ϕ
(n )

e,ti
e,ti	e
e,t3n+i
e,t3n+i	e

and, because of ne < l(e, t3n+i), hence
Be,ti T ϕe,ti (ne) = Be,t3n+i T ϕe,t3n+i (ne).

Thus, we have ϕe,t0 (ne) = ϕe,t3n (ne) and ψe,t0 (ϕe,t0 (ne)) = ψe,t3n (ϕe,t3n (ne)) for


all n. Since A(ne − 1)(ne) changes whenever Re receives attention, ΦBe (ne −
1)(ne) has to be changed before Re receives a new attention. That is, Be,tn T

me /= Be,tn+1
T me for all n. By construction, the case |xBe,tn
− xBe,t
|≥ 2−me

can happen at most he(me) times. If |xBe,tn
— xBe,t
| < 2−me , then we have

Be,tn T me = 0.w10 ··· 0 or Be,tn T me = 0.w01 ··· 1 for some binary word w.
That is, Be,tn T me switches between two different forms. On the other hand,
A(ne − 1)(ne) takes three different values consecutively. This means that after
some stage, an agreement between A and ΦBe of a length bigger than ne is
impossible and Re stops requiring further attention. Therefore, Re receives attention only finitely often and it is satisfied eventually.
